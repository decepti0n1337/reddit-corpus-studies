Holy/ret first 18 points ret then going holy but I will level whit a warrior. Then some holy spec adjusted to what buff/aura guild needs

---
---
For someone who has never played any WoW whatsoever, which class/professions/role would you suggest for Classic?
---
A guild leader doesn't necessarily have to be good at the game, but they have to be good with people. If you don't think about yourself that way you are not going to have an enjoyable time.
---
Plus, literally every piece of loot that ever drops is your loot! ;)
---
Well priests have dispell which is one of the best offensive abilities in all of vanilla.
---

---
Plus if you spam rank one shadow word pain, you can stun lock without any mana usage.
---
Guardian of Blizzard is an NPC that casts Touch of Death, which is the same spell several dev-only items back then used.
---
I have never found it ingame (certainly wasn't in Hyjal etc), but it wasn't a GM killing everyone manually, it means it was somehow spawned. Either through a bug or a GM somehow accidentally spawning it. Could be the npc was a leftover from PTR or an internal build and was accidentally pushed to the live realms (temp npcs and stuff from the PTR and internal builds have been pushed to live by accident before).
---
DO NOT HELP
---
sssss key

:]
---
Damn thats a good idea
---
For anyone going Shaman, set your hearthstone in Camp Taurjo for this. Speeds it up massively.
---
I'm very much looking forward to the updated graphic options. It occurred to me that there wasn't much crossover time between having the pre-sundering world and the availability of the newer graphics options, as I believe they were added in the Cataclysm pre-patch, and then when Cata hit, the old world was gone, to be replaced with all these ugly reimaginations :\
---
Going to be building a new rig just for this, so the plan is pretty much everything at ultra. Even though I don't think the water effect looks much like water, I love the reflections and how much nicer they make some of the beautiful views in vanilla, so that's staying. It's the shadows I'm unsure about; some zones they enhance, others less so. Elwynn Forest for example, seems to lack some of the 'warmth/golden' look when you use the updated shadows.
---
His guides are 100% private server based. So take it with a grain of salt. He undoubtedly has the best researched guides on YouTube. Just keep in mind why he was researching. To provide a guide for people that use private servers.
---
Wannabe fan \^\^
---
I replaced pretty much everything I had in Hellfire Peninsula, by the time I was level 63-64 in Zangarmarsh and Terrokar I kept running into alliance buddies (I was horde) who were still chilling in their naxx gear with comparable stats to me and they were disappointed in seeing me to say the least.
---
Good times until we had to make the move to Korgath.
---
Man, me too! But I'm 90% sure it had more pixels back then...
---
You say that but try pvping or doing content when the server has progressed to naxx and you only just got 60. You’ll wander into a BG with tier 0.5 and get one shot by anyone with AQ, Naxx or even ZG gear.
---
We should probably wait for Classic to actually launch. Private Servers probably didn't get Naxx (and most other Raids) right.
---
Charging up a pyroblast so the tank can stack 3 sunders by the time your cast goes off.
---
A lot of this is class dependant.
---
I lvled a rogue to 14. Took roughly an hour a lvl until 10.
---
I lvled a hunter. Lvl ten in less than half the time.
---
&gt; I do collect all quests for the good dungeons, but again, it’s up to you whether you feel like bothering or not.
---
Yeah I’ve heard those 2 quoted as good for bear before. I am interested to know if Druid is better than fury tanks (on pserver some people tanking naxx bosses in fury even dw sometimes for threat)
---
Are you saying you got to level 10 on a Hunter in half an hour?
---
I’m ready to take my time with this game but I’m going to try my best to log in on day one and reclaim a few of my old names.
---
&gt; or Don't
---
You’re saying you took 10 hours to get to lvl 10?
---
Got mixed feelings about BC. Yes it was extremely cool to cross the portal into a whole other crazy space themed world (a controversial theme, but I'm actually fond of it - minus the space goats). A lot of shaky or questionable game systems in Vanilla got polished and made a lot better.
---
And yet... and yet... it was also the beginning of streamlined quests, welfare epics, loot hallway dungeons, heroics, daily quests, gear currency, Horde pallies/Ally shamans, flying...
---
Of course LFG was the thing that really nuked the game, and that only came in ToC in Wrath. Still, a lot of those seeds of destruction were already there in BC.
---
This is why you no life the first 3-4 days and get ahead of the pack, everyone doing that is just going to want to get through STV so you it'll be fairly pleasant until the writhing masses get there.

I played all my WoW "career" with the music off - as I usually do in games - but I think I'll at least try to leave it on for Classic.
---
I can only talk from a Horde Warrior perspective. 
---
In my experience Undead was the fastest zone. I went from 1-12 in 2 hours and 50~ minutes. 
---
Orc took me roughly half an hour more. 
---
Tauren was the slowest for me, but that could very well be due to my lack knowledge of the zone. 
---
It really depends on your Class too, how you choose to play. For some Classes it can be quicker to mob grind rather than quest, which also depends on the zone itself and how easy the mobs are there to grind.
---
How exactly does a tabard or a pet increase your chances of winning anything?
---
I had thought about that before, but this way the rogue will get windfury and the druid can follow the hunter as balance. Other than stealth (which isn't used that much during leveling), rogue and druid don't share anything, and hunter Shaman doesn't share anything.
---
Lot of dying, slow dps until I got dual wielding, some green gear with stats on it. Ran RFC at 13. For a sword and dagger that were +3dps each.
---
yes
---
How much time is added to a clear by bringing a ret?
---
Can you pm us the name please?

There is a podcast which had the lead developers on and they explained that was actually going to part of the warrior class.
---
Just three of vanilla
---
I have seen shit like this. Upvotes
---
Wow thats great, didnt know it could be done. Will def. try this out when lvling in classic
---
It’s not empty, they’re just all on another shard.
---
Hehe, heh, now I’m sad.
---
Wow. Not to judge or be a hater, but JFC youve been missing out so fucking much
---
You're right. It will be easier than on private servers.
---
Nice! I knew I missed one haha.. had a strong gut feeling. I'm not a big fan of trolls so it was one of my favorite raids. It was still amazing and I'll never forget the leather helmet from Zul Jinn.. I could never get T4 or T5 so that helmet was so clutch. Also got the bear mount which was dope.. great raid for sure.
---
Don't is the correct and only answer here, I'm sorry. 
---
Vanilla leveling is a grind, it's tedious, sometimes down-right mean. But I wouldn't change anything. 
---
I play Warrior, and the class is well-known for its slow and unforgiving leveling, and while I can see that increasing our spirit would decrease our down time, I still don't want it. 
---
There's ways to improve your leveling experience with every class, you can optimise it. 
---
There shouldn't be any changes, while these are minor it's a slippery slope, and could quickly lead to more and more changes. 
---
Just my two cents.
---
If we don’t have this, it won’t be worth playing.
---
Having this mount since vanilla is sort of a curse. Because I have it I have little to no interest in farming any other mount, ever.
---
Gotta boost that Arcane Shot, bruh.
---
Oh right that's huge
---
As people mentioned, theres definitely a lot of variables.  But in general I think Elwynn Forest and Tirisfal Glades are the winners, at least in my experience.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxmZxGzZxfctdcVo
---
Very good, I couldn't remember if they had adjusted the rates or not in the past. I'm fine with either solution to be honest. For me this is a minor adjustment that would reduce a lot of pain and something that is not going to affect my classic experience.
---
Fishing is pretty nice once you get it up, but getting it started is a MASSIVE grind, that can take about an hour solid of fishing just to get to the point where you no longer fail while fishing with a lure in the lowest level ponds.
---
However once you hit that point, leveling it becomes pretty smooth (you don't get any chance for skill up on failed catches, so early on you end up with A LOT of empty attempts due to your catch failing). However once you always catch, skilling happens pretty fast until about 150, and isn't that bad even after, just any time you're waiting on something and there's a pond nearby, drop a line and fish for bit. (it's entirely possible to skill to 300 just from STV, though it will go a bit faster if you keep gradually moving forward as soon as you can fish without failing in the next level of zone).
---
Especially for ally, making a pilgrimage to desolace to farm a Big iron fishing pole can be useful as it's the only really good fishing pole they can get short of winning the tournament. Horde can get a slightly better one from a late game quest so it's not as big of a deal.
---
And since not people work on it, early on, you can end up having all of the high level debris pools to yourself for months.
---
Especially nice as a tailor as debris pool chests can provide cloth bolts and leather (also bags, greens/blues, straight money, etc), and do so relatively commonly, which saves you a bit of time and makes it so you don't need to worry about having a skinner. (it's not enough to supply a LWer but is enough for most other professions who typically only need a couple pieces of leather every now and then for specific patterns).
---
As nearly all the best raid is fish, fishing is also helpful for ensuring you have a reliable supply of buff foods without having to buy or badger people for it.
---
Cooking of course is always good to have, and if you've got time to kill, you can sometimes squeeze out a bit of extra gold via cooking stuff and then vendoring it for 2-3 times sum of it's parts. Doesn't always work, not all recipes are created equal, but some end up quite profitable. And as with fishing, being able to supply your own buff food is always a plus.
---
Probably. I doubt Blizzard would let a server stagnate at sub 1.5k... on the other hand, if a server is at 2k, they can’t really merge it because 2x 2k is exceeding Vanilla populations already. 
---
Blizzard probably has all sorts of contingency plans, since money is on the line. But I also highly doubt many realms will be ghost towns if any, depending on how they’re utilizing sharding at launch.
---
No, Private Servers often times have way too low Armor Values compared to Vanilla. It will be easy anways unless they make the Raids harder. People are Min-Maxing stuff already, when Classic and especially Nax is still a long time away. 
---
And compared to Private Servers Guilds have way more good Members they can recruit.
---
I'd wear the hell out of robes in real life if they weren't considered feminine.
---
Robes are awesome.
---
You can buy game time with retail gold, and since the two games share the same subscription you'll be able to pay for Classic with gold from retail. 
---
You will however not be able to buy tokens for money and sell them for gold in Classic, nor use your gold in classic to buy tokens.
---
The guy sounds like a massive tool
---
Big yikes.
---
&gt;You will however not be able to buy tokens for money and sell them for gold in Classic, nor use your gold in classic to buy tokens.
---
This was my belief to but it is in fact allowed. All games on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) is the same Game Platform and it is in fact allowed to trade items and gold on the Game Platform.
---
this is a shit ton of work and a ton of risk for not only almost no benefit, but also detrimental to your dps in various ways
---
Fistweaver Monk was a magical thing, I logged back for WoD or Legion to find they'd destroyed it.
---
Rogue, except instead of nails its a mountain of salt.
---
I mean, then it isn't a fingerprint, because this bug isn't proof that you're playing Classic WoW. :p
---
You do need to make sure your 1h weapon skills are kept up. it's really easy to forget that, get into a group and miss constantly.
---
Well it is allowed, there won't be a cash-shop in Classic where you can buy the tokens from. 
---
So it won't be a possibility.
---
Well that's a great theory, but back here in reality Blizzard is not going to feel beholden to their own EULA to define the features they put into a new game.
---
There will always be people that min max, always was always will be.
---
Im interested in leveling a druid (and a hunter to a lesser degree) in classic wow and was wondering which two gathering professions are the best while leveling. I know skinning is considered the best, but is it better to take herbalism or mining?
---
I still use my hotmail address. Set it up exactly in 2000. Luckily I was a smart kid and just used my first and last name
---
I am **not** rolling a boomkin named Iceblaster again... Icecube was taken, and I thought Iceblaster sounded cool. The amount of people whispering me to fill dungeon slots, only to go "wtf, you're a druid? We need a mage for this!" Sad times. So now I'm rolling a mage!
---
So you can trade lets say 300gold on retail for 300,000gold on retail and then use that gold to buy a token that pays for your subscription. This is in fact allowed.
---
So if you farm a lot of gold in Classic and trade you can play for free. This is what I have just realized. And it's not against the rules.
---
I would say pick the first in alphabetical order.
---
I remember back then the biggest guild (Millenium, for french realms) announced they would do that and it ended up being the most populated server, which is usually what you want. I think a lot of people would do the same, pick the first thing that shows up
---
How is changing stats on melee classes a vanilla like change?
---
I did this with my main. We were called Druid Raid Officers. Im sure there's some YouTube videos. We even had a second guild because there was a surplus of druids.
---
Start tanking lava runs at 55!
---
Good thing you don’t have one.
---
Jokes on you: my vanilla name for my paladin became my online name.
---
Those names are reserved for male NE rogues
---
Wow thats insane. What type of war is best?
---
What do you mean?
---
Are we talking about launch day here? Then obviously Tauren or NE simply because they are the least played races and doesn't share starting areas like troll/orcs and gnomes/dwarves do.
---
If we're talking about empty zones then every area is probably around the same. I saw a troll hunter push 1-10 in just 1 hour and 20 minutes which I thought was crazy fast, but then I saw a gnome mage do the same in 1 hour and 30 minutes. So I think 1-10 is pretty balanced time-wise as long as you don't have to compete with others.
---
Dark Souls 1-3

&gt; mail address. Set it up exactly in 2000. Luckily I was a smart kid and just used my first and last name

hey as long as your first name isn't legolas it's probably all good!
---
Better trio = WoW classic alpha + beta + Classic
---
I see - I understand where you're coming from now. 
---
This could be a minor issue, but I don't think it will be one and if it does become a problem I have no doubt the Classic team will deal with it.
---

For classic, you should focus on what class you *want* to play. People will have recommendations for you about what is "easiest" for a new player. But ultimately it doesn't matter. Every class can be played successfully by a new player. Some might take a little getting used to if they have involved mechanics. First step is to read the [class summaries](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Class) and see what interests you.
---
What class fantasy appeals to you? After that, think about what role you want to take. If you want to group with people (which I highly suggest as WoW is a social game), then do you want to tank (be the focus of enemies to protect your groupmates), heal (keep everyone alive), deal damage (kill stuff), or be mostly support (use abilities to contain enemies or buff alllies). Do you want to do any PvP (player vs. player)? Again, I would suggest you try some of that. 
---
Answer those questions first.
---
Yeah; the expansion itself was kind of Meh; but stepping through the dark portal into that new skybox? Amazing. Opening up the Caverns of Time and Kharazhan? Fantastic.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I admit I'm hoping they'll take a cue from Runescape and make Classic+ rather than TBC Classic.
---
My main in Vanilla was Paladin. 
---
Ret is pretty meh in PVP even with halfway decent gear (had the rank 10 blues + Unstoppable Force). You're still a support. Better off specing Holy-Prot for PVP and knowing you're never doing any decent damage except for small bursts on occassion under the best of conditions. In PVP the only exciting thing is giving a Warrior Freedom and keeping them up while they kill people. I don't mind doing that but it gets a bit old. I'll be rolling something more active this time around.
---
In PvE you literally spam one healing spell + Cleanse. Per Blizz devs, Paladin was designed to be the easiest class to play, and it shows. The skill cap is nothing. They are truly EZ mode. If you are looking for little challenge, this is your class.

---
I feel the same way about warriors, and I think its just that they actually feel powerful more often, they can go hard dps in pvp and pve, and their damaging abilities are consistent, reliable and snappy. 
---
Paladins on the other hand have alot less going on in both the endgame tanking, dps and pvp "break people" end of things. They feel; relative to warriors, a little disconnected in their effort-to-outcome area.
---
It's a shame Crusader Strike never made it in, probably would have been a fine ability if it were similar to judgments with an effect based on present seal.
---
put away ur nostalgia glasses already you stupid ppl. these exps are trash compared to bfa, but 1 day u will realise that im 30 years ahead than u lol.
---
If I recall correctly Battleshout tends to be better for tanking 5 mans.
---
The amount of threat generated by Battleshout when it buffs 5 players is just shy of the threat generated by a single sunder. But applies to all enemies. So say sunder generates 300 threat, Battleshout generates 250 threat on 5 players, or 50 threat * num players for smaller groups.
---
The amount of threat generated by demoralising shout was slightly lower than battleshout, but you could apply it to as many targets as you were in combat with. So it might only 200 total threat if it applied to 5 enemies, 40 * 5 targets, which is worse than battleshout. But if you're fighting 7 targets it would generate 40 * 7, 280 threat per cast. Tipping demoshout to be the better choice on bigger pulls.
---
Back to my original point, this tends to make battleshout more useful in dungeons. Since most pulls are designed around fighting 3-4 enemies at a time. And unless you're playing with a group to farm gold, chances are pulling 2 or more packs to make demo shout more viable is going to be risky.
---
I am both horrified and, intrigued. One one hand, I think it can be terrible, on the other hand, I see a business opportunity where trustworthy people with a lot of good references like myself (hopefully) could act like a middle hand in these transactions and take a 5% cut ;)
---
Phew! Still using my original character name.
---
Tauren is probably the slowest. It's fairly large and spread out, and while it does form loops, they're large loops that take much longer to turn in.
---
undead is fairly efficient if you do the quests in the right order to largely eliminate backtracking, and if you do backtrack you at least have quite a few quests to work on each loop.
---
Human is pretty similar but it also has a few drop only quests which are needed to have maximum efficiency. (undead has 1, but you tend to grind a bunch at Agamond Mills for other quests so you'll probably get it. The Elywnn drop quests can be pretty annoying..or you can get them first kill. The rare gnoll always drops the gold collection schedule and that level 11 rare Defias that can be at random camps always drops the fulbrow deed, though you can get them at a low chance from any gnoll/defias respectively).
---
Dwarf and Orc are about the same Small loops but each have one kind of awkward quest that is a little out of the way due to it's awkward placing in the leveling path. You can make it work but it's not really a smooth loop.
---
Duskwood was my favorite zone.  My favorite quests, too, until stupid Cata ruined *everything*.
---
vanilla faggs hahhaha u guys will be pn knees to play bfa like real apha guy like me hahaaha gl at vanilla
---
Really? I felt as if the progression was pretty good in BC but then again i was above average in gear, i didn't replace my AQ/BWL gear till mid 60ies and kept my couple bits of T3 till 70 with the odd change here and there i felt as if the flow was decent. Wrath that...that was a whole other ball park i had full T6 ( Sunwell and BT ) and i kept all that shit till Naxx. I remember our first run half the raid was still in odd bits and pieces of T6 and Sunwell random items hell the Bow from Twins was still great until you got the bow from 25 man naxx.
---
Thats like saying if u got a job u cant be happy. Absolutely true.
---
bfa 100x better than vanilla but u guys will realize it eventually lol hahahaha
---
the shittiest game ever but its ok lol
---
Its how I learned guitar as a 14 year old. Leveled up a paladin.
---
You're entirely correct thanks for pointing that out. Hopefully we will learn how blizzard standards on this later. I can't say it's an issue for me personally if it's only one way. 
---
However if people are just buying wow tokens with real money and then getting gold on classic for the trade that's a pretty big deal.
---
Side note: I know everyone feels strongly about this but don't downvote / attack OP for starting a discussion.
---
Since classic WoW subscription is tied in to retail I doubt many will do it. Given how easy farming gold is in BFA compared to classic it’d be far more efficient to just hop on retail, farm gold, buy your token and then enjoy the free classic.
---
I could see how you could make a 'business' out of it. But I don't see a lot of people wanting to spend 300g or most likely more for retail gold, even if it's to buy a token. 
---
Also, I'm 97% sure we're in the same Guild. Does Dipsy ring a bell?
---
Herbalism by far, as a Druid you can gather herbs while in cat or bear form which is a nice bonus. A lot of the zones you level in won't have many or any mining nodes.
---
Last sentence made u a douche idk why
---
put away ur nostalgic glasses and accept the fact that vanilla is trash compared to bfa :)
---
There's some debate about whether fury tanking can be used in retail classic in the same way it's currently used on private servers. "Better" however will depend on the encounter, and play skill. Theres some advantages and disadvantages to both. I would suggest reading here.
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/

I'm making plans for my alt (main has been locked down since I started vanilla in 2005) and I'm looking at professions. If I went tailoring on a SM-Ruin warlock and made Robe of the Void, when would I replace it?
---
Cosmetic microtransactions in Classic? 
---
I'm already sharpening my hypothetical pitchfork.
---
To get 50% more survivability from playing prot is something you won't see unless you're wearing tier 1/2. And your dps while wearing that gear and specced prot is going to be tragic. I was maintank during TBC and still have flashbacks about how low dps was back then.
---
The only fun thing about being prot outside of dungeons and raids was duelling rogues and the fights taking several minutes.
---
ye i agree but this shield has bad stats and cant wear bcs there was no transmog in vanilla xD bfa 100y better
---
[removed]
---
Agreed. I got to Shaman where they said even resto ain't great and then laughed and moved on.
---
I just stopped playing PoE after it happened and the gpu has been fine since. I'm not sure why you seem to think it's impossible.  I launched PoE and probably 15 some odd minutes later all you hear is RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR as the fans cranked up to max. I just did some googling and it seems like a lot of people have/had this issue with PoE specifically.

I mean wouldn’t you have to be on the same server for both games, or no?

It's Reddit - when people disagree with something, even if it offers a good discussion they tend to down vote.

I'm not saying that's a good thing.

If selling gold in Classic for gold on Retail in order to buy a subscription does become an issue, I'm sure we'll see Blizzard deal with it, in one way or another.

What is this troll vid, Hunters doing Nightfall, people using "Lion Horn of Stormwind"????
---
Doomguard is useless in raids, like ihasaccount said; you lose more than you can potentially gain in any case.
---
And really, you're gonna make the raid wait a full minute for doom to tick on your digrat?
---
Why does this read like a fucking manifesto, like a god damn super villain monologue......
---
You obviously have not been following this community if you haven’t seen these issues resolved in the last few months.
---
Just make sure the druid and rogue are on different accounts.
---
There are certain dungeons you can farm with 2 stealths like that at level 60.
---
&gt;The population will be 20% of that of the big private servers
---
Have you seen the future sir ?
---
Hunter: 
---
* Raid spots are scarce. 
---
* Your DPS is dogshit starting around AQ40. 
---
* Ammo eats up a TON of bag space.
---
* Deadzone is super frustrating at times.
---
* The class has a lot of QoL issues and "clunkiness" that didn't get fixed until TBC, like auto-shot not starting on right-click.
---
Summonmaster... how many times people joked as I was summoning people for whatever the occasion was.
---
In the MMORPG genre: nothing.
---
But Witcher 1, 2, and 3 is a close second trilogy for me.
---
Can’t even compare. Two different games.
---
I've been using Evoseven for nearly everything since vanilla wow and I'm desperate to come up with something new. 
---
Over years of voice chat, I learned that, apparently, Evoseven is hard to say concisely.
---
I've tried a few different names now, but still keep "Ev7" as a little historical tag after names on places that let me do so.
---
as a vending machine we have cooler stuff but are more likely to break down
---
I actually think Hunter has one of the more complex PvE rotations, because of the nuances of auto clipping.
---
It's not *hard*, but compared to most other vanilla classes it requires way more attention.
---
You're right in that I hadn't been following closely enough to know there even were these issues as holdovers from Blizzcon. 
---
So, I'm late to the party. But resolved? How so? They are still implementing them last I checked. So, they aren't resolved, Blizz is just doing it, as they always do. And it seems the only reason it's not being as big a deal as it was before is the people who cared simply split, and those who are left have are just going with it.
---
I checked the thread. It was dead set against sharding. This was IN RESPONSE to the blue post being linked. Did something else happen after that I am not aware of? If not, it seems this is another "our way or the highway" situation, with many taking the highway since they aren't yet invested. I'll probably do the same.
---
I didn’t know this, I’ll look it up. But what to replace it with?

If you check my profile on Discord you can be 100% sure ;)

And this is why I want to roll a rogue - I'm going to use stealth to the utmost advantage looool
---

I can assure you Classic will be *far* more neckbeardy when it comes to min/maxing. Both the retail and Pserver communities are significantly more hardcore and picky these days than they were in 2004-2007.
---
This might be the most blasphemous thing I've ever read
---
Back when I was playing an instant 60 private server I tried out a few alternative builds in PvP. I thought I was a genius for it but as you can imagine it went horribly.
---
This was my first build; https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/Bc_RzHoEAz0cwAA 
---
As you can see the goal here was dual wield, mace spec and sword spec for that ultimate stun and burst damage combo.
---
The next build I tried was the stun build; https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BM_B_DABEAQ8w8AQ
---
Goal here was of course to get as many stuns as possible because for some stupid reason I thought the extra CC would be more valuable than MS
---
Fingers crossed BC and WOTLK get relaunched. I loved BC and never got to get WOTLK. I would totally transfer my classic hero from server to server to get to run through BC and WOTLK.
---
;) We are everywhere.
---
That’s unfortunate.  LK was one of the most challenging and enjoyable fights to progress through, right there with Yogg and Algalon.
---
Sindragosa on the other hand, was a shitshow of a fight.
---
Easy. At 60 go tailoring and engineering. Best for warlock hands down. You could grind mining as you level or wait for your mount and do it. Tailoring is just farming humanoids. Level them once you hit 60
---
Well I've played warlocks off and on, only trued a mage a couple of times. I've always known locks to be much worse at escaping and moving around. But with a pet, I leveled pretty easily. In classic some of your bag space will be used up by those soul shards. Nothing you can do about it, just plan accordingly and manage inventory. Sell stuff every time you get a chance.
---
They are implementing them because they SHOULD be implemented.
---
Worst case scenario is you get to 60, there’s not enough people to support raiding and you have to pay for a server transfer.
---
Can’t be done
---
Minimizing weaknesses, maximizing strengths.

It was available until the end of wotlk.

I got it on my lvl60 Shaman Twink as I was boosting myself through ZG. People were jelly.

This is great.

Wait can you expand?
---

Love it! Did you make this OP?
---
Private servers buff hp/armor values to make bosses harder to kill. If it was all the same values as vanilla, raids would be cleared even faster
---
The only useful potion is shadow protection or fire  protection. You could be that guy that provides those. Alchemy is only good if you have the flask recipie and can corner the market
---
Stick to the plan chums
---
I'm not sure having a 10% chance once every gcd to stun the target for 3 seconds is the same thing as being able to stun lock.  
---
It takes 7 casts before you have a 50% or higher chance of landing one stun, so you're looking at 10.5 seconds of casting to have about a 50/50 shot of a 3 second stun.
---
I’m in much the same boat as you. I resubbed for BFA got a auto level up and played maybe 16 levels before giving up. It wasn’t for me. 
---
Since then I’ve been messing about on PS, one char to 32 a few in thier 20’s and been having a blast.
---
Just because you had a bad time doesn't mean we all will. My wife and I cant wait to play Classic.
---
You can realistically run that piece until AQ40/Naxx, it is amazing for a craftable item in Classic where not a lot craftable items exist. ZG robes with 2PC could be an upgrade, 3PC T2 could be an upgrade for you but those are way way (way) down the road for an alt.
---
Swap out Rogue with Warlock, and Hunter with Shadow Priest. Only have Druid tank instead of Warrior.
---
I can't believe your group PvE dream is actually including a hunter.
---
I didn't know it was you. I thought it was just some video you remembered from back then. We were all pretty terrible at the game back then.
---
Yes. I saw that.
---
But dungeon quests are not all flagged as dungeon quests, or dungeon followup quests.
---
So I may follow his guide, and not know that I spent 45 minutes going from Feralas to Swamp of Sorrows to pick up 3 quests before finding out that those are Sunken Temple quests that I won't be doing. I could have grinded out half a level instead... and then not have to waste another 30 minutes / quarter level grind getting back to where I started to continue questing.
---
Yeah the story wasn't my thing either but I know many like the story so I work critique that. I only critique the game aspect, as I thought the mission variety could've been so much more in the ones I did play. It's one series I truly can't understand how it got so popular. 
---
One game that I thought took assassin's Creed gameplay and made it better was the Lord of the rings game. Eventually i got bored of the gameplay loop and never finished that one either but man I actually had a ton of fun before I put the game down. I loved the mechanics in that game and wished it expanded more on the orc captain capturing. That was the only missing piece in that one for me.

Gonna go 1-60 leveling with Frost.

At 60 I'm going switch between Frost and Fire depending on what's best for specific raids, but I'm also going to have a lot of fun PVPing with Pom-pyro. Gonna insta-pyroblast people's faces off.

i probably got screenshots sitting on my old computer stuffed in the basement but im afraid if i plug it in to get the files then the 15 year old super viruses will tag along

The biggest problem with the 10/25 spread was that it led to so much raiding, I think the “by encounter” toggle was a welcome change for ICC.
---
When ToC came out we were spending one night in each 10/25 of ToC and Ulduar.  Plus “optional” achievement runs in  t7.  Thankfully by ICC, our guild rarely went back to TOGC and could focus on one raid and cut our time in half.
---
I loved the WotLK content, my fav era for content, but it was truly exhausting.
---
Aside: ToC might have been the strangest content release in the history of WoW.  WTF was the rational behind that steaming pile?
---
Why the hate, man?
---
Pulled for ya. You boys take it from here
---
How is that hate?
---
LOL. Shamans with Purge, 6 second cooldown Earth Shock, Grounding Totem, Fire Totem, Nature's swiftness, etc will wreck a mage.
---
Shamans are hard counters to Mages
---
Will it be possible to get rank 13/14 before BG release, or is there some set amount of honor required to even progress that is just unobtainable without bgs?
---
I'd like to see a Boss cast  random debufs on all raiders temporarily disabling their abilities except for auto-attack while at the same time summoning waves of minions.    Now their auto-attack would be modified to do something new.  One effect would be your auto attack would only work against allies, and it would heal them equal to your weapon damage.  Other players would now be able to harm the boss as a normal attack.  Another would cause great aggro and add lots of armor.   The last would allow your auto attacks to stun lock minions.   For a brief moment all players would be given a new role, one set by random.  Tank, DPS, heal, and cc.
---
While killing a named mob, just look around you with your camera, there might be another player inc that also needs him, accept his invite and start building dat server reputation.
---
Make a bankalt to send your stuff to quickly, like wool/silk cloth etc, it keeps your bags clear while not needing to go to your bank all the time. 
---
 
---
Really take the time to do every instance while leveling, even travel to SFK as alliance, it's really worth it and fun to do every instance at least once and it avoids you having to grind mobs at any point during the journey to 60.
---
But yeah most of all communicate, talk to people, help them, group with them and buff them when they walk past :)
---
It's up, I'm not on fire anymore. I'm fine
---
But I've played 4 years on vanilla servers with shitty water. I'm looking forward to this new water. I could also understand all BFA players wanting to try out the vanilla graphics since they are probably tired of seeing their own
---
How much time do you think a token would be worth? What I mean is, how much time does it take to earn enough gold on retail to buy a token for a "normal" player?
---
Fastest 1-10 times right now on Barrens Chat speedrun forum have been Gnome Mage in Dun Morogh at 1:25 or so... but recently ousted by a Tauren Shaman at 1:15 or so?
---
But both are fairly immaterial unless you plan on playing mage or shaman, as other classes are slower in those zones.
---
I've done human paladin in 1:45 or so. I'd think anyone's hypothetically capable of sub 2 hours in an ideal situation.
---
Okay, thanks. I'm going tailoring on my main (Holy Priest) for the Truefaith Vestment which stay relevant until around the same point. I heard that the Robe of the Void is replaced sooner than Truefaith, but I couldn't remember where. If I do end up leveling a warlock as an alt, then I'll almost certainly never raid on him. Makes tailoring worthwhile at least until I get Robe of the Void.
---
Vanilla, TBC and another box of TBC.
---
Doesnt take up a debuff slot, it's lowest priority so it will be pushed off by anything
---
Dota 2..sigh

I game on my laptop at my job. I typically work 3-11 as the front desk person at a hotel. Obviously guests need help/check in, and phones need to be answered but, overall I have a lot of free time for the last half of my shift

You can't use /tar grounding totem?
---
.... the term “Platform” refers collectively, and at times individually, to ... each of the Games
---
EACH game.
---
Classic is a different platform than Retail.
---
TBC was boring as a Mage :&lt;
---
Wow you really showed us thank you for opening my eyes that were glued shut with classic glue :^ )
---
Hunter can grind gold and go rank 14 in pvp easily without needing any raid gear. Just requires time. You should definitely do some dungeons though.
---
Ya because Dark Souls 2 is so loved by the fans :D
---
How soon probably depends on how much hit you need and to a certain extent crit.
---
haha this made me laugh very loud
---
Shatter is still handy, like amazingly handy for solo farming though. Unless you like respecced just to farm.
---
Thanks, I hadn't cried while thinking about life just yet today.

---
Please stop spreading baseless rumours.
---
PvE wise for me a lock (maining a lock with always having an alt mage for altruns/pugs), it's always been much more chill to raid with tbh. 
---
Seeing you played a mage you know the following things but I just list them so you realise you don't have to worry about anymore:
---
No Arcane Intellect buffing which is problematic in fast guilds, no worrying about mana with gems/innervate timings, just lifetap away.
---
No losing bufftime precrafting 200-600 water or needing bagslots  for crafting and trading water. Just have your soulshard bag full from last raid (at the end of every raid farm some shards on the final trash, or in an offday ZG/Aq20/5man), soulshards 99% don't require any sort of pre-raid work at all.
---
Pure dps competition inside your class , when mages go fire AQ40 I totally disliked the ignite lotery (and corresponding threat problems)  competition wise. Warlock is mostly fair game, it only gets 'unfair' when you have 4 locks in the raid and 1 doesn't have to curse on pull, but even that is a small deal.
---
No annoyingly having to sheep any mindcontrolled players (be it on nef,  AQ40 mindslayer trash, skeram etc etc). Just cast away.
---
Threatwise no problem, as you have to curse (which isn't as bad) every trashmob and bosses on every pull, it takes a GCD to start casting, which means ezlife on threat on most cases if your warrior tank is set up properly (meaning no full tank gear).
---
Warlock is much more a pure caster in PvE than a mage imo, and has really enjoyable to me. That's not to say I didn't enjoy my mage, it just has a bit more annoying stuff to deal with to me, keeping up manawise with the raid (MC can be a sub 35min run chainpulling trash) is the most obvious point which hurts the mage.
---
You mean the exact kind of weapon 99% of warriors will be using?
---
Did you get your Tabard of the Protector or w/e it was called? The one that made you /flex when you clicked on it?
---
My plan is to include all realms from all regions.  Hopefully all the first to 60s will be aware of what they need to do in order for them to go into the hall of fame of first to 60 on my site.  Once again that info is described here  [https://www.joanasworld.com/fastest.htm](https://www.joanasworld.com/fastest.htm)
---
Right. But if I'm mostly just running dungeons, PvPing, and maybe hitting MC/Ony, I'll get good use out of Robe of the Void.
---
Sounds a lot like the [Prophet Tharon'ja](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Tharon%27ja) from Drak'tharon Keep. I like it!

---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AiMMAs_QBM_ADww
---
Thanks, I hadn't sobbed into my monitor over Classic WoW yet today.
---
agreed but its not really fair to include engineering
---
engineering tips the battle in whoevers favour has it
---
if rogue gets jump on hunter they \*should\* win if no one interferes. However its typically not that clear cut. Both are the only classes I took to 60 in vanilla so I know both well. As a hunter I \*never\* lost to a single rogue even when they got the jump on me. Every time I was able to stun, wing clip, feign, trap, back off, win. 
---
Pet does so much DPS so rogue is fighting vs a clock, stacking mail immediately at 40 makes life hard for a rogue too. Realistically I should have lost often but very few rogues are the top 5-10% that know how to use their full toolkit and actually have it all on CD. 
---
It's crazy how bad the average rogue you see is
---
Darkfall series by far
---
much of what was featured here is used by top guilds. I am simply revealing what goes on behind the scene. Naturally, you can stick to the basic aspects of the game.
---
Anything that could be changed with console commands is cool, like foliage density. The new water is disgusting though.
---
Battelfield 1942, BF Vietnam, BF2, maybe shift over to BF2142. All down hill from there though BC2 was pretty good but not the same, nor compared to the originals anymore.
---
Original warlock was named Soulstealer. 13 year old me used to feel so proud that I got that name. Eventually Soulstealer Jenkins became a thing, but I will not be going that route this time
---
So I just had a long discussion on the EU forum and you are the first to have this interpretation...
---
Is your claim that " the term “Platform” refers collectively, and at times individually, to ... each of the Games " means that every Game on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) is it's own Game Platform?
---
How do we determining if your claim is right?
---
That's the case with rogues too.  I was always jumped by rogues as a hunter and I won nearly every time, and they shouldnt lose if they get the jump on a hunter.
---
Your experience with warrs, I had similar with hunter. I was able to take anyone and everyone. I never found someone who could take me during the leveling experience. It got to the point where I'd approach people and type /challenge because I needed a fair fight, I craved a fair fight. Sounds like I would've appreciated scrapping with you if I had come across you in vanilla! 
---
If I had to bet, with neither class having engineering, hunter wins when they engage and can just laugh and keep warr at 30+ yards. When warrior gets engage though, and both played perfect, I actually don't know who wins.
---
Can't recall if it was Hopeless or Heathens.
---
Knowing a list of servernames and some communities already anouncing which server they'll play on can only be a good thing for many others.
---
I personally want to avoid the private server community as much as possible, hoping they'll cluster together. Yes I'm part of it and raid in one of the top if not the best guild, but I want to chill things down on classic and mostly just want a 'new' community to explore and guilds/people to meet, not wanting to end up with again mostly the same players, with the same pug/farm/gank/worldboss dynamics. I need something fresh.
---
Also as a EU player who at one point in retail ended up, with his whole guild, on a 90% Turkish realm somehow and had to transfer away, it'd be nice to not mistakenly roll on a Turk/Czech server etc.
---
If it lasts long enough, it will be possible. You just need to be in the top bracket. There probably won't be enough time, though.
---
Also most groups are going to expect you to know every dungeon inside and out. Take a route that isn't the fastest and people start whining. Same with pulling a group wrong. They may not leave the group, but they will complain.
---
Hey man, no Judgement here!
---
Nothing in arms or fury is going to make you do 'much more damage' until level 40+. Your crit chance is going to suck so impale won't matter much, you're not going to be using overpower much, enrage ..ok but you're not going to be crit that much. If he wants to tank a lot, imp revenge is great, imp shield block is great, last stand is great, defiance is great, concussion blow is even ok.
---
what if I am still using that ingame name now?
---
Thanks man, I'm so fucking excited to play it.
---
Gathering professions generally slow you down quite a bit while leveling, other than skinning, which is an excellent choice. Stick to skinning, then when you hit 60 and have a mount, you can pick up some other gathering profession and quickly skill it up to max.
---
Idk, i felt like Alphawolf was trying too hard.
---
I do think "Admorphio" for a druid was pretty solid, original at least.
---
Pick some you find interest and play them for some levels. If you happen to find a class you enjoy right away, then stick to it.
---
Diablo II LOD, Warcraft III TFT, Vanilla
---
Still a really good trio OP
---
Should people use primary professions that are the most useful to their specific class?
---
what is auto clipping, how did that work? I played hunter in vanilla never know of this
---
If you plan to be a guild leader who raids, you'll probably need to invest a little more time than a casual even if you are raiding on a casual basis. Your guild will need you to be there. It's not a great idea if you're a casual player unless you have someone else to lead raids for you as a secondary guild leader.

Lmao I still make fun of my friend who named his character Xbloodhunter.
---
It won't be impossible, but it will be close to it. Part of the problem with world pvp only is that concentrated areas tend to be like AV - you get the same kills over and over again until they are worth 0 honour. You not only need to be pvping constantly but also having a constant stream of new people to kill for months. 
---
Can it happen? Yes. Will it? Extremely unlikely.
---
Back in vanilla there was 3 female gnome rogues, In a guild called powerpuff girls.
---
They used to just destroy a cloth in av then  vanish and repeat
---
Would something like enchanting be more useful to a spell casting class, and mining to a warrior, ect?
---
For the most part, yes. But if you know a good questing route, it's faster to combine both. If you don't know which quests are worth doing, grinding will always be much faster at that point of the game.
---
\&gt; A second monitor should be a listed system requirement for leveling a paladin 
---
Lol
---
You can
---
Depends on your gear really, don't tank ubrs with crap gear in arms or it's going to be slow and painful.
---
And the circle jerk continues
---
That was mostly because the dungeon and raid difficulty was such a joke at 80 though honestly. If it demanded better gear like TBC, we would have been replacing it all with blues.
---
Like Desolace but with a lisp?
---
Story time. Back in Vanilla, I was a warlock and must've been raiding MC in early middle school. Probably had no clue what I was doing. My ventrilo button was the same bind as my pet attack button, cause, why not? Proceed to first boss of MC, we're sitting at the back of the cave and I respond to the Raid Leader in ventrilo... while I have the boss targeted. A full minute later, the boss suddenly pulls and we wipe. My imp ran up past the adds (Imp immunity) and gave it a nice fire bolt. Good times.
---
That sounds awesome! I'm super excited 😁😁
---
Why not just pick a normal fucking name rather than trying to sound dark and edgy
---
LEEROOOOOOY JEEEEENNNKKKIIINNNSS
---
Oh, I plan on taking my sweet ole time enjoying the game.
---
Warlock is one of the most gear dependent classes in PvP apart from warrior. You need a lot of stamina, as you don't have the survivability a mage has.
---
Man, I must have downed that ZG boss like 50 times or so.  Never saw that mount even drop.
---
Yeah when Vanilla was out we all made gnomes and had that guild. So it's more of an ode to our old jokes. We always make that guild now to keep it alive :) 
---
That's funny about the gnomes hiring dwarfs. Only dwarfs were hired? I would hire NE, lorewise I would think they'd be best healers.
---
That's my expectation, but I'm hoping for otherwise or at least a middle ground. Clearing raid content with weird specs or party rosters was still very manageable.
---
Yeah maybe generally. It's probably most useful for a druid who can use a lot of gear (and therefore turnover a lot) as well as having a BOP best in slot trinket made with enchanting.
---
It should earn some decent money as you disenchant stuff though, you can either sell the mats or if you're dedicated and level quickly you can sit in org/ironforge sell enchants for some decent money
---
Your auto-shot is on a swing timer. The entire Hunter rotation is fitting shots in-between auto-shots. Clipping an auto-shot is a DPS loss under most circumstances (maybe all? I didn't play Hunter in retail vanilla).
---
Only thing I'd ever change is -1000 mana for priest/mage groupbuffs. Still a lot, just a lot less annoying.
---
Obviously the next poster would come up with another QoL change, then someone else finds not buffing annoying but finds casting water annoying and wants to cast 20 instead of 10 (or 4 if you're really purist). Then QoL upon QoL you end up in current retail....this is why even my suggestion shouldn't be implemented and people saying #nochanges are mostly right.
---
Literally the only thing you have to look at is what is different from now vs back then, which will be player retention, which is why the phasing/sharding in the startzone in the initial week was the only QoL change that actually made sense; not needing to open too much servers which would've ment, with a 100x lower retention potentially than retail vanilla, a lot of servers would've died off in 3 months. 
---
As for other QoL changes, yeah not gonna happen for good reason.
---
Depends on your approach. Since you're a new player, I would suggest you go for something useful to your class. In my opinion, it just adds to the game's depth to be able to craft some gear for yourself. Also, crafting professions have various bits of gear that can only be used if you're the one that makes it, so it can be a huge benefit if you level it all the way.
---
Typically you'll pair a crafting and a gathering profession: leatherworking/skinning, engineering/mining, blacksmithing/mining, alchemy/herbalism. Tailoring is a bit of an oddity in that it doesn't require a gathering profession, since you get cloth for tailoring from drops off of humanoid mobs. 
---
The only real suggestion I would give is to avoid enchanting. You of course can pick it up if you want to, but enchanting costs you money because you have to destroy all magic items that you pick up and aren't actively using. Since most people make money for their mounts at level 40 by selling those magic items, it'll set you behind. And you'll never make that money back because the only people who make money with enchanting are the ones who get the rare enchanting patterns from rep grinds and from raids. Not likely to be you unless you go hardcore. 
---
If you roll a cloth wearer and pick up tailoring, I would suggest grabbing a gathering profession to make a little extra cash. Skinning is the easiest because you won't have to fight over ore or plant nodes. Just kill beasts and other stuff you can skin and just sell the leather to a vendor for extra money.
---
I had to pause during Jon telling Daenerys who he really was just so I could laugh like a stupid person at this.
---
I used to have to get to BWL an hour early to zone in, otherwise my guild wouldn't wait for me and would kill razorgore before I even got through the load screen.

C&amp;C 3 (red alert spiritual successor)
---
I always likened it to a heated final round of Legends of the Hidden temple.
---
But in this case the temple guards are rogues.
---
Warriors and rogues are super good from start to finish.
---
Hunters are really good early on, but fall once people get BWL geared. They scale poorly.
---
Warlocks do poop dps early on, but get good with BWL gear and scale nicely into AQ and naxx. Warlocks are extremely dependent on spell hit and they have none from their talents, and hit gear is quite rare in MC. 
---
Mages are the top caster dps for MC and BWL as frost, then when they go fire in AQ and naxx and get some good gear, they outscale warriors because of ignite and become the #1 dps.
---
Yeah man, that's a major part of why I'm so excited to play it. I've never gotten into mmos much because, although they're called mmos, everyone seems to want to do their own thing. I want to be part of a great group. I want to feel powerful not as a lone wolf but as a pack.
---
This made me laugh more than it should.  10/10

Lmao I'm resubbing ofc holy shit is vanilla wow id rather die than miss it.

---
That's the exception, not the rule.
---
Halflife 1 2 and 3
---
Same here haha
---
changing your own diapers or kids? Cause between the taco bell and jolt energy drinks I just decided to go full diaper during raids and the tail end of leveling so I wouldn't have to constantly run in and out of play as I'm TANKING... it wouldn't be right to my party.
---
The problem with the situation you're describing is that the tank leaves usually because the group sucks, so 4manning isn't going to work for a group that wasn't doing well 5manning.
---
On the other hand, if you have a pre-made group of good players I would guess you could clear any 5man in the game with a hunter pet tanking pretty easily. The only limit is that good players often like to optimize VS doing more adventurous runs.
---
In short, the limit is mostly social. Hunter pets are quite strong pre raid. As someone who's healed plenty of content I'd take a well managed hunter or warlock pet over a garbage warrior any day.
---
You'll do less dps, because the pre-bis daggers aren't as good as the swords. It's definitely worth going daggers if you can get your hands on perdition's blade from ragnaros, but you should start off as swords. Perdition's Blade + Core Hound Tooth is a pretty nice combo. If you want to go dagger rogue, tell your guild, so that you'll have priority on those two items.
---
I know why they made a QoL change for battlegrounds to make grouping easier. But it seriously decreased the social aspect of PvP, especially the cross-faction rivlary.
---
My realm was pop-balanced for horde and ally, so I never experienced the pain of horrible queue times.
---
What he says is true though chris wilson did say that about why he is always hesitant on implementing graphic options that could make the game look bad. In addition to it taking time from other development.
---
I still feel so lies to about this picture.
---
I wanted to fight a red dragon in zul’gurub as a demon hunter dammit lmao.
---
&gt;It was not that uncommon but I used to love my Hippogryph from Zangar march reputation.
---
Plain mounts are nice. I'd switch it up now and again, but largely I always stuck to just a plain Black War Wolf on my UD mage. And despite having a plethora of flying mounts my favourite was actually just the standard Wyvern. It has great animations, the armor is simple yet cool, and UD is a really good fit with it IMO.
---
Did they say they weren't going to include it or something?
---
Didnt it have a boss fight where you were in tanks or some shit? That seemed pretty lame for WoW
---
That is mostly what you'll be using IF for as an undead shadow priest, yes. The normal cost is way too high to sustain.
---
Calling someone a kid on the internet, you're so original.
---
Nah it's just from what I've seen from my family, my family's friends, my friends, and my friend's family's, I've come to the conclusion that marriage is a road men should avoid.
---
Paladins can crush warriors and Rogues in duels. But duels aren't meaningful PvP.
---
Ret is only as good as using their BoF, BoP on various casters and HoJ on the focused target.  Even then you're better just running a single rogue.
---
As far as getting to 60 goes, the starting zone speed is not the biggest challenge - at worst you're likely to lose an hour tops from best to worst location, familiarity etc. It's far more productive to know your route and have a plan for weapons etc.
---
Good bot
---
Yeah weather effects and true night is a make or break for me tbh, classic won’t be the same without them.
---
Yes, it wasn't perfect. But the system was.
---
I personally only played Warlock (main), Priest (main/alt), Hunter (alt).. you are wrong on all 3 of them.
---
Kinda but if I were to phonetically sound it out it would be: 'Day-Sil-Ith' but said fluently in a single stroke of that makes sense
---
I like how you took points in offhand and two hand.
---
Related question, are they going to require you to purchase the base game at all? Or does it just require the monthly subscription?
---
I use to call for this as a guild master in wotlk.   I didnt raid leas but when I felt they were taking to long I'd just queue my mic and say    what? Pull?   And throw a frost bolt.
---
I was referring to PvE and high ranked PvP. Every single warrior spec is viable.
---
Best tank and it's not particularly close (in before angry druids).
---
Arms is insane in PvP, the most desired class in any premade.
---
Fury is insane DPS, best DPS class in the game.
---
Amazing idea, cant wait for this and the launch of WoW Classic.
---
How many times are you going to post this?
---
Link to the past, ocarina of time, breathe of the wild.
---
From what I've experienced, most guilds will have some extra members and some social members that can take the place of someone who isn't able to show up or is underperforming. 
---
If you only have 40 raiding members in your guild, you'll be screwed when a few can't show up to raid.
---
If they wanna sell the collectors edition bonuses or the Blizz-con pet codes, I wouldn't care about that. 
---
It's cosmetic, it's classic content that exists but is no longer available unless you're one of the OGs who still has their codes. 
---
And since classic is free for subscribers, they can't even do a collector's edition promo for it.
---
But that is the ONLY cash-shop stuff I'd tolerate for classic. (and it needs to be in the external store and not an In-game one).
---
If they release a TBC legacy and want to sell TBC-era TGC codes, collector's edition bonus, RFA-mount, and blizz-con codes on THAT server. Sure. 
---
It's a way to throw blizzard some extra cash to encourage them to make other eras of wow available so they can milk TCG code sells/promo items etc.
---
Sure some people will complain, but as long as they stick to just the cosmetics that were available during that era to sell, there's not a whole lot of complaints that will stick.
---
And shield!
---
One thing worth noting is you're probably going to want to quest with all of the major factions until you are honored. The discount from honored adds up over the course of 1-60.
---
Halo 1-3: "sup"
---
I like it, its a great game to immerse yourself in.
---
Probabbly the easiest way to explain this
---
https://youtu.be/NXX8URSUWm0
---
Yo i like this premise. Its pretty hardcore tho the amount of gold you will need for world boe drops and rare crafting recipes but it could probably be doable. God speed
---
Enjoyed it.   Thanks for posting
---
The fact this is often true pains me
---
Yeah exactly, which is why it seems hard. I feel like it’s reasonable to expect that 1 person out of every 40 won’t be able to make a given raid. But then who wants to just be “that person waiting for the raid spot “ every time, without a sure position ?
---
Never rly enjoyed RE1 or RE3 like i did re2, yuri's revenge, generals, or zero hour. Re2 and generals, plus their expats, are maybe my favorite rts games ever.
---
I think TOC was the symptom of Blizzard's constant attempts to do more than 3 tiers per expansions, which did always quite work out. Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath all sort of had 4 tiers. AQ didn't really even get a proper tier set like and thus was relegated to being tier 2.5. Sunwell was not fully divorced from Tier 6. TOC was actually had its own set that was not crappy looking like the AQ sets, but was an underwhelming raid content wise. In Cata onwards, it seems like they stopped trying to do 4 tiers per expac.
---
I never bothered with fishing and cooking at all during vanilla.  They didn't interest me at all, and I never felt like I was missing out on anything important.
---
was babydill in 2004. Is babydill in 2019.
---
My personal opinion every horde raid should have at least
---
\- 1 shadow priest
---
\- 1 moonkin
---
\- 1 enh shaman 
---
\- 1 feral druid
---
Although they are not "best in slot", they have some individual strengths and buffs they can bring to the raid as well as to spread the gear that drops (meaning takes longer until gear gets disenchanted etc).
---
That's fair. I will mostly be farming DM on my priest or mage I think, so I hadn't considered the stealth farming.
---
Will you spec the druid as balance? Dual boxing 2 melee is always a pain.
---
When you run the flag and get spam mini stun, you are beyond fucked because its not like you shape shift out of it.
---
This is good
---
"I AM SPEED" he shouts in dwarvish as he procs a double attack off a windfury HoJ crit combo.
---
Yes just over 7 days and /played at 60. Was an alt, so there was some blue xp.
---
Make it so overpower can't miss so that I don't get jebaited by a fucking murloc who decides he's never going to take any damage ever.
---
Wow
---
&gt; WTF was the rational behind that steaming pile?
---
ICC was probably taking a while and it was a filler raid
---
Usually I pug 5 man dungeons with:
---
\- 1 shout in general chat
---
\- whispering Tanks, Healers and DPS individually. Often actually starting with Shamans and/or Druids to have flexibility depending on how the rest of slots will fill up
---
"slightly"? They're a lot stronger pure healers. Druids are generally a lot more fun in PvP as an immortal flag carrier, but in PvE paladins are supreme in both fun and usefulness.
---
They are gonna feel really dumb when us druids are getting insta ques, running flags, out dueling literally everyone, tanking raid bosses and trash, wrecking kids in wpvp, etc
---
eat my ass
---
Your so overpowdered. 
---
You have to go full try hard to get a raid spot.   Minmaxing every way you can because everyone else rolled a rogue too.
---
Okay
---
twinking is trash everyone who twinks can’t pvp.
---
Shouldn't be tanking with Whirlwind Axe though. As a tank, your job is to hold threat from the enemies slapping your party members about first, and then not dying second. Doing damage isn't your job, ostensibly three other players in your party are there only to do damage and all warriors can hold threat fairly easily without having to resort to DPS configurations, such as Whirlwind Axe or dual wielding weapons.
---
Just go Sword &amp; Board, get a 1h and shield. Your dungeon runs will be more successful because you die less (more likely) or it puts less pressure on healers (less likely to get reliably good healers, but you're making good healers job's harder because their mana isn't infinite). Don't make the argument about more DPS = easier healer mana, if you're taking \~15-20% less melee damage simply for having a shield and being able to press shield block, DO THAT - it's the right decision for your group and your team, even if it's less fun to run around with your "badass" spikey axe.
---
There are going to be a lot of mages, so being able to remove their frost nova on a 1 min CD is extremely good. It's also useful against warriors and hunters. 
---
Stoneform is very strong against other rogues, as it breaks blind. It's also good vs bleed effects, so you can bandage or restealth. 
---
I personally think gnome is a little better, but dwarf is also a very solid choice.
---
I love druids. I am rolling one. However if hots stack, it would make so many boss encounters easier to preemptively hot the mt before a major boss mechanic.
---
&gt;I quit in 2011 and after playing from vanilla to Cata well
---
Same here. Had to quit some time after T1 of Cata due to my RL just crumbling left right and center. Had to get it all back on track and that left no time for WoW. Worst thing is that I was going to be the guy to get the legendary staff that was being introduced in the next patch. As pathetic as it sounds it was one of the hardest decision of my life.
---
8 years later and god am I glad that I did.
---
Do people still not know how to use the Prnt Screen button in this day and age?
---
I don't see why not.
---
It's okay, I Misdirected the Tank 👌🏻
---
For the third time: Turn your pet on passive you moron!!!!!!!
---
I think an obvious solution is to just allow one clear of 10 and one of 25, or one of normal and one of Heroic... or make it more true, and allow one lockout to toc as a whole. Same with ICC. Should’ve been, do the whole thing on normal, or the whole thing on Heroic. Want to try heroics but you still want normal gear? Than take a risk or do normal. 
---
It’s just felt so lame picking and choosing which bosses we wanted to kill. It feels so much more daunting of a *raid* to get to the first boss, try to kill them, then work on the 2nd, 3rd, etcetera.
---
If you spam arcane shot, it interrupts the 5 second out of combat mana regeneration and the damage just isn't all that high. Only use it against hard to kill mobs.
---
Yeah, I can agree that as long as they're selling cosmetics that were in the game originally it's okay.
---
It would be weird seeing tons of people running around with pets and things that were really rare back in the day, though. Maybe if they made them available for only a limited time.
---
LOL look at the keyboard turning. Man the nostalgia is real.
---
oh that makes sense.
---
I agree. ToC should’ve been the AQ40 slot between BWL and Naxx. Still a step up, but not virtually making the last raid useless. Can you imagine if the only reason you ever had to do BWL after aq40 was for one legendary and nothing else?
---
Hope you guys enjoy, would like to hear your thoughts on this.
---
Please use the LFG thread for group-lookimg posts. Thank you!
---
I'm going to leave my wife in the dust.   Going for 60 asap.  And when she catches up to 55 I'll help her with ony attunements etc.
---
My wife isnt new to this though.  Having leveled to 60 5 times in vanilla and 3x on private servers.   She knows what to do.
---
We dont play classes that compliment each other so we dont have to rely on each other for anything.  
---
Leveling alts is the best part.  Once prebis and raid nights have been established.   Leveling an alt with your wife and only playing together is a great time.     Were doing that right now on a private server to practice for classic.
---
Yeah I highly doubt I'll get "Brian" again.
---
if you cant get enough responses, i kno kargoz and other hunter theorycrafters have dscords if you search
---
I was one of the first to get the Ravenlord mount in BC on my server. That mount was all I ever wanted and I still remember the day it dropped. Ran with friends of mine who were generous enough to pass on it. I could spend hours just staring at my character sitting on that glorious mount in my full priest absolution set thinking: "This is it, I finaly beat the game" lol If I could have frozen the game at that point and stayed like this forever I would have lol
---
If you can grind efficiently as two people, managing your resources properly, letting your priest get the last  hit, having your warrior run towards the next mob before the current one dies, pooling rage and using sweeping strikes to aoe down mobs, etc, etc. As long as you don't run out of mobs from killing too fast, you'll be golden.
---
Nope.
---
Herb/alch is a great moneymaker. As a healer, your farming abities will be quite limited unless you go ele/resto spec and get some spell dmg gear, so having the best gold making combo in the game as far as professions go, is a wise choice.
---
Well I plan on playing as a spell caster, so I should pick up tailoring and skinning. I can't decide what spell caster I want to pick though, do you know what the play styles of mages, warlocks and priests are like and how they're different?
---
Move 1 point to tactical mastery so you keep 5 rage on switch and still can't use an ability.
---
Where can I find a guild of hardcore players with proven experience (achievements) pre-forming for classic? I would like to be raiding by day 10 at the latest. I have my leveling group, but it takes more than 5 hardcore players to raid and we don't want to risk wasting time on a dead server.
---
Not according to the data mined alpha, but we will see what makes it to live.
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
They generally slow you down if you're looking to level as fast as possible.
---
I've been that ADHD, spammy, teenage hunter who accidentally right clicks when nobody is ready. I would usually say something on vent to defer the blame like, "Ah geez, who pulled again!" knowing damn well it was me.
---
Apologies to everyone who had to endure that.
---
Yeah but then lock mage and Priest all split loot so they basically have to either have 1/3 the gear they would otherwise have or do abunch of ck tent outside of the group to gear up. Not that I'm saying that would be a bad group comp though! The healing from the spriest damage would be a nice plus! And the soulstone/health stone from the lock would be a definite bonus.
---
Yeah, I guess I just think hunters are cool 😅 (as the guy who is playing the priest in the group)
---
Spoilers man...
---
I've literally always thought the hunter was shooting a giant bullet until JUST now realized that'd a fireball/pyroblast from the gnome mage in the back..
---
Contrary to what the other commenter said, druids are totally competent tanks and healers while levelling. If you enjoy doing all 3 roles I suggest druid for dungeons. In raids you will be relegated to healing, and non as in-demand as priests. 
---
Druids are cool for pvp too, best flag carriers and have tools for every situation. Also heard they're easier to gear
---
Most guilds don't want an enhancement shaman in their raid. Maybe if you also craft nightfall, you'll be able to get both. It would be a huge gold investment.
---
Prepare to be buttfucked by rogues and warriors instead of the other way around.
---
Play your priest. You can still heal groups, still level quickly, and still PVP really well together. If she ends up bailing, you still have the character that you wanted.
---
You're telling me I have no soul.
---
Have you checked out the Classic WoW Guilds discord?
---
Have fun getting through an army of exploding mages lmao
---
Nobody does, it’s fairy tale nonsense.
---
&gt;spam mini stun
---
You literally have a 1% chance of getting two stuns in a row.  You're more likely to get zero blackout procs in 43 casts than you are to get 2 procs in 2 casts.  Yeah, it's nice when it happens, but you definitely can't count on it.
---
Yeah, there’s no way I’ll be PvPing to other level, much as I’d like to. I’m thinking Paly twink might be the way to go.
---
"can you please turn off your pet's taunt? Thank you!"
---
Yes but I suspect most people aren't interpreting it literally and generally understand it to mean internality/depth/psychological makeup of who a person is.
---
IMPressive
---
TBC pvp was trash. Either play the 5 good classes or get steamrolled in arena
---
Yeah, I was waiting for a higher level dude to swing in on a rope and kick him off the course and into the back of an ambulance.
---
Hard to do because it changes a lot between character level, gear level, spec and mode of pvp.
---
Alright, Mike is tanking. Craig, you're healing. Steve, Joe and Xarnicloighashif you're dpsing.
---
TriSpec is not a meme, it has a VERY high skill floor, as if you’re not careful you will run oom crazy quick. If I had to offer one tip is to downrank all heals + especially spam rank 1 swp for stun proc
---
1 doomguard please!
---
My best friend used to right click the boss and go take a shit or rub one out while i was struggling as a paladin healer. I hated him
---
Well I plan on being a spell castor so I'll probably do as you said and pick tailoring and skinning. I don't exactly know what I want to be though. Do you know what the major differences are between mages, warlocks and priests?
---
Metal gear solid 1-3. I loved MGS2 don't care what anyone says. I wouldn't trade that experience for any other.
---
Oh ok that’s easy
---
Warrior Pre BiS, no one cares about your hunter loots
---
Thanks for the info
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTrVgogA6kU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTrVgogA6kU)
---
The Long Patrol is returning soon.
---
shit sorry, fixed
---
Do you know how I should that? Like any youtubers I should watch or websites to visit?
---
Many guilds had Moonkin +4 Mages/Locks and Feral + 4 Rogues/Warriors in groups for the buffs.. and the Shadow Priest in the healer group.. It's 40 people.. we had a rogue afk behind a box in stealth at the entrance of Anub Rekhan the first time we killed it.. you can fit these classes into raid for the benefits they provide.
---
Priests are good before ZG too. 16 debuff slots from the start.
---
That undead warlock in the wallpaper lookin fine tho
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Thanks
---
Flying mounts, town to town portals, LFR, guild banks, 30 slot bags, BG que from any where and flex raiding will not be added to vanilla. In fact they have stated they will try to make classic true to the original.
---
You're a hunter just bring your pet and let it attack while you watch Netflix on the side
---
Ohhh okay, this is good info to have I'm going to have to look into down ranking!
---
My old wow name was a dwarf hunter named "rifleman" but i'm going warrior this time around....
---
You want to melt faces, most raids only have one spot for that. One on one in pvp you are great but pvp is rarely a one on one experience. Light feathers prevent you from using the amazing levitate at will. You have to wear dresses. You might get carpal tunnel from declining all the group invites you get.
---
Haven't said this spec was any good except for dueling rogues. Try it with shield +1h, can't lose to an equal geared rogue.  
---
Might be expensive to reroll for a duel but if you got the gold...
---
Gnome mage in the background homie.
---
thanks for the tips!
---
That's really neat. I'm very much looking forward to the feeling of connecting with other players and traveling through the world with enough time to enjoy it.
---
Mods  really need to put a link on the side bad that has all the info we know so far...
---
OH WAIT! It's already there!
---
i wouldn't get my hopes up.. its running on the legion engine/client, which if im not mistaken render stuff differently, shaders, colors etc won't be the same.. correct me if im wrong, but classic won't look like vanilla no matter how much we want it to.
---
The main thing that I think stopping WoW from having a classic+ is that unless there's more powerful gear, most people won't care enough to do the content. Why would someone go and do the quests in Outland when they're in AQ/BWL+gear? Why do the newer raids if the gear isn't any better? If the gear is better, how much better will the gear get before it's too much and new player unfriendly?
---
Sidegrades don't exist because one piece of gear will always be even slightly better than another unless they have the exact same stats. They could buff other specs but some specs will always be the most powerful and some specs require actual balancing to their class.
---
Wall of fame server firsts to 60 AKA wall of hunters.
---
Mage: Classic fantasy wizard type. They use the elements (fire and frost) to cause direct damage to enemies, either singly or in groups. They can solo well and are among the top damage in dungeons/raids. Very straightforward class.
---
Warlocks: Another pure damage class. They embrace the darker arts of magic, dealing damage with shadow and fire as well as summoning demons to serve them. They can cause damage directly or by cursing their enemies. They tend to cause their damage over time, but they can hit hard if you build them that way. They are also a pet class and have utility through their different demons. Solo very well, do PvP well, and can hold their own in dungeons/raids, though they don't tend to do as much damage as mages. They're a little more involved than mages because they have lots more abilities.
---
Priests: Classic holyman/woman. They can damage their enemies with holy energy or embrace the darker side and damage with unholy shadow energy. They are the most versatile healers in the game and that's almost certainly the role you'll fill in dungeons/raids, though shadow priests do well, too. Healing is my favorite thing to do in WoW and priests are my favorite class. Healers have a little higher skill demand simply because people rely on you to stay alive, but it isn't something to worry about. If you want to heal, you'll learn how as you go.
---
You’re gonna have to update it yourself once its out, right ? :D
---
Deadzone! It's something I've adapted to after years of playing Hunter, but I can understand why it's a big turnoff to some people.
---
this, SO MUCH THIS!  miss my 29 huntard.  survival spec and melee twink rogues so much salt so much fun.
---
still feel bad for the 29 druid I one shot with a 1k aimed shot crit.  only time I broke 1k on the twink.
---
This guy really nailed it. Three archetypes are tank, damage and heals. Consider those then consider which fantasy speaks to you. Also do NOT feel bad if you roll another character. It’s a fucking game so if you “waste” time leveling a toon and decide you hate it-no worries :)
---
if theyre time-gating things like titanic leggings, i'd guess theyll time gate SGC too.
---
Sorry. I only very recently subscribed, and honestly, didn't think to check the sidebar. I use reddit on mobile, and the sidebars are a whole new screen, as opposed to the desktop view. I'll try harder in the future.
---
Great video, ret paladin FTW, not sure why so many are downvoting your video, everyone played like this back then, clicking spells, messy UI, that's just how vanilla was for most people
---
Thank you for sharing my fellow ret bro!
---
Shadow Priests will melt faces in pvp.
---
Most IMPressive
---
Why not both?
---
I think private servers have it wrong then because when I did the rank grind, I could be pretty much mini-stun constantly by a priest.
---
Misdirect wasn't added until BC.
---
Not sure on healers lorewise or not, but the Dwarves and Gnomes are cousins, with a close relationship, the Dwarves made a section of their city for the Gnomes since Gnomergone was lost, and the two share very close relations (which in-retail is why Gnomes eventually took up being Priests).  They even share the same starting area.
---
So from all of those perspectives, it makes sense.  Sometimes you don't hire the best, you hire what you know, and Gnomes and Dwarves are besties.  Night Elves don't really have much of a relationship with Gnomes or Dwarves and are more friends of convenience through their mutual ally, the Humans, if you think about it.  In lore, how often do you see Night Elves and Gnomes (or even Dwarves) palling around with each other?
---
Also: For post-boss kills in raids, Dwarves are only a LITTLE taller/bigger/bulkier than Gnomes.  A Night Elf in a crowd of Gnomes would stick out like a sore thumb.  So they're also vertically challenged together, Gnomes and Dwarves!  ^_^
---
You get slam and conc. blow at 30, nice synergy. Plus if you've been tanking you have corpsemaker.
---
Hey man it's my best shot given the options :p
---
&gt; I can guarantee you you’ll be faaaaar closer to your epic mount, which is a massive time saver at 60.
---
Not if you spend all your time and money on professions...
---
Nah tank just needs to handle aggro better
---
Okay.
---
looks half demon hunter half druid
---
You’re okay.
---
There is no aggro reset!
---
For bank alt are you finding one is enough?
---
I remember someone saying that certain specs don't have appropriate gear. Not a lot of caster plate for paladins was the example they used. And hell; maybe they will just make the gear better. Naxx is already pretty "New Player Unfriendly". Make The Burning Peninsula a level 55-60 zone to give people more options for that final push into 60. 
---
I think there are a lot of options - but only time will tell. I'm fine with this just being a time capsule but I just think that re-releasing the expansions is doomed to failure. They'll just keep splitting the Classic Population until they hit Cataclysm. I suppose really what is needed is to take a closer look at what made OS Runescape a success and take notes.
---
Most of what he is talking about is gathering professions.  Which is true, you need to level them as you level.
---
Bless you for sharing this retarded nonsense.
---
To be fair, the sidebar doesn't have readily available info on QoL features.
---
Taking any established names from WoW lore is super lame imo.
---
Damn they all seem interesting to play. Is there any youtubers or sites you could suggest for knowing more about vanilla classes?
---
I wonder why
---
Eh it’s sort of difficult to do this.. the balance in vanilla is so fluid that it won’t be as accurate as you would like.  For example, there are 5 solid mage specs I can name off the top of my head that have completely different weaknesses and strengths.  This would be a massive info graphic that could also be super subjective
---
I have but can't quite find what I'm looking for. Was just wondering if there were other sites/sources I may be unaware of.
---
If she's not an MMO player the chances she actually sticks with it long term is pretty low. I'd play what YOU want to play for the long term and let her play w/e. Or, conversely, play something to help her out and then have your alt be what you originally wanted to play,
---
That's fine and all, but why are you here, in this subreddit, if you think that?
---
I totally disagree with the other poster and will say that I *do not* recommend enchanting to someone who is a complete beginner.  As far as practical or money-making professions go, it's not very casual/beginner friendly. 
---
Skinning is a really nice passive way to make money, since you can just skin every beast you kill and usually just sell what you skin to a vendor.  You asked in another post about casters, so assuming you play one, tailoring can be a nice profession; you can make bags for yourself, there is a good amount of gear that you can make for yourself if you keep your tailoring up as you level, and each of the 3 casters has a bind on pickup robe (meaning when you craft it, it is "bound" to you and you can't trade it, which means you have to craft it for yourself) that is really nice for the start of endgame play.
---
There's a guy named Frostadamus who posts a lot of good videos on youtube that you can check out if you want to learn more about the different professions.  [Here](https://youtu.be/sLS8lOhApZY) is his video on tailoring, leatherworking, and blacksmithing, and [here](https://youtu.be/eMQxrd_ZcOM) is his video on skinning, mining, and herbalism.  He has separate vids for engineering and alchemy on his channel, as well as pretty involved class overview videos for most (maybe all?) of the classes.
---
Orcbit is another youtuber you may want to check out, he has a series of overview videos for some of the classes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRmvlZrvbw&amp;list=PL1BXege7szD3cakslnEBMX36VsoH0u2FW).  Platinum Wow has another series on all the classes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmTQ5284GiI&amp;list=PLiGcT3dOk5iAZ8woMatxbKvfM1rMzKivz) which are informative but also pretty funny.  Finally, dareal MarkyMark's class videos are super informative, and you can check them out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEZEtJ9fpQo&amp;list=PL1fIib3KlV1rw9gC8XG-1xze01PKCRIv6).
---
Since you specifically mentioned mage, lock, and priest, I would recommend watching Frostadamus' mage video, Mark's warlock video, and Orcbit or Mark's priest videos.
---
Maybe not vanilla, but I've always wanted to see a dungeon that involved a torch mechanic. Like one of those underground undead cemeteries in Duskwood but you had to stay near one another and you had reduced vision as you went through small catacombs. Something like a horror game that made you feel claustrophobic as you descended with a mob that could randomly attack you throughout the dungeon like a scare mechanic.
---
guess i have some kind of special vision then, because in a lot of there pictures you can clearly see the difference. contrast, colors,tones, shadows,reflections,shaders, fog and the list goes on.  they're not even close
---
I'm not sure yet how many bank alts I will need. I haven't leveled to 60 since vanilla. I was going to take skinning until I saw some people post some math that skinning every mob to 60 adds 13 hours to the leveling process. I might just level herbalism on my may to the skill level I need for certain potions after level 60. I will need to save all of the cloth and de greens so I might just keep it all until 60 and then power level profession and grind 1000 gold.
---
Refer to reddit at launch.
---
Do you plan doing lots of BGs? I like the size and style of gnome assassin but I think dwarves look pretty sick. Was hoping to get a consensus on dwarf vs gnome but everything I’ve read is 50/50, not sure what I would find more useful. There will be lots of mages and hunters, but plenttttty of rogues warriors hunters, plus UD SPs.
---
Jokes on you, i still use the same name from vanilla!
---
What an amazing show that was. Good 'Ole Olmec.
---
Lmfao this brings back cringe memories for me
---
Never expected my video to show up while browsing Reddit! Thanks for sharing it, I always loved the weather effects and atmosphere of Vanilla, which led me to just record whenever I stumbled upon them.
---
This is the best news I've heard since Death Knights were announced.  
---
Also, to the peeps down voting the original comment.  I play a Prot Pally, thought the rogue joke would be relatable to everyone leveling at some point. Sorry you didn't see the humor.
---
This is hilariously wrong. I don't even know how you managed to be as wrong as you were lol
---
Flasks will be no where near as prevalent for raiding due to the scarcity of Black Lotus. Mana potions will sell well (mana regeneration issues are a core component to playing well)
---
Lol artifact such a garbage fire
---
IIRC wasn't there a dungeon just like that that got scrapped from vanilla?
---
I love Reddit.
---
Everquest, Kunark, Velious.  Sorry, it's true.
---
Woah man, thanks a lot. Yeah, I was planning on going tailoring and skinning since those would probably be the most useful to a spell caster. What I was really looking for was a way for me to more easily decide which spell caster to play because they all seem so interesting. Thanks a lot for the links for sure.
---
I’d argue TBC. TBC started to become carebear and started eroding the principles of working for gear.
---
Also, it split PvP and PvE gear up which was infuriating.
---
Hi, /u/vicxkz
---
If you find human boring, go tauren. It's the character you are going to look at the most, the cities and silhouettes are secondary concerns to that imo.
---
They start off strong (MC/BWL), but don't really scale well with gear so their damage falls off in later raids.
---
That's most of the serious guilds will only bring 2-3 of them for the tranq shot and kiting
---
To be fair, I feel that way about watching sports, too.  Want me to play sports?  Sure.  Want me to watch sports?  I'd rather watch anime or play a video game.  
---
Likewise, I'll watch people play games sometimes if I'm trying to learn a strategy or build or rotation or something to get the basics, but nothing beats learning by doing.  Do the research, understand the basics, then get in there and give it a shot.  
---
There are a few rare games I can watch people play, but generally this is for the story, and it's more like watching a movie with an epic story to me in that case (that is, watching someone play an RPG or something).  MMOs just don't have that to me.
---
I would think either that the details haven't been released, or that blizzard is still unsure of the scope of what they plan.
---
Engineering is the big one for both.
---
Bombs are amazing, both for threat, extra damage, CC, and ranged pulling. Also that shield that lets you AoE tank MUCH more easily. Also spell reflectors to pretend you're a TBC warrior.
---
You'll generally want to go Goblin, since the extra explosives are generally more useful than the gnomish stuff. The Death Ray is nice...but that's really about it, where as pretty much all the Goblins stuff is useful.
---
They start out strong but they just don't scale like a warrior or mage who gain exponential power with higher crit or better weapons. 
---
hunters are very useful in raids because of tranq shot and being the go to kiters, it's just that once you have those roles filled a guild that has options will very likely pick a higher dps class over another hunter.
---
They definitely aren't bad they just don't become gods in naxx.
---
Zero QoL changes are planned. They are trying to get as close to original vanilla as possible.
---
Based and Classic-pilled
---
And Reddit loves you too!
---
While you are correct, I'd like to introduce you to the bags of a Warrior tank, full of several gear sets and consumables.
---
Yes.
---
Because as an Australian with a 300ms, it was easier to learn the patterns and bursts of high end mobs/for high end raids rather than try to explain how you're always doing shit on the DPS meter because the game was lagging when you were trying to backstab/put multiple dots on a target. I never caused a wipe, despite coming first on the overhealing chart and the other healers in the guild never gave me any shit for it... although I was 14 at the time and the youngest by at least 8 years so that could have had something to do with it as well. 
---
Plus it was easy to level and experience all the dungeons as you're always required. You made friends easy, which led to networking easier, which leads to a easier time securing your spot in a raiding guild. 
---
tl;dr - 'cause, if you're somewhat good at healing and you can commit to raiding times, you can go places quicker than DPS/tank if you've got lag.
---
Literally how it goes most times hahaha
---
OS Runescape benefits from the system is has because it's a sandbox, classless MMO. Gear doesn't have stat upgrades and is less important. It's full loot if in PvP areas so that grind for loot is always there. Runescape and WoW are just so fundamentally different, like the polar opposites of the MMO genre, that what works for one game probably wont work for the other. WoW needs it's own formula or to just accept that expansions or added content aren't feasible with it's model
---
You can't tank or DPS if you're dead.
---
We're the big dick in the raids. It is known.
---
That's pretty rad.
---
Nah just liked the sound of it when many years ago. Have stuck with it. Nothing about being dark and edgy.
---
I lol’d
---
Thank you. I think I might give them a shot still. I’ve played mage most my time playing wow so want to try something else.
---
i caught myself going deep hardcore into wc3 even after WoW's release. This has something to do with the dial up internet though.... red latency crippled me and could barley hit level 20. but I did.
---
Maybe, maybe not.
---
In practically all open world games I prefer the game itself to set the mood with its gameplay and ambient sounds, rather than some piece of music “forcing” a mood. For example, I have fond memories of questing in Fearalas to the sound of rain pouring down.
---
Come to think of it, what really turned me off about it was the stupid change to “combat music” whenever I’d start killing a mob. That stupid OMGACTIONMUSIC that didn’t turn back to regular music until way after combat was over got old *real* fast.
---
Thank you for the info. I still might pick hunter just still having a hard time selecting a class since I won’t have a lot of play time.
---
You can do it with pugs, but it's hard and expensive
---
I'd recommend them as they are super fun, have an interesting rotation and have as stupid as it sounds you really do bond with your pet because you are forced to put some time into them, they also get to wear their full tier set which is a nice bonus if you don't like messy clown suits.
---
Things you are going to miss a lot:
---
 * Teleporting everywhere
---
 * Unlimited food/water
---
 * Blink
---
 * AoE kiting
---
 * Polymorph
---
 * Ice Block
---
 * Bag Space
---
 * Running anywhere without worrying about how your pet is going to path or what mobs it might agro
---
Things you will pleasantly enjoy:
---
 * Having a pet tank for you
---
 * Soulstone
---
 * Lifetone
---
 * Sacrifice
---
 * Wanding things to death while they flee in terror
---
 * Sending your pet in as a distraction for mobs while you loot or run
---
 * Fear kiting elite mobs with ease
---
&gt; you need to level them as you level.  
---
Except that you don't need to, it's just your and his preference.
---
Not even close. Use my current alias. Although I will make an alt with my old name, i'll use my current name for my main. And never this weird middle ground reddit name I cant go back on.
---
**Alternate plan:** Rush to 60 with only First Aid to keep me company.
---
That pvp footage made me so excited for classic.
---
You can do it, it just takes longer it requires more patience on your part
---
It's really not that bad (following [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW\_6b\_z0oU/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml)), there's a good bit of leather gear that's great Feral Tanking gear which rogues don't really want:

---
But yes, Feral Druids do have to compete with Rogues for leather gear, but both cats &amp; bears get 2 AP out of each point of Strength, whereas Rogues only get 1 AP / STR - keep this in mind
---
I wouldn't say supportive and friendly. I'm usually cheerful and laid-back but healing turns me into Dr McCoy. Learning to heal has been a continuous journey to learn how to manage my salt levels. 
---
I like the control freak aspects of it. The group can't move without you, at least not in vanilla, and usually play melee so it's nice to be able to stand back and look at the bigger picture.
---
 many healers come from having played tanks first, feeling like their wipes could have been prevented if their healer was better, so they roll a Healer.
---
Only a great geared healer can push a raid through massive amounts of stupid
---
Yikes!
---
Yeah I think I was running 1gb with an Athlon64 3200+ when I started in Vanilla, and two 80gb HDD's in RAID 0 for extra speeeeed.
---
I was crushing it!
---
Well... even though there is a population who will rush I have no doubt that there will be a 3-4 year lifespan before all the people who will see Naxx will make it there.
---
Just went from six to midnight thinking about my first 10 slotter purchase. Or the moment you find a 8 or 10.
---
It won't come out till phase 5 so you have a real long time to collect all the mats and pieces necessary, by that time the serious raiders will have omega gear and could easily crush dungeons, the hardest part with a pug is either the baron speedrun or valthalak himself, both of which can be carried if you can get hold of a well geared tank who knows what he's doing.
---
There's also this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e7nMh8IaH5mNZ7MOx2it8MF7ULYdCIT0VqO6ubaUDq4) with all the guilds currently recruiting.
---
There's absolutely no way to know. If you start on the server and get you a certain level when you notice the population really dwindling, and you see other servers are very popular, if you haven't managed to make any friends or find a friendly Guild which would make you want to stay, then you can just move to a new server
---
I'm planning on doing the same if I can't find enough time to raid. Pugs are fine, some of the drops are just really low and the quests are a bit of a gold sink. I'd say they were great non-raiding endgame content and should keep you busy for a while.
---
This doesn’t make any sense. 10 hours to reach 10?  How in the fuck...
---
Like, were you high?
---
Sometimes it’s nice to take a break and run around picking flowers n shit.
---
Especially while eating 👍
---
Oh definitely. And people are always down for fresh servers.
---
All they really need to do is make Need Soulbind the items.
---
Problem solved. Greed can finally serve it's intended purpose with no real risk to subvert it, unless someone is will to risk their server rep for 2-14 vendor gold or some enchanting mats that sell about the same.
---
I used to do arenas as disc priest while my frost mage partner would handle the other team naked in a funny hat.
---
I always start STV around 40
---
Very cool find. I’ve only ever seen bits and pieces from the wayback machine.  Seeing the mostly intact page is great.
---
Well shit, that clears it all up.
---
Okay yes impale wouldn’t make a big difference but that’s probably what you want if you’re leveling and have already put that many points in arms. Imp shield block is not great in dungeons it is useless. Imp revenge is mediocre mitigation. Defiance and shield slam are the only meaningful talents in prot for dungeons. 
---
Now that I’ve given it more thought I’d skip impale and go straight for enrage after getting anger management. The fact that you think you won’t be getting crit much as a tank with 0 extra Defense while tanking multiple mobs at a time tells me you don’t know what you’re talking about. You’d have near 100% uptime of 20% extra damage if you’re pulling multiple packs....
---
The guild I was in during TBC had main tanks in Group A that required a tank or CC for every mob.  The DPS and healers carried Group A, and the tanks carried Group B.  In our 25s, the RL would be marking mobs in excruciating detail, and then one of the tanks in Group B would say in the most deadpan voice possible "oh no guys, they're aggroing me" as he would just charge into the fray.
---
Those are the good animations that I want to keep, I'm just afraid they will dump the BfA client animations on us clumped together as the "updated graphics" option. As long as I get the vanilla animations HD or not, I'm good.
---
Yeah, they're all fun.
---
You can certainly search on Youtube for Classic content. But if I can make a suggestion: don't. This is your first time to discover the core World of Warcraft game. Don't spoil it for yourself. It's a long ride and there's a ton to explore. Despite what you might hear from people (especially on this sub), you can't make a wrong decision. Some are sub-optimal, but even the least used builds are fun and completely viable unless you're in a hardcore progression raid guild. 
---
From those three classes above: Want to explode people? Go mage. Want to cast curses and summon demons? Go warlock. Want to heal and maybe go a little into the dark side? Go priest.
---
I've done those quests on a pserv, it was really fun but it will ruin you. Would do again 100%
---
I wanted to put this up during easter for those sweet, sweet views. Couldn't get everything I wanted in here. The video is going to be partially recycled for a community rendition. I've re-written the classic song for a wow-machinima music video. So me and some wow friends are going to sing it. It's going to be pure cringe. Subscribe if you want to see it.
---
Pretty decent. Interesting take - nice to see something different from the normal (guides).
---
They scale well in survival spec with that +15%agi
---
You'll be just as dead if tanks can't hold agro or if dps doesnt kill the boss before you go oom.
---
It's almost as if raids are a group effort
---
I've kind of just played healer by default because none of my friends have ever wanted to play one, whether it be DnD or WoW or any game for that matter. I'm a helpful outgoing person IRL as well. I enjoy the challenge and really love the times where you keep the group alive despite some bad pulls/adds. Requires the ability to remain fairly calm when things turn chaotic. DPS can feel mindless fairly often to me, while healing that only happens when you're with a great group that knows how to play exceedingly well. I wouldn't even call it mindless, more so just more autopilot and less ultra focus mode.
---
Not if ur a warlock and that DM isnt out in phase 1
---
Perfect. Thanks for this!
---
Good thing you can still buy a regular mount like the rest of us
---
Yeah, why would anyone update the perfect vanilla wind rider model/animation /s
---
Alright. Primarily based in PVP because PVE 5 mans are easy and don't require perfect groups:  
---
Warrior (mid), holy Paladin (mid), frost Mage (snare mid), druid (flag carry), literally any DPS but probably rogue or hunter
---
Nothing is more rage-inducing (huehue) than speccing 2/2 Overpower and then it fucking misses.
---
Since you will be consumed when it launches might I suggest you go out and try to fullfil some life goals? Like rock climbing, play some sports, go out and socialize with friends and family and tell them that soon they wont see you again for a long time.
---
I'll just wait my 30% cheaper mount thx
---
Be careful what you wish for...
---
2 questions:
---
1. How does dungeon leveling compare to questing/grinding, like in the form of an approximate percentage of speedrunning in those styles?  I abhor questing, but if dungeon exp is abysmal and impractical compared to questing, so be it.
---
2. I actually really want to give roleplaying a fair shake, I've always enjoyed watching others RP and have been brought into impromptu RP a half dozen times in my years of mmo playing.  Are there any resources I can look up that explains each class's history and identity in their representation in each race?  I originally was wanting to go NE Mage, but learned that isn't thing before TBC.
---
Phase 5 seems so late for these items. Can you think of any reason why they didn’t bring them out earlier? I wish they would release these much sooner.
---
1. dungeon leveling is terrible, it is worth to do dungeons once sometimes if you have all the quests because the loot can be really good and will help you level faster.
---
2. rp, i got no idea
---
can you give me a link
---
The correct order.
---
All you have it cloth turn ins but as human you'll least be 10% faster 😏
---
Yeah you're right. Judging purely from just this thread I can tell that the people that will be playing vanilla, will help a noob out. Going into it without really knowing anything will be part of the charm. Exploding people sounds pretty fun, do mages also have the ability to buff people? I want to be as useful as I can to other people.
---
The quest requires some stuff in silithus that isn't patched in till AQ so purely based off that it cannot release sooner.
---
Don't you mean 31/20 Arms, or did you mean 20/31 Fury?
---
\*summons a cat\*
---
Now if only people learn to buff your pet as well as you when they run by
---
I'm the fucking tank.  I pull the damn groups the way I want too!
---
Could be they have it wrong, or it could just be that you probably won't notice all the times you don't get stunned but you'll always notice the handful of times you do get stunned several times in a short window.
---
Tauren. Everyone wants to be Kungen!
---
Just find a social raiding guild that isnt as hardcore.
---
My Hunter will be happily waiting for the pack :3
---
Since classic will be its own contained game there really is no time limit to completing raids as there was from vanilla going into tbc.
---
This was a great idea, and it's a shame it was never directly implemented. If you're doing a dungeon with people, you are there WITH the class/spec/role you're there for, to get gear FOR the class/spec/role you're there performing. It would take 1-2 failures of clicking 'need' to send something to an alt before the greedy retards realized that it won't unbind, and they would never do an alt 'need' again.   
---
"Greed" is wanting gold for an item. "Need" is wanting to equip an item. This is how it arguably ought to be, but as "ninja insurance", most people will probably hit 'need' on any BoE, and I'm sad that Blizzard never thought of your proposed fix themselves.   
---
Everyone, try to be courteous and discuss your policy on loot \*AT THE GATE\* so there are no surprises if/when the time comes. Don't wait until there's a fucking timer ticking on the die roll to have a debate/discussion. Talk loot before everyone zones in.
---
I've been using the same name since i started...eell minus when i had to edit it in tbc when we had server moves
---
Diablo
---
I plan to toy with a toon for a week, then delete and pick the highest pop server after it has established itself.
---
This sub is full of warlock misinformation that is repeated as fact ad nauseam. If you're a part of a guild that's at least slightly competent you only have to summon one or two people that may be running late.  
---
  
---
Furthermore, this meme about making 40 healthstones is complete bullshit. Tanks and healers get healthstones, and there's more than one warlock making them.
---
Nobody knows the exact reputation values on quests in vanilla. There are no resources and I hope to god someone proves me wrong by linking one.  
---
As far as I can tell, private servers are inflating the reputation rewarded on quests by roughly 50%.  
---
The redeeming piece of information is that private servers aren't using overflow reputation, which will exist in Classic.  
---
I personally believe that if it's possible to reach exalted with any race in vanilla, it will be extremely difficult and require large lists of quests and disciplined tracking.
---
Why wouldn't you miss with a 1-hander? Why would using a shield with improved shield block give more rage as opposed to being hit without the mitigation of the shield as well as the bigger hits from a 2-hander? What are you even talking about?
---
Anyway, it's not safer, you gain survivability but lose so much DPS that you come out of every fight beaten to a pulp because you're taking damage over a longer period of time. Not worth it at all, not even for tanking dungeons, as Arms/Fury does a fine job  of tanking lower dungeons.
---
Sorry, had pet on aggressive.
---
Check out Madseason's two part series on it. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnzeAk7Urgg
---
Stealths in so we see our death unfolding in slow motion
---
Imp. revenge is amazing, get procs on your first two revenges, your healer can be drinking still.  Totally speeds up instances. And imp. shield block keeps revenge lit up at low levels when you don't have much if any avoidance on your gear.
---
With three mobs on you have a little over a 50% chance to be crit after 12 seconds of melee.  That means even on a melee heavy pull, you're going to have a 50% uptime on enrage which means optimally a whopping 12.5% damage increase for 5 talent points. Practically, it'll be less than that because it's more likely you'll have enrage up when the fight's over and it'll do nothing.
---
Aspect of the pack is ok though right?
---
Yes! I spent 2 hours tonight on my level 7 Rogue(who's now 9) killing Boars to skin and turning that into armor. 
---
Was a fun time, actually. I managed to level Skinning to 100, Leatherworking to 70, get 2 levels from mobs, AND upgrade all my armor to stuff I made(with light leather kits on them as well).
---
Back in vanilla my group of friends needed a healer and I dropped my first 60 days after hitting 60 and made a priest and it’s been my main ever since(til I quit 2 months into BFA
---
I love the cavalier attitude of this bunny hunter! I plays so well with this meme 🤣
---
huh. sounds interesting. my favorite memories of WoW involve the sense of community there was during the burning crusade days, before matchmaking became a thing. guilds meant so much more than just an extra few letters below your name to make you sound cool. getting your first mount was a huge deal. those were the days...
---
I'm a bit confused though, are they just creating separate realms that are dedicated to the vanilla experience or is it a separate sort of "expansion" that you have to purchase?
---
do you think the auto level up feature makes leveling less fun, or was the expansion just not that interesting?
---
I can't wait for people to complain that Blizz secretly caved &amp; made classic easier than vanilla
---
oh man ST was such a PITA until they revamped it.
---
Yeah, if Classic is anything like vanilla, if you ask around in General chat for help, people will definitely help you out. Also, try to find a casual guild. Hell, if you send me a message when you get started, I'll be happy to share what I know.
---
Mages have a nice buff called Arcane Intellect which increases everyone's intelligence. Casters will love you and it's even a little useful for melee characters because it helps them level their weapon skills a little faster.
---
Mages can also do some crowd control, but I'll let you figure that part out when you get there.
---
i would love to know how many days played i had specifically in this dungeon
---
my warrior main was named Poppopop.... I liked popcorn
---
I'm thinking if they don't...or can't, it's probably because the current version of WoW (client/server) can't handle weather like that anymore.
---
I sincerely hope we get the weather just like it was back in Vanilla.  Only time will tell.
---
This is the WoW version of farting and immediately applying blame to someone else.
---
So like a redneck saying "desolace" with a lisp
---
Not all relationships are good.  There's also a lot of people that are really bad at them.
---
Nice
---
...shocking accurate now that I think about it.
---
+1 you have my vote - I wouldn’t even mind if they added animations/models from current wow. I mean you can’t tell me the male human running animation or the NE mae jumping animations don’t look terrible on vanilla 🤨
---
I never said that dying isn't fun; I said PVP isn't fun for me, personally. I also never suggested that PVP be removed from the game. If I don't care for something on the menu, I don't ask for it to be removed from the menu; I simply don't order it. I know others enjoy PVP, so I would never want to take away their fun when I can simply opt out of PVP. 
---
I'm not sure why you feel personally slighted by my response. I'm sorry that you misunderstood what I said.
---
Aside from the druid hot stacking, sounds ok
---
Good luck convincing this sub of anything to do with making classic an even better experience
---
Ah, thanks for the reply, can you explain to me what overflow reputation is? I've never heard that term before. Also, do you know the cloth turn-in will be available right once classic goes live?
---
I have always played hybrids in every game possible. Imagination my disappointment when I hit 60 as a troll shaman and was told you are the dedicated group healer. What is even more strange is I liked it. Always came back to healing eaven after several excursions to dps. I think what I like most is that there never was a single parameter that could measure my performance. Like dps meter. Sure you can measure hps or over healing or inactivity but it is never one parameter.
---
My understanding is that runecloth is a rather high-level cloth to farm, so wouldn't that be costing hundreds of gold worth of cloth to get exalted? Especially with the demand from everyone leveling first aid and the tailors on a new server?
---
If you aren't going to level them, you can't gather any of it, so what's the point of even taking the profession?
---
frik i thought i didn’t need it
---
&gt; Overflow  
---
A system which awards you with 25% "overflow" or "spillover" reputation to cities other than the reputation being awarded.  
---
Example: I have done a quest that awards 100 reputation primarily with Darnassus. As a result, the game will also give me 25 reputation each to Ironforge, Stormwind, and Gnomeregan Exiles.  
---
&gt; Cloth turn-in  
---
Availability of this quest has not been confirmed at launch. Blizzard may opt to release it in line with the patch cycle it appeared in, or allow it from the very beginning.
---
Sorry for ruining your name for you lol
---
I always just did desolace-badlands
---
For my experience if you can kite you are sorly needed. Back in the day I had to kite dragons as shaman in the razorgore fight none of our 5 hunters was able to kite more then 2 dragons. We had a shaman and a warrior kiting. And trust me kiting 5+ mobs as shaman sucks
---
I remember escorting groups through this dungeon when I finally learned what to and where to go. People would get lost so easily in here or not know how to navigate a non linear dungeon.
---
Second davorite dungeon after BRD.
---
Currently overseas and am looking at playing on an oceanic server until I return back to the States next year.
---
Will they allow server transfers? I haven't seen any news on this.
---
Or should I play on US servers and just deal with the lag?
---
Yep
---
I plan to play about an hour a day a few days a week.   Probably going to take me year to hit max level.
---
Looking forward to leveling my fishing and cooking, and all the slower parts of the game.
---
Ah okay so theoretically just completing a metric ton of quests should get one to exalted eventually. But if there's no cloth turn-in at launch, then would there be no other way besides completing quests for spillover to gain exalted?
---
Can someone explain how debuffs work on bosses? Do new dots push current ones off when it hits the limit? Do debuffs stack and if not do they stack when a lower rank is used? I'm kinda confused 😅
---
The tauren quests aren't quite as condensed.....there is a lot more area to cover to find quest mobs/items and there seemed to be more patrolling mobs roaming Mulgore but that could also be because less players are there killing things. If you know the zone and all the quest givers its not as bad but going in blind its faster to start with troll or orc in my experience.
---
I’d love to see this as well
---
I don't argue for less graphical settings but players and the world needs to look similar as they did back in Vanilla. It should be the goal to recreate Vanilla. 
---
Keep in mind please that there is alot of detail that is being generalized in "improvements".
---
For example:
---
The water in Classic demo looks calm where as water in Vanilla looks uneasy. There is a big difference in the kind of ambience they give.
---
Have you seen the weather effects that got nerfed in vanilla? The original weather effects where too taxing on computers back then so they got nerfed. The new weather effects are less than what Vanilla had at a point. 
---
It is not soo simple as improvements vs nostalgia alot of the time the old graphics were better at giving off a certain atmosphere. 
---
The problem with saying: 
---
"I, for one, am looking forward to seeing the world in gorgeous graphics." 
---
is that alot of players think that the old graphics are gorgeous too.
---
People who say "it's almost as if" are the new rock bottom. I'd rather hang out with someone who says "problematic" or "gatekeeping".
---
I just love helping people and making those around me better.
---
I have self confidence issues, so I’m not a type A person, I rather just do my job well, but at the same time be more important than a fucking rogue lol 😂
---
Oh, you mean Slitus?
---
Yea you can just Google it and get your answer. There have been plenty.
---
Right you are Ken! I don't take primary professions until level 60.
---
Hype
---
The point of a ret paladin in PvP is sheer annoyance. If you actually want a mean setup they're pretty easy to skip over.
---
Healing paladins however...
---
I first read "large amount of mysery and imagination". Just imagine being attacked by locusts flailing around your arms while they crawl under your armor biting every inch of your body only for you to die and your body explodes into a host of bugs. Ugh, nightmare fuel.
---
I did a calculation where I reduced the reward of every quest by 50%, and then added in the spill over reputation from every quest in the game, and it still doesn't get you to exalted.  
---
I hope my numbers are very wrong. I want to be exalted with Darnassus pre-60.
---
Maybe I just don't remember this accurately but I mained a shamy in early vanilla and don't remember them being all that great. My initial experience was 5 dungeon for the .5 gear For PVE I tried to main spec elemental, at least for 5 mans, but was outclassed by mages/warlocks dps and often was forced into healing if I wanted to party. And I don't recall Enhance being good til much later, not sure when and what changes made it a thing. And for healing, priest were best IIRC and most raids preferred Druids for Innervate and Hots, at least for main tanks. I was needed for totems for the MT quite a bit tho. As for PVP, I feel like their were more viable options but I don't recall that and didn't PVP much with my shamy, I did most of that with my mage.
---
So please correct me where I'm wrong, because this was so over nearly 14 years ago and I prolly don't remember half of this correctly. Plus, I know players are much more informed today than I ever was back then, and I really came a long ways over the years. But back in those early days, around .5 and MC, I slowly came to the realization that I was a healer class and my other 2 specs options weren't that desired for groups/raids.
---
I just want to have fun and make friends, probably join up with a big guild.
---
Who the hell asks if a game from 2004 can run on their potato. It runs on my grandma's PC so - yeah.
---
Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, Dark Souls III.
---
Vanllia, TBC, and WotLK are great also. :P
---
Plan to do them eventually post 60.  Preraid bis, attunements, and grinding gold for mount come first though. Might fish for some gold... but I'd rather mine and flower pick if I can find quiet server time to do so... which is unlikely I'm guessing.
---
Play Warcraft III
---
At 60? Arms for PVP, Fury or tank for PVE.  
---
You'll be kicked out of any serious raid if you use up debuff slots with Mortal Strike.
---
Nothing was more creepy than walking the dark path of duskwood and running into Stitches lol It's still my favorite zone but I miss how dark it used to really be
---
Is it viable to lvl up with herborism and mining and replace at lvl 60 herbalism with engineering?  
---
Get 300 eng with the mats i’ve collect while leveling ? 
---
So more money while leveling selling herbs.
---
Time to find my old ocremix jams.
---
I hope you get 3 shot by an enhancement shaman for saying they're just awful
---
the amount of agi you need in order for survival to grant more raid dps over marks w/trueshot is so high that it's pretty much not feasible until you have naxx on farm
---
Not the ones Sodapoppin , Asmongold and Nixxiom are on.
---
In my experience all the quests were labeled with a D to indicate dungeon.  Or if you cared enough you can add your own path to his website for your characters to follow. You seem knowledgeable.  If you aren't happy with how others do it, then just figure it out yourself.  Good luck.
---
Ooooor you can respec for raids? Or nah, to much work.
---
I started with lock and then priest alt in vanilla.
---
Warlock probably easiest, you get a pet to help absorb damage, no mana concerns, healthstones. I think mage ends up with higher damage in raids though, has portals for travel and movement abilities. Priest is generally only a healer. You will level as shadow/hybrid, but if you want to raid you'll probably be asked to heal. Priest also way more boring to level.
---
Those are just basics though. People post class specific threads all the time on here and YouTube vids out there on every class. I suggest you research there for a full picture.
---
Too much gold
---
I think if you're able to play Retail at max settings, then  you'll probably be able to play Classic at max settings.
---
Ahh, I like to call it the holy trinity. If they eventually release legacy servers for all 3, I’d be set for life.
---

---
old night literally still exists in current wow, you just have to buy a potion for it (yes, it's weird). I can't imagine a scenario where the weather isn't easily implemented
---
I'm torn between sticking with Hunter, my tried and true class that I always played, or playing something all new.
---
I've never leveled a mage or warlock, so maybe one of them.
---
I'm also torn between playing Horde, whom I've always played, or playing Alliance for a new experience.
---
I wanted to play dwarf hunter from watching the cinematic. Had to get the bear also. Good times.
---
I am playing Warcraft 3, but tbh I am having a hard time holding my interest in any game now. I think I will start Dark Souls 1 once again.
---
All games feel very same and indie games are just gimmicks and nothing solid, after few hours indie games feel very boring and disconnected.
---
Like the new voidwalker models
---
Yes, pretty common tactic to send all of the mats to a bank alt, then level up the crafting profession once you hit 60. You will probably be a little short on materials, but you can just buy the rest.
---
On classic launch, cloth turn ins arent even guaranteed
---
&gt; Also, it split PvP and PvE gear up which was infuriating.
---
Exactly. You need separate character for PVP and PVE.

The route file he uses, that the site allows to customize and import is 404'd - I'd love to adapt it myself like the author intends. It just doesn't work, and messages go without response.
---
Durotar and Coldridge are the fastest, but how they transition into secondary zones makes Teldrassil better for Alliance. Elwynn is pretty kickass too.

Not sure if there’s been any word on this yet but, is individual mob tagging going to be a thing like in retail? Or is it gonna be like OG vanilla and party only? 
---
Any word on respawn rates if it’s not mob tagging?
---
It’s great for warrior too, if you are tanking
---
I'm picturing a visual of you standing outside the entrance, offering groups to be their guide but getting rejected, then watching them corpse run 3-4times to the dungeon before they cave, begging you to show them the way
---
Called myself Shadowscast as an undead mage. My logic seemed alright, undead seemed shadowy and as a mage I did cast stuff however I was always mistaken for a warlock.
---
Having said that I feel it will get another run this time around.
---
You'll get no spots in pugs unless you're overgeared, you'll need to be competitive in dps even though you do none and aq40 gets you no loot.
---
I'll probably try out mage first, as I'd like to be able to help others of in terms of utility and damage dealing.
---
I know gnomes and Dwarves are clearly better and closer I was just saying in a joking way as hiring the best healers would be night elf's. Like a job. So I guess more in a RP way, my bad.
---
I like playing support in games; mostly played medic in BF2 and so on.
---
I don't know how supportive I am IRL though...
---
Yeah then once they go healer... "If only the tank was better" lol
---
Glad to be in Oceanic with our few servers most likely lol
---
I’d rather play on LH than play on the one with SS, Esfand, and Tips
---
Ok nuke it. Dot it.
---
Leeroy wasn't a hunter
---
I split my time between hunter and holy paladin in vanilla/BC, then started WotLK as a resto druid before going feral. I enjoyed pally up until wrath, I didn't enjoy resto druid until wrath.
---
&gt; Do you enjoy because you’re so crucial to dungeons and raids (sorta like tank)?
---
Sort of. It makes it easy to find groups and be a meaningful part of someone's experience. Mostly I just got sick of healer shortages/bad healers. I'd get frustrated playing with bad healers, but I'm not a dick, so I don't just go off on them. I offer tips and all that stuff, but sometimes it doesn't do any good. If I'm the one healing I don't have to deal with that frustration, and I'm not afraid to tell people that blame me because they died in the fire that they're morons.
---
&gt; Are you a supportive friendly person irl?
---
As much as anyone I suppose, I just keep to myself, mostly.
---
&gt; Does your class reflect your personality?
---
I wouldn't say so. I take enjoyment out of The Darwin Awards, not sympathy, but often as a healer you're having to keep morons from dying, so it's basically the opposite of what I'd rather do.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I was an undead rogue does that make me a dick!!?
---
Statistically speaking, yes.
---
Who did 1h20m as troll hunter? I've not seen anyone get close to that, but I've seen times in the 30s for durotar.
---
That damn auto-attack during explanations haha
---
Healing makes me feel like I'm helping :D
---
The \[Inky Black Potion\]([https://www.wowhead.com/item=124640/inky-black-potion](https://www.wowhead.com/item=124640/inky-black-potion)) makes the game far darker than it ever was in Vanilla. 
---
Here's an example: [https://i.imgur.com/H3aSlTt.png](https://i.imgur.com/H3aSlTt.png)
---
I would go fury but pick dwarf or gnome for their PVP racial.
---
At the same time, of course.
---
Promoting private server use is a violation of rule #4, reported. Keep your private server bs elsewhere.
---
Excellent, not the same thing but myself and friends got the expansion at midnight launch (Australia). But myself and one other ordered from another store which didn't do that. So while our 3 other friends were playing the new content we were killing horde trying to get to the portal and ended up getting a huge group going for several hours. Definitely one of the best times I had playing wow.
---
Did that happen to be on frostmourne?
---
One QoL thing that has been heavily alluded to is about the [mailbox interface](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2330) using more modern features.
---
But right clicking turns on your melee not autoshot...
---
Not making updates graphics at the very least a toggleable option would be a huge mistake for the lifespan of Classic. Any retail players that started the game a few expansions in are going to be severely turned off by the downgrade.
---
I do not play Retail. I dont even know what retail looks like. But I think I'm right.
---
Buggy. Due to coding errors.
---
They use their own code and numbers from HP to damage and armor
---
One can say that raid loot trading is a QoL feature as it massively lowers the time it takes for a mistaked master looted item to be exchanged.
---
Yeah I agree with you, I want to experience pre-cataclysm Azeroth with a slightly nicer engine. After having read your comment, and others, on the water I am less sure what I want now, but that's the beauty of it it being an option! Thank you.
---
Eh, I suppose it could be considered QoL. I had forgotten about raid loot.
---
Like I posted above I thank you for your thoughts on the water. I am less sure now how I will play, and I think especially the ambiance the water will set is something that I didn't think about.
---
Warlock is my favorite class. You turn life into mana. You can get the life back with bandages, healthstones, and deathcoil. Learn to use your pets. I keep pet attack and pet follow bound to the 2 buttons on the side of my mouse and I can control them easily or send them to go get another mob after the first. I don't worry about pet aggro in groups because I know they are on follow. 
---
Pick the right build. You want instant corruption and a tough voidwalker when leveling. SM/Ruin is awesome. Shadowburn is awesome. keep your soulstone up. 
---
You want to use macros like the stop casting shadowburn macro and the soul shard bag space drain soul macro. Some people like drain tanking but I think its meh. You don't need food or drink if you are doing it right. Your level 40 mount is free. The class quests are awesome. Choose the trinket not the staff. The staff will be replaced fast the trinket is a one of a kind. Don't craft a robe of the void its a huge time/money sink compared to other options out there, but it does look cool. I've made one I know. 
---
Don't ever clip your dot. Its bad for DPS. Kargoz has a decent Warlock guide to get you started. Wands matter a lot. Get a good one. Let the Tank get aggro. The Warlock community has always been helpful. Locks help other locks out. If your stuck on a quest go find a warlock. 
---
Well that was a very random and not thought out list as I thought of stuff. check that guide out. It's a good start.
---
Not that one, but I will upvote you both for the attempt! It was like a super in-depth one, that even included the WoW movie. Like announcements to release dates, how long each one took.
---
Most things that dont involve mobs and dps should be right since things like proffessions and loot is correct 
---
dont bit my head off with your "well there are a couple of items that werent correct to the patch on the pserver i played on!" Cut em some slack progessive itemization from pservers is prob way closer then what blizzard is prob gonna give us
---
Druid and paladin heal for raid almost exclusively I'm told. Im also fine with this looking forward to it even, but if I'd like to grab a weapon or weapon and shield for outside raid use (like tanking dungeons and ubrs or farming or pvp) what are the options? Like there's a spear shadowstrike I see called vendorstrike because it isnt great, but if I were a paladin healing could I grab something like that for if i ever wanted to mess around ret without much fuss? Are there situations where as a hybrid healer I could snatch &lt;insert weapon&gt; and nobody would fuss too much or how does offmeta/offspec gearing go? Not everything from everywhere is sought after so what other kinda dead items are out there that'll be reasonable to offspec gear with?
---
I'm always impatient and end up having someone I invited whisper me back 2-3 minutes after I filled their slot and I feel bad :( but not bad enough not to do it
---
So true
---
I'm going to be doing this exact thing when classic comes out. Its extremely important to try and not skip a single quest. 
---
Here's a summary of what I'll be doing in the beginning. Level to 4.5 in Dunmorogh. Sell everything from my inventory that I do absolutely need. Get The Ironforge flight path. Learn skinning and buy a skinning knife. Learn tailoring if I have enough money. Do the menethil harbor mountain skip. Get the menethil harbor flight path and take the far right boat. Get the duskwood flight path and then darnassus flight path. Get the hearthstone at the telldrasil inne and start doing the night eld starter zone quests.
---
Getting the flight paths is crucial!!! Because running back would other wise be a huge pain.
---
You want to head back to ironforge at levels 10, 14 and 20 to learn your new spells. After you get portals at 20 being so far away from a mage trainer will stop mattering.
---
At level 10 I also reccomend doing your mage quests in ironforge so you can get some extra xp and a very handy off hand orb.
---
If you have any other questions feel free to PM me.
---
exactly this situation we had back in vanilla. after ragnaros pull one of our hunters has been kicked. from this day we raidet only with 3 hunters even bwl.
---
And I think that is a good thing, I am strongly in favour of it being possible to play it as close as possible to  how it played in 2006. 
---
I also think, however, that it should be up to each player if they desire a slightly more modern look with more dense foliage and water etc.
---
No purchase box price, just a subscription. You’ll have to pay box price for the most recent expansion if you want to play it. So if you sub in July you get access to a Classic sub and a Legion sub.
---
Now that some alpha files are "leaked" so we know which API the game will be using? Will 8.2 live add-ons and macros likely work in classic too?
---
I remember one time when I was leveling a rogue through Sunken Temple, and a boss or trash mob charged me, which sent me flying through the air about 50 feet, and straight into that pit to the bottom floor.  The group could only laugh.  I think I typed, “SWISH!  Three points!,” in party chat.
---
Already see now in trade chat .BWL GUILD SELLING 45 MIN BARON RUNS 50g
---
So I'm planning on potentially rolling an NE Hunter. I have tons of Vanilla/PServer experience with classes, but not much with Rogues or Hunters (lots of Rogue in TBC though cant imagine playing without shadow step at this point personally). Am I wrong in thinking that a well played Hunter has a big advantage over an equally played Rogue regardless of the opener?
---
It’s all about community. You see someone about to die, get in there, give them a hand, chuck a heal, bandage. Throw your buffs if you have them! Have fun! Make friends. The one thing I remember is the community aspect of vanilla. Everyone helped everyone and you got to know people and make new friends. Have fun. Enjoy the journey. Man I am so keen!
---
Hunters are godly at PvP while leveling, I dont think that's a very good basis for opinion.
---
why are they not putting them back in?
---
Those first two arent qol but gameplay changes. The last one doesnt work because of how professions used to function.
---
Proper mailbox functionality was announced. Nothing else is official.
---
Just wanted to give you a heads up that under "Charter" and "Initial Timeline Discussion", you still mention you're a 10 hour raiding guild.
---
My 2015 Macbook pro ran the classic demo. It looked decent for leveling, but I'm upgrading to a laptop with a 2070 in it because of 40 man raiding.
---
Depends on how you prefer your controls.
---
Wife and I are going classic warrior priest combo. Gonna be so amazing. Mining and skinning for me. Tailoring and enchanting for her. Gonna be well bagged and well geared. My (solo) alt will be a lock with herb and alchemy. I can funnel the mains potions and elixirs. Have it all worked out perfectly.
---
Pretty cool! Don't get discouraged by somewhat mixed reaction. I, personally, would really like seeing all classes portrayed in such way.
---
I know this is a WoW sub but ill throw
---
Halo 
---
Halo 2 
---
Halo 3
---
into the mix of trio. I really loved these games as much as WoW.
---
It's almost as if gatekeeping becomes problematic.
---
He's busy being stunned for 15 seconds
---
I don't think you can claim "accidentally" while also having a "usual" response. You were just an asshole.
---
&gt;If you're doing a dungeon with people, you are there WITH the class/spec/role you're there for, to get gear FOR the class/spec/role you're there performing.
---
Now this part I don't fully agree with. I like to play hybrid specs (Not just hybrid class but hybrid spec) because I like being able to do whatever the group needs. 
---
Often I'll join a group for a dungeon after an item for a certain role e.g. a shield on my paladin but we can find tanks but no healer so I'll heal. But I'm only doing the dungeon for the shield.
---
Warrior BIS till aq40 from memory.
---
I remember watching a tips out video months ago where he was whining that the shadows in the new client were too dark. As he was standing in a fucking jungle. When he looked up he saw no sky, only canopy. But the shadows were too dark.
---
I'm excited for the updated graphics.
---
I was gonna no life to 60 but I have a wedding to go to next month so I’ll only have about 4 days off for Classic :(((((
---
With Prot Warriors hopelessly spamming thunderclap in a futile effort to hold aggro... I can still feel the anxious sweat under my arms.
---
Duskwood was never very dark, it's about the same on BfA as it was in Vanilla. Video from 2006: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkgdKNAzoEU

Yeah that’s what people say to do. That profs are a massive time sink. Worry about them when you are 60 since you can’t do A LOT of progress you will have some downtime.
---
If I had to, I'd probably go with Morrowind, Obivlion, and Skyrim.
---
But WoW define my childhood and teenage years so I wouldn't say it's "better".

I think the engine can handle weather just fine. It's up to Blizzard to implement it properly and I have no doubts they will.
---
The fasted 1-10 I’ve ever seen was like 1hr 12m but the guy had help killing his tags on a fresh server. I can’t imagine 1h 20m is possible on a hunter though considering joanas 1-10 was almost 3 hours on a mostly empty realm, and 1-10 is probably the easiest place to practice and find a route with maximum efficiency. Not to say joanas speed couldn’t be beat but I doubt by a full hour and a half 1-10.
---
Check out this video for some gearing advice at level 60. https://youtu.be/g_hoNO8pzt8
---
SGC drops from day 1, unless you’re saying they’re going to make SGC have its original stats but blizzard already said they’re not changing stats.
---
I think my favorite version of every class was wotlk. tbc improved alot of the shortcomings vanilla classes had but there were still some left over. Wrath really filled all the gaps. Your point on wrath being a burst fest has less to do with class design and more to do with how they scaled their numbers, something that while not easy, could be improved.
---
If you're bleeding edge, first to 60, all you need is skinning and to skin devilsaur for the first week or two and you'll have thousands of gold
---
Sure, we are paying a subscription fee after all, and it’s not like they have to add additional dungeons. Instead, they could gradually “remaster” the old world and even reuse those assets in retail. As long as they keep such changes optional to allow for purists having the old experience.
---
DM is dire maul
---
Wotlk is absolute trash. Achievements? Raids with modes? Come on now, wotlk was where people started to see the direction wow was going and represents the calm before the storm
---
Are PvP servers going to be faction locked?  If I roll a Paladin on a PvP server am I going to be prevented from having any Horde characters on the same server?  I seem to recall that being a thing for quite a few expansions.
---
Everyone talk about bad scaling item wise ... but no one tells you about complexity of hunter's rotation ... 
---
Depending on your attack speed you need to use different one ... and your attack speed may change by using skills so every time to get max from increase of attack speed you need to change rotation to optimal one ... add to it Fake Death trinket swap ... which may also change your attack speed and to max your output you really need to think and have knowledge ... and these are not small numbers ... if hunter use same rotation for every attack speed he can lose 30-50% of dmg from every third autoshot (this statement is very simplified and not truth when you go deep into hunter's rotation but will help to understand my point) ... add to it usage of pet who is easy to kill by boss and revive = dmg loss, not using it = dmg loss ... add to it good trinket swap management ... mixing it all together can make huge difference between good and bad hunter 
---
 ... I'm not telling that good hunter will top in dmg chart of good players raid but definitely the picture of bad scaling is enchanted by hunters who doesn't know how to use correct rotation to each attack speed.
---
And now conclusion ... hunter is fun class to play ... "hard lvl" starts at the end of game where you need to really know how to play to stay on top where other classes scale with gear and hunter scale with gear + gameplay as number of options and variants  increases 
---
Hunter is great for pvp ... roles which he fills are vvveeerryyy enjoyable ... use engineering + brain ... and you will own :P
---
I haven’t played a game with the volume up since YouTube became a thing. I run let’s plays or streams on my TV the entire time I’m on my computer.

Thanks! This is the exact sort of thing I was looking for!
---
After Cataclysm I stopped buying physical discs for some reason. I feel stupid because of this.
---
Those are probably game objects which are spawned by the server. He is using a sandbox for the Classic client, which has no spawns or content outside of the data contained in the client itself, while playing on a fully fledged private server with the Vanilla client.
---
Sandbox emulators just let you get in game and run around, but do not implement any gameplay logic, nor do they have any server side content, like spawns and quests. The objects you do see in the Classic sandbox are static world objects, which are a part of the map files themselves.
---
Time flies, as does Nozdormu.
---
I’m still using and playing 6 characters from vanilla with their original names. 
---
Now I have one toon of each class and a couple dupes on opposite faction for storyline experiences.
---
While we don't k ow that's how it will be. That is how it was back in vanilla, so I would wager PvP realms will be faction locked.
---
Is it worth it to level professions on the way to 60 or should you just focus on grinding and quests and then get your chosen professions when you're max lvl?
---
LOVED this dungeon. Can't wait to run it again in classic.
---
I'm intent on playing either Hunter or Warlock as my main on Classic launch and the fact that Warlocks have the soul shard issue plus resurrecting with no pet and no buffs leans me *hard* towards Hunter.
---
Faction lock was present in PvP servers in Vanilla.    
---
So I would assume that PvP servers in Classic will have faction locking.
---
I would wager tagging will not be like retail. Locked to party only, just like it was back in vanilla.
---
Will we be using the new updated character models or will we be using the original models?
---
I don't know about lower ranks. But as far as I recall new debuffs push the old debuff off
---
And the promptly blame the healer for letting it die. I don’t miss the abusive relationship of being a healer.
---
Red Dragonscale Protector is best looking imo.
---
TBC  
---
* Flying  
---
* Arenas  
---
* Easier raiding  
---
* More accessible raiding - This isn't necessarily bad, but it was the start of the whole pandering to Casuals thing Blizzard started to do   
---
* Both factions getting Paladins and Shamans  
---
* Shattrath  
---
* Raising the level cap to 70 - Classes in Vanilla were messed up, raising the cap and adding more abilities only added to this  
---
FUCKIN' BRACE YOURSELF FOR BUTTHURT(This is where most the downvotes will be coming) BRACE!  
---
* &gt;!Blood elves !&lt;
---
I would have loved raiding with that dude.
---
When you add items from a different patch than the current one, this is not called “progressive itemisation “ , it’s called a private server.
---
Now, I have nothing against pservers, just remember that the values and all of the math is developed by blizzard engineers, not enthusiasts.
---
Huh. I never really considered what the plague event was like on the GM side of things. Good lord it must have been even more of a confused mess then it was player side . But still though thanks for your time and answering!
---
I thank you, yet will probably go for a pet class, it seems that the warrior dream is too far away.
---
For sure, that's one of the reasons I'm so excited for classic!
---
I am currently playing a lock on a private server ( gonna roll priest on classic). Soul shards are really annoying. I can't just camp bgs all days because I run out of soul shards after a few games. Otherwise, it is nice having a lot of utility and resources, but it is very easy to run out of soul shards fast.
---
Def more excited to roll priest later
---
That's reasonable.  I suppose my point of view is from that of a competant premade.
---
Do you really think at level 30 a shield and using shield block will amount to 15-20% less damage taken?  I'm asking honestly because I havent done it in many years.
---
We had a 1:22 Gnome Mage run (Jokerdtv) on repack recently. There’s quite a few classes that can do Durotar in the range of 1:25-1:40, also.
---
So your phone is like a second monitor to you, but WAY THE FUCK SHITTIER THAN A SECOND MONITOR. So yeah we have phones. Have you ever watched The Office in its entirety before you hit level 45?
---
Arms can't raid due to MS taking a debuff slot.
---
Fury is the go to for PVE DPS with or without Deep Wounds spec depending on the guild.
---
I used to play on US servers while I lived in Singapore and the same server when I moved to Fiji.    
---
The only lag I found playing back then was the auto dismounting when going inside a building. Even with that I didn't have any problems with dungeons when playing on US servers.    
---
The only problem I did face was that most Guilds would raid in US time (obviously) so I had to stay up pretty late to raid.
---
With the release of classic here soon, us as a community could make changes to the game as new expansions get released (Depending on how well classic does), kinda like OSRS did. 
---
The community could then vote and make changes to the game. Re-release the expansions and create a better WoW, deviating away from the content that made it worse and creating new content that makes it better. We have a time line of the last 15 years to work from. It’s very exciting to imagine and should be taken seriously because this is the only MMORPG that I keep coming back too and keep wishing it was like it once was. I believe wow will be around for years to come.
---
I can’t wait for classic.
---
Think you can raid in pve with arms if you go horde because of the windfury of shamans
---
*checks combat log* oh
---
..I dunno! Who could it have been???
---
You think it's ruining *your* life? Try that with a family and children to educate and houses and cars and a wife that despises anything to do with technology and games.
---
I have to stop moving to cast spells that aren't instant. It's way worse than it sounds in high movement fights. Being a spell turret feels terrible and the people at Blizzard that design the classes like it that way. There was once an amazing class design for Warlock in MOP, but we couldn't have that could we? No problem I just unsubbed again for another xpac. I have no bag space and I have to bring shards to the raid. Farming them is not the problem its the lack of bag space. Who thought this was a good idea? It was on purpose to because that designed bags for them. The whole wand thing is dumb. No viable threat mitigation? Better set an alarm on your threat meter or you wipe the raid. You have to summon people to the raid and they are afk. You have to find 16% Hit before you can stack spell power. Blizz was genius after crapping on the robe of the void bonus and made the blood vine set from ZG that has great stats and looks like complete dog shit and it locks you into a profession to get the crit bonus. One day you will be a tier 3 dps god but as soon as you get it the end game content is over. Mages will always out DPS you with a one button macro because Blizz likes it that way.
---
Orc &amp; Undead sent bad options either. Depending on which side he plays, ofc.
---
Classic view and hard cap FPS to 15.
---
As a Warlock you will be expected to be a portal bitch in all group content. You will always have too expend soul shards, which are a bitch too farm, so the fat fucks in your group can rest on their laurels doing whatever before a dungeon. Not to mention these soul shards you'll need to generate on your own time by grinding mobs take up 1 bag slot each, so welcome to -1or2 bags so you can just play your class.
---
original
---
some detective always called you out too but by then everyone’s focused on corpse runs and resting to really care unless you were doing it constantly.
---
I agree.  It's great to see all of the action at once and predict how things are going to go.  It's a lot of fun to keep your mates alive also.
---
If I weren't dead set on rolling warrior it would definitely be a healer for me.
---
Whats the difference between those buttons? I am still using my name from back then. And i still like it.
---
Hunter feign death - trap ?
---
Will be the pre-cata version of Azeroth so yes stuff like missing geometry between zones etc will be there.
---
Yeah thats great use! Sucks that traps can only be placed out of combat. But it makes sense.
---
When did DPS Warriors become a thing?    
---
Just out of curiosity was wondering when Blizzard made it so Healer and Tank classes were able to have DPS builds.    
---
In Vanilla if you rolled a Warrior or Priest you were set for life as a Tank or Healer right?
---
Any hunter experts (pvp) wanna educate me? Hunter is by far the class I know the least about in pvp, so my question is: How is the hunter matchup spread in world pvp, both during leveling and at max level? What classes are hard, which ones are easy, and any general info you wanna share.
---
Blizz's favorite class is warrior followed by a mage.
---
Mages duel a friend who is low on hp then polymorph him to regen health fast. 
---
Hunter FD + Goblin jumper cables to attempt to resurrect a party member. 
---
Hunter scare beast works on Druids in shapeshift form.
---
Priests can levitate over water so they don’t have to swim (great for Buru fight in AQ 20.)
---
Just some off the top of my head
---
Loved this dungeon, sure first time you were there you got lost. Probably happened 2nd and 3rd time too. But the atmosphere and style of the place was so well made. It felt like an actual rpg dungeon run should. Can't wait to run this again in all it's un-simplified glory.
---
DM is deadmines. 
---
DM:&lt;insert wing here&gt; is dire maul.
---
These are all great!
---
That I dislike, they moved Juno to the comics =/
---
use current online name which happens to be your past vanilla character's name (and of retail tbh)!
---
Rolled a warlock based purely on the undead lock in this cinematic. The feels I still get watching this today..
---
i will also like to know the name if possible :)
---
I was a Holy Paladin in TBC-Cataclysm, I am a helpfull person (studying to become a lawyer and working parttime at a webdevelopment helpdesk)😂
---
June 25th or July 2nd.  Blizzard like to do releases to interfere with their competitors and FFXIV's Shadowbringers expansion's early access is the 28th, official release on the 2nd as well IIRC.
---
It was on Illidan actually
---
Wow really was made before its time. Imagine wow again without all these halts because of lack of technology at the time
---
Generally speaking, how much stronger is T3 compared to the epic PvP set? If someone in full PvP gear would fight a full T3 equipped player, how big of a deal would be the gear difference? Obviously the outcome depends on a lot of other things, but I just want to know if the PvP geared player would have a disadvantage.
---
Speaking of which, what is a good website to get Classic news?    
---
Thottbot?
---
Hunter weapon damage is fucking weird. Slower weapons factor in more rap so they end up being better. It's such a huge difference that CSC is almost as good as Rhok. Also weapon skill means very little for ranged because no glancing blows.
---
As for talents a 2/31/18 spec is better until you have +8-9 hit from items alone.
---
I cannot wait to lvl up my character again.    
---
The biggest thing I hate about retail is that it seems like it's all about the end game. Why even have lvling anymore when you can lvl to max in a few weeks.
---
Ah! It was the exact same thing on frostmourne, this was on the midnight launch too :)
---
It was very common in vanilla in my experience on Tichondrius; what server did you play on?  I rolled need on boes regularly and no one ever called me a ninja.
---
If the group specifies loot rules at the start of the run and you don't like them, find a different group.  If no rules are specified and you have a strong preference but don't bring it up until after a boe drops, don't get mad if people don't automatically agree with you.  
---
It's a total non-issue if people communicate.
---
Neputius. I do not think so.
---
Just play your gnome mage when you are alone and the alt dwarf priest with her. Let her pick the class she's most interested in, you have no choice in that. She has to play what she thinks is fun and looks cool. You can give her some general info on what the class does on endgame, but you might not even get there. Just let her be free and have fun, and dedicate the dwarf alt for playing just with her. Maybe it'll ding 60 before the gnome, who knows? Regardless, you can heal her all the way.
---
So did mine, I was a lolret.
---
Elemental has awful mana problems, if you wanted to PvE as a shammy with any mind to competitiveness you were a healer.
---
You stole my comment!
---
Anyone notice that the tanks head seems to be tracking correctly whereas all the others seem as they do in the game.
---
Every class has a viable spec, it might not be the role you want but each has their niche, choose your class and role wisely.
---
Deadmines has relevance in 1 Local chat and is level depending but seeing a lvl 60 asking for lfm or lfg DM you know it is for dire maul
---
Mage can amplify magic the tank so he receives more healing if you know that he won't be receiving that much magic damge.
---
Paladins can put Blessing of Sacrifice on a friendly target, so if the Pally gets sheeped or blinded while their friend takes damage, the transfered damage will break the CC.
---
When a raid member accidentally pulls something, a Paladin can use Divine Intervention to pull him out of the fight, so the mobs will run back, potentially saving the raid from a wipe.
---
Warlock pets always walk to your left, so you can walk backwards if you don't want your pet to pull a mob while hugging a wall.
---
This is a tough choice. I was on a medium pop pve server and it was a fun time. I would rather be on a high pop server and I'm not sure yet if I will like pvp. I will try PVP this time and see how it goes.
---
That Paladin one with BoS is clutch! I wish I had that sort of reaction time ahah!
---
A personal question, what do you do now?    
---
Did your experience as a GM at Blizzard open up opportunities to the career you have now?
---
I am guessing that you are referring to streamers? If so, I hope that it will be known before the launch on where those guys will play. Just out of curiosity, are these gentlemen from EU or US?
---
depends on your definition of clever, some of these posts are the equivalent of "this healing spell can save the tank from dying if you heal him when he needs healing from a healing heal spell of healing."
---
Which is a good thing.
---
It was bit too much in vanilla. 
---
They are getting it right
---
If you're just soloing in a BG they have their niche, organised pvp it gets harder to justify taking an enhancement shaman over elemental as they can do decent burst, support and being ranged.
---
&gt;dwavish and windfury in same sentence
---
I think that casting windfury totem then immediately dropping grace of air is clever af. Things along those lines are huge.
---
I'm telling you, this shit goes deep. It's been a setup from the start, and the Hydraxian Waterlords are in on it.
---
I'm an enhancement, and I hope I have you for that SM run.  Ima need roll up and fucking down.  Then when you cry like a bitch to ORG, the whole town can rejoice on who to avoid.   Almost every Hunter I know nabs the bastards too, enjoy that.
---
Just make sure you charge them for food/water/portals and it takes the edge off.
---
Whenever ironfoe procs it forces you to speak in dwarvish for a couple seconds.
---
But you get to wear such a beautiful blue dress.
---
a 2070 is more graphics processing power than was used to create vanilla wow, nevermind run it. raiding fps is bottlenecked by 1) your cpu, 2) network infrastructure, 3) spaghetti code
---
I actually liked naxx in wotlk more. For me it was always this great mystical raid I have never seen from the inside and somehow it reminded me also about karazhan because it was the start into a new expansion. Ulduar was great when it comes to mechanics but the lore wasn‘t my cup of tea. Still liked it (:
---
The PvE rotation for a hunter is to have a Nightfall and spam wing clip.
---
I play a little bit hots but I only play wow characters like thrall and jaina to get into the mood for classic :P
---
But when you did get back home and start playing WoW in your air conditioned room... it was glorious. All the pain and grind in real life made playing WoW that much sweeter.
---
Lee-eeee-rooooo-y
---
We had hunters that misdirected other dps so they had to slow down and not get agro, gotta find them ways to get to the top of the charts!
---
1g/stack
---
Agreed, there just aren't many "unexpected/unintended" mechanics me thinks, would be happy to be proven wrong as it is one of my favorite parts of games from halo 1, pubg, warhammer tabletop, starcraft/warcraft, half-life 2, and probably others. Those are the kind of mechanics or tricks that add personality to the game.
---
Mage shatter combo being a part of the game due to lag and becoming a balance feature is a good example.
---
It's not just for classic wow.
---
&gt;dw arms
---
But why?
---
the scrolls won't stack with the "real thing" so stam scroll won't stack with priest buff, etc. It sucks that thorns isn't a 30 min buffs or I would probably prioritize it over most of this list, PS playing has shown me just how good those on-hit dmg abilities can be.
---
Thunderfury
---
Did the Imp say "Lets do this!"
---
That's exactly it. The soul shards are of course a nuisance in PvE and general world content, but it looks outright unplayable in a BG premade situation with short queues.
---
Of course, those are all good reasons. But all worthless to a blizzard specced mage, I wasn't even disagreeing with you for the record.
---
Think he meant it was untouched and aimed towards Kul'Tiras, Zandalar, and broken isles.
---
Arms while leveling. Fury at endgame.
---
shit, I forgot about that. my bad
---
I did it together with two Friends that were holy priest and combat Rogue. We three-manned all the instances and it was the most fun I had in My wow career. Mostly playing rested and mostly duoing outdoor content with the priest. I think we played many dungeons several times too. I remember being flag carrier in warsong gulch a lot during levelling. This was My first character that I played all the way to 60. I definetly had No hurry to level as I assumed that the game would be more or less over when we reached max level.
---
Killing things on your own as prot when you are 45+ is really not recommended, it takes forever.
---
The reason for my pick was of course that we made a team from the start and I was the tank so I went full prot to level 40 before I even consider something else. 
---
I remember lots of grueling fights in Lbrs and brd that came down to the priest scraping together some mana regen to save the day as the fights took so long.
---
okay you caught me, you gained a small advantage in that your frostbolts could cancel out the effect of a single heal over time. /rollseyes
---
Disagreeing with me on this point as if we don't have side by side comparisons of what a mage in BWL gear could do to your hp in 4 seconds compared to a mage at 70 who didn't use icelance is just absurd.
---
Thinking about that too mate, but desolace will be full of hordes no? Im ally
---
I wonder, do you actually need to take the IF flight path? On private servers at the moment, if you play a dwarf or a gnome you know it automatically. I always just rush level 1 to the ne starting area personally, you don't need skinning that early.
---
No-one ever does a full dire maul run of all wings. If someone says DM they mean deadmines. If they're doing dire maul they'll say DM:N or DM tribute etc.
---
Fury Warrior kinda is.
---
Fpr healer classes you sre right. If you can heal, you will (if you want to play the optimal spec).
---
Warriors are, on the contrary, top of the line DPS in fury as well as the best tanks. They also slay ass in PvP as arms.
---
The other exceptions are Shadow priest for 1v1 PvP, and alliance druid gor feral tanking (which is also very doable, despite what other people tell you). Shaman elemental is also a pretty fun (though not really cost effective) PvP spec.
---
ay I got it right.
---
Tbh i really like the robe + mace&amp;shield look haha
---
It's those awful shoulders that I refuse to wear, i dont care if they have 500 +healing and 100mp5 I'm not wearing them
---
Why would undead be good?
---
Depends on what you want to do. For optimal speed to 60, skip progressions. For optimal money+speed, you want skinning and mining /herbalism.
---
but the auras dont stack, unless you spread the huntards out for melee classes, but i dont remember if it worked that way.
---
Yup
---
We can do it, wait for the real thing
---
It satisfies a certain OCD. Getting a perfect heal (topped off target with no overheals) is a great feeling.
---
Why would you keep mining and not herbalism? It's better money than mining for sure and Eng mats are cheap.
---
The quests should auto-track when you initiate completing them (like when you kill the first mob or collect one of the quest items).
---
I believe shift-right clicking was the only option to auto-loot back vanilla but they may add an option for Classic, since the interface menu will likely be slightly upgraded.
---
Balance/Resto but yea.
---
Druid might need to pull some tanking duty as well.
---
Because many on this sub says that eng is better for pvp/pve
---
Check out "Skarm Tank" on YouTube. Major resources on Warriors and Feral tanks.
---
You run 2h Fury in that case and abuse hamstring to fish for wind fury procs between bloodthirst and ww.
---
Your can’t raid as arms because MS uses a Debuff slot.
---
Shots fired shots fired
---
Don't play priest. Finding groups will be as easy as it is on retail.
---
And you play vanilla for different dificulty mode than retail.
---
I used improved thorns when I levelled my druid. It was surprisingly good, especially considering the otherwise low damage of a resto druid. though i did switch over somewhere between 30-40 to a feral build.
---
Will of the forsaken!
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they remove it from the loot table all together in the earlier stages as to avoid confusion and just add it in its 1.12 form at a later date.
---
I know it's not true to vanilla, but this is what I would prefer. I think progressive itemization gets a bit confusing for most players that aren't super educated about the foreseeable changes. How frustrating would it be to vendor it just to find out a few months later that it was gonna become OP.
---
Do you think anyone would miss the original chest piece?
---
The demo had auto loot as an option but we'll have to see in beta
---
Trees won't have tops cause you are not to see them  xD
---
Fury Warriors get use out of that strength on there. Fury prio lol.
---
I will be the thorn in your vale.
---
(if you play alliance)
---
Sounds like you know a lot of beta cucks, trapped in relationships they shouldn't be in but are too weak and insecure to get out off. Relationships are a blessing where each one of the two puts themselves first, but does everything they can to support, care for and love their partner.
---
Your family and friends don't sound like the kind of people I'd surround myself with bucko.
---
I guess we will find out within the next year or so (hopefully)
---
I'm not quite sure warriors need a fourth fear break though, do they?
---
Dynamite and Sapper Charges do major damage to trash packs / group bosses. The chicken is also good. 
---
For tanks, the Eng shield is also super important.
---
Haha my bad, too lazy to move a screenie onto my phone
---
Well, not in the first 40 Levels. :P
---
I’m stuck between Warlock, Warrior, Mage or Rogue...
---
Can you help me by listing bad/annoying stuff about these classes, or convince me to play one of them because of X good things?
---
Can't hurt.
---
I did 3 hours on populated realm as troll WARRIOR, using Joanas guide AMD skilling mining. 3 hours is super slow for a hunter without professions.
---
I DPS’d as a hunter for 6-7 yrs, enjoyed it, but it was easy raising as a DSP. Tanks and healers have it much harder. 
---
I levelled a resto shammy and loved it, it was fun in raids and fun in PvP. AV weekends as a resto was brilliant!! 
---
This time I am starting my main as a shammy and going full resto at 57.
---
Its gonna be the same, the purest were angry about the graphic setting changes just imagine if they changed how the world look
---
Lobstaknob will work.
---
Slower weapons were better back in vanilla. The crossbow from BWL was the dogs bollocks even in PVP.
---
It's a BRD drop. It's not on a weekly lockout. Anyone can farm it.
---
I will probably play horde, but I think bear druid maybe with imp thorns, combine with a paladin using ret aura can be a tier 1 leveling duo. The paladin heals, at lvl 20 they drop consecration, at lvl 30 they respec to blessing of sanc and the druid is basically invincible from there on out, spam swipe to prevent forest fires.
---
Never rolled a warrior in classic. I definitely dig melee over casters. I prefer DPS over tank or healing just because of a slightly more casual play style. With a more lenient view on PVE Dps warriors this time around its definitely something I'm considering. Currently deciding between:
---
Enhancement Shaman (Orc) 
---
Rogue (Undead/ Human) 
---
Arms/Fury Warrior (Orc/Human)
---
Any suggestions?
---
Nah, TFT was ass compared to RoC.  In fact, TFT was an excellent analog to WotLK, because the same design philosophy drove it -- take an excellent game and then dumb the strategy down to make it more palatable for the average gamer.  Gone were the days of high micro hero pushes while teching, instead every just made tons of T1 units and the counters were all super hard counters.  RoC had more playstyles available and skill mattered even if you made the correct counter to your opponent's army.  Like yeah, gargs beat wyvs, but if the orc player has way better micro, those wyvs \*can\* beat gargs.  TFT was far more "make the correct unit and attack move" than it was "dance units ftw".
---
TFT is retail WoW, RoC is Vanilla/TBC.  Flavor wise, TFT was awesome, but gameplay wise, it was just an inferior game to the original RoC.  Which again, great parallel to WotLK, which had the best storyline (Gates and Battle for UC overtook the Tirion Fordring quest line as my favorite flavor in the game) but shitty, easy gameplay meant for mouthbreathers.
---
From my understanding classic will use the legion client which has different needs in terms of pc specs. Meanwhile the classic graphic option shouldn't be too power hungry.
---
I will be using the Classic graphics setting initially. I will switch to the updated graphics when I have had enough low res nostalgia.
---
The Warlock Classic discord pvp channel might know.
---
Black Flag was a marvel of gaming for me, it took the base AC game and added something completely different to it, ships. Handling them, having a crew, upgrading it, naval combat and it was all glorious.
---
I still believe up to this day that the naval combat in Black Flag is one of the best any game has to offer. Even games themed around ships or pirates have less to offer than Black Flag's naval system.
---
I stopped playing after that, I already wanted to stop after AC3 because the game was very mediocre. Despite a very good concept it was very boring and bland.
---
Defensive stance alone is 10%, base block is at least 5%, armour from shield is probably 4-5%.
---
That's just the base.
---
“Free level 60 mount”
---
He wishes lol. The amount of mats and even in-quest fees is not saving anything
---
How the hell has no one linked Cranius' song in the 13 hours your comment has been up?

---
&gt; When did DPS Warriors become a thing?
---
The moment warriors were added into the game.
---
A lot of great trio's in the posts and I agree with most of them, to add to the list, Dragon Age 1,2,3. (yes please bash the love for DA2)
---
Why 60? You can solo devilsaurs at 54.
---
What is the mountain skip?
---
I remember the patch this weather thing came in, and it was awesome!
---
Okay, so it sucked, but you've barely played it? Got it.
---
No. Assuming all of the quest rep values are correct in the classic databases (some of which I've been able to confirm through the way back machine) and there isn't "spillover", it's not possible until early/mid 40s without help. 
---
Using a classic wow database, an excel spreadsheet and a bigger PServer (rhymes with... heightstinger?), I was able to confirm this. 
---
As a Human, I did EVERY available quest that gave Darnassus rep including chains like the ones in Duskwood and Alterac that give +Alliance rep and I was still short at 40. 
---
If I remember correctly, there are ZERO quests that specifically give Darnassus rep after a small chain in Desoclace until you get to Feralas. 
---
Once I was able to get into Feralas, I finally got exalted at 44.
---
Oooh bad/annoying is my speciality
---
*Warlock*
---
* soulshards are annoying, take up bag space for no reason
---
* has no way at all of getting +hit from talents for destro spells
---
* has aggro problems in raids
---
* has no movement abilities and only has fear for a CC (which has many counters) - no, CoEx doesn't count
---
*Warrior*
---
* constantly being asked to tank stuff
---
* is good at tanking/DPS/PVP but can only spec and gear one at a time making it very expensive and time consuming if you want to do multiple things
---
* has literally 0 sustain solo (bloodthirst lol?)
---
* free honor during levelling pvp
---
*Mage*
---
* I hope you really like casting frostbolt
---
* I hope you like stopping to drink
---
* getting soloed by a BM hunter pet while levelling
---
* getting asked for water constantly, and then complaints that you don't have highest level water
---
*Rogue*
---
* feeling completely useless when your CDs are down
---
* wondering if it's all worth it the first 25 levels of the game
---
* killing warlock/priest/warrior/druid but dying to DoTs with no way to heal yourself
---
* being complained about that you joined the BG/Dungeon/Raid even though they already have 2 rogues and need a useful class
---
* keeping up with warriors the whole fight in a raid and then they get to deathwish/reck/execute spam and leave all the rogues in the dust
---
It isn't really a maze though...
---
Sunken temple has four levels. First you go down the right-most stairwell and pre-clear the trash inside the water (not at the candles). Then you go back up to the entrance hall. From the entrance hall you go down the second stairwell on the right and there you just kill everything. After killing everything you activate the statues in order (check atlasloot or google). Then you jump down and kill the boss that spawned. From there you go back up to the entrance hall.  
---
Now take the second staircase on the left all the way up. Kill everything there. Every time there is a way down you go down one section of stairs to kill some mini-bosses. Once all of those are dead you either jump to the dragons OR you go back down a flight of stairs to the entrance hall, then take the left-most flight of stairs up to the dragons. Kill all the dragons, then kill all the bosses. Make sure the trash dragons are dead before you attack Eranikus (dragon ghost).
---
Problem with that one is totems cost a fair bit of mana so switching the air totem every ~7 second is only useful if there's no better use for your mana.
---
you start with your capitals flight path, you don't need to take it.

What makes you so sure they're inflating the rep? I've been able to confirm through the way back machine that the rep values on the largest current vanilla PServer are, for the most part, correct. Some were off, but I submitted tickets to get them updated and, if I remember correctly, all of them were because they were missing a faction for multiple faction rep gains.
---
Some reason I had it in my head that he wanted to go alliance.
---
&gt; how common or possible would it be to swap out multiple pieces of gear (in addition to your trinkets) during feign death to make up for the loss of 2% hit chance. 
---
It worked on private servers at least, I used to do this.
---
It's honestly a huge benefit to all classes.
---
A healing class is mana-locked, healing just means you'll be drinking more often.
---
Private server has 15k people online at the same time. Server cap in vanilla was around 3k. Math.
---
You're not wrong, I replaced this shield super quickly but was sad to let it go
---
Most guilds in PvP psevers don't use summons because they can lose their buffs to ganking. Instead they meet up in the nearest town and get to the raid entrance together.
---
Agreed, and hope for a future 1.13 Patches with class balance, karazhan, grim batol, mount hyjal, everything in azeroth with vanila game design. Don't screw with sistems just add content ffs
---
I still have the same name.
---
Assumding they don't fix it, near Gnomer is a path that you can easily walk up (no wall jumping needed) and it leads you to an unfinished area. You jump off the cliff, die, and spawn in Menethil. You skip the wetlands deathrun.
---
Its kinda hard to guess how a word is pronounced when English is not your first language and people keep coming up with weird names.
---
Yeah gathering the mobs as they spawn each wave can suck. I remember having to nuke down the rogue-like npc and cc/focus the healing mob. If your group was well coordinated it wasn’t as bad but I remember trying to pug it and wiping on the last wave before the second boss too many times.
---
To be fair though, D3 wasn't horrible... he auction house was what made it horrible ;)  
---
But ultimately I have to agree that PoE is the true successor to the genre.
---
It's more efficient at 60. You waste maybe a day getting from 54-60 and then farm for a week or you start maybe a day earlier and farm inefficiently for a week.
---
You can play the whole game without them. Cooking is just to save some money when you get far enough into raiding that consumables are demanded.
---
Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, Final Doom
---
Carnivurous armor no?
---
It's worth noting that you should pick up cooking and herb/alch (even if temporarily). There are two Dolonaar quests: Recipe of the Kaldorei and Elixers for the Bladeleafs that require Cooking(1) and Alchemy(20) respectively to complete. They're worth 500 Darn rep.
---
I'm gonna be an alchemist. Stocking up on Potions is going to be profitable to every raid release.
---
leveling in holy is self-harm
---
&gt;What would she play?
---
Have her read a bit about every class and pick what she feels suits her. 
---
&gt;What would I main and alt now?
---
Whatever compliments her class.
---
&gt;Server type?
---
PvE unless you enjoy being ganked.
---
&gt;How to juggle real life balance. (her personality is the kind where if she is interested in something that's all she wants to do. We can't read books together because she is compelled to keep reading when I'm gone)
---
Scheduling.
---
The drakedog replies when op says orc lol
---
There is simply no build for a DPS Warrior that is good for both PvP and PvE.
---
Warriors have many advantages but one of their disadvantages is that their specs are unflexible. It is such a great class but their talent tree is just really badly designed.
---
Moar dots
---
Your name is enough to discredit your reply on a  dead post.
---
/r/lastimages
---
Yeah you win the thread, you mad badger
---
It’s a good spec but not against Mages because it’s a hard counter. Try to cast anything and you will get locked for 10 seconds. So for 10 seconds you can’t do any damage, healing, earth shock, or even grounding totem. 10 seconds is more than enough for a Mage to slay you.
---
That's not true, there are different lines of evidence showing that real vanilla had lower armor values than pservers. 
---
Also scripted mechanics are known from strategy guides and videos from the time, and they are generally tuned harder on pservers too.
---
Finally, just because it's different doesn't *automatically* mean it's easier. In fact, why would you err on the side of easier than harder for cases that are not clear? Doesn't even make sense.
---
But this is Holy DPS. And I'll at least try.
---
If you dont care for tanking or healing go with Rogue. Rogue is a complete and pure DPS class, there is never a misunderstanding what a Rogue can do. They are very valuable if played well. Also they are very straightforward to gear up as opposed to enh shamans and warriors.
---
imo use your old name as it will most likely feel like logging into your old char down the line, and mine isnt too bad either so there is no way im gonna use my current nick in WoW lol. Would probably get banned
---
There were no dungeon maps in Vanilla
---
That’s because you’re a really bad Mage. But any decent Mage will beat a shaman because it’s a hardcounter.
---
Just FYI, you’ll be just as fine healing dungeons as shadow up until 50 without noticing any major difference. Questing will be much slower in a holy build though, keep that in mind.
---
I only DPSed for a long time and never really thought i would enjoy healing, but when I did give it a real shot, I really really enjoyed it. It is just kind of a whole other experience, where dps is mostly a set order you have to prioritize and kind of the same at every boss, healing is never the same. It is a constant braintest of what is most efficient to use, and using strong cooldowns at the right time and if you use em inefficiently you may wipe the raid cause you needed it later on.
---
I just felt like you could make more of an individual difference as a healer, if you had good enough healers in the later patches going with 1 or even 2 less healers for a boss could be enough to kill it.
---
I never healed in classic, but im gonna give it a shot this time, I hope I like it, but am also a bit worried that it feels less important and a bit boring, as you have very limited ammount of heals, CDs and so on and 40 man raids are way way different from 20 man.
---
Yes the naxx gear is a decent step up from Rank 13 gear. Basically MC gear is lvl 65 and end game Naxx gear is lvl 90 and so every epic is somewhere between that. Epic pvp gear is basically around high level BWL - mid AQ gear, so it's good but definitely gets outclassed in Naxx.  
---
It does depend on the exact class and spec whether they even want to wear their tier set or 2.5 set or pvp set or just random drops.
---
I know, I played Shadow Priest back in the day. I just want to try something different.
---
I shame indeed, but no can do.
---
Part of me is glad that there is still time till classic is out, because i still haven't decided which one to pick. 
---
But instead of just dps and other stuff that warrior does, paladin can heal really well so there is that.
---
For some reason i feel that im drawn to warrior more.
---
It just isnt possible in Vanilla by level 40.
---
The only way to get enough rep for cross exalted factions is through Runecloth turn ins or AQ event turn ins.
---
There simply isn't enough rep gain from quests.
---
Same boat here, love my UD mage. But mine was female, I cant stand the Male prep cast animation.
---
"I am so much better than everyone else"
---
how are you supposed to kite 5+ mobs unless you can utilize the terrain as a hunter, you have no AoE slow like shaman except ice trap which cant be used in combat. If you can utililize terrain it's easy as all you need to do is run in a circle with cheetah, multi shot to keep aggro and keep serping sting up on all
---
well if we're talking about an optimal guild you won't have that many hunters, yes in a situation where every physical group has a hunter and there's an extra one then survival would be better but most guilds won't have that many
---
Didnt they use to post in game screenshots submitted by player? And do like a fam art competition thing?
---
Vermintide 2 is fantastic, I recommend it if you can get it on sale. I'll be playing it on and off even after  classic releases, it's that good.
---
With the warrior talent revamp when BWL came out, so very early on in the scheme of things. They got new bloodthirst which gave fury an instant attack, and people tried out dps warrior in BWL and it was obvious it was really good (nef part 1 is a long cleave fight which is made for warrior dps). Soon people realised the key was stacking tons of hit and lionheart helm/titanic leggings builds became really popular and it just became 'normal'. Not all guilds had dps warriors, you never really 'needed' them, but for the whole last year of vanilla it was definitely a mainstream meta spec.
---
Man I hope (if they do public beta) that they spam infernals to kill everyone/destroy everything when it ends again!

---
Tbh, you can't have enough processingpower for world events (given if they won't use sharding for that). I can imagine that city raids, Hillsbrad, and the opening of the gates of AQ will still be very heavy. Then again the game will use the current engine that can leverage DX12, and last year's multithreading optimization was a big deal.
---
Haha yep, probably 2-3 servers for us! One of each type, maybe an extra pvp if demand is there? I reckon that they might not even bother with an pve-rp
---
Nah, it's just a bunch of memes. Anonymity begets animosity, so you get a bunch of e-thugs and edgelords as well.
---
always thought the Belfs with the weird 70's or 80's style hair you would see on tv was so weird. It's like the show hairspray.
---
Thank you so much!!!
---
For the past 3 weeks I’ve been debating engineer or alchemy for my hunter, after seeing this u finally decided alchemy!
---
I was gonna craft the rifles before MC and a few other things but didn’t know they were world drops, that confirms I’d rather do alchemy.
---
Great work :)
---
Why? The OP is a survivor! Doing whatever it takes.
---
I really want to make elemental shaman work. I won't be joining any hardcore raiding guild, probably just some casual raids once or twice a week. Healed through all of vanilla and played a bit of elemental in BC and WOTLK. I realise it was WAY better post BC but I think I can make it work with the correct consumables and itemization.  Having grace of air in your ranged DPS group isn't half bad either.
---
Yep. In proper 40-man raids you only have to summon the fuck-ups and the unlucky ones. The whole raid is travelling together in force after popping the ony world buff, so there is no need to summon. And a proper raid will have 4+ warlocks for the curses either way, so you should easily have enough shards for two rounds of HS for the entire raid and SS + pets (sacrifice lock) without occationally draining thrash. And that is if you bother giving them out to casters *and* they fuck up enough to have to use it instead of a demonic rune.
---
why would healers use healthstones rather than demonic runes?
---
Shaman can water walk too right
---
They said no rp servers at all didn't they? Doubt we will ever see one anyways , I've been trying to find a guild for weeks but realized with 2-3 servers it really shouldn't be hard once it goes live lol
---
Sorry. When I used to play I was constantly asked to Tank so I completely forgot that Arms and Fury were still viable in vanilla.
---
I just ended up playing hunter till Wotlk.
---
A shaman doesn't need to explain why he is healing. Purge, totem twisting and utility does speak for itself.
---
You can do it. Just find a guild (or make your own) that encourages offspecs as long as you can clear the content with normal specs.
---
Going to suck in MC as I remember it alot of the mobs are immune to nature/have high resist. Good thing you can still heal and act in a supporting role during trash clearing. Going to have alot of fun trying it I think.
---
Yo, you want a nice spec for both? 
---
Start with a fury pve build. Stack st/crit. But run a few pvp talents.
---
I ran 17/34/0.
---
Take piercing howl, improved intercept, and dual wield, run impale in the arms tree. You will be a mobile, aoe snaring, self healing, blender in pvp, an great damage in pve.
---
What you lack in ms or shield wall you make up with sustain an high consistent damage with good bleed dots.
---
Fortunately no
---
yeah that knowledge includes the fact that you don't bring deadweight to raid anymore
---
What makes you so sure they're inflating the reps?
---
As far as i remember, most quests gave 250 rep in   vanilla, which seems to be what most private servers give.
---
No worries. Your question just confused me a little bit.
---
Depends so much on your own goals, theres really no correct way. Personally im going to save all cloth to level first aid as painlesly as possible, leveling Herb/alchemy together when my toon is 60 😊
---
An alternative to using a sugar is just to aggro him and run away until he resets. Run up behind him as he walks home for a free deathblow.
---
Thanks for detailed explanation!
---
I remember all my friends telling me to heal or tank and I wasn't able to DPS as those classes so forget other Specs were even a thing in Vanilla.
---
The fact that everyone has to be at the same place (or places when ZG comes) minutes before the raid to grab said buffs pretty much guarantees that everyone will move together to the raid on every server. If you have someone lazy, stupid and selfish enough to think they can skip out on travelling to save buffs, and then think they can hold up the raid by wasting time and resources by being summoned when literally everyone else have to walk, they wont be part of any raid for long.
---
Expect the worst for wow classic, private servers are poor, wow classic may get changed, you just cannot know how it should be. To bad we cannot have vanilla back as it was, people have to put their fingers into it.
---
found the wrath baby
---
I’m not sure of the source (blue post or similar) but I think they do plan on releasing pve rp. There is multiple threads here about doing pvp-rp instead as it appears more popular depending on some census/poll data. I’m after a casual guild that maybe does raids at like 8:30-11pm Adelaide time. Not keen on pvp server as I don’t want to waste time dealing with/avoiding gankers.
---

---
My problem with the water is that water was opaque in vanilla.  It might be minor but you used to be able to get away with swimming in AB and not being seen.
---
Doesn't matter shit if you can choose your self.

Can I have a source for this?

Price of leathers very low so most people just vendor them and dont bother putting them on ah. Saw some people buying insane amounts of thick leather at launch but not sure what they were using it for

We actually have a word for this in Swedish: Brunka. We also have one for crying, pooping and masturbating at once too: Grätbrunka.
---
You probably spelled "rogue" as "rouge" too didn't you?
---
Sure, but both Taurens and trolls are better for warriors. And Orcs are miles ahead.
---
Why is that? You think the server pop will die?
---
Currently rolling one in a pserver.  Very fun
---
I was alliance pve since TBC I'm going horde PvP for a fresh game
---
I'm not sure that "what she wants" is a helpful answer to 1.  It's pretty easy to make bad choices with your first character so she should be guided towards something sensible.
---
The current plan of rogue/druid is excellent as you want to support her exploration/enjoyment.  I'd be careful of tanking in open world however as it's easy to fall into the trap of you leading and her following around instead of her having the agency critical to really falling in love with Azeroth.
---
I'd also still level at least the main I had planned anyway in case she stops.
---
I think you mean AQ. MC was the fire dungeon.

---
**Introduction:** If you're looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you're a PvE raider who's looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you're at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they're Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
**What we expect of members:**
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids.
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1.

**Dedicated PvE** ***with a social atmosphere***
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, **we may also try to vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**Raid Schedule**:

Wednesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 - 24:00 **CET**

 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**   
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.   
---
Contact Wolfie#2101 on discord for more information!

Fairly sure some of the elementals were nature immune, can't remember for sure.

That sounds fair, I suspect I will play around with both to see the difference a lot, at least initially.

I would recommend levelling a profession with the materials as in the short term that will benefit you the most. However if you save the materials you will be able to make a bit more money as prices will slowly rise, however it is hard to know what the demand for these resources will be. 
---
Most people will be trying very hard to pay for their mounts in the first instance, so gold may well be leaving the game at a fairly similar rate it is entering it. As if memory serves, I had only just made enough gold from quests / vendoring to buy it and might actually have been short.
---
So with this continuous drain on the gold for the first few months there won't be huge amounts floating around to spend on resources, and also with people being a bit more knowledgeable second time around they may just gather their own for levelling professions.
---
I get that this didn't really give you too much advice one way or the other, but what I will be doing in taking alchemy and herbalism gathering my own mats to level alchemy and then directly trading the potions I make with friends / guildies in exchange for gear and tailoring bags. Then any surplus may end up on the AH if there is any.
---
No reason to argue about a topic neither me nor you will accept the opposite mindset =)
---
Have fun in Classic :)

Wrath would be perfect if they removed dungeon finder and flying mounts (maybe make land mount up to 250% speed in northrend). On retail the over powered PVE trinkets were also a pain in the ass in PVP, but its less of an issue on pservers. Since we are talking about making changes to the original game, might as well add transmog, more toys, and mythic dungeons to wotlk. Those three are the only few things I liked about wow post Wrath.

Engineering is indeed very good. But mining is way worse than Herbalism. Just keep Herbalism and buy mats for Eng.
---
You don't have to focus on Pservers economy, it's quite different because of overpopulation. I remember well, when I was leveling in Vanilla \[Linen cloth\] cost something. Nowadays on pservers \[Linen cloth\] selling to vendors. 
---
However I don't think you have to keep your cheap low levels materials. The price will increase but not too much.
---
The fact someone felt a need to name this process has me curious. Is this a common event?
---
I don't think you remember TFT accurately. Suboptimal unit compositions are winning all the time in TFT and are more viable than they've ever been. The existence of the shop heightened micro to another level that was never possible in ROC. Staff of Sanctuary, Preservation, speed scroll, Healing Salve, clarity, Rod of Necromancy, etc. Neutral heroes and the Tavern (instant revive for huge resources), Marketplace, better items, towers not giving experience and not being able to creep to 6 (turtling was a massive issue in ROC), the list goes on.
---
TFT was a massive upgrade over ROC.

I remember back in the day this happened to me on my warrior countless times. I would try to kite the mob with hamstring, disarm, shield block, everything until my hp reach like 5% after killing the last one. Only then will I eat my precious food.

Never happened to me or anyone I know personally, so I don't think so.
---
I swear Blizzard, a company literally named after a fucking storm, has some weird aversion to weather effects. Even in BFA.. what the fuck happened to the new fancy weather? Only time I ever see it raining is when I hearth to the Inn by the docks, which immediately disappears when I walk outside.

**&lt;Credendum&gt;** **EU \[PvP\] | Alliance** *(PvP or maybe RP-PVP if they will be available)*
---
*Are you from Norway or Sweden? 25 or older? Busy life? Family? Children? Career? Then Credendum will be the perfect choice for you. A serious guild without any obligations.*
---
**Guild Information:** Credendum will be a place for veterans and vanilla virgins who’ve matured and found themselves with other pressing responsibilities. Drawbacks like you having to go ninja-AFK, failing to attend raids, going offline for a few weeks, having your baby crying in your microphone or other adult chores are all traits we expect, and accept. Welcome to a guild that works WoW around your life, and not the other way around. It doesn’t matter if you play for 6 or 60 hours a week, there's always a place for you here. There's no requirement to be hardcore in any way, we just want to build a solid community of mature individuals who all share a love for classic World of Warcraft. We probably won't push for server first kills, but instead aim to be the kind of guild that will clear everything in a slower, but steady pace that turns out to work best considering the schedule of our members. There will also be a signifcant amount of PvP with premade guild groups. Guild chat and discord language will be norwegian by default.
---
**What we expect from our members:** In Credendum, you are free to play whatever you want, the way you want it. We do however reserve the right to give the players with a more "hardcore" attitude towards raiding (the ones that always show up fully prepared with buffs and tons of consumables despite not being expected to do so) will be given priority for raid slots. This applies even if you're playing one of the specs that are considered unoptimal, like Retribution Paladins, Balance or Feral Druids and so on.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Will be decided as soon as we have a sufficient raiding roster available at max level.

Or, if only the dps wasn't so shit and attacking before the tank has enough threat. 
---
That's why I play druids and pallies. So I can do all three!
---
During leveling, Hunter is easy and slays. Just use the BM cooldowns and tell your pet to attack. He will probably kill 1 or 2 guys by himself.
---
At max you still murder clothies, but you need to be pretty good at your traps, slows, kiting to kill anyone who knows about your dead-zone.

If something drops, and someone gets a real upgrade from it, they should be able to roll Need on it without competition from people who would just sell it. It doesn't matter whether it is BoE or BoP. Selling an item is always a Greed roll, anything else is ninjaing.

As a guild we are not in a rush getting to 60 and would like our members to take their time getting to 60 and enjoy the content leading to max level - We have plenty of time to raid and will start gearing up our members as they reach the level cap.
---
We expect those who are looking to raid to read up on information regarding the bosses inside the raid we plan on clearing that night and to also have their own consumables ready to go for raid night.

---
Okay ! Mats are that cheap ? If herbalism makes more than the cost of mats yes good ideas ! Thx

About us: 
---
Mok’ra! &lt;Guild&gt; is recruiting new members to join our core group of players in the upcoming Classic WoW. Our team has experienced members spanning across WoW’s timeline and we are looking for enthusiastic players to join us and create a tight-knit raiding community. Becoming part of &lt;Guild&gt; is an opportunity to play with others who share your passion for vanilla and want to be involved in the raiding scene. We’re also rolling up on a PvP server, despite our PvE goals. You might think that you’d rather roll on a filthy PvE server to do PvE, but in the words of a man far wiser than any of us, 
---
                                                         You think you do, but you don’t.
---
Our Goals: 
---
- Upon the launch of Classic, we’ll be aiming to hit level 60 within a couple of months and start gearing up in dungeons. We understand this won’t be possible for everyone, so we will be lenient on this, and help people out where we can. However, we do expect people to be levelling regularly and making progress consistently, even if this is a little slower than ideal.  
---
- We are planning on progressing through the end-game dungeons, then jumping into Molten Core and going from there, doing raids as they come. 
---
- We aim to try our best and clear as much vanilla content as possible. The most important part is having fun, but also working as a team. It’s rarely “That one guys” fault every time and we will openly communicate to improve our strategy.
---
Expectations:
---
- A willingness to learn and do your best. 
---
- Actually showing up! 
---
- Putting in the effort to have what you need and turning up prepared. This is really important to ensure nobody is wasting the rest of the player’s time.
---
Schedule: 
---
- We will be raiding two days a week
---
- The specific days will be chosen closer to release. 
---
- Times will be 7:00- 11:00PM and include a break for 10 minutes at 9:00PM to keep everyone at their best. All times are GMT.
---
We will be using Discord as our recruitment platform pre-release and as a communication hub throughout the game.  Feel free to PM the Guild Leader (Orinus#1430) or Recruitment Officer (Trauzek#7247) for any queries and join our discord server: https://discord.gg/FSAPUTP

You do know that the Dwarven hand cannon is a world drop, right ?
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**​Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) or simply apply at [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/)
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.

it will if you rebind right click too shoot
---
Except thick leather, can make level 51 gear and DE into eternal essences and illusion dust.
---
I heavily suggest ackis recipe list - if there will be a classic version
---
Lots of honor at 40 this way
---
On your private server, spillover rep is not used, but other private servers do implement spillover rep to varying degrees. More importantly, the demo released last year was verified to have spillover rep, so hopefully that will stay in place.
---
However, if reputation values turn out to be lower than expected when Classic comes out, you’re going to need a much more involved plan than just completing every Darnassus quest. Assuming spillover rep is in effect, you’ll want to complete every single city faction quest for all four factions at the appropriate level to get the most possible Darnassus rep from Darnassus quests as well as spillover rep from quests for the other three factions.
---
I am painstakingly developing a step-by-step quest completionist guide for that very purpose (currently complete through level 31) which can be found here: https://shadowpanther.net
---
I was Elarrion back then and I still am!
---
We dont just accept anyone on the dark side ;)
---
I think it depends on the class/situation. Can we really say that warlocks spamming shadow bolt and nothing else in PVE to top dps Meyer’s was good class design? Or mage spam, or hunter steady shot macro spam.
---
That said, my favourite class (the prot warr) had it’s best design iteration in TBC. I really enjoyed the struggle for AoE aggro and I HATED the change of shield block from 5s to. 1min CD. For me the warrior fantasy is spamming buttons to consume my endless rage, and having shield block off the GCD and needing to be pressed constantly along with heroic strike and your GCD abilities was just heaven.

Probably a lot of people will be 60 within days, don't underestimate how many people can't wait to get that sweet sweet vanilla endgame in their mouth asap.
---
&gt; during raids you'll have to stop halfway through and you and all the other Warlocks have to teleport out of the raid to go farm 40+ soul shards while everyone else waits. This is because Blizzard chose to remove XP gains from the trash inside raids so you can't Drain Soul them. And to add insult to injury, the Dragonkin outside Onyxia's lair are all lvl 40's, so they'll be grey to a lvl 60. And there aren't enough mobs outside of Blackrock to go around for more than 1 Warlock.
---
What? That is just blatantly not true. I cant recall being in a raid where warlocks couldnt farm thrash for shards from vanilla up to wotlk at least. Besides, even if they did have to go farm shards, why the fuck wouldnt they drain the same mobs? Drain soul isnt an exclusive thing, every warlock that cast drain soul gets a shard as long as they are in the same group/raid.
---
Imp. drain soul is also a fucking bad raiding talent. Its barely passable for leveling, where you only have one pet vying for the last hit (if you dont chain mobs), and not 29 others /w pets. Imp. LT is better in both instances because of how it works.
---
But 600g is less than the cost of a normal epic mount...!
---
Ermm, classic is not out next month, so...
---
If you get to 60 fast enough you can farm the end game crafting mats and make enough money to for your epic mount and consumes for many raids.

YFW everyone does this and no one to gank
---
I'm rolling a dwarf rogue to gank every single undead (especially rogues) I'll come across.
---
Smite builds are a thing :D definitely off meta tho
---
Question: have fans ever made a HL 3 mod of sorts? Steam games are often one of the most modded out there.
---
I'd expect people to prefer the water that matches their experience with the game. The newer high quality water is the post-cataclysm experience.
---
I'm fairly certain just fire immune/resisted
---
Probably, only silk is worth saving.

\*\*&lt;CREW&gt; - EU – Horde - PvP Server – Mediumcore Raiding Guild - English\*\*
---
\*\*Introduction\*\*
---
CREW is a fresh guild preparing for Classic release, which means new members will be able to help shape the guild moving forward. It will be a casual/mediumcore raiding guild on a PvP server with a relaxing and friendly atmosphere.
---
We currently have 49 dedicated members, most of which want to raid. For raiding, we are currently ONLY looking for: Hunter, Resto Shaman, Rogue.   
---
We are also absolutely looking for socials/non-raiders!   
---
\*\*Goals\*\*
---
\* Our overarching goal is that we want to create a relaxed environment where we can have fun and challenge ourselves. WoW is about having fun, and we want Classic to be as fun as possible.
---
\* We want to see all of what Classic has to offer at our own pace. 
---
\* We want time to experience the leveling process (1-3 months). 
---
\* We want to be a part of the server community and experience World PvP, and hope to bond and form rivalries with other guilds on the server. 
---
\* We want to strike a middle ground between the casual and semi-hardcore raiding. We want to clear raids in our own decent pace.
---
\*\*Member Expectations\*\*
---
\* A friendly attitude and willingness to learn and improve.
---
\* We expect raiders to have some cheap consumables (food and pots), and NOT 13+ expensive ones. We will make do with what we have.
---
\* We expect raiders to do their best while in the actual raid, so we can overcome the challenges together.
---
\*\*Core values\*\*
---
\* Bring the player, not the class/spec mentality. We allow less viable specs and encourage everyone to play what they like.
---
\* Common sense and patience. 
---
\* Being flexible and understanding that real life takes priority.
---
\* Honest and transparent leadership.
---
\* A team mentality about raiding, with fair loot rules.  
---
\*\*Raid Schedule\*\* (\*Preliminary\*)
---
2 raid days: Thursday and Sunday 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET).
---
If you are interested or have any questions please send me a message and we’ll talk:

---
I really wish they'd done it like that.
---
Only runecloth is repeatable, and not available until 50.
---
I wanted a horse on my nelf back in the day, so I "just" did only Stormwind quests, still needed to turn in a metric ton of cloth at 50. I was playing at magtheridonEU, it had a really fucked up economy so 2 gathering profs allowed me to buy a crapton of cloth.
---
Only negative I can give is in solo PVP, playing a warrior in random que BG's sucks dick. Nobody will heal you, you mostly spend your time riding back and forth watching ranged shoot at one another because the second you charge in the entire enemy team will focus fire you. Finally you will see an opening and charge! but then you get frost novaed or hunter trapped and die, then you respawn and do it all over again!
---
alchemy has the same amount of good stuff that world drops
---
No honor till phase 2.
---
They can't sell it if they immediately equip it. All-Need is incredibly shitty towards the eprson who could actually use it as an upgrade for their main role.
---
Because I want to support my friends. I'm that way at home, I'm that way at work, and I'm that way online.
---
Plus as a healer, when the tank dies, you can off tank by healing yourself and once the boss is dead you can rez the tank. :)
---
&gt; Edit: Of course I will get downvoted, people don’t like the truth about private servers, it’s like shattering their little glass world.
---
It has nothing to do with people defending private servers; your first sentence is completely nonsensical. The progressive itemization that private servers use isn't just random stuff they added for fun, it's an accurate progression of items as they existed in WoW. Having stuff like the original Spirit of Aquementas is actually more faithful to vanilla WoW than having all these upgraded 1.12 items around at the beginning of the game.
---
you can get to exalted or atleast very close if you do all the Night elf quest starting in their Starting zone, but that means a level 1 Track to darnassus, also on Kalimdor is not a single Mage Trainer because Nightelfs dont have mages. that would mean you need to RUN back to Stormwind/IF every odd level. Its unfortnetly only fieasable for Rouge/Hunter/Warrior or Priest. Also on level 10 you have to track back to YOUR starting Zone to do your Class quest since only your race class trainer hand out that quest.
---
I think the most important thing you can do is letting her figure out things on her own. The game becomes really dull when someone guides you through everything and spoils it, which is often the case when playing with someone more experienced.
---
When she asks questions like "Where does this road lead to?", the proper response is "Let's follow it and see" and not "It just ends up in Azhara, a high level area you won't be seeing till your high 40s or low 50s."
---
If you play with her let her take the lead on almost everything. Rogue/Druid is a good setup, but maybe she'll identify more with a dwarf paladin, gnome mage or night elf priest once she's told to create a character. Her character should not be something that compliments your character, and neither should your character be something that compliments hers. Level your mage with her if she wants to play a rogue, level your priest is she wants to play a warrior.
---
Be ok with wasting 20 minutes on a garbage quest that you know won't lead to anything. It's her first time doing it so it's important for her to see it for herself. If you insist on playing with her all the way to 60, be ok with 25 days /played even though you could achieve it in 8.
---
If you control too much she will end up at level 30 resenting the game or way too dependant on you to even figure out the most basic of quests on her own let alone forming her own dungeon groups.
---
I'm not saying you shouldn't help her at all, but instead of giving all the answers - help her help herself. If she needs vanishing powder she might ask you where to get it, don't say exactly where to get it, let her know that cities are good for acquiring goods and a guard should be helpful for locating a reagent vendor.
---
Pick server type based on her personality. You know her better than we do. Is she highly competitive? Go for PvP. Is she more of a calm, in control and structured person? Maybe PvE is better. If you know she gives up easily if things doesn't go her way then PvP is a no go.
---
You also say she has a bit of a obsessive personality. Great! I can't think of a better game to play than Classic. 
---
Don't go out of your way to always play together. Be ok with her spending 8 hours leveling on her off days while you're at work, and don't stress out trying to catch up to her after. At most you should consider leveling your alt if you're consistantly getting too far ahead.
---
Oh yeah right
---
It obviously isn't "the standard", given the responses in this thread.
---
Yeah forgot
---
No I don't but it is July 16th
---
*Rolling need intensifies*
---
but when the quest turns gray you get reduced rep like 90% reduction
---
Big fan of kennion and pat highwarlord
---
I can’t wait to get back into stv.  Was some of the most fun back in the day
---
So darkest dungeon in wow?
---
Wrath really upped the ante when it came to the 'wow factor' (not wow as in WoW). Divine storm, arcane barrage, shadow dance, explosive shot, nether portal, disengage, etc etc. All these incredible abilities came out, but it really ruined that methodical way classes worked. Everything was sped up, PvP fights ended quicker, burst was more out of hand.
---
Like, can you imagine the wow devs sitting at a table brainstorming what cool new abilities they could put in the next expansion? "How about an attack that cuts through divine shield?", "ooh that sounds great". They kind of did that with everything -- beacon of light, shockwave, fucking titan's grip.. but I wonder if they ever thought how all these huge changes would affect the game. PvP really was never ever the same.
---
That's a weird thing to have an internet temper tantrum over.
---
Wait, what? Are you arguing someone cant make the same mistake on a regular basis? Because repetetive mistakes and accidents mean there is intend? How so? Whats the logic in that?
---
Yes, I assume there will be a classic version of that addon at some point. We don't know much about classic addons yet.
---
Yea but how many companies let you take a week off one month then another week off like 2-3 month later. They should let me tho kuz I work about 65hrs a week
---
r/buttfangs
---
There should be a slider for modern to classic graphics
---
Are we just gonna ignore the gnome with that very specific robe chest piece?
---
Also enjoy poverty and being a free kill in pvp
---
Exactly.
---
People who say WOTLK sucked are the same people who pretend to be vanilla pros but never did BWL or later progression. WOTLK had some of the hardest encounters in the game, the best music since vanilla and some of the best zones/raids. LFD came so late it barely deserves to be held against WOTLK. LFR is a much bigger blight.
---
Only if you stand near the melee's
---
Im rolling orc for killing dwarf rogues who seek to kill undeads
---
So its great if u dont wanna play hard for endgame stuff
---
Me me me me
---
There is no honor is ganking anyway ;)
---
Using mine since Gunbound
---
I had the most amazing adventure with my friends when we were in school vacation, we were logged in for 19 hours to do sunken temple for the first time, we didn't know what to do there, a guild mate said that there was some good loot and we rushed in without any knowledge, man those were the days.
---
Lvelling to 30 ganking redridge lol
---
Far from trash my friend. There's a reason the post has so many upvotes ;)

[H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)```
---
While wanting to relive past heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week raiding schedule.
---
Off nights are to be spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
```Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)
---
Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!```
---
**Loot System:**
---
```Loot Council```
---
**Our Goal:**
---
```To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment.```
---
**Requirements:**
---
```
---
18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)
---
Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)
---
Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)```
---

Flashbacks to 14 year old me
---
No decent guild will raid with a clownfest filled specs
---
Who we are: &lt;Birds of a Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.
---
What we are looking for: A person who is dedicated to the cause. We want people who show up to raids on a consistent basis (80%+). We understand things happen sometimes but just don’t make it a habit. We are looking for people who are more concerned with the progress of the group than the individual. We are serious about clearing content but can’t dedicated our lives to playing all day any more. We want people who are serious, on time, and want to clear content in a timely manner. This means when we raid at a certain time we are all in the raid at that time. Not all logging on at the time.
---
How we operate: We are ideally looking to raid two days a week. For three hours a night. Currently looking at Tuesday and Thursday 7/8-10/11 EST. For loot we run Loot Council. We prioritize giving loot to people who are actively trying to help the guild. This includes showing up to raids on time, attend raids regularly, help other guild members to get them raid ready, contribute items to the guild, listen to directions, etc.
---
What we are recruiting: Pretty much everything and anything at this point. You can check what we are looking for on our website linked below.

Rogue is a redheaded stepchild comparatively, seems like every class is designed to make your life hell as a rogue. If you don't severely outgear your enemy or have all of your cooldowns just about every class in the game potentially sucks to fight. Armor hurts your damage by a huge amount and only 3 classes have cloth, and of those mage has enough CC to make your life miserable, locks can spec to have enough DR to be a battleship, priests to a lesser extent but still very tanky in sform. You do pretty well against rogues though....
---
Warrior? Overpower, 50% damage reduction and more health, Aoe to break stealth
---
Mage? Frost nova, ice block, sheep, slows for days, sheep, Dot to break stealth, IB, AOE to break stealth, yeah I said sheep twice, because fuck sheep, you are gonna get sheeped then that hunter is gonna hunters mark you from GY then you might as well go get a drink cause you aren't gonna get to play the game until it wears off or you die
---
Warlock, Paranoia to help find stealth, SL to make you have more effective health than anything else in the game on top of 40% damage reduction before armor, dots to break stealth, aoe to break stealth, at least fear has a short range and locks out their shadow school
---
Hunter? Where to fucking start, hunters mark has STUPID range lasts for an eternity and you have to blow a 5 min (3.5 min talented) cooldown to get rid of it, Flare, traps, slows, aspect of the cheetah, dots to break stealth and still has pretty good fucking armor
---
Druid? insane armor insane mobility, if you don't have great gear and catch them in caster form in a stun lock you might as well not even bother, you won't ever kill a good one solo, also faerie fire which you can't get rid of at all and again fucks with your main gimick without help or waiting for a fucking eternity
---
Shaman? A geared ele one can fuck your day up just by casting lightning shield, shocks and totems, good armor, has a shield crazy burst later on with NS
---
Paladin, dont even bother
---
priests aren't too terrible as long as they aren't shadow, built in stun resist sucks though
---
I love playing rogue but you gotta be willing to put up with but its definately not a have your cake and eat it too kind of class by the time 1.12 came out
---
Just put frostbolt on all keys and play the piano
---
But thats your chance to tell them exactly how many fires they stood in
---
Couldn't agree more. I play Vanilla mostly because of the atmosphere it provides, the powerful feelings you have when you run in that old world. Updated models for example would be a big no for me.
---
UNBREAKABLE!!! https://youtu.be/ja1j7xWpB3w
---
Start planning out your journey. If that’s what you are going to do. Assuming you aren’t gonna rush to 60. I’m thinking about making a list of all my goals from 1-60 ie get leggings of the fang, or scout rank ASAP. Every little quest you specifically want to do. All professions you wanna do.
---
So you are saying that a copy of a game, where items have “guessed” drop rate is more true to the vanilla style than the original WoW was?
---
I have never heard anything more ridiculous.
---
This is why people come here and ask questions like is front stabbing good for leveling and etc., which is private server gimmick.
---
Was Cloak of the Shadows in Vanilla?
---
I'm rolling dwarf priest to heal dwarf rogues who seek to kill undeads and are in danger of getting killed by orcs.
---
The way back wouldn't be THAT bad.     
---
Once you've made the trip from the human or dwarfen starting area to the night elves, all you have to do to reach a mage trainer would be to take the ship back to Menethil and fly to Ironforge. Not as convenient as some other classes, but it should be manageable in about 15mins or less.     
---
You just have to remember to collect the relevant flight points on your first trip.
---
Great
---
you are not supposed to see it anyway. and if you would watch the Blizzcon stuff Blizzard already explained they will use a 7.3.5 or 8.0.0 client and feed it with 1.12 Data wich means it will Have the same missing testures and geometry.
---
You’re right.  It’s why you have to use sharpening stones over poisons as a rogue.  If you want to push for too DPS you have to switch back and forth depending on the mob(s) you’re about to fight.  Pretty annoying, really.
---
Sure, but that wouldn't matter if you're doing them level appropriately, i.e. leveling through that area.
---
Arms for PvP and Fury or Prot for PvE.  There really isn’t anyway around it.  Fury and Prot are terrible in PvP, and Arms isn’t viable in PvE.
---
I'm rolling troll mage to polymorph dwarf priests who heal dwarf rogues who seek to kill undeads but are in danger of getting killed by orcs.
---
I agree. I did 1-6 on a troll warrior in 37 minutes, 1-6 on a Tauren Warrior was 57 minutes. A big part of that is the running.
---
combat text is horrendous
---
No, it was added in TBC.
---
They are only just in alpha stages from what that blue post said, so by the time that runs its course then then beta etc, looks like it is going to be a classic september.

Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn’t always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
**What roles are in current demand?**
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for heals, off tanks, and locks.
---
**Misc:**
---
Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (7:00pm-10:00pm Saturday EDT)
---
* Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even  
---
those with little interest in raiding).
---
* World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases.
---
* Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---

World drop with 0.025% dropchance, good luck 😂
---
Erm... fucking fade?
---
World drop with 0.025% dropchance, goodnluck farming this thing 😂
---
The thing im wondering is how will i know the faction balance of the server im going to roll? could spent a good few weeks leveling then find out your faction is 70-30 or so, and by that time your cucked.
---
Back in 2005? Yeah it was. 
---
Compared to how people talk in games today? It was unbelievably tame.
---
I think it's safe to assume most retail addons will not work for Classic. Some might need to be completely overhauled, but others might only need some minor tweaks. 
---
Macros are more likely to work similar to retail, but we don't yet know what restrictions or permissions we'll have that compared to retail.
---
Even if we have some information on it from the alpha files, I think it's too early to draw any conclusions from it.
---
Did not expect to get 1.4k likes, glad you all enjoyed it as much as I did.
---
This is simply not true. Auto Shot is a skill specific to Hunter. There is no bind for it anywhere in the keybind menu.
---
It's not possible to rebind right click.
---
They existed out of game
---
Which is exactly what I'm going for. When we get a second chance at a game as great as this, you gotta try the weird things!
---
I'm kinda worried they will release 2-4 pvp servers and all of them will die off except one.
---
Thank you.
---
GLAMORAMA (Alliance EU - PVP) is recruiting!
---
Classic is coming! We are already over 50 people but still recruiting all classes!
---
Finally, we will all be able to play the best game ever made. And we hope you will do it with us!
---
We are a group of friends who played the original vanilla wow from near launch up until patch 1.12. We want one more stab to clear all raid content, enjoy and compete in world and BG PVP and just mess around in Azeroth.
---
Our background:
---
We used to play in a server first guild, clearing everything from Hogger up to Four Horsemen in Naxx.
---
What we offer:
---
-          Focused 40 man raiding Tuesdays and Thursdays at CET 20.00 -23.00
---
-          Knowledgeable and experienced raid leading
---
-          Balanced raid groups
---
-          For those interested we will run 20-man PVE and PVP content on other days
---
What we require of raiders:
---
-          Average attendance 1.5 times/week 40-man raids
---
-          Suitable PVE spec, consumables and knowledge of encounters
---
Guild language is English.
---
We have no age requirements. Everyone is welcome to apply. We will not stand for any harassment or discrimination within the guild.
---
We want to create a guild for those who can commit to twice a week raiding. We strongly believe we can clear all raid content, including Naxxramas. We also believe it is important to not fall too far behind in progression as you risk losing players to other guilds. We thus aim to be “geared and cleared” of current raid tiers by the time the next raid tiers are released.
---
If you wish to join as a social or pvp player you are most welcome!
---
Loot rules: We will use a DKP system with fixed prices. Read more about it here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9dx1pk3BY7ahdsmAVdlZFwfy0F6jISZs4hmRAojDx8/edit?usp=sharing
---
We look forward to your application. Contact us on discord https://discord.gg/92V5CCD , send us a message or comment in the thread if you have any questions.
---
Sincerely,

Glamorama

Check the right sidebar on desktop, or just look at the stickied post.
---
“Beta cucks” bro youre just cringey as the dude youre replying to
---
I would love to hear any actual arguments against this instead of just receiving downvotes.
---
Hey all have a question, I absolutely love the updated graphics on max, I just totally not love the new water that comes with it. Can you just turn the new water off?
---
Expect having to find LOTS and LOTS of keybinds. More than any other class.
---
Good luck! Classic will be a great opportunity to try something new like this. Just tell people you’re new and they’ll be patient. Be open to constructive criticism, and be open that your going to make mistakes.
---
The classic community will be good, and they know being patient with a new or learning healer is easier than finding a new one.
---
With no pvp system out at launch there isn't really a point
---
1 EU and 2 US are the biggest ones and I think Nixxion clarified where he's going to play but I forgot
---
Cool factor!
---
I'm in the same boat really, only ever played dps but planning on rolling a resto shaman for classic. I've also had some doubts about it due to the increased responsibility but to be honest I think that once you go through a couple of dungeons your confidence will increase.
---
Best way to do it would be to find a nice group of people/friends to play with whilst you're practicing.
---
Still not "awful"
---
If your the WC mage you get some leeway in your talents, and if I'm playing the spec nobody else wants to play because its worse DPS then  you damn well bet im getting shatter = )
---
*all of them

"Guild of honor" bwl geared dps warrior vs 59lvl hunter :D
---
My biggest concern with Classic is going to be lack of healbot or a "healbot" addon while spell stacking different levels of heals.
---
True, I know some do. But I think that the larger, more successful servers will be closer than you think. The rep gains for many of the quests that I've personally checked match thottbot/allakazam pages from the late classic and early TBC era. And if they do incorporate spill over, which I'm not sure was in classic (didn't pay attention at the time, frankly), it'll be even easier.
---
Why so much hate? Some people seriously have an issue xD
---
It also works in reality not only on paper - check the logs on legacyplayers.com
---
Back then rogues didn't even use Slice'n'dice and yet still cleared stuff - the game allready adapt to a point which you wont recognise compared to back then

You gotta photoshop a multishot icon on there.
---
Of course! I was just saying that holy doesn't only mean healing as some other people here seem to believe
---
This was amazing!  Crazy good edits and super fun to watch!  As a fledgling YouTube content creator I can only hope the quality of my content will someday match yours.
---
Nice work my friend!
---
Half life 1, half life 2, half life... Wait a minute nevermind
---
Aaaaaaand wrong forum.
---
Then we are in a disagreement, which is rather fine. It's a psychological thing for me and btw. I didn't say it will severely hit the 1-12 area, it will have an effect on it though.
---
i think you can do it with the razor naga addon
---
Well, whilst there are many things I would like to see changed or added to improve Classic, there are also many things I wouldn't. And the guy above and below have their own things they would like to add and also wouldn't add. My point is that no changes is the only fair way to do it because otherwise you would have to start caving into everyones demands and before you know it it's back to current retail.
---
QoL to reduce mana cost of buffs is on the surface a harmless request.. but then where do you draw the line?  It's pretty annoying having to navigate yourself though 3 enourmous talent trees every time you level.. may as well just change it to a choice of 3 obvious spells every 10 levels.. you see where I am going...
---
When I played mage for a bit I would often polymorph then immediately fireblast to negate the poly heal on casters when they had long important casts while my CS was on CD. This allowed me to effectively interrupt and deal a touch of damage when that was the best option.
---
Could prevent a big heal going out, a nuke, etc.
---
I'm a quest completionist and I don't think it was possible to get to exalted while levelling.
---
That makes 0 sense.
---
I still think I I’ll play as them cause the pet sounds dope. I wonder if you can get the cats from the cat figurines in Auberdine. Plus all the other pets they can have just sounds fun to kinda capture them.
---
If you're horde on my server I'll buy all your thick leather.
---
You’re right, I could definitely be remembering this from BC where I did most of my raiding.
---
spiderman.jpg
---
My understanding is that you will be able to toggle the graphical settings between a somewhat 2006-esque look and a more modern version. I believe the water will be one such function.
---
I'll be doing this, but on a Tauren Druid. And then I'll keep leveling after.
---
The complicated thing is which statues to press in which order D:
---
I would say it's worth it as an orc, not so much UD that get to cannibalize most of the time.
---
Faxmonkey followed by Unbreakable and Pat.
---
I have a aoe slow totem and I use one of the stairs
---
&gt; Enjoy the bulk of your leveling damage rotation. Just go right click, seal, judgment, seal, and then alt tab for 40 seconds because you do no fucking damage.
---
Or find a friend who's going warrior and level as a duo with them.  Both warrior and paladin suck to level, agreed - but if you duo them while leveling the combined total of both of them is insanely efficient and almost unkillable in the worldpvp you'll see while leveling.  Pally + War duo is by far the strongest pairing in the game.  Plus if you want to do dungeons all you have to do is find 3 dps.
---
&gt; Paladin buffs are great, and there are many. Enjoy casting them one at a time and refreshing them every 5 minutes. 
---
*15 minutes unless you're poor, plus with pallypower addon it's really no big deal.
---
&gt; Also enjoy healing
---
I do, thanks.
---
&gt;  because no one is going to keep you around if you only play retribution 
---
Didn't mention retribution at all in my post, you're right though - anyone thinking of going ret should realise it's non-viable except in pvp at endgame.

The subject says 2105 videos, but there are a few more since I uploaded some requests from the original /r/wow post.

**&lt;Chaos Theory&gt; - NA \[A\] EST PVP Server**
---
**Introduction**
---
Greetings! &lt;Chaos Theory&gt; is a mature Alliance, PVE focused guild based out of North America (EST). Our goal is to work toward raiding progression as a raid team. We will be playing on a PVP server for Classic WoW.
---
**Member Expectations**
---
As we prepare for the Classic WoW Launch, we are looking for new members to help us build our core. The main requirements to joining the guild are active participation in Discord, a good/positive attitude, and a desire to progress. We are actively looking for all classes and roles, so now is the opportunity to join at the ground level and help build something special.
---
**Specifics in regards to desired classes/roles:**
---
* Druid (Tank, Feral DPS, Heal)
---
* Hunter (BM, Mark)
---
* Mage (All Specs)
---
* Paladin (Heal)
---
* Priest (Heal)
---
* Rogue (All Specs)
---
* Warlock (All Specs)
---
* Warrior (Tank, DPS)
---
**Raid Schedule – Early night EST Raids!**
---
Our raid schedule will be 3 days a week. The core raid days will be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays from **7pm to 10pm EST**. If we complete content early, we will take days off if there isn’t additional content available to clear. We plan to use a hybrid **transparent** form of Loot Council. This will include open dialog with the entire raid and potentially a rotating member of the council.
---
**Next Steps**
---
If this sounds of interest, please join us via Discord to proceed with next steps. We currently have a Discord and Guild Website ready for your enjoyment. We are looking forward to adventuring in Azeroth with you this summer!

Why are people focusing on retribution when all paladins should be holy?
---
And druids can quickly shift back up humanoid form when they see a Hunter casting scare beast. 
---
There's at least a 30 second cooldown on scare beast too if I remember right, so it can't just be spammed.
---
I agree it should be easy as hunter some how it never worked I think I have 4 months of wipes to prove it
---
It just sucks that horde dont really have a redbridge mountain zone.
---
All their contested leveling zones start at 20
---
20 fury
---
31 arms
---
So if one wants all the recipe and become a Gnomish engineer he should first become goblin, get the bombling schematic, relearn engineering and go gnomish and then learn lil smoky, pet bombling and flash bomb schematic ?

Im gonna roll a paladin because im gay

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!
---

---
My friend and I have been playing Divinity Original Sin 2 while we wait for it to come out. 
---
It's a little pricey but super fun if you have someone to play with.
---
I did a similar build, but shifted around the order a bit. Grab wand spec/spirit tap first (obviously), but then go down the holy tree to spiritual guidance. Spirit tap/spiritual guidance stack, so as long as you pull the next mob within 15 seconds you'll have really nice +spell damage. Definitely stack spirit gear if you want this kind of build.
---
Also pick up imp. shadow word pain. SWP snapshots your +spell damage when it's cast, so as long as you cast it during spirit tap you get the full bonus (and 2 more ticks extend that bonus even more).
---
So something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVZfxx0cbVZxM
---
Not sure if meme, but I think even speedrunners usually take at least a week real time to ding 60.
---
Mhm as a guy who used to play a lot of 3s in legion (and some before bfa was so blatantly a lost cause), believe me people try to be completely anti social there 2. Pushing for the elite sets, glad etc, you will find plenty of people who insist on no voice, barely any party chat. That is the difference: retail wow encourages mental afk and 0 social conduct, vanilla wow encourages team work and mannerism.
---
What part about the client not allowing you to rebind right click to anything other than its original functionality was hard to grasp?
---
I'm hoping to do the same thing on my priest/mage dual box. [Here's a checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1spD5vcf5vt3CIVd_rJIfERlOs_4o1xYRcTUkIW8RNag/edit#gid=134288223) I made so I don't miss/out level any of the Darnassus quests. All values taken from classicdb.ch so they could very well be off come class release.
---
I believe that is what is going to be the case. You will, from what we have seen so far, have a slider and a button that says "classic settings".
---
Rogues can use distract on player casters out of combat to spin them and stop their casts from finishing. Shamans and priests can use their levitate, water walk, underwater breathing as bait to cover their buffs in order to prevent more important stuff from being dispelled. Shamans can drop poison cleansing totem preemptively to get themselves out of a rogues blind (considered a poison). Grounding totem eats polymorphs and hammer of justice
---
Used to get me so amped https://youtu.be/3QtI6zE8IgE
---
My friend and I have been playing Divinity Original Sin 2 while we wait for Classic to come out. 
---
Kinda reminds me of a mix between Diablo &amp; DnD.
---
Speedrunners that actually do it solo. Pretty sure there's going to a character that won't ever be behind because multiple people play on it just to get 60 as fast as possible.
---
The way armor fits on the new models is something I think more people should be aware of. If you log into BFA and throw on some vanilla shoulders / helms, a lot of them fit terribly or have clipping issues. If there's a choice between new and old character models, then I'd like to remind everyone to just keep that detail in mind.
---
Another tip as a shaman you can jump of a cliff then cast farsight to stop mid air then dismiss it to fall from the new height not taking fall damage
---
I'm rolling a hunter hurr durrr
---
Okay, so basically take it easy, gathering Ore and save it. Maybe use some to get Epic mount at 60? Continue to pool mats until I can get Eng to max or a point where I need to. 
---
All the while, focus on tailoring with cloth?
---
Peace? No peace..
---
Mandatory gank incoming.
---
I’m going to play a ranged warrior. 
---
I’ll auto attack with my ranged weapon. 
---
Ill roll on all agility gear and all ranged weapons. Anyone who complains is an elitist and an asshole for telling me how to play.  With enough agility gear I could get my auto shot crits up to 300!  
---
Can’t wait for classic!
---
Sadly some guilds will advertise as hardcore progression guilds and say, “pserver full clear experience only”
---
Imo herb/mining is a great way to level, harvest nodes appear naturally as you're leveling so it's like free money on the auction house.  I use those to get money for a mount, and then usually drop mining for alchemy, or herbalism for blacksmithing, or something to that effect.  I try to avoid crafting as I level, it just ends up being a big time and money sink for me.
---
do grey quests not award rep? also is there a specific level where it might become impossible, like if i dont work on the rep until 60?
---
You will always have a huge variety of different kind of players - there are people playing the game for over 10 year and still are backpeddling
---
Im considering something like that too. My goal was to minimize downtime with free heals from Inner Focus and combat regeneration with Meditation. But yes, more spell damage also makes you use less mana to kill things. Decisions, decisions...
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah but account sharing is against the tos though, and is generally pretty bad for keeping your acct safe
---

---
Pat pvpppppp
---
I use the sounds from FishPing on retail: https://www.wowace.com/projects/fishping
---
On most pservers world buffs are disabled during new raid launches as well, so unless Blizz also opts for that naxx will be cleared first day without a doubt
---
There will always be bad players, clueless players or players not interested in becoming better players. Private servers are full of them and I dont mind.
---
But the main difference between now and then is that whoever is LEADING raids understand the game well enough to not invite players that refuse to want to improve. Honestly, information is so easily available these days that you have absolutely no excuse to not know what your prebis is, which upgrades you should go for in a raid and what consumes to bring. Will players still get invited to raids in spite of this? Of course.
---
But generally the people that play like absolute shit will get told to improve themselves really quickly, or get replaced by the hundreds of players who do know how to play and are willing to improve.
---
As long as you still get Spirit Tap, it's not too bad.
---
TLDR;
---
* Region: NA
---
* Realm: RP or PVE
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Raid times: 7PM PST or later, would be available most nights and would prefer at least 1 weekend raid night
---
* Priority/Class: semi-hardcore raiding, 95% chance I'm rolling a mage, 5% rogue
---
* Rules: Must be adult only guild, friendly and mature atmosphere, no edgelords/trolls
---
* Feel free to PM me on reddit for more info
---
Backstory: I'm currently in my mid-late 20s, and I started playing vanilla back in 2006. I made a night elf rogue that's still my main today! Since I started playing toward the tail end of vanilla, I never fully experienced the raiding scene back then. I killed a few bosses in MC, Ony, AQ20, and ZG in PUG raids before TBC came out but that's about it. My real raiding experience came in TBC. I joined an awesome guild that cleared all raid content, had multiple server firsts, and cracked US top 250 all with a fairly light progression raiding schedule. I was also an officer in this guild so I do have some leadership experience. I kept raiding with these guys through WotLK but as things usually go, a lot of the original members fell off and changes to the game were killing my enthusiasm for hardcore raiding. Since the end of WotLK I've played pretty casually, but classic has sparked my interest in getting back to that level. 
---
**THE IMPORTANT PART:** 
---
The thing I loved most about that guild is that we were able to achieve hardcore goals with a semi-hardcore mindset. We raided 3 nights a week for 3-4 hours max. We didn't take ourselves too seriously - the atmosphere was fun and relaxed, but we focused and got shit done when we needed to. There were no edgelords/trolls or mean-spirited people who caused drama and distractions. If someone was missing an enchant or consumable, we helped each other out instead of calling each other out. This is what I'm looking for in a new guild. 
---
My goal is to clear ALL raid content and to experience what I never got to experience on my rogue. I'm pretty sure I'm going to roll a mage this time around just to do something different, but there's a small chance I'll go back to a rogue again. If this description fits the type of person you're looking for, I'd love to hear from you. Thanks for reading!
---
I played on Burning Blade and later re rolled Horde on Onyxia. I played far more than I should during Vanilla and I am being sincere when I say this is the absolute first time I’ve ever seen anyone have this mentality. In my mind, and honestly kind of shocked anyone disagrees, a need roll is ONLY to be used if you will equip the item and a greed roll is to be used ANY other time. Thinking otherwise is frankly stupid in my opinion because it is completely contrary to the actual intent of Need vs Greed. 
---
It is not something you should have to establish before the group because that is the way proper etiquette goes. I would 100% call anyone who would roll need on an item they don’t need a ninja looter, because well you are. 
---
Proper etiquette is to use the systems as they were intended.
---
You dirty bastard! STV sucks enough on it's own 😂
---
Giving the DPS both Windfury and 20% reduced threat will almost always be the best use of your mana.
---
Great video! Good support priest videos are pretty rare. I have two questions for you:
---
Favourite alliance racial from a pvp perspective?
---
What are your thoughts about tri-spec vs. disc spec in a pvp scenario?
---
If you’re exclusively completing Darnassus rep quests, as some have suggested to do, then you won’t be getting any spillover Darnassus rep from other quests. If spillover rep is working as expected and your goal is to reach exalted as soon as you hit level 40, then you will need to weave in other non-Darnassus quests at the same time to benefit from that spillover rep.
---
Getting exalted by level 40 may or may not require a full 100% quest completionist approach, but if rep values turn out to be much lower than expected, you’ll reach exalted sooner if you’re prepared for that worst case scenario.
---
I hate them because you can absolutely decimate your supply in one bg if your using everything at your disposal, healthstone and spellstone roughly every 3 mins, and then shadowburn, its fantastic in pvp and you should really be using it as much as you can because it's great burst and instant, it's also on a 15 sec cooldown and you might get half of them back because of the refund mechanic if your lucky. If your using SL spec and saccing VWs it's even worse, I have legitimately used 40 soulshards in a long match, so then you end up using drain soul which sucks for pvp, low damage and just screams COUNTERSPELL ME
---
That's interesting.
---
Thats the stuff you don't notice as a healer.
---
Healing is actually easy when you get the hang of it.
---
Be sure to install custom unit frames, cause default ones are crap. I like my party/raid frames to display my buffs and dispellable debuffs. 
---
I recommend making mouseover macros for your abilities, so you don't have to target a party member to heal them
---
Lots of chuck norris
---
My favorite is using Blessing of Freedom to make yourself immune to several damaging spells in dungeons such as the Mind Flay from the Inquisitors in Strat Live. It can literally reduce the damage taken by half on certain pulls.
---
Now there's literally nothing retail does better lol
---
They do but at a diminished rate for every level the quest is greyed out. I think it caps at -80% so you'd get something for completing it... but not much. It's definitely worth it to do all quests when they're yellow/green.
---
Yeah, the new water fits a very calm pond, not shores of Westfall, let alone Bay of STORMS in Azshara.
---
You have to land the KB to get a shard, which is tough with 30 other dps beating on it

I can’t answer everything since I’m not an experienced hunter but -

2) Impossible to say. From an economy standpoint we’re in completely uncharted territory. We’re likely to have the largest population playing since Vanilla but with 1000x the knowledge and experience. Prices could be way higher due to players being better at making gold, or way lower due to players being better at gathering/making things. 
---
4) With a macro it won’t be bad, switching gear isn’t on the GCD so you can swap everything at once. 
---
6) I’d recommend Mining to go with Engineering until your gold stabilizes and you get a feel prices. Gold is SUPER hard to come by in Vanilla and so double crafting in Phase 1 is gonna be crazy hard to maintain. Especially while leveling don’t go double crafting. Once prices stabilize you’ll have a good idea of what your guild needs too.

Well the first time i ever entered Barrens Chat and the first line i've seen was:  
---
"My mom said it's ok when she touches my peepee, since we are family"  
---
so... yes
---
Sunken temple was an awesome dungeon. I remember just farming it for for as long as I could on my prot pala (wotlk) because it was so fun and had good xp. Assuming I could find people to run there.
---
Then Cata ruined it.
---
balance/resto druid leveling here
---
I don't exclusively do Darn quests, but I do prioritize them. As a Warrior, doing as many green quests as possible eases the leveling pain so I bounce around all the starting zones if I can. 
---
But I'm still not convinced that spill over is intended to be in a vanilla build, so I'm anticipating that it won't be there. If it is, I'll adjust to do as many extra quests as possible ofc but I'm pretty sure that with my plan, I'll get exalted around 44 again - earlier if they do implement spillover, which I'll admit would be nice and make IF easier.
---
&gt; used for nightfall
---
What's a nightfall? My brains prolly been ruined but all think about is Destiny when I hear that.
---
For people who think we all played on Commodore 64 machines back then:  the wallpaper section goes up to 1600x1200 resolution.  Which is almost as many pixels as 1920x1080, still widely used today, only not widescreen.

Vurtne, Drakedog, Laintime, WheelieCool &amp; Champ, Roguecraft.

I always loved the outnumbered, skill-based videos, and I never really liked the crit highlights ones (usually made by well geared, but terribad players, like Pat).
---
That will be non-issue with ui frames and proper bindings and macros
---
Hahahaha
---
Iam gonna try this too, or balance feral for more dots
---
It doesn't scale past BWL and you'll always be seen as a retard.
---
Nightfall is an axe with a proc that increases the target's spell damage taken by 15% for 5 sec, usually you'd have one person on Nightfall duty just to apply the debuff, most often a hunter spamming wingclip.

https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169
---
Passive: Attacking rogue first will result in 90% chance of summoning  at least 2 level 60 rogues to come to his aid.
---
Depends on the item. If it is BiS for Rogues, the group has no Rogues and the hunter who can use it gets it, because "it's an upgrade", even though not BiS, then you basically threw the gold out of the window.
---
If it is a low cost item, and BiS for the player, sure.
---
If it is Edgemaster's which go for 1000 gold, then no way you just "get it because it's BiS for you" man. This is life-altering amount of money to just give away. Get the edgemaster's and give each member 200g? Fair enough.
---
Non-BiS or closely BiS items (i.e. lower levels) are whatever, roll whatever you want man, as long as it's not twink gear.
---
I love it
---
Maybe let she plays whatever she wants instead of you choosing for her?
---
At most you can explain the classes brieflly and let she decide.

**&lt;FREE HUGS&gt;**  *PvP*  **Horde** Semi-Hardcore [NA]
---
**INTRO** Who are we? We are known as FREE HUGS! (Yes, we do offer free hugs.) We are a semi-hardcore guild for those who want to spend a lot of time raiding and obtaining those sweet epic and legendary items! We are a newly formed guild that is looking for anyone who has a passion for World of Warcraft Classic.
---
**RECRUITS** We are looking for people who have the interest and dedication for raiding in Classic. We are currently recruiting for our main raid group and are in need of every role. Although we are small we hope to grow into a powerhouse guild that prides itself on our close knit community.
---
**SCHEDULES** We will most likely raid on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays 7 - 10 PM CST. We will begin raiding within a reasonable amount of time after release, allowing for everyone to level/gear up. We are open to bending the raiding times based on our communities input. We will be doing dungeons, farming and pvp on our off days.
---
**OUR GOALS** We will clear all raid content through naxx at our own pace to ensure our quest for legendary items and epic quest chains. We aren’t as hardcore as some other guilds out there; we won’t be making any world/server firsts. However, we will be making sure everyone achieves their pve and pvp goals !
---
**BONUS** If you are new to Classic, Welcome! And fear not, we have experienced classic verterans in the guild with a passion for teaching all things WoW! We are a welcoming group and are here to guide you on your glorious classic adventure.
---
If you would like to join, please send me a message on discord @NeonInuGanetto#3614 and I will personaly welcome you to our family!
---
Mfw the joke site is more accurate than the "serious" one.
---
A good one would
---
You're strawmanning.
---
When the poster mentioned "progressive itemization" he was obviously referring to the way in which the stats of the items changed over time. You're the only one bringing up drop rates here.
---
But you're wrong about that too. Drop rates aren't guessed, they're determined by a collection of drop rate data.
---
that's just vanilla though, bad talents everywhere only a very few classes have a spec that's really good for both
---
I played it enough for it to tell it sucked Death knights killed it design was awful 😂 sorry you can't see that and WOTLK was ur first experience playing wow I can tell.
---
Best make it an alliance or perception will rek ur ass lol
---
I am counting that guilds that will go for the "worlds/servers first" will pick same server (or same few). Those servers will be considered as "top servers " to play on. Once that is known, Il just have to avoid those. 
---
That is the strategy I am counting on :)

We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere. 
---
While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community.
---
We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be “pre-raid” raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other. 
---
We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.

Fear "dance with warlock" by swapping rank 1 Curse of Recklessness (make enemy immune to fear) and rank 1 Curse of Agony (the dot, only to remove the previous curse).
---
You can use this to fear some mobs in dungeon and not have them pull other packs by trying to control the fear the best you can. Usefull in more emergencial situations like tank or healer dead etc, but always good to know if you are a warlock.
---
These are just the regular uses of spells. It's not what OP is asking about.
---
haha yeah, it's weird to dislike people who aren't able to stop themselves from being smug little dbags, isn't it?
---
I've been where you are and it changed into something completely different. Again. The good shit in life came back. If it did for me then it can for you but you're gonna have to get up and make it happen, even while it hurts. I'd suggest this book to get you started 'Reasons to stay alive' - Matt Haig. Good luck.
---
I'm pretty sure that's completely wrong?
---
Yea, but this example is just the regular use of the spell. OP's asking about some clever and maybe not-intended stuff.
---
Of course saying "you can use dispell to remove debuffs from your friends" is not what OP's asking about here lol
---
Healing gives a nice sense of reponsibility, the problem is you have to spend a lot of the time looking at raid frames and not the fight. A lot of people don't like that.
---
This happened me on a pserver when I was asked to stomp a 30 ganking warrior with my 50+ hunter. Did so and got several angry messages from a level 1 alt about not having a life etc etc.
---
Talk shit, get hit.
---
If you get to 60 quick then all the black lotuses and Devilsaur leathers are yours.
---
I'm with ya. It was still an MMO RPG, but wellfare epics, heroics, dailies flying etc all made my passion for the game die down. I raided as far as 2 bosses in Naxx in vanilla despite being very young. TBC i did karazhan, which was fun, but afterwards so uninspired. I haven't truly raided since, only pvp'd, because nothing they've released since could compare to the epicness of vanilla raiding imo.
---
Recently I asked a question on what’s the best way to go with professions on a fresh server.
---
I got a brilliant response from a user, basically he said that you only need to level 5 skill per level and you don’t need to over-grind just 5 skill. By 60 you will be at 300. And this is what I plan to do.
---
They only ban account sharing these days if it's made for selling services like Mythic raids or Arena.
---
Yeah, some of the submissions are still visible on the wayback machine.
---
Warriors in general are rage inducing in RL because of the rage limiting in game, due to rage mechanics, level difference mechanics, weapon skill mechanics, and absorption shield mechanics.
---
On my warrior on a Pserver, there's been more than a few times where the words "oh come the fuck on" were uttered while questing or tanking when this combination of things makes you do almost no damage and then you are in hole threat or damage wise, and you look and feel like a noob.
---
If only there was a talent or some lowbie gear that gave you just some +hit, it really messes with the class on a fundamental level. It always seems like damage is feast or famine and would give up some nasty crit chains in order to not randomly look inept and get beat up by a dopey mob out in the wild.
---
If they're a dwarf and /wave, I'll leave em alone.
---
Any other race, though? So dead.
---
I downed like 8 bosses in naxx vanilla, cleared everything in tbc raiding with the players who later formed Paragon. There was some bad things in wrath: dungeon finder and 5-mans being way too faceroll, but it wasn't a bad expansion at all. I've barely raided in Legion and BFA so I don't go tell everyone how they suck, since I don't have enough to base than on.
---
But honor points still there.
---
That's when you get a druid tank and cloth DPS to group with you, when you are a hunter. So you can get the chest.
---
Aside from the usual Maydie, Unbreakable, etc, The one video I saw from Spritzer really clicked with me back then, felt a little more like crafted movie than a collection of clips and music.
---
Not sure if it really was that good, but it's got that nostalgic effect for me now.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrM54_8Nvgs&amp;list=FLvS_Cku1DHO1GxSAhoVv4PQ&amp;index=86&amp;t=969s
---
Same thing for me, hunter main except I was raiding BT at the end of middle school
---
Don't get me wrong, I love wrath as much as the next guy, but hindsight is 20:20 and I can see how damaging most of its design was to the spirit of the game. Even TBC already had seemingly good ideas that chipped away at what made me start playing to begin with.
---
If I got the slow pace and scale of vanilla, with the class design of wrath, I'd be a happy cookie. Alas, it is not given.
---
Hahaha sure you did
---
I'm betting OP will dedicate all da gold to wands xD
---
Live to win!
---
Hey  Mikimao, thanks for offering up your memories. I'm wondering if you can help out all these old folk that are coming back to Classic, with kids/jobs/wives/husbands/washing up. As current retail guides aren't going to work for a lot of vanilla gameplay stuff, could you point to the best places to to start reading up for relevant class/game mechanics/addons etc. Where are the best places to go now if you've forgotten everything but the nostalgia? Is youtube the best place to go for all that "50 golden wow tips you wish you'd known before grinding them the wrong way" videos or is anywhere starting to collate all this stuff in one place? Cheers, and welcome back!
---
Gonna roll orc rogue and gank menithil harbour in memory of my boy anwe
---
I had the same feel like you. Couldnt think of anything but classic WoW. Couldnt even play other games, they bored me to death. 
---
So I started on a Private server played a hunter to 60 and got him to rank 10 for blue pvp gear. I always felt like I missed something in WoW, and that was playing a hunter.
---
Now I just cant wait for the Real deal to be released. I am super ready and still excited to play classic.
---
Does mouse over work in Classic?
---
I've found grinding to be generally faster than questing on some classes. 
---
The last Warrior I levelled I grinded from 12-60 and only did quest for a few levels when I couldn't find a good grinding spot. 
---
I didn't do a single dungeon, my /played was 5 days and 20 hours. 
---
Humanoids are my favourite thing to grind, they're generally easier to kill and have better drops. 
---
Grinding all the way to 60 is also going to give you more gold. At 40 I had 120 gold ~ and at 60 I had over 300. 
---
I'm not certain on which beast are easier to kill for skinning. The armor values are more of a guess work on Pservers, so they might be very different in Classic. 
---
However cats and birds seemed easier to kill.
---
It certainly worked in TBC
---
It was pretty bad.
---
Female Dwarf, you run up on them just to take a screenshot because no one will believe you saw one.
---
If you truly wish to take less damage, then get a slow 2 hander and kite with hamstring, dipping in for auto attacks to trade blows 1 for 1.
---
It equals around a 40 to 50% damage reduction
---
Stonetalon
---
Although they are a bit behind WoW 1-3 for me I think Gothic 1-3 is a really good competition especially regarding story telling and world exploration / immersion.
---
I would also love to see the numbers on this.
---
I feel like if you arent able to do at least 3 quests before trucking back to town its not worth the walk.
---
I typically will kill everything I see to and from doing quests.  So, grinding on the way.
---
If you grind strategically for mats, usually killing elementals or demons at lvl 45+ you can easily end up with 800+ gold at 60.
---
Ahh.. Sunken Temple &lt;3 I have such good memories from running that dungeon
---
Still the same.
---
Yeah I'm probably going mining and engineering. Farm a lot of arcane crystals at 60 to pay for things. Once I get 500g and enough starting materials to take engineering to 240ish then I'll switch to tailoring
---
Sounds cool! I'm playi g druid this time. And I wonder if that's a class who can do this effectively or not.
---
Warrior grinding is especially good vs humanoids.  They have lower armor (caster types have especially low armor!) and many cast spells that can be easily interrupted.  They also flee when low HP, so as long as you hamstring you can pretty easily follow them as they run and get a few free hits. 
---
You're also correct about armor on beasts, generally it is much higher than humanoids but some beasts have higher armor than others.  Turtles and bears have high armor values, cats and birds are lower.  Dragonkin whelps have the lowest armor I think.
---
no
---
Misdirection was added in TBC.
---
Or wait until bloodvine comes out then go tailoring. Start making mooncloth
---
Says the guy that uses "cringey"
---
Got the pleasure of ganking the living shit out of a NE hunter that hit me a few times in STV and Tanaris. She was a few levels above me, like 5-6. She'd shadow meld and wait for me to run back, let me feel safe for a minute or so and fight some mobs before killing me when I was low HP. I played more and thus got to Un'goro and EPL before her. Very satisfying to get some revenge on what I would call light griefing. Looking forward to some exciting world PvP moments come classic.
---
Killing Satyrs in Azshara is good for farming felcloth and killing furbogs in winterspring for cosumables. 
---
However I didn't take them into account, I did have a lot of them stored in my bank and didn't sell them until I reached 60. ds
---
So the 300g I made was vendoring anything that wasn't valuable.
---
136 hours of pure grinding to 60 if you get 2 kills\minute, assuming you kill an equal level mob (1 at 1, 10 at 10, 59 at 59, etc).
---
"Easier" depends on your class...you have the right idea in killing lower armor, high value mobs, but as an example STV has lots of quickly killed\high value beasts....except if you play on a PVP server, you're likely to spend half your time getting ganked.
---
I'll probably go the beast route, there's a ton of areas and flexibility in quiet(er) areas (1k needles, feralas, winterspring) that I hope will be less contested than madhouses like tanaris pirates, etc.
---
Alternatively, y'all can use this sub:  https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowlfg/
---
Why ?
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/frostwhisper/kowáqt you can check the dates of the various achievements if you really don't believe me. Many sites point to Wrath being the peak of WoW subscriptions. It's not exactly a unique opinion to like the expansion.
---
100% making female dwarf rogue called 'thicc'
---
Downvoted instantly.
---
Let me guess, you are a rogue?
---
In Sweden most people have 25-30 vacation days off a year and you almost always get it approved unless it's because of a specific reason like overlapping with a lot of other colleagues vacations.
---
You and I are saying the same thing, I was more saying there aren't very many "clever/hidden" spell uses, most are intentional or left in for their deliberate use. Most of the posts are things like "feign trap combo".
---
An example of clever use, casting arcane missiles with 1 second of a dmg buff like arcane power or a trinket will still apply the full effect of those buffs to the entire arcane missiles, so you can make a 15 second buff last 19 seconds. If you begin casting a fireball but do not finish the fireball before the buffs drop off, you lose their benefit to that fireball.
---
My response to that is your username
---
I've been playing all these different classes on pservers to try and figure out what I want to play on classic when it launches.  I've tried pretty much all of them and idk what it is about the hunter, but I think i'll end up playing it as I always do.  I just can't shake it.
---
You don't remember the original buff mechanics? It was literally just 5 minutes, single target. Greater buffs weren't added until a number of months in (can't remember exactly). So for those early on in  MC and Onyxia you did need to click each person individually. Granted it usually wasn't everyone because warriors don't need mana and mages don't need attack power, but it still sucked butt.
---
 I remember putting the rest of my extra talent points in prot so I could get the improved blessing of salvation, which upped the duration to 15 minutes. I honestly believe it was the best healing talent you could get as you'd cut your downtime by over 60%.
---
The only problem with that is there was only one paladin in the raid that could utilize that talent.
---
Other than that yeah you're right. I'm just angry complaining.
---
Except for trying to level up. That shit was so fucking boring and tedious.
---
Giving the tank windfury/agility is also a huge boost to his threat, meaning the entire raid's dps.
---
Eh, depends how much your paying for that
---
Yeah. I will be maining dwarf rogue and dwarf paladin once classic comes out.
---
 **&lt;Thinkin Bout Thos Beans&gt; Alliance | NA | Normal/PvE**
---
We're a casual guild looking to expand our roster for Classic release so we have plenty of people to level, do dungeons, and complete group content with. Eventually leading to raid progression sometime in fall.
---
Our guild consists of a mixed group of raiding veterans and casual players who cannot wait for Classic release. We are all working adults who have been playing WoW together for many years, with some of us playing together since Vanilla. We are always on the lookout for new players who want to have a good laugh and complete content at a pace that is fulfilling, but not overbearing.
---
**Raid Times:** Weekends only. Aiming for two nights a week.
---
We are looking for any **DPS and Healer** at the moment.
---
You can join us at our Discord. If you are looking for a community that plays games beyond WoW, we run giveaways and server events, while playing various other multiplayer titles.
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/8QV45fP](https://discord.gg/8QV45fP) (mention WoW Classic)
---
Because where do you stop?
---
Ahh, sunken temple. Remember the statues puzzle? Good times, can't wait for classic :).
---
/u/Mikimao, thanks for doing this AMA and hopefully you'll be willing to pop back by and answer this question!
---
So in the old vanilla days, I was a gold buyer.  The first couple times, my palms were literally sweating while I waited for the gold to arrive, and then I'd be nervous every day when I logged on afraid that I might be banned.  But the ban never came, and eventually buying gold became a regular routine part of my vanilla WoW experience.
---
Eventually, it kind of became consensus in the gold-buying community that Blizzard decided to focus on banning the gold farmers/sellers, rather than the players that were buying it.  Were we right about that?  Or were we just lucky that we never got banned?  
---
It seems like if Blizzard knew who the farmers were, then you'd be able to tell easily enough who had bought the gold.  So it seemed like the only reasonable explanation for us not getting banned was that Blizzard must have adopted a "Get the dealer, not the buyer" approach to the issue.
---
Any insight?
---
Huntard!
---
because they already did. It used to be 45%.
---
Once the game is reasonably balanced.
---
Some classes are better than others at grinding.  It also matters what type of mob you grind, they have varying armor values or skill types.  
---
It's very realistic to grind to 60 using minimal quests.  I would advise that you do a bit of research depending on whatever class you're playing to find good spots.  As a physical DPS class (warr, hunt, rogue, shaman, pal) you'll want to find humanoids IMO as they have the lowest relative armor values, flee when low hp, and have easily interrupted spells to lower their DPS by a good chunk.  
---
Cats have the lowest armor as far as beasts go.  Some of the toughest beast targets are turtles or scorpions IMO- scorpions are often very annoying unless you are a class that can cure poisons.  The poison is sometimes just a mild DOT, not a big deal, but sometimes it's a massive movement / attack speed debuff that makes you a super easy target for wpvp as well. 
---
I'd advise that you do a tiny bit of AH shopping too for cheap consumes, and that you definitely DEFINITELY level cooking to get the stam/spirit buff and also for moneymaking purposes.  Cooking food can sometimes be sold on the AH for very modest profit but I often just vendor it.  The max level cooked food that adds special buffs is very profitable and also a very consistent seller so you don't have to worry much about the auctions not selling.  If you're grinding to 60 you will get a LOT of meat and cooking vastly increases the value even of just cooking it and then selling it back to the vendor 
---
relevant consumables-
---
trolls blood potions (hp per 5 sec)
---
good stack of HP/mana potions to avoid deaths
---
alch elixir of your primary damage stat only (str for warrior, agil for rogue, etc)
---
cooking food for stam/spirit
---
random scrolls for your primary damage stat or stam/int if caster
---
You should also revisit the AH every 5 levels or so to get some cheap upgrades.  If you aren't doing dungeons or instances you will likely fall severely behind in some gear pieces as you go.  AH usually has some cheap green options as you level, or a blue piece for 3-5g that is a massive upgrade.  If you're grinding this much and not dying often you will have a lot of gold, and you will grind a lot quicker (and save time!) if your character is always relatively strong rather than struggling in greens 10 levels below your level
---
Last but definitely not least be very mindful of your weapon if you're a physical damage class.  Weapon damage makes the biggest difference as you level.  A warrior using the same weapon from level 30-35 really won't see much damage increase as you level, but if you finish the whirlwind axe quest at 35 and replace whatever you had prior with it you'll see a huge power spike.  If you're grinding this much as a melee class I'd say always have a blue weapon within 7-10 levels of your level or a green weapon within 3.  If you're planning to grind this much you have to make sure your character is relatively strong otherwise you will just slow down a lot and really hurt your efficiency, which is what grinding is all about.
---
They were extremely welcoming to community input and interaction back then. Just look at [this snapshot from Mar 15, 06](https://web.archive.org/web/20060315195732/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/) and you'll see what I mean.
---
On one page, you can see movie contest winners (featuring the legendary *Illegal Danish Super Snacks* as best Comedy), the screenshot of they day, a community spotlight, a contest to win a TBC beta invite, fan art submissions, and a post about the really cool [guild relations program](https://web.archive.org/web/20060315200612/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/community/guildrelations.html).
---
And ALL of those community oriented posts are coming from a 12 day timeframe.
---
Compare this to the current [worldofwarcraft.com](https://worldofwarcraft.com) homepage and it's night and day. Nothing community oriented whatsoever and the posts are far more sparse in comparison.

&lt;Redux&gt; [H][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website. We also have candy.
---
And the hunter can stop casting it when the druid shifts to humanoid.
---
Now the druid has to transform back, and that's a big mana cost, especially at low levels.
---
Scare beast is actually very useful.
---
&gt; on what I would call light griefing.

Explain to us how attacking players of the opposing faction, who chose to play on a PvP server constitutes "Grieving" please?
---
Unless “Zalfin” sounds like a lore name for a dwarf, gnome, or nelf... not really
---
Damn, they really announced classic that long ago?
---
Well done! I would love to see one for cooking and another for alchemy. :)
---
I would aim for 1050Ti or better.
---
Nope

*Curse of Agony*
---
*Corruption*

---
You couldn’t make an alliance and a horde character on the same server in vanilla
---
It's poison elementals are immune to. Same as undead.
---
If you think about it logically it makes perfect sense because neither has blood circulation.
---
yeah memes are hit or miss with people.  some people probably expected to get a comprehensive guide.  I prefer the shit post approach \*rubs hands\*
---
&gt; Suboptimal unit compositions are winning all the time in TFT and are more viable than they've ever been. 
---
Can't comment on now.  Haven't played TFT since maybe 2 or 3 months after release.  Call it 5 months at the outside.  Hard to remember how long it took me to quit, but I know it wasn't forever.  I was pretty excited about TFT but decided pretty quickly that it wasn't for me.
---
&gt; (turtling was a massive issue in ROC) 
---
The only place where turtling was a viable strat was in 3's and 4's with specific comps for cubing.  And you generally knew a cube team when you got matched up against them.  If you played correctly against cubers, you'd win, it'd just take forever.  People tried Hu/UD cubing in 2's but it was never effective and any other form of defensive towers was just asking to get your ass handed to you, because if you were spending resources on towers, you were not spending them on units that could control the map, which meant you got out-expanded and your opponent just made a few siege to burn down your towers before crushing you with an army twice the size of anything you could afford.  You'd never see an orc or a human make more than 2 towers at the most unless they were a: tower creeping a map that was well set up for it or b: tower pushing.  Elves never made APs because they were shit and AoWs were a better base defense (unless the Elf in question was getting wrecked by wyvs or griffons, in which case, they'd already fucked up the match badly enough that it was already over).  So no, turtling was not really a thing at all in RoC.
---
&gt; T1 was WAY more viable in ROC because Piercing damage was on everything (Magic attack type didn't exist) and T3 units were especially vulnerable to it because of their armor types. Tier 2 was all you needed as even casters did piercing.
---
Tier 1 units were viable for all races (except Orc, because grunts were awful and heads were strictly worse archers and T2 and T3 units for Orc were awesome).  However, fast teching was also a viable strat, which it was not in TFT when it came out (again, can't comment on today).  Orc would almost invariably straight tech to T3, either going caster Tauren or Wyv/shaman.  Human would usually start with footies, but even there, teching to casters was not unheard of, and you had the occasional cheeser that would go straight for griffons or tonks.  In fact, because it was significantly cheaper to tech (and therefore to unlock new units, new buildings and a whole host of new decision trees), pretty much every race teched far faster than in TFT.  Even if they made T1 units, they'd usually start their tech before they had more than half a dozen units out.
---
RoC was incredibly balanced from the time they nerfed uprooted AoWs (and while I did play Elf and did abuse the shit out of Assassin Push, it \*did\* need to get beat down with the nerf bat) to the point at which they changed how damage types and armor interacted sometime after the release of TFT (I want to say somewhere around 2005, but it was a long time ago and my memory is fuzzy).  Basically, the point at which hunts got nerfed into the ground and archers got super buffed to where the entire Elf strategy became "mass archers, attack move, mana burn on CD every CD".  I mean, to be fair, the DH was always OP and Elf was always the most newbie friendly race, but once they made that change, it became nearly impossible to fuck up your build as Elf.  You mass archers and if somehow the game goes long enough, you make hippo riders.  And the racial advantages (Orc beats UD, UD beats Elf, Elf beats Orc, Human beats UD and loses to Orc) went from mild advantages to near certainties(except human cheese strats became somewhat difficult for Orc to handle).  I played for a while into that era, but it tanked my win percentage something fierce.  I think I was down to about 65% when I quit playing entirely, down from around 87% in the RoC heyday and it was entirely on Elf being a nigh unwinnable matchup, even with the Rotanimod head strat (was an odd build that got heads up and running before you even built an Altar of Storms and got you on closer to even footing with mass archers, assuming you had decent micro).  Of course, I'd end up getting frustrated and switch to UD and then I'd get a seemingly endless string of Orc matches, because fuck me, right?
---
Anyway, the balance of RoC didn't go to shit until after TFT came out, when the balance changes were based on what TFT needed and RoC was basically ignored.  So I have no problem believing that it's unplayable now (good to know Grubby is still around though, I haven't looked at WCIII in a dozen years at least), but comparing contemporary RoC to RoC when it was relevant is like saying that Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms now are comparable to what they were in Vanilla.
---
&gt; Creeping was done with burrows and towers 
---
Sure, sometimes.  Not every map was favorable for that.  The majority of the time, creeping was done either by a hero alone or a hero and a few T1 units.  You chose to creep or to try and catch your opponent creeping, or to push your opponent's base while they were creeping or trying to catch you creeping.  At least TFT still had decent harass, I'll give it that much.  But the maps where tower creeping was super effective (i.e. not just Human making a tower on the ramp and killing the Ogre camp on Temple, where the tower doubled as a base defense) like Frostsabre or Legends, the investment in towering the creeps was backbreaking if you got caught.  Usually what would happen there is if your opponent found your towers before they were finished, they'd wake the creeps by hitting them with their hero, then TP out and let the 1 or 2 towers that were already up acquire aggro and then you lose your towers plus the opportunity cost of having pulled workers that far out to build them and falling behind on unit production.  It was a pretty massive hit which is why I rarely tower crept those maps.  High risk; high reward, but you could just outplay your opponent and it was a much safer way to win.
---
&gt;  Undead couldn't use Sacrifical Skull to creep with Ziggurats or Rod of Necromancy to tank with skeletons and were massively disadvantaged as a result. 
---
See, when you say things like these last two quotes, I find it hard to believe that you ever played RoC at any sort of competitive level.  DK/fiend and DL/ghoul were both \*very\* efficient at creeping.  Now if you want to say that UD was at a mild disadvantage for fast expanding, well yes, that's true.  But fast expos were just another aspect of the strategy of the game; get caught by a competent opponent before your expand is up and you probably lose unless they're also fast expanding.  Then it was "who does a better job of keeping their expo up".  And the trade-off to being worse at fast expanding was that you were far harder to harass than any other race.  Regardless, UD creeping was fine.
---
&gt; There really is 0 reason to ever play ROC over TFT. TFT is better in every aspect - 1v1, team games, custom games and campaign. 
---
Agree to disagree.  I'd take old RoC over release TFT any day of the week and twice on Sunday for any sort of rated matches.  As far as custom games go, I never really got into any customs on TFT, but RoC had plenty of amazing custom maps.  I was a huge fan of Wintermaul TD, 11th Hour, and of course, DotA.  DotA did kind of launch an entire genre of games.  I'd call that a winner over anything TFT had, but really, everyone's entitled to their opinion.  Campaigns, well, who cares?  The campaigns are always easy and it's a very limited form of gameplay.  There's no real strategy to it, you know what the AI is going to do, it's usually just overcoming a unit deficit.
---
Oh, and I'm sure YOU will be the one to tell us when it's "reasonably balanced", right?
---
thanks bb
---
Back in the days I grinded my way from 52-60 with a rogue. A good level would take about 4 hours.
---
You're talking about PvP servers. Normal and RP servers had that ability. And I know, which is why I said it was a pserver, where it is very easy to create a new account for free.
---
It's a private server, probably took 2 minutes to create a second account.
---
Warmane allowed the player to use the WoD models in their Wotlk server if they wanted to so it's possible.
---
No but everyone agrees that the orc racials are over the top
---
Well, Locks are definitely not the most affected in a BG setting. Warlocks just have to put Demon Armor on which is 1k1 Mana. As a comparison, Priests (healers/hybrids), for pretty much the same manapool, will have to buff Power Word : Fortitude (1k7 mana) + Inner Fire (310 mana) + Divine Spirit (970 mana) and normally also Shadow Protection (650 mana), which is 3k5 mana, over 3 times more than Warlocks.
---
In WPvP it's something else, then again, unless you're unlucky, there's no reason to have to jump right in after rezing in the open world, which isn't the case in BGs. Warlocks have it relatively well.
---
Ahh yes I am, my mistake. Thanks for the correction sir
---
Just want all of it for my leather worker.
---
No problem my dude. Happens to the best.
---
I hope they don’t “balance” anything. We don’t need another e-sports WoW.
---
Least IMPressive
---
Get fucked noob
---
I guess I couldn’t imagine someone being so triggered about getting killed they’d make a second account just to message their killer🤣
---
You're a fucking punk, dude.
---
We used to ms in raids in vanilla. This is just 1.12 debuffs change makeing ms stay instead of dropping off
---
If it is a completely balanced game you are after, I think you should go play BFA. They believe it or not, do a great job of balancing classes, atleast in pvp. The problem is that atleast for me, balancing things too well often removes the fun and unique aspect of different classes / races. Classic is not supposed to be balanced, it is supposed to be fun.
---
What....? I was just suggesting something...
---
Are they planning to tank dungeons tho? :\^)
---
Hello, fellow WoW veterans!
---
I'm starting this group as a contribution to the community!
---
This is a group where you share, discuss and get information about the release (for now).
---
https://www.facebook.com/groups/346507426221783/
---
This will also be an arena for socializing and recruitment, pre/post-launch.
---
it's pretty fresh as of now, but hopefully the community will come in strong. anything can be the topic, as long as it is within the fine lines of Classic WoW. Memes are also welcome!
---
You really should go for something with a dedicated graphics card..
---
No
---
I had changed by TBC, had my first job and life was less stressful.
---
Perklunt, Grim, laintime.
---
Anyone know where to get original hq versions of these? I cant find anything remotely watchable. Just movies reuploaded a million times
---
Onboard graphics card is just like a no no for any game. Can it run it? Yeah probably but it won’t be enjoyable. The rest of it’s specs are ok but those intel hd on board cards are turbo bad.
---
“Everyone agrees”
---
Seems to be none of those agreeing in this post
---
I remember using the dungeon maps from PC Gaming magazin all the time. My 12 year old self was so proud to be able to guide dungeon groups.
---
In classic does stranglethorne vale host the fishing competitions every sunday or is it at a later patch?
---
Vinosity reporting in ras, great vid bud
---
Arms is viable for raiding but the min-maxers will burn me at the stake soon.
---
Internal 620 can handle it, but that’s it. 
---
I have it myself - old 1.12 client is giving 55fps outside on full settings. 
---
New client plays aswell with well reduced settings, playing in wsg didn’t give problems. 
---
It will be enough for me to spend 5-10 hours max per week when Classic comes out.  
---
Not sure how raids would be handled though...
---
But I didn’t have a choice when picking ultraportable which I wanted. If i did - I would pick a dedicated card to forget about troubles and constant reduction of settings once I start moving to cities.
---
Just compare beast slaying with hardiness...
---
People do not agree because they are all orc mains

&gt; killing me when I was low HP
---
This constitutes as light griefing imo
---
&gt; Yeah. I will be maining dwarf rogue and dwarf paladin once classic comes out.
---
Nice, I hope we get to play on the same server, that way when I put 5 points into iron will, I'll get to mess you up even harder.

**Semi-Hardcore | PvP | NA | Faction: Alliance**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"** Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;**...
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role and have an understanding of each encounter.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Have the desire to coordinate with other members, and have a good time! 
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, have fun and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week; **Wednesday** and **Thursday**.
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than **8:15PM EST.**
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around **10:00PM EST** for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than **11:45PM EST.**
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
**OTHER FAQ's:**
---
Q: **Do you accept social players that may not be able to raid?**
---
A: Very much so! We aim to make this a family friendly guild, but at the same time progressing firmly in the PvE content of Classic.
---
Q: **What other plans do you have for Classic besides raiding?**
---
A: Our members have already been discussing this. Ideas include, but are not limited to: fishing contests, 1v1/2v2/5v5 duels, hide-n-seek in Ironforge, Quiz Time in guild chat, World PvP and taking over a horde town, screenshot contests, costume contests, guild farm groups, weekly lottery, rat races, treasure hunts, and more! All with prizes that benefit the players as well as the guild.
---
Q: **How many members do you have?**
---
A: As of the time of writing this up, we currently have about 110 members. And of those, about 100 have identified what class and role they wish to play.
---
Q: **Are you using Loot Council or some other form of looting?**
---
A: We will be using EPGP in conjunction with ranking priority (if you show up and perform well for 95% of the raids, you are rewarded with the "Zealot" rank which has priority when it comes to loot over the "Member" rank.) We will not be using Loot Council, other than the fact that Thunderfury will be going to the main tank.
---
The overall goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their “second home,” away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. We've taken our years of experience from leading prior guilds and poured everything that was effective into Always East. Please reach out via a direct message through the reddit forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460, Kegg#8900** or **Vexlander#9572** ) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

Orders stand: ***“Be Excellent!”***

There's a whole priority list of debuffs in Vanilla WoW. The debuff cap for Classic will start at 16 debuffs per mob no more no less. Since you only have so many debuffs slots most 40 man raid groups only allow players to put on specific debuffs. A Warlock, for example, will get a spot for Curse of Elements and depending on the rest of the raid comp and spec may get a debuff slot for Corruption, or they might not. Now Curse of elements is a high priority buff and Corruption is of middling priority. Corruption does not stack and the higher rank will overwrite the lower rank, or state that a more powerful curse is already active when attempting to cast a lower rank Curse with the higher rank active.  Now there will be a number of fury warriors in your raid that on crit will apply Deep Wounds to the target. Deep Wounds is a low priority debuff and will constantly be overwritten by the Warlock's higher priority Curses.
---
Camping someone in stealth and waiting for them to get low HP before firing 3 shots to kill them isn't PvP in my mind, that's just shitty play. I'd you want to do that, that's up to you but to me that's just being a ass.
---
Not any different from Trade Chat or literally any online community.
---
If you get easily triggered by what randos say in a chat screen, then maybe...
---
This is amazing to read. Hunters are the worst, then rogues, then mages.
---
I was thinking the same to roll NE and I could get other weapons since maces and swords are mostly given to humans anyway. Sure, it doesn't eliminate all of the fight for gear but it lessens a bit.
---
I'm old school. I bind my 1-10 keys with the heals I want and I'm done. No complaints.
---
It‘s a good racial but most people don‘t understand it properly. 
---
It increases base stun from 15% to 18.75% and not to 40% like many think. It might be wrong on private servers.
---
If you keep killing someone again and again, especially if there is a significant level difference, it becomes griefing. Sure everyone has his own definition of when that is the case, but I guess we can all agree on the concept.
---
Personally I kill players only once. Unless they attack or provoke me.
---
Hey man, I’m super interested in being a ranged warrior. I love manually clicking the shoot button. Lots of people complain that I basically do negative dps but they are just elitists. 
---
Do you have any tips on how to best play my ranged warrior?  
---
I’m going to stack agility for that sweet ranged ap.  Anything else I should know?
---
Yes it is
---
i'm going with my OG names since luckily i just go by an abbreviated version of it now. classic game, classic name
---
Do you have a source on this claim?
---
Thanks man I wanna try to continue to fill that niche. 
---
1) My favorite for solo PvP is definitely night elf. Every 3 minutes I can 1v1 a t2/HWL warrior with elunes grace lol. Shadowmeld is underrated due to out of combat necessity but I use it so much. My favorite is star shards though, the damage is actually fantastic and it's of course arcane school, so if it gets kicked I can freecast anything. Rogues kick it the most since they can't get resealths against it since it goes around LOS.  
---
That being said, for group PvP scenarios (so most as a priest) I would definitely go with dwarf. Forget fear ward which is obviously great, but stoneforming blinds and more importantly honestly viper sting is so good. I will be going dwarf in classic
---
2) It depends what you mean by disc spec. If you mean power infusion, I would say tri spec and PI are equally good from a PvP perspective  but just in different ways. I personally would prefer the PI spec becauase dispell, mana burn, and MC are enough utility for me. I like deep healing and buffing.  If you mean what I'm running (26/25/0) vs tri spec, tri spec is definitely better from purely a 1v1 and high end premade perspective. I chose the disc/holy route for two main reasons though: I wanted to be extremely mana efficient, and rank 13 gear has 0 spirit. I also chose it most importantly because I wanted to be as realistic as possible to classic as the server would permit. In other words, I didn't want to play shadow priest in full BWL gear and just destroy everything because it's rare many spriests would even get that gear on live. I wanted to play a general raiding spec that I would use on classic to obtain raiding gear so that I could PvP with it, and I didn't wanna feel gimped switching over to classic and playing a non OP spec. 
---
Hope this thoroughly covers everything. Thanks so much for watching!
---
Oh yeah I remember that. Especially in WotLK, where pvp mages stacked haste like crazy, Polymorph became so fast, it was a really good way to interrupt. Even more so will troll berserk on top of it.
---
The snowd in Winterspring, and the sandstorms in Tanaris actually made it pretty hard to see sometimes. Loved it, though.
---
Depending on server population my plan B is a beast-heavy grinding run.
---
Plenty of high mob density, low player presence secluded spots out there for those who don't mind grinding (mostly) beasts.

 **&lt;TBD&gt; {Alliance PvP} {West Coast Semi-Hardcore} {LC}**    
---
**What are our goals?**   
---
We will be a fun but serious guild working to clear content in a fast and effective manner. We won't be chasing server firsts but we do intend to be among the top guilds on the server, and compete for world bosses and fastest raid clear times. We will be an active part of shaping the classic community on our server.    
---
We will be active in pvp but members are not obligated to participate. World pvp and groups will be encouraged. We plan to start premades when the first BG's are released.    
---
**Why should you join us?**   
---
We have a strong core of knowledgeable and skilled officers to allow the guild and raids to run smoothly. Our officers have experience with all vanilla content, and our raid leader has previously lead a guild to success in Naxx, downing Kel’Thuzad before TBC was released.   
---
Raid times are favorable for all NA timezones.  They will be Saturday and Sunday from Noon PST - 4 pm PST.    
---
**Want to know more?**   
---
If you are interested in joining or would like more information please message me (Kicharan) directly. We accept casuals and strictly PvP'ers. Very much seeking out **Hpally, Warlock, and Fury.**
---
Thanks for spelling it out for me! Really appreciate it. That makes more sense.
---
There is a lot of unfair in vanilla wow.
---
Go rogue man. Energy so you don’t have to wait on mana. Stealth. Great dps. The best in pvp if you ever want to get into that. Best looking T2 set. And really ez learning curve.
---
You can do that by yourself normally, but you'll have to modify the game files. People already do that on PServers, and everything is downloadable on the internet.
---
There were people in Vanilla who used changed models, like this guy who took a Blood Elf model when BC was annouced :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_tE2dbmyYjs&amp;t=1237s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tE2dbmyYjs&amp;t=1237s)

As for sounds, there's this guy on PServ who did put between others porn sounds in his gaming files :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUAI6ABS3-U&amp;t=73s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUAI6ABS3-U&amp;t=73s)  
---
Togglable option ? Not probable, these are completely different game files, it's not like an addon you have somewhere in a dormant state which you can simply choose to activate.
---
Do what you enjoy more homie
---
Do paladin undead spells work on Forsaken?
---
It‘s simply the way it worked and how it is worded. Same for all talents that work the same way.
---
Mage or warlock
---
Hunter too but less dps and you have to kite
---
Swifty’s best of each class/warrior tricks video.
---
they might have changed it at some point, but originally you even had to fight your own pet over KBs
---
I remember they patched fear so it had bigger chance on breaking on damage, any remember what patch it was?
---
I ^guess ^^they ^^^never ^^^miss, ^^^^huh.
---
Man thins made me laugh just before a section meeting at my university, then I had a very shitty meeting with shitty people who want to do shitty things while thinking they are not shitty
---
Alcheeeeemyyyyy
---
Yeah barrens chat on X ps last year during launch was disgusting. I honestly kinda quit the server because of how poorly moderated it was. Felt like I was on 4chan and made me sad lol.
---
Of course but if your going to have them for end level (gathering) then it’s smart to.  Ya you don’t *need* to, but you’re pretty dumb if you don’t

There are a few addons that make it work that could be remade. So theoretically yes.
---
Damm pets fault .. come here you stupid pet that made me right click the boss , bad coding devs
---
Questing is a lot faster than grinding in the early levels.
---
First it did, at some point they changed to melee
---
it will be really useful if each pattern has a link to any vanilla DB
---
Ooooh, I misunderstood. I thought you mean start tailoring/mining. Yeah that's a better idea. Hoard the cloth and level engineering. I bet trying to hoard all the ores for engineering would be tougher.
---
So accurate it hurts me in my soul
---
I would recommend Mage or Warlock. Hunters tend to have more roles than simply DPS in raids. But Mages and Warlocks just need to DPS. 
---
Warlocks does need to farm soulshards for health stones and summoning but it's not something that'd risk you wiping the raid. 
---
They're both great DPS Warlocks being more gear dependant. 
---
Easy to level and generally fun to play.
---
Yeah. I heard that's the biggest reason to be a tailor. But I also heard there's a good chest, but I don't know what that is.
---
Indeed. I love WoW, but I have zero interest in watching someone else play it. Maybe the last minute or something of a world first kill would be interesting, but beyond that, watching others play WoW is boring. That said, with games like Cities and Factorio, it can be fascinating to watch other people play and its also a treasure trove of new ideas that you can use and modify for your own purposes. I consider that to be doing research, while at the same time being entertained. Learning by doing is king, but sometimes there are just super simple ways of doing things that you'd never have thought up yourself but seem glaringly obvious once someone else does it.
---
Hello, Fellow WoW veterans!
---
There's alot of you that feel the urge to google 'Classic WoW' ever so often.. myself included!
---
To combat this, i've decided to create a group, where you can go to share, or get the latest news regarding the release. Or if you already collected the latest news, you can discuss various WoW topics, maybe get some friends for the launch - perhaps recruit guildies.. whatever you may want to do!
---
It's not correlated to any private servers!**

If you struggle getting 100g at level 40 then selling all cloth might be in your interest. There are better ways to make gold, though. But you need some experience and effort to pull them off.
---
I think you meant to say it's smart play. Why rush like an idiot and risk yourself being killed when you can outsmart your opponent and always win.
---
So then, we're on the same page. Thanks for agreeing.
---
im glad it won't be there. cheaters can fuck right off.
---
Rogues are not even close to being best in pvp, not in solo or premade
---
Holy shit. We get a week a year and you get your first week after 2 years with the company. However you also get 40 hours of paid time off which they can deny if they really need you to work:
---
Implying having healbot is cheating 🙄
---
Even phones and tablets are stronger now I think  :)
---
As far as I know it's flat because Orc warriors tend to combine it with Iron Will and it's even more op like that lol.

Hi, we're an easy going, fun loving guild, who plan to explore every nook and cranny of Classic and be in the first 5 guilds to clear naxx.
---
We currently have 25 players committed, and are on pace for 175 players by late June.  
---
We acknowledge that the first to every benchmark will be [dedicated try hards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y50I4KI_o9c). Our goal is to maximize fun, and while winning is definitely a lot of fun, it's even more fun to win as a team without some [annoying officer whining about that time you got hit by a raid boss's ability, or missed your interrupt, w/e.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lo9kmcEw0w)  
---
We're going to support each other while leveling, we're going to pool our resources so everyone can have their mount at 40, if you're roleing warrior or another class hard to level, we're going to pair you with someone who can make leveling more efficient (pet classes and druid do well on their own).  
---
When it's time for raid content, we're going to make you watch youtube videos on all the engagements and write a test to prove you know your stuff, and we'll make sure your gear/consumables means we have a chance at clearing. Once that's out of the way, it's all good. No pressure, lots of laughs, wipe often and have an amazing time.  
---
We believe a positive enjoyable raiding experience will keep players coming back, and keep the guild strong all the way through to endgame.  
---
So all are welcome, we don't have dedicated PVPers right now, but if you'd like to join and create a subdivision for PvP you are more than welcome to do so.  
---
We currently meet on a discord server, PM me and I'd be happy to add you.
---
The only armor and weapons worth keeping early on are the "bis" twink items for the 19,29, &amp;39 brackets.
---
They are always cheap, or relatively cheap like the pendulum of doom, tiger strike mantle, etc. And then inevitably skyrocket in price months down the road.
---
If you are planning on building a twink, definitely keep an eye on the ah for those boe items you need when they are dirt cheap. You either save yourself enormous amounts of gold, or can wait a couple months for phase 2 and 3 and flip them.
---
Welcome to the healing community :)
---
Plus the mages keep sheeping my multishots!
---
So happy that this time around I will know what the difference between a PvE and PvP server will be. PvE all the way.
---
Gnome racial is a game changer against mages and druids. Should it be nerfed as well?
---
Forsaken racial is game changer against priests and warlocks. Should it be nerfed as well?
---
Guards!!! A PvE player!!!

---
"In your opinion" doesn't matter however. What is griefing and what isn't, is defined by Blizzard.
---
Definition of griefing as defined here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer :  
---
&gt;A griefer or bad faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game (trolling), using aspects of the game **in unintended ways.**
---
_"in unintended ways"_ is key here. Killing other players (regardless of level or current hp) is not an unintended use of the game on a PvP server.
---
You probably think that gankers are assclowns, and I agree with you here.  
---
But they are not griefers. The game allows being that kind of assclown.
---
it obviously is. makes healing accessible to monkeys.
---
Blood and thunder
---
Classic is about the adventure, just do all the quests, world PVP, raid Crossroads/ Ashenvale  invade the Undeadcity try to get inside the Ironforge throne room if you never done it before, spend a week pvping in Darkshore and SV just Enjoy the game this is not a race to end game because you wont be able to solo anything at end game.
---
These images are awesome! Thanks.
---
We do agree on the concept. however, our opinions are not the ones that matter, as outlined elsewhere in response to u/Onadaislandinadasun 's post.
---
Please spend the exact same amount of money building a desktop instead. The difference is night and day
---
The wording would mean its additive if anything, mr "simply the way it worked". Also where does the 15% base come from? I've never heard of anything besides 5% mentioned in old comments from 2006 but no real source.
---
Great chart! Could definitely plan out an entire route(s) of beast leveling based on those.
---
See, I was almost certain that if I were to play a mage, I'd have to kite a lot, which I'm not really fond of. It's one doing it in a BG/PVP, but just the idea of wiping on a certain boss because of me, and costing other 39 players their time, gold and buffs... ugh.
---
As for the warlocks, I bet that can be a bit annoying, but in all fairness, I don't mind doing all that pre-raid work,
---
It's a tough decision to make, but nevertheless, thank you for posting. &lt;3
---
Wotlk turned the game into easy mode centered around accumulating purples with no sense of accomplishment. Its the xpac that put wow on the road to where it is today so I wouldnt include that in the picture.
---
"Yours" a.k.a shared with all the other NEETs who hit 60 in two weeks.
---
Even if you rush to 60 (which I will), there will be plenty of other people who are doing the same. You'll have people to play with. If you're smart, you'll farm devilsaur leather or other methods of getting your epic mount.
---
Good job!
---
The real question being  why would you do that?
---
/laugh
---
Only one i can think of is the Ezio trilogy. But this is definitely far in first place.
---
Do you have any proof of it working like that though? I would like to believe you but there seems to be alot of misremebering going on regarding classic.
---
Redridge is contested on the p server I play. It's the biggest cluster fuck ganking zone I've ever seen. Worse than STV right now, mostly because I feel like STV has at least some similar level range pvp situations where as red ridge has been ??s one shotting everyone.
---
You won't be kiting bosses as a Mage, it's of course a different story in PvP. 
---
Farming soulshards takes generally 30-40 minutes so it's not the toughest thing to do. 
---
They're both great at leveling, PvP and PvE. So you really can't go wrong with either class.
---
Yea dps life is the life, no worries Hakuna matata.
---
No, I meant to say it's being an ass. But that's my opinion, your entitled to yours.
---
I will lvl faster than u and counter-gank you
---
Fixing something that is innately badly designed for a simple quality of life change is not moving the goal post NOR perfection. It would make anyone running a guild happy to have a guild bank. It would make SENSE. They added it later as it was clearly needed.
---
Things like pve dungeon ques kill the community component. That makes sense to avoid that one. I just do not understand why so many people are against a few little QoL tweaks.
---
It is known...
---
It's a much easier competition still.
---
TBC had an upgraded macro API.
---
As a nightelf, how far will I have to quest in which zones until I reach the honored discount for the Darnassus mount vendor?
---
Cant even fall through the floor in retail now :(
---
&gt; AAP is an extremely popular addon that's supposed to make you level faster, by automating some of the gameplay for you.
---
I believe they already said that they will make changes to the API to limit the addon automation, like for example healbot and decursive.
---
Well how undergeared are we taking, blues fighting t2? 
---
For the most part as long as you keep your weapon relevant you can get by with your gear being a little behind, also depends what classes your friends are playing, if you have a holy paladin behind you it's a bigger force multiplier than say a Hunter
---
But if you play a dwarf rogue, does it cancel the immunity the Horde gave you as a nice race?
---
To clarify I don't think any action should be taken against players that do things like this. Or players that mind control people off of cliffs. Absolutely not. It's just tiresome and annoying to be a victim of and at some point you just take a break and come back in half an hour or so when your oppressor has left. To me, that's purposely creating a bad player experience for one specific player and I would call that griefing but like you said, that's my opinion. I stated that in my post as well and as you said, ultimately our personal opinions don't matter in this case.
---
I actually draw parallels between WoW and D&amp;D. With Paladin being your your old-school Cleric (or Devotion Paladin if you prefer the 5th edition) and Shaman being your old-school Ranger (or Ancients Paladin in 5e).
---
Basically Holy Crusader vs the Green Knight. And we all know who won that one.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green\_Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Knight)
---
I had a similar experience on pserver. I was in STV trying to do the naga quest with my druid when prot warrior (don't ask me why) about 8-9 levels above started to gank the living shit out of me till I had to leave the place. About five days later I was in Un'goro doing the the gorilla cave quest when I saw him there. This time I was 2 levels above him. Needless to say I ganked him till he had to spirit ress. Felt so fcking satisfying. Good times.
---
I don't think I would all the way, but I know it's one pretty efficient way to have some gold for mount and skills while leveling
---
I miss the old Blizzard :(
---
The proof can only come when we have a beta or after release. 
---
I think this was also discussed in one of the last Good Morning Azeroth podcasts.
---
[They did indeed.](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2494)
---
I'm happy to hear that. I did use Healbot in TBC, but if my memory serves me right - it didn't actually automate the healing then. All it did was a raid frame + mouseover macros. Was Healbot a fully automated service in vanilla?
---
When accounts are free, why not make a account for a bank alt so you can log onto your bank alt and your character at the same time?
---
That's a great feeling. You're gonna have a blast!

**\[H\] \[EU-PvE\] &lt;The Muffin Vendor&gt;**
---
Hello there!
---
“The Muffin Vendor” is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We’re going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn’t mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!
---
We’re a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I’m sure a lot of others have. We’ve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we’re all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla’s endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
While we have the “basic stepstones” covered (such as a MT and a minimum amount of healers/dpsers), we still have plenty of room for additional people.
---
What we’re looking for are mainly dedicated players. Which means, if you have the passion to keep on playing, and the willingness to show it in your commitment (i.e. show up for raids and group content, bring consumables, improve your game and so on), then you’re the kind of person we want to invite in our guild.
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
· A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we’ll go far!
---
· Consumables. We’re not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefis/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
· English – or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We’re currently planning to have at least three weekly raids. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there’s only MC/Ony and people don’t have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we’re planning to begin our raids at 8-9 PM server time (depending on players’ availability). Exact days/hours will be set in stone once we get closer to Classic WoW’s release date and our ranks are properly filled.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to pop by on the discord server. When joining you’ll have a temporary rank and only see a public chat to counter any potential shenanigans.
---
Discord: discord.gg/mucN4Du
---
Yes I agree 100%
---
I've been playing PC games since Doom and Duke Nukem, and the one thing I loved the most over the years was updated graphics.  We were always excited about new games just to see the awesome graphics.
---
I don't understand why people are all #nochanges about the graphics.  I can understand #nochanges about the game play, spells, talents, mechanics for sure.  That's why I love Vanilla.  But I would definitely much rather have updated graphics.  Make my old game look awesome...yes please.
---
Also say no to your brain, which already knows where to go for many of the quests
---
No, they aren't the same thing, but it's really just a matter of degrees
---
Right now she's leaning toward a human rogue or a Nelf hunter.
---
Why the hell would they get rid of weather effects?! Bring em back now, itd help with immersion
---
I enjoyed playing a rogue back in the days. Even though I never reached level 60, I did have a lot of fun leveling and wpvp-ing. Knowing that I wouldn't have to do anything "special" during the raid makes me wanna play it again, but I feel like everyone and their grandma will be rolling a rogue. :3
---
Anywho, thank you for posting. :\*
---
I’ll definitely use this if it’s available for classic.
---
Yeah I completely agree. Its funny what you said about being told exactly where to go and exactly what to do could ruin her experience - that's BFA and modern WoW right there. Figuring it out is a huge part of the fun!
---
A lot of us had windows xp machines for a few years by that point, which doesn't feel like dark age technology yet.
---
Or you're really bad at shaman.
---
Judging by the downvotes, I reckon the latter
---
With two accounts you could, and also i will admit I rage deleted a level 30 just to make a level one to whisper someone with before, on a server I had rerolled on with no other alts
---
Yeah, that's why the majority of marriages end in devorce, at the expense of the man I might add.
---
It's fine, some people get off on pain, some people are so hopelessly dependent that they can't stand to spend even a moment outside the company of others.  Do what makes ya happy I guess.
---
Whatever trips your trigger, you know, different strokes for different folks and all that.
---
Am I the only one getting stressed out from watching that gif?
---
Accurate though.
---
Absolutely. Its not fun unless you own the process.
---
That's awesome huge gz.
---
I walked away because I couldn't get the feeling vanilla,tbc and wotlk had. It was just gone. It felt so not those 3 xpacs 
---
But I'm going back in. All my friends are returning. It's going down.
---
Wish I could appreciate this meme. All I think about is how Sylvanas burned down Teldrassil for edgelord factor and how the world leaders are SJWified.
---
"Decurse me FFS"
---
"Damnit Jim, I'm a priest, not a shaman"
---
Hi,
---
Played a feral druid myself back in those days as a 16 year old kid! Had a reserved spot in a premade as flag carrier, one of the best times i ever experienced however i got to rank 11 and was pushing forward my account got hacked and lost honor progression and couldnt be bothered to push it further.
---
If u want high end pvp gear you need to be dedicated for sure and cannot do it on social base.
---
But the nice thing of vanilla is that you can pvp with decent pve gear.

But shamans doesn't have to cast anything to kill you. He can start with Purging all your buffs, then toss down a grounding totem, then just spam earth shock all the time so you can't cast for shit, then a fire totem that decreases your efficiency in spell casting, and if he gets low, a quick Nature's Swiftness + Healing wave should get him back to full again.
---
A good shaman wouldn't even let you polymorph him. He has several silences and spell disruptions available at his toolkit, you have one.
---
It was quite fun, helped people out with quests and such. Also alt f4 is the answer to everything
---
When your camera goes through a lot of effects (waterfalls/mist/lava?/smoke/etc) it still tanks to all fucking hell.  Granted i have my shit cranked pretty high, but under normal circumstances I want to say im running at like...60% GPU and nowhere even remotely close to max on my CPU and it can get *bad*.
---
And actually....i think that normally happens in raids where i have everything set to run at 7/10 (normally im damn near maxed on everything).  Its crazy how bad it can get sometimes just from having your camera aimed just wrong.

Drakedog made me fall in love with the warlock class and many helmets was tmogged to red scarfs. [https://youtu.be/Wk-EFIEmCv4](https://youtu.be/Wk-EFIEmCv4)

---
It would probably be really bad.  Just from what I've seen of regular use it's bad.  I imagine a PC game would be worse.
---
Get a really long video cable or put the PC by the TV and get a wireless keyboard/mouse.
---
Another thing to watch out for is during vanilla there was a cap for splash reputation. It was removed at some point however I don't have a source for it's removal, though it was likely in 2.0.1 in the pre-tbc patch with all the other reputation changes.
---
&gt; What is REALLY upsetting is the lack of the reputation spillover after &gt; 1/2 honored. It does not make any sence story-wise as well, in fact it contradicts it!
---
&gt; So i started at Teldrassil at level 1, and did only darnassus quests, and now i am stuck at 7/8 honored at level 35. None of the IF/SW/GM quests give ANY credit to Darnassus!
---
&gt; Supposedly, if you stick to the story and common sence the night elves should appreciate the fact that every single quest was completed (and i do mean EVERY SINGLE ONE, AT YELLOW too!). and should get an extra rep boost.
---
&gt; I think blizzard should implement a bonus rep, for example if all faction quests in a zone are completed. That would at least make some logical sense. 
---

Thanks for the insight! Btw just a tip for the viper sting spam: https://classicdb.ch/?item=3386 This potion is cheap and can be spammed on yourself to remove the sting. It only has an internal cd of 2 or 3 seconds. Plus it doesn't trigger the 2 minute potion cd.
---
Same
---
I tried it a few years ago and there was like a 1-2s input lag. But if you can connect it to the TV with an HDMI cable then it should be fine. Maybe the wireless things are better now but I'm guessing you'll still have a noticable amount of lag.
---
There are add-ons made to make a kill list on enemy players to make sure when you see one that you realize who it is and what he has done to deserve getting resskilled.
---
Damn you just persuaded me to roll Orc warrior.
---
My only problem with the potion is that it replaces the skybox, which really sucks.
---
I actually think BfA zones look pretty decent at night.  I wish there was an item i could use to make it 10-20% darker (though not as dark as the potion), but things have gotten better.
---
Wow that is nuts! I usually just use restorative potions but I will definitely be checking these out today, thank you.
---
What cinematics? I've been skipping the intro one for years.
---
One of the things people complain a lot about is the less-than-optimal itemization on many items in Vanilla.
---
As frustrating as that can be, it allows the devs to spread out the "good stuff" with the right stat combinations over many instances; a lot of bosses will drop sub-optimal gear. So, new instances/zones need not have outright more powerful gear to be interesting.
---
With that said, I really think it's better not to mess with Classic for the foreseeable future. Vanilla had a pretty well balanced amount of content, the players had plenty of stuff to do but they weren't spread out too thin.
---
I never landed on a permanent gamer-tag until I further bastardized my already bastardized WoW character name. Character is Balanor, old guildies called me "Balanub," so I came up with "BattleNub."
---
Alot of BIS in there
---
&gt;really that ~~bad~~ good?  
---
Update:
---
 After some consideration, she has picked two toons she want to try out. The first is a Human Rogue. The second is a Night Elf Hunter. She has expressed her dislike for PvP, so we will play on a PvE server. 
---
I will most likely just roll a warrior wherever she wants to go to help fill a support role reducing grouping up time for dungeons. This will be my alt I will only play with her.
---
I will then continue with business as usual and roll my other two toons in a PvP server and play them whenever she isn't interested in playing. 
---
This feels good.
---
I remember nothing being off limits in Barren Chat. I think a lot of it had to do with A. The personality type that rolled horde prolonged with B. The amount of time so many varying levels stay together in the zone. The only thing I remember truly triggering someone was saying “reported” if you engaged in the chat. Simply saying that would get you a lot of “hey wtf man!” kind of whispers. I rolled a horde to level specifically to check out my servers Barrens chat and was totally worth it. So, for me, yes this is very accurate.
---
Miss me with titanforging, give me those sweet Master's cloth greens of Shadow Wrath.
---
Ouch, yeah I have 30 days, which I got from day one. On top of having incredibly lax rules regarding sick leave, parental leave, sick kid leave etc. I mean if you are a parent of three kids with a stable job that's not too dependant on you, you could live for years barely working.
---
I've done the whole full immersion thing multiple times on private servers. I'll use anything to speed it up this time around.
---
&gt; I don't ask for it to be removed from the menu; I simply don't order it.
---
That's a horrible analogy. You're **literally** removing PvP. There's no ordering it or not, because it's a crucial design of the game.
---
This is a better analogy;
---
You go to the restaurant to order their famous steak dish. This dish is designed to include potatos, broccoli, a well medium-rare steak and some sauce.
---
You tell the chief to *LEAVE OUT* the broccoli and potatos, only leaving you with the steak and sauce.
---
THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO THIS GAME
---
Level as shadow priest but main as a disc. I understand holy, I just don't like it.
---
I think he's thinking of quick heals. Which heals the lowest hp target for you automatically
---
If you have the patience and luck to get them. If an item can get the animal suffixes then getting the wrath and alike ones is a big RNG wheel. But at least it's interesting/profitable content ;)
---
love it, lol +1

Don’t use it? I think you’re a bit too worried. Auto pilot won’t enable you to solo the various elite group quests scattered around, and with quest text I imagine most people read them as they’re travelling to the quest location, it’s what I do.
---
Vanilla had leveling guides as well. Ultimately nobody is saying you need to get it.
---
+1 to you too sir
---
My biggest memory from ST was being in on of those god forsaken tunnels where you would have patrolling mobs and the tank suddenly disconnected.. i just remember that feeling of "oh we are so fucked" lol
---
This :D
---
I wont be using it on Classic (at least at first), but the point of AAP is for people that have quested through those zones 20 times already and know the stories.  For people that have played on private servers for years, etc...meh.  I wont judge them for using it if its available.
---
The only reason i *havent* been using it on alts lately is ive never really been a 'read the quest text' kind of guy, and ive been really making an effort to do it lately to learn the stories/lore.
---
Well, since this post is about imagining your 'dream comp', it's kinda obvious that the group already would be geared. This is a post about finding the best configuration for PvE and PvP

-_- okay roll an Orc if you want to have an unfair advantage...
---
Yup, hunters are a huge pain in the dick to fight as a druid.
---
Did they ever actually do this though? Don't remember this ever being meaningful during vanilla or afterward.
---
Just don't install it.

Lets hope they follow that.

Played a lot in vanilla, then raided hardcore from Cata thru BFA. Skilled player but don’t have time to be in a hardcore guild. Looking for a relaxed, fun atmosphere with other people that are older with families or full time workers that don’t plan to hit 60 until a month after launch. But I want a guild that is organized, skilled, and experienced for raiding, and have serious raid stipulations, e.g. attendance, pre-raid bis, consumables, enchants, high performance, addons.
---
I see no problem with this addon in classic.
---
This. And after levelling a few times you've seen it all anyway, there's no reason to avoid having the addon unless it's your first run through.
---
u can't melee in between wand attacks. still a cute list.
---
I could be wrong, but I believe he is referring to “intentionality” - meaning that if you really intend NOT to do something, you take measures not to do it. Whereas if you genuinely don’t care if you do something you shouldn’t, you won’t be bothered not to do it. Therefore while maybe it wasn’t actually done intentionally, you have expressed the intentionality of doing it regardless of the consequences.
---
For instance, you often hear of this happening when a guy is cheating on a girlfriend or wife. Was it really a “mistake” or “accident” if he was off at a bar by himself flirting with some chick? You see, it’s not that he WOULD cheat, he simply demonstrated “intentionality” by putting himself in a position where he COULD cheat.
---
Wasn't there something like this available for classic anyway? Some add-on you had to pay for if I remember it was call xygor but I dunno if the classic version had a TomTom feature or if it was just a written guide.
---

---
"unintended ways" is hard to pin down.
---
World PvP obviously intended, otherwise no need for PvP realms.
---
Stalking someone for the express purpose of killing them when it's a sure thing? That's borderline.
---
Well what he described was definitely *light* griefing, just not a reportable offense.
---
Also, you are entirely ignoring that colloquialisms are a thing. Like come on, when someone says they "got raped by rogues in STVietnam" they don't mean it literally.   
---
You're way overreacting here.
---
wtf
---
To be fair, orc racial is a bigger factor against druids than gnome racial.
---
...fein death*
---
This is why im still not 100% sure i wanna roll Rogue in classic cuz as good a ganker rogues can be, you will never get these moments, your enemies wont see you.

Community is important to us, hence the reason we are all stoked for Classic.
---
You actually think a shaman can kill a mage by using earth shock every 6 seconds?
---
I’m sorry but you’re utterly clueless about vanilla pvp. And I don’t play a Shaman I play mage.
---
Well not exactly. That is helpful to understand the order of the books. I'm interested in maybe 1/2 books that are most helpful and then other resources to fill in the gaps.
---
Say NO to people telling you how you're supposed to enjoy the game
---
Vanilla “MD” was a hunters Aimed Shot (or Mages Pyroblast), followed by the warrior Charge/Taunt/Shield Slam - instant aggro combo!
---
In 10 years I've never healed a pet unless it was in an arena.
---
Paladin if you wanna play the best healer in the game (pve and pvp), priest if you want more utility (only offensive dispel on alliance, shadow preists are gods of 1v1 pvp at endgame, stam buff, better itemization etc).
---
If you're thinking of paladin I'd recommend trying pservers out to test a few things before diving in to retail classic.  That's what a lot of people seem to be doing right now.
---
Not on a PvP server. You cant be on a PvP server and consider every gank/engage under X amount of HP griefing. 
---
Thats not how open world war works.
---
All quests except Mankrik's wife, that is.
---
This makes me want to start a group of ppl able to be hired for STV protection lol
---
Still funny - but good hunters didn’t have to worry about topping DPS charts in TBC
---
If you haven't run the content before I also wouldn't use it, you miss out on so much of the game and story line that is just amazing.  
---
But in case you weren't aware you can disable all the auto things so you can still read the text or see cinematics.  Also this automation is on nowhere near the level of LFG/LFR, that is a totally different beast.  AAP is the equivalent of having the circles of quest zones on your mini-map with a hit of steroids.
---
But as someone who did all that blind 15 years ago as a holy/disc priest and as someone who misses the mechanics (stats, talents treees, community) of vanilla over the story... give me the quick leveling.
---
I definitely won't, and I get it that it's entirely a matter of choice (if AAP is even made available for Classic). But I would argue that once it's there, there will be a lot of peer pressure to use it, and many players that don't have prior vanilla experience would succumb. If AAP is a thing, it could have a negative impact on the community, even for those who don't use it, in the same manner that Gearscore was back in Wrath.
---
Two-handed elemental shaman for pvp. I can cast freely on you == you die. Come into melee range == you still die.
---
Being this sarcastic and bitchy about it DOES make you an elitist asshole, lol.
---
I suggest that you stop suggesting things
---
Now just make one for every class
---
I loved a good GM with a sense of humor like this
---
I’m going 29/11/11 Druid and want to DPS. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to be competitive in PVP. Especially since I won’t be allowed in raids lol
---
&gt; "unintended ways" is hard to pin down.
---
Not really. When something new that is technically possible within the game comes up, you ask Bklizzard "is this allowed?". If they say "yes", it's intended. If they say "no", it's not.
---
Intention is up to the people making the game, because it's their game.
---
You bet your sweet ass I’m installing the most complex quest helper there is, preferably one with speed runner input so I know I spend the least time as possible on boring ass shit
---
Base stun resist is 5% and the orc racial is additive not multiplicative, so you get a total of 30%
---
To add some more shaman specific ones:
---
Put grounding totem down early and walk just out of its range, go back into its range when your opponent is casting something you actually want to stop.
---
Put tremor totem out of LoS of you enemies as good players will kill it with their pets or wans before fearibg you. 
---
Your different totems all have set locations around you, turn you character certain directions to totem-stack making them harder to target.
---
Swap to flametounge/frostbrand against high armor targets for more dps.
---
Taunt totem (the name is escaping me) will pull rogues out of stealth. Searing totem can stop them from getting back into stealth.
---
You can effectively kite elites/rares with earthbind making solo killing them much easier.
---
Unsure if private server shenanigans but stormstrike debuff increases the damage of lightning shield while not consuming the debuff.
---
Holy shit I had no idea 98 and ME was supported.
---
I love that you can see the old Forums through the archive. Too bad the actual posts are all dead.

---
Now this brings me back
---
The addon does nothing that having a website up on your second monitor doesn't do equally well, and will be impossible to break unless you want to break almost every single other addon in the game.
---
It's an addon made to speed up leveling, in a game where leveling is a total waste of time (retail). If people want to use it in Classic too, then that's their own problem for ruining their own immersion. Leveling guides existed in vanilla too, nobody cares and nobody should care.

I didn’t know blind was considered a poison. Good to know!
---
You can on private servers though. Most (if not all) popular vanilla private servers allow you to make Horde and Alliance characters on the same PvP server.
---
Weird that nobody's mentioning that. You don't need two accounts when we're talking about pservers.
---
Hdmi. Easy and fast
---
Doesn't the blizzard or warcraft official site have a story going all the way back to Sargeras and leading through the events of WC3 and the expansion?
---
I feel like I remember reading through it when I was bored at work
---
Are you trying to get me to play Shaman?! Haha
---
Awesome you want to try a different perspective, i my self was a vanilla healer and now want to try the dps side.
---
The think back then was a lot of ppl thought that healing was for girls only and i did get my share of ridicule for it, but the only way i can explain what makes healing so great is that you actually have the power to make a big difference. I love being dps role aswell and have been in other expansions but at the end of the day it always makes me feel like i havent really accomplished much as oppossed to keeping ppl alive.
---
Years has past though since vanilla and today i think everyone respects a good healer cuz everyone now knows what important part they take in the raid.
---
Have fun trying it out, i was a priest in vanilla and happy to answer any questions if you have some.
---
I’m playing on a pserver right now as I wait for classic. It’s PvP, like all the highly populated pservers, and while it’s been a fun novelty I’ll be very glad to go back to PvE for the long haul. I had an undead warlock camp me in the tunnels between Loch Modan and Wetlands when I was making the death run on my nelf .
---
Maybe they are the best parts for how you want to play, but alot of people don't care about the immersion and leveling and lore, some people just want to get to 60, as that is where the game begins for them.
---
Like you said all it does is auto complete quests, once you have clicked and shows the best route. They still have to click and finds mobs and items
---
This is exactly what I am looking for! I had no idea about this and it is a very clever use of game mechanics
---
Oh Bruce!
---
Because then you’d have to trade items vs. instantly mailing them?
---

I read that last line in Hulk Hogan’s voice.

But ya, I agree with you too, I like the new models and animations etc. Except maybe the new shadowform. It’s too smokey and dirty.
---
Here's my time-preserved priest from vanilla:
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/nordrassil/festival
---
I believe the helmet you spoke off could drop from Skhowl in alterac mountains as well, even though wowhead does not seem to support that claim. Dungeons as a priest rule, there's so many nice spirit-based questrewards you can find
---
Yea :(
---
So curse of recklessness will stop humanoids from running for their lives at low health?
---
make sure you /spit
---
Hasn't everything we've seen so far used new graphics?
---
In PvP both caster specs rely on big crits that can happen. Shaman has the advantage of a hybrid ele/resto build so in some cases that respec cost saved as both caster DPS specs are bad in raids.
---
In PvE Shamans are totem utility and raid or single target healers (and Horde only). At best a raid will have 6-8 shamans, one per raid group. Some will be chain-healing the raid some will be on tank duty alongside druids and priests. Totems in raids get quite important.
---
In PvE Druids can heal, tank some or if addicted to pummelers also kitty DPS but without breaking the records - putting a lot of effort just to get decent DPS. Tanking is better while healing is the most polished role. They are rarely played and even if you would want to it's hard to get many druids into a raid. They have strong single target heal as well as HoTS but those don't stack/block other hots so HoTS healing with many druids in raid will get problematic. In PvP feral and feral/resto druids are also good for flag carry and stuff like that.
---
Ehhh I guess? World pvp easily but idk what rogues you were playing with man.
---
Is that pserver only?

Got me to make an Orc Warrior alt in TBC! Love those massively outnumbered world PvP battles, and the switching between warrior and druid perspectives.
---
I’m jealous! I’m the only provider as armed security with two dependents and I live less than comfortably on 60 hours a week
---
I think my response will be dictated by my experience. If I am ganked while leveling by higher level characters, I will always return the favor.
---
Side note: I was constantly ganked while leveling in vanilla. I will not be showing mercy in classic. Every. Horde. Must. Die.
---
Classic is going to be here for a while. I want to raid, and I need to level at a decent pace. I don't want to speed-level, mind you, just get to 60 by the 2-month mark. I'd use this for my main raiding toon to make sure I make that deadline, and then turn it off for any alts I level after it.    
---
Not everything is so black-and-white, my friend.
---
Tri-spec isn’t meant to do damage, you will be downranking all of your damage spells: they’re just used to CC (black out and/or mind flay slow). 
---
All of your mana will go to mana burn, offensive dispelling and healing (you will want to downrank your healing spells too to get the most out of your mana).
---
Like people have said before, this is not an easy spec to play, but if you play it capably it’s a very strong addition to organised PvP. You’ll also be annoying to play against in wPvP but won’t pose the same threat a SPriest does.
---
The issue I think with pservers is most every quest rewards the full 250 rep if done on correct level - in vanilla most quest did not give 250 and a lot of quests didn't give anything.
---
It wasn’t ever really a thing, it was a cool idea when Blizzard thought WoW would have at most 100,000 players, these things simply don’t scale.
---
Why do some people TRY to go an off spec?
---
"I'm a healer, not a fire extinguisher"
---
Those are rookie numbers. You gotta pump those numbers up!
---
If I go alliance I’m tempted. Levelling is genuinely fucking boring though
---
Warcraft I, II, and III. The story goes from WC III right into WoW I think. They put out some rule books when WoW launched for a PnP Warcraft game and there was a lot of lore in those I think.
---
I know there are quite a few people who want to get through the levelling process as quickly as possible so they can get to what they consider the real meat of the game - raiding. So, they will be happy to have addons like that. I don't know if such an addon would work in Classic, but I'm sure there will be addons of one sort or another that will help speed up the levelling process. And that's fine, if that's what they want. I'm glad they have ways to play the game their way.
---
I on the other hand, plan to level at as glacial a pace as possible. Probably the number one thing I've disliked in WoW nowadays is the speed at which you level up. I want it to be a journey. I want to explore and immerse myself in every zone. I want the anticipation of getting that first mount at level 40. I plan to never log out in an inn so as to minimise the amount of rested xp I gain. I want the journey to level 60 to take months. And I'm so glad that I will finally be able to play that way again when Classic launches.
---
I'm looking forward to the triangle bunnies, too. Somehow they're just cuter than the new models.
---
I genuinely LOL'd, gonna have to remember that one 🤣
---
Yeah it's a pserver bug.
---
Variation is the spice of life.
---
Nope, the realm forums were used more at first but even towards the end of Vanilla it became less and less of a thing also with TBC it pretty much died and other social media took their place, and when WoW was set on its way to 10m players it simply became unmanageable.
---
Ironically it seems that the community forums are more active now than they were in WoTLK and Cata, at least from a bystander point of view.
---
playing through the barrens on a private server, yeah no... its as baffling now as ever. I do agree with you otherwise tho.   
---
Part of me has hope that classic wow wont have it be that bad, as the playerbase is likely to be one of the most mature in any game ever - at least i dont recall any other game launch targeted at this old an audience. At said launch we will likely have plenty of whiners and bm'ers as 'outsiders' try out the game and later quit because they didn't get a novelty epic with their preorder, but down the line it could prove quite reasonable.
---
Which results in hunters showing up and nobody getting any quests done while level 60 healers stand around in major cities thinking, “fuck, that I’m not going out there.”
---
Show me on the doll where the bad AAP touched you. 
---
Really, many of us our in our 30s now, we ain't got time to screw around.  You better believe I'll be using AAP and whatever else will help. 
---
Have fun being immersed.  I'll be getting pre raid bis while you're still killing bandits in tanaris.

I have no intention of playing through those 3 games. I'm looking for resources that discuss the lore without having to play through the games.

Which API command are you even talking about? So far your post is just a word soup "what if the sky falls".

It’s going to be the same immature crowd just older
---
When you are the only level 60 in Darnassus, then a level 6 night elf passes by, stops, looks weirdly at you, and gets shocked by your mount and epic items
---
It took me just over 10 days with a human mage. I primarily did quests and had the occasional high level buddy run me through a dungeon.
---
I will give my unpopular opinion: I'm a huge hardcore fan of Vanilla, in 2007 I was already asking for Vanilla servers and I started playing Vanilla pservers in 2009, made it to most of the servers launch. The reason I love Vanilla so much is because of the atmosphere it provides, the social interactions, the never ending world, in fact, a MMORPG unlike retail. Yet, I believe gameplay is not an important part of Vanilla, I'll even say that it is bad, and you know what? I believe retail gameplay is better. Despite that, I still have 0 fun playing retail because of the reasons I mentioned before. Vanilla graphics are the main reasons I love playing Vanilla, updated graphics would ruin my experience. I don't even want optional modern graphics, it is a MMORPG, I HAVE to have the same experience as the other people around me. I don't want to be that guy playing with a VR headset in his own world while others see something totally different. I spent so much time throughout these years trying to get Vanilla servers debating on forums, getting something different than Vanilla would be a huge let down. Although I appreciate @Gurchen respecting each other's opinions.
---
Vanilla had rangecheck aswell with the same accuracy as retail does now (for hostile units).

 **&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
Hey everyone!
---
We are an Alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual".
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory.
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO.
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004.
---
**Raid Times (PST):**
---
​
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders.
---
**Membership:**
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move on. When they come back, its like they never left.
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100% sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have a full 40 members every raid.
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is great for members of our guild.
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals.
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

There was that poll on here once on what you are most looking forward to in Classic. Barrens chat was an option as a joke, but I voted for that seriously. Barrens chat is hype.
---
Lol this is just what most of the people sound like. I getting wanting to try new things but some of the ideas are just fucking stupid.
---
Okay, but those games, especially III, are the source for all the lore. If nothing else you could watch all the cut scenes and stuff on youtube or something.
---
Speaking of rare drops I just got the Edgemaster's Handguards on a private server, god only knows I would never be that lucky on a retail server!
---
there will already be a dozen variants of this on every server. it's the modern equivalent to tauren with cow/beef names.
---
I think there’s a big difference between AAP and something like gearscore, gearscore was used so that people could form groups while making sure that the people they are inviting are geared enough to their liking so as to prevent downtime and speed up dungeons/raids as a group, where their time can be impacted by the other players gear. If someone else is questing slowly it’s not going to change my pace and I believe that you may be overreacting a little when it comes to people “peer pressuring” into using something like AAP. I would actually expect the opposite, if I’m using AAP I would rather no one else uses it so I don’t have to worry about sharing quest mobs and resources with other players.

God bless you.

  **TBA - NA - PVE/PVP Scheduled BG's/Open World - Semi Hardcore Raiding** 
---
We are currently Looking for most importantly a Raid Leader with a lot of knowledge from Vanilla WOW and has been keeping their mind fresh throughout these years on private servers. This is not because we are inexperienced players, we just want another to be able to refresh and communicate things with the rest of the guild. Most of us who are starting this guild were present in 2004 and were raiding from MC to Naxx. We prefer Retail Vanilla players but will consider and or accept players from private servers. We understand that not everyone who is looking forward to the release of WOW Classic was there in 2004. Are priority is for a raid leader but are also looking to fill are ranks. It's never to soon to start getting Organized and that's what this post is for.
---
As for PVP, The guild leader himself will be the organizer of the PVP content. As in premade BG's, Organized Open World, And Raiding Capital Cities. We will have organized PVP events weekly. This is another reason why we are currently looking for a Raid Leader.

Doing rogue next
---
I would pay good money for AAP on classic launch.
---
LOL Drakedog is garbage
---
You've got to view Sekiro with a different mindset. You know how bloodborne emphasized different elements of the souls games? There were far fewer weapons but each weapon mattered more, fewer builds but the builds were nuanced, etc.
---
Sekiro is like that but it takes it way further. Its like playing dark souls as a shinobi but your class is so developed that even the gameplay itself is different. Instead of stamina you've got posture. Instead of magic you've got shinobi tools, etc.
---
I totally get why some people didn't like it, but I feel like i got a lot more out of it than I would've bloodborne 2/demon souls 2/dark souls 4. It makes me want FromSoft to keep changing setting and making mildly/moderately different souls games.
---
repost
---
iirs, it used to. even priests Shackle Undead worked on Undead players at the beginning of Vanilla. But i heard it was too OP and got nerfed to only npc's later on
---
I don't remember any of these and I started playing in BC, took a break between WoTLK and Legion, but still play today. These are awesome!!! I would love to see these in Classic and honestly in Retail.
---
Sounds like the definition of PvP to me. This is normal, expected, hell encouraged, on PvP servers. Ganking adds to the world, the lore of the server. You can always play on a pve server if you don't like it.

As Shaman Main

Tired of r/classicwow to tell you that you won't get into any raids as a spriest/non-resto shaman/feral etc?
---
Feel free to join us in our adventure to clear the entire of classics raiding challanges while still maintaining our identity!
---
We will raid 2-3 nights a week and won't require too many consumables.
---
Everyone is welcome so feel free to PM me for the discord link!
---
Your skill in unarmed has increased to 1.
---
AAP is way better than any guide/addon currently available in vanilla though.
---
Their current MO seems to be to not answer the question, just straight to concequence.
---
Elem Shaman here.
---
Did Enhancement first time around, but I want to heal in dungeons (and not have two sets of gear.)
---
It would almost make more sense to go Enh and be a tank, but, meh.
---
&lt;Pugger Stompers&gt;
---
Playtime is Casual, Playstyle  is Hardcore
---
PvE/PvP
---
Server:                  NA - Alliance - PVP
---
Region:                 Primarily CST
---
Loot System:      Loot Council (GM and Officers)
---
Raid Schedule:  TBD; Most likely Friday or Saturday night ~9 CST with the option of adding a raid night during the week based on availability
---
Intro
---
Pugger Stompers is a vanilla original guild from Sargeras. We were a PVP guild with a hand full of rank 14s, and shifted to raiding toward the end of Vanilla. We cleared MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20, and Huhuran in AQ40, and progressed into BC.
---
Expectations and Philosophy
---
We are all now older; married, kids, and real life responsibilities, but still have aspirations of clearing the all PVE content (finishing Naxx) and rolling people in PVP. We want to have fun playing with friends and get to experience the same things that we loved years ago. We are not going to no-life this game like we did years ago. We are not going to blaze through content, but we are all super competitive at heart, and when we play we play to win.
---
PM me and we can chat/get discord invite
---
I play on a private server right now and barrens chat is as worse as it's ever been on there. Tons of racist shit.
---
 Enhancement Shaman (Orc)  - No guild will take you in a raid, mana management is BRUTAL and even if you try your hardest you will be bottom of the meters. ..from experience don't do this.
---
 Rogue (Undead/ Human)  - Great for beginning tier raids,  PvE spec will do well in PvP as well
---
 Arms/Fury Warrior (Orc/Human)  - Fury is my favorite, amazing/top dps in later raids(early if you get lucky with drops/weapons) BUT, if you want to compete in PvP you'll need to respec to Arms, doing this regularly brings that 50g respec fee into sight and again, from experience that sucks down the road spending tons of gold on respeccing.
---
Classic is a recreation, not a remaster. Everything will use the old (1.12) graphics. The (optional) improvements, like the shadows and water all come from the modern engine.
---
See the "Restoring History" panel at last Blizzcon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
First, I would suggest you play through Warcraft III and it's expansion, The Frozen Throne.  It sets up the story telling foundation for the series henceforth, so being familiar with what happens in these games will be the most beneficial.
---
There were 7 Warcraft novels before they re-branded to World of Warcraft novels, if you want to know more context about the stuff that is happening in the beginning of WoW, read Lord of the Clans to learn more about Thrall and his journey from a slaveboy to Warchief, War of the Ancients Trilogy to learn more about the Night Elf mythos, Day of the Dragon for the story of freeing Alexstraza from the Dragonmaw clan and a bit of Deathwing.
---
The other novels will certainly mention characters you might be familiar with and telling somewhat interesting stories, but won't really focus on what is happening with Classic.
---
Yes. The messase will still appear "X runs away from fear" but they won't actually run away.
---
I friended exclusively on my hunter when fresh realms opened in EU (second batch of new realms). Way before Silithus and EPL quest revamp.   
---
My hunter got alliance first 60, but got beaten by a lot of horde. I think it was faster back then because (well mainly because of my class) people didn’t really know or bother with optimal quest routes, grinding seemed quicker.
---
It will most definitely still be competitive for the classes with high uptime and kill speed - hunters, warlocks and druids. Define rly competitive if there’s a lot of traffic at quest hubs/areas. 
---
Also, a lot simpler and easier to pull off quickly. An afterthought if you are considering it is the increased gold reward for completing quests once you reach 60, the gpm isn’t great but it’s guaranteed and the only competition you face are lower level players
---
There were indeed a few guilds accepted into this program, but I have no idea if it ever actually amounted to anything. The part that resonated with me was the fact that they put seemingly so much effort into pursuing community feedback like this. Giving every guild accepted into the program access to "Live chat sessions with Blizzard game designers" is an incredible benefit and Blizzard would probably never promise such a thing nowadays.
---
To level without grinding?
---
Not sure what you mean primarily by quests
---
They did in the beta. Blizzard reclassified forsaken players as humanoids in the release patch (1.1).
---
its not a bug.
---
Level 60:
---
You overconfidently attack, only to realize far too late that you are looking at a 20/31/0, and die a horrible, agonizing and slow death.
---
Yep I think most of the people in this thread have it right. If you don't want to use it, then dont use it. If you're crying because it not fair that you aren't going to use it and other people are... Then use it lol. 
---
I've been through these quests 20 times and really don't want to read them all agin. Leveling is about 144 hours of game play, there are hundreds if not thousands of hours after hitting level 60 that you have. Thats the game I want to play, I've never been a fan of leveling in any game. I just personally want to speed through it and get it done with. Yes I still want that rewarding feeling of getting it done, and I'll get it... Its not like 144 hours is completely nothing and I'll feel proud of getting it done, but I want to make it go as quick as possible. GIMME ADDON!
---
Older playing its part. Age is not wisdom, but it does help. Some cases more than others to be sure, but applied to the whole community, it will make a difference. Question is how much
---
It became a physical debuff in patch 2.3 IIRC, but beore then, you could pre ppoison totem as shaman, abolish poison as druids, or stoneform as dwarf (tho you can still use stoneform during blind, being basically a will of the forsaken/PvP trinket against blind)
---
Wheter or not there are consequences is the answer.
---
And to the best of my knowledge, no player has ever been banned just for killing low level players.
---
No, not even Angwe.
---
Way to ignore 90% of the post. Shows how strong your argument is.
---
What OP described is borderline griefing by blizzard's definition.
---
Enough so to use the colloquialism he used (light griefing.)
---
These kinds of add-ons are popular in retail because the modern game is designed to be played only at the level cap. To modern players, leveling is just this archaic process from the legacy Vanilla game that Blizzard hasn't removed yet, so of course it makes sense to use an add-on to avoid it as much as possible.
---
I agree, it should not be part of Vanilla.
---
“... of Sorcery” is TBC.
---
PETA
---
For reference this got fixed in patch 1.6.
---
This is helpful. Thanks man. I think I'll try to find some video recaps of WCIII and frozen throne lore.
---
umm dude lazypig and questie both exist already on private servers lol
---
Druid, Shaman, Rogue, Rogue, Warlock
---
We all have names like Capnkrunch, Kornpops, Frootloops, Countchoco, Fruitypebbles
---
Guild Name:  &lt;The Cereal Killers&gt;
---
Mostly PVP focused while leveling.
---
Go gnome or go home!
---
You can taunt hunter and warlock pets with warrior's taunt for example, and they'll attack you until your opponent controls it again.
---
This can be specially usefull if you think you are going to recieve a CC that is removed upon damage. Gouge, blind, polymorph, grenades, Freezing Trap, etc... Just taunt a second or so before you think they'll land the CC on you
---
With spell batching you can also get out of those CCs by hellfiring if you are a warlock. It's way harder to time because the first tick don't come out instantly, but I remember sometimes getting out of polymorpg by casting hellfire during the mage's polymorph cast.
---
When they announced Classic my excitement levels were so-so but the closer we get to the summer the more hyped I am for it. In ways that I didn't originally expect. And I suspect this is the case for a LOT of people out there. I think the numbers during week 1 are going to be mind blowing.
---
What do you care? It does not effect your experience.
---
Kek
---
Because they don't do the same thing? One is for emergencies to keep you from dying, one gives you mana at the expense of health.
---
Shaman is a much better class overall in comparison in terms of strength. across most aspects. druids are the underdogs of vanilla overall. in pvp druids only excel and the best flagcarriers, so if you are intrested in this role consider a druid. otherwise i'd go shaman. much saver choice.
---
ppl get used to a faction.
---
answering your questions, druids are healing but they are overall the worse healer across the healing classes in terms of hps. if you tryhard and a better than others you can do some things, and they are good on some specific bosses, but im talking in average and for an average player.
---
elem shaman is much better than moonkin, good and geared elem shaman are one of the strongest classes in random bgs actually. 
---
starfall is much longer cast and you can't ns it. when you can ns elem sham spells. also druids dont have slows. when shamans do. druids don't have spell casting interrupts, when shamans do. shamans have totems utility and when druids dont so on.
---
Yeah so prot spec is MOSTLY mitigation. There are a few talents there that will give you some TPS like Defiance but for the most part its just mitigation. I think mitigation is worst for leveling up tanking as well. As you level up in instances especially lower instances like Dead Mines you're extremely rage starved, adding mitigation will just further starve you, lowering your TPS.
---
You may want to take your time leveling and run through dungeons, but if you are spec'd prot for that and decide you just want to go grind out some quest, you're going to have a bad time doing so as prot. I recommend going 100% arms and still tanking. This will still allow you to do both. + Tactical Mastery = best talent in game
---
Depends on the server's economy. This doesn't sound likely soon after the launch.
---
Is “of restoration” in vanilla?
---
or...Priest, Rogue, Rogue, Mage, Warlock
---
All Undead
---
Guild Name:  &lt;Subway Eat Flesh&gt;
---
Play Warcraft 3 and read Cycle of Hatred in that order. Both are leading up to Classic WoW.
---
First thing I am doing when I hit 10 and run to the barrens is throwing up a Chuck Norris joke. Sorry but it's something I must do.
---
the vanilla and tbc api would not detect your range to your target, from wotlk you have a perfect range check functionality (a perfect example is the range radar for dbm)
---
Damn, that sounds shitty.
---
I learned about the battle shout strat when I played on Nost a long time ago. I'm not sure if it really worked that way in classic and would actually LOVE to know if anyone has a confirmation of this working on classic.
---
This was added when WoW had over 5 million subscribers. But yeah, it does look like it fell by wayside pretty quick. It doesn't look like they ever added more than 4-5 guilds to the program, before the parts of the site dedicated to this were taken down around 2010.
---
Warlock on alliance. Least played most needed dps in the raiding game and requires shadowbolt and lifetap.
---
&gt;What OP described is borderline griefing by blizzard's definition.
---
Show me that definition then.
---
And if you can't press Alt-F4, and leave argeuing to the people with arguments.
---
Yes, it's a list of books in chronological order. The point of it is to understand the order of the books. You asked for lore resources, I thought you meant books.
---
Also, with arcane missiles and other channeled damaging spells, opponent can't LoS the rest of it if they were in LoS during the start of the spell.
---
So if the opponent is really close to a pillar and you know he'll be there at the next 0.5 seconds, the best thing you can do to damage them would be casting drain life/mana, mind flay, arcane missiles, etc
---
After Blizzard I moved on to start my own business coaching Ice Skaters.  I was offered a spot at a top training facility in my area (the LA Kings Hockey team trained there, as well as LA Lakers in a separate part of the building at the time)  I was there for 10 years before I started branding out to other places, my experiences at Blizzard definitely influenced how I approached things and how I communicated with people.
---
In a lot of ways it prepared me for being in an environment (albeit VERY different) where the energy level is high and you need to speak to people with confidence.  It may not seem like it at first but you do gain a lot of confidence talking to people, even through a chat box, when you need to be professional about it, that really served me well.  I had learned a lot of techniques for dealing with people on the GM floor.
---
I'm also a huge believer in using the experiences you have positively.  For the most part, if something goes good or bad I wanna learn from it and apply it to how I approach things going forward.  Sometimes I would encounter clients who were involved in the gaming industry for example and Blizzard was a great ice breaker (no pun patrol plz =P) I taught a Call of Duty Devs daughter for example.  I also teach other kids who love gaming, I can throw out a Blizzard story and earn a little cache with them! ;)
---
I don't know how far along it was when you played it but there are two expansions for it.
---
Actually they just came out with an ultimate version that has everything. Still an amazing game.
---
I won.
---
Will we be able to have the old water?
---
Thanks, looking forward to the other bosses!
---
Can you tell me the addons you use? The interface looks very nice and clean.
---
few guys did some tests on demo in november, and it seemed to work
---
In the winter i wear a bathrobe at home a lot to stay warm.  Does that count?
---
You can't auto attack with a ranged weapon.
---
Don't forget the items from sunken temple. You can farm shoulders and gloves from mini bosses solo as druid. There is also the ring and off hand from later bosses but you need a group to farm them.  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/uFfY1He](https://imgur.com/a/uFfY1He)  
---
(can't recommend farming shoulders, won't do it again)
---
oh i didn't know that. so much for #nochanges i guess.
---
I've played all three roles (tank, healer, DPS) with different characters and overall, I enjoyed healing and tanking the most. One thing you'll quickly realize with a healer is that the healer has the best overall knowledge of how the group is working. But as someone else said, you're going to be looking at the party and raid frames far more than the fights themselves. Definitely keep stacks of the best water available to you since all too often, you'll find the tank pulling while you're still low on mana. Don't rely on water from the mage since they lag 5 levels (For instance, at level 15 you can get water that restores 835 mana. Mages don't get a spell to create that water until they reach level 20. And at level 25, you can get water that restores 1345 mana and mages get the spell for that quality of water at level 30. They're consistently 5 levels behind the curve).
---
Awesome!
---
Youre turning the defintion of intention around here mate.
---
i7 8th gen // 1060 GTX   
---
Playing on Linux via Wine.   
---
It's a laptop so cooling is sub-par (it's a desktop version GPU.).
---
4K runs consistently at ~50fps with almost everything on highest settings. SSAO is taken down a notch, as well as shadows.
---
I think it's safe to say most people will be able to max out everything. 
---
Performance loss through Wine is minimal these days, so not sure exactly how much is lost there, but there's *some*, and my GPU runs at 80°C or higher which certainly isn't optimal:p
---
vanilla doesn't have range check against hostile targets except for the spell range flags, the only addons available for range check use the spell flags that only checks for things like "lower or higher than 20/40 yards"
---
I did grinding in there too. But I think most of my experience came from quests.
---
Hunter easy to lvl? Good luck killing voodoo trolls if you play alone. From 1-10 hunters are the worst to lvl
---
I love it! Haven't seen this one before
---
I always thought glancing blows only happened if you were attacking something 4 (maybe 6?) levels higher than you. You hit them with glancing blows and they hit you with crushing blows that do extra damage.
---
And what did you do the other 99% of the time when goblin rocket helm got resisted/missed?
---
Haha gotta love the puns! Nice 😁
---
Definetely agree. I bought a laptop with an on-board graphics carc a few months prior to the Classic announcement. If I had known this, I would have bought a better laptop.
---
I have a set of arcane damage plate in my warlocks bank
---
in PUG groups, any BOE that's blue or higher that drops should be rolled NEED by everyone...in my opinion.
---
If the mage wants to use it, he can buy it off AH  :)
---
It was certainly annoying, but unfortunately the 2019 version of barrens or world chat is a bunch of copy cat edgy shit like saying racist or "redpill" things.  Hopefully the subscription wall keeps some of this idiots out.
---
“Yea I'm just gona go ahead and give this whole thing a big nope.”
---
You replied by turning the conversation from his dismissal of your suggestions into a absolutism on perfection, thus moving the goal post of the conversation from his dismissal to your accusation that he thought the game was perfect as is. 
---
Now you’re being defensive about your “simple quality of life” CHANGES not being about perfection when funny enough no one is accusing your suggestions of perfection. You are in fact the one who first used the term perfection.  So ironically enough, you have unsuccessfully attempted to move the goal post again in a response to being called out for moving the goal post previously. Unbelievable
---
In Vanilla Healbot was a LOT more automated. You can still find copies of it available for use with the 1.12 client that a lot of pservers are written for. To give an example of the level of automation, it can be configured to look at the party and find the character with the lowest percentage of health and automatically target that character. It would then select the healing spell that would restore the health without overhealing. If there was no one with any significant damage, it would do nothing. So quite literally, you could run a 5 man instance as a healer and simply spam 1 button that would automatically target anyone who needs healing and heal that character.
---
expected to see a reply of someone who grinded the entire way. but as a warrior? mad man
---
Where's Mankrik's wife?
---
Sorry I’m pretty new to this, but are you saying you’re going to level up solely on just killing the monsters at your level? Or are you still going to quest in between and kill each mob?
---
If you've never healed, I would suggest leveling a Priest and Paladin a bit in Retail to a) learn how to heal, and b) get a feel for the classes. Both classes are a bit different now, but they're still the same class so you'll get the flavor and still get to use some iconic abilities to help decide which you prefer. And since dungeons are so anonymous now - and easy at low levels - you'll have a good place to learn to heal before Classic starts. You can play for free to level 20 and up through Legion content for just the $15 sub fee. So it's easy enough to try IMO. I think you'll feel a lot better about starting Classic once you're more prepared.
---
And FWIW I have both Priest and Paladin at 120 and am still having a hard time deciding which to play first in Classic. I'm thinking Priest right now and am going to just stick with that because I know if I let myself waffle on it I will lol. They're both great!
---
The Orc Racial may be strong, and mathematically superior.
---
But as someone who has never PVP'd on an Orc.... isn't the racial super frustrating to have as well? Like, every time a stun gets through you think to yourself "if hardiness triggered I would have won".
---
While other racials, like Will of the Forsaken, are more of a "I have what I have" kind of deal.
---
If you want to be desired by others and have a very strong class, shaman.
---
If your character fantasy is more important to you just roll ally and make a shaman when bc come out and keep your druid for farming (flight form)
---
The thought of being a soul shard bitch is a lot of what made me decide on priest instead.
---
That and Dwarves cant be warlocks, and i really, really, really want to play a Dwarf.
---
Don't sweat it, healing is fun because:
---
- it's much more engaging than dps
---
- it feels great to land that clutch heal and save a friend
---
- those narrow wins where you JUST scrape enough mana to keep the tank alive are awesome
---
- in vanilla raids it's a little easier as a healer to learn tactics (at least as far as I can remember) because you generally have less moving around to do
---
- you've got more to manage.  It's not just mana, you can optimise cast timings, whether it's optimal to finish casts or overheal, how to efficiently spread your healing etc. There's a lot of ways to improve 
---
The main two downsides are that farming gold is harder and buffing in raids is quite a chore - but its worth it imo
---
I loved the guild's philosophy and the raid schedules. Being horde is just the cherry on top.
---
Couple questions:
---
- Are you willing to accept foreigners that do speak good enough english?
---
- Are you playing on a heavy populated/streamer server or going to emptier ones?
---
Skinning/herb until mount; vendor skins and save enough herbs to catch up in alch; drop skinning for alch; get epic mount; drop herb once you can afford to max engineering
---
That’s what I would do 🙂
---
thank you :)
---
nice troll bro
---
Silithus cultists and their summons drop it.
---
You more or less have to go engineering. AOE threat is hot garbage without it and it's incredibly powerful overall.
---
Silithus cultists and their summons drop it. It's not found on other items.
---
In this context you should remember that Bosses (??) Are considered to be your level +3 which makes glancing blows a big deal.
---
Smart warrior build :)
---
Got it. Yes, I've seen that video and it's very good. That's why I was questioning how it was possible someone beat him by over 20 mins...
---
delete the FRAPS
---
Oh good God. Gearscore was a blight upon warcraft. All too many idiots would effectively ask the following:
---
LFG instance XXX, minimum gearscore YYY.
---
The translation of XXX and YYY would basically state
---
"I want to carried in instance XXX and your gearscore must be high enough that you need nothing from XXX, so I get to keep all the loot."
---
I believe that's what PVP gear is for...
---
Also a common strategy for druids to prebuff Abolish Posion on themselves when fighting a rogue so it eats the blind.
---
I loved sunken temple! I remember some people would gripe because it was long, and the layout was confusing at first, but I loved that dungeon and it's atmosphere.
---
Absolutely one of my favorite 5 mans of vanilla.
---
i didn’t know you could do AB before level 20 bracket. When i had a twink in the best twink guild ever &lt;Horde Invasion&gt;,  19’s could only queu for Warsong Gulch
---
Yeah I'm not sure how it worked with bosses. I cant remember if there was hit rating in vanilla. Pretty sure glancing blows weren't a thing on bosses though. You miss a lot as a dual wielding class but I'm like 90% sure glancing blows were only a thing on stuff that's a few levels higher (not bosses)
---
Second account can be scanning the AH and /2 while your main is literally doing anything else. If you need something and you can't wait 1 hour for the mail you quickly log off your main onto that account's alt and do a trade as it's parked in SW who then mail's instantly to the main.
---
Private servers can get a bit much. Racist shit 24/7 but you can easily just block the retards that spew that shit all day. Honestly though sometimes it's funny as hell to see how triggered people get
---
Okay, so if you don't like the outcome of Blizzard's decision, it's "fucking over everyone else", but if others don't like the outcome, they are "some Whiners".
---
Did you consider at some point that maybe you are the whiner who wants others to get "fucked over"?
---
Warrior travel form sighted!
---
no downtime with feral druid if you use innervate every time its up and make sure to not go completly oom until its ready again.  thats the trick
---
Sounds like you're more interested in being a caster for pvp, and if so I'd recommend shaman over druid. You need a lot more gear to make being a balanced druid viable in pvp whereas ele shaman gets a lot of damage from talents and doesn't need as much gear right out the gate to be useful. They're far more sought after in raids, and people would rather have a healing shaman for an instance than a resto druid because druids can't res other than their long cd battle res. Instances in vanilla can have long runs back to a corpse, wasting a lot of time. 
---
I would say choosing your class is more important than choosing your faction. Horde is way better anyways.
---
Shaman is the better class imo. But you’ll get geared faster as a Druid. I feel like shaman healing is dropping appropriate totems n chain heal
---
I still think I have the mohawk mask on my original account, along with arrows, bullets and stuff.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Same. There was one point a few weekends ago where there were Horde who were on literally all Saturday just ganking lowbies. People were doing callouts in chat and it showed that there were at least 4 separate gankers just walking around the zone killing everyone.
---
I tried using my steamlink to do this very thing. It worked pretty well and most of the time I could not notice a difference in latency, however I was simply farming and not engaging in any pvp. The main issue was that the mouse icon kept dissapearing. Might be a fix for that out there somewhere though.
---
rep grinding early like the furbolgs, you gotta grind at 60 for gold anyway so might aswell start early.   might get lucky with a world epic boe that'll sell for a lot.   blues and greens to equip ready to run dungeons at 60.    theres a few reasons.  i'd blow my brains out just grinding though i think haha
---
Funniest rng item name I've ever found was a "Pagan cloak of holy wrath"
---
Well modern day healing addons aren't cheating but I do prefer not playing with them. I would be rather excited if people had to learn how to heal without the easymode addons they have today.
---
Oh he was hilarious.  One day we wiped on Gruul, and he goes "we died because he groweded."  (Not only did he say "growed" instead of "grew", he added an extra "ed" at the end).
---
We were all making fun of him and he goes, "Hey, I'm from Florida, a'ight?  We don't even know how to vote."  Had the whole raid in stitches.
---
I ground on my first ever vanilla character 10 to 60. I leveled a hunter,  kept my beginning pet to 60. I came from eq, so I had the patience and love of the grind.  It took me a long ass time... I hated questing because I'd get frustrated fast when I couldn't find mobs. I'd say it took me at least 2 months to do it.  I made a ton of money though! Had everything I wanted the entire time and could afford epics and such.

Hah!

Their DPS is basically the lowest of all DPS classes throughout all raiding phases. They might be a little above Warlocks very early on, but it goes from Warriors/Rogues doing like 5-600 dps in MC and hunters doing \~300, to Mages/Warriors/Rogues doing 800-1100 DPS in Naxx, and hunters doing about 5-600ish. This will be different on certain fights that require lots of moving so the ranged people can keep dpsing while the melee are just running around. They have some CC and Tranq shot makes them absolutely required for some fights though. Most raids will bring 2-3.
---
Playing a warlock will be rough, not only for the shards etc but your dps and role in raids will be minimum for the first year(and half). You start scaling with gear from AQ and naxx, If you are able to raid and CLEAR naxx, ppl seem to think every1 and their momma will be doing naxx. Which is not the case, by the time naxx comes out, you will have to be lucky to have a guild that does naxx. Not too mention all the prep that Goes into it.
---
When Zg arrives, you best gear is blue anyway.
---
Gottem'
---
What are you even asking about?  Adding the pet battle system to Classic WoW (will never happen and you’ll get laughed at and downvoted out of this sub for even asking), or playing a mage in Classic?  If you’re just asking about playing a mage, go for it.  They’re great.
---
It's more that people didnt know how to fight rogues back in original vanilla
---
**&lt;Relapse&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild, specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Our Official Raid Times are as follows:
---
**Tuesday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
**Thursday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
There is a chance we do cleanup on the weekends and possibly 20 mans, but that is up in the air and dependent on if people want to/are available.
---
We will use EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
&gt;She'd shadow meld and wait for me to run back, let me feel safe for a minute or so and fight some mobs before killing me when I was low HP.
---
Long, long time ago, I was reported for this and asked by a GM to refrain from continuing when I did this on my NE Hunter.   
---
By that point I had spent about an hour killing someone over and over as revenge.
---
You do not know what is intended any more than I do, the text only says "unintended" without further explanation.   
---
Difference between us two is I have experience from Vanilla relevant to this I can draw on, as do many others. Now I may not have faced actual consequences (teenage me got real scared and complied) for what I did, but I think the message was pretty clear back then. 
---
Again, you don't know what is meant by "unintended" because it isn't explained.
---
It's really not hard to learn how to heal without addons. Honestly I've been healing for over 10 years in a ton of MMO's and I find healing without addons much easier. It's simpler and gets rid of a lot of the unnecessary complication. Just keybind your skills and you're good to go - you'll just have to get good at fast and frequent target swapping, and learning to keep a focus target on the boss.
---
Of course!  I had a great time talking vanilla WoW with everyone!  Very excited for classic!
---
I haven't played WoW in over 10 years, so I am rusty myself, but I did find this guide from the guy who was the first level 60 on my personal accounts Horde server (akama) https://www.joanasworld.com/speedruns/
---
By the time I had encountered him they had done quite a few speed runs and perfected the methods.  They were pretty interesting to talk to, and still remember being very impressed with his level prowess and how well he had mapped out his leveling plan.  I noticed while looking at their site they will also be back for classic!
---
In terms of Add Ons, not sure what will be available when classic launches, but I would advise to keep them updated and don't be afraid to cut loose Add Ons that cause problems.
---
It completely depends what we are talking about. Official punishment as in GM interaction? Absolutely agree, no action needed. However in Classic player retaliation is a real thing. If you are having laugh about camping lowies you may face revenge in forms being camped yourself.
---
But this is a video game, and its not exactly fair, is it?
---
Shaman beats druid.  Druids are tough to kill in pvp but they're focusing alot on staying alive so not overly lethal. Thats fine for stuff like flag running which is why it's brought up alot when people talk about druid pvp. Shaman have a variety of playstyles while from my ally side i had never heard of shaman tanking i guess it's a meme because it could be done? But they're also a hybrid class in that all the specs are different playstyle centric. In pve as i understand it shammys are healers or enhancement swinging the 2h blacksmith axe to buff the raid. Shaman are much much better raid healers than druids but iirc there isnt alot of unavoidable raid damage in classic so while nice to have as a safety net it isnt required. Druids arent innervate bots they do some nice healing but their one off heal is mana expensive so they do better in healing lower more consistent damage fights with a few uh oh buttons. I wasnt horde so I'm not sure how shammy looks but they definitely provide more to the raid than druids. That being said too the horde usually has a couple druids in addition to shaman in raids so its not like one is a direct upgrade. They're different. If you're just looking at ele vs balance I cant help you. I dont remember seeing alot of either one of them so there's probably no way to salvage whatever problem shaman have like there isnt a way to fix how mana demanding moonkin is within reason.
---
hunter dps in vanilla is getting your auto speed &gt;3s and rotating aimed and multi while binding your pet's furious howl to infinite scroll mousewheel.
---
Pretty sure they also said they were going to do all they can to make it so you can't get to those locations. No Hyjal or getting "on top" of Org.
---
Playing a mage. I couldn’t care less about pet battles and don’t want them in my classic. I was using it as an example of how she likes some of the more modern things that retail has and if playing a mage since I can portal us around and such would be a good idea to make her have a better experience or if it’s a stupid idea.
---
The closest thing we have might be hunter for her, its a "semi-advanced" pet system, with training pets for diffrent ranks + rare pet spawns. As for you, play what you like everything goes well with hunters :)
---
I knew one player who was lost in there for three days.  Three days, would you believe it?!
---
Wait, let me think, I went in there on a Tuesday...
---
You’re definitely right in terms of speed leveling. I want to be level 60 before most people are so I can then leisurely level those professions without risk of getting ganked. Although I am going to try to level skinning because I’m fairly certain you’ll never outlevel the skinning profession and it will only slow you down by the skinning animation.
---
His plan is to quest normally, but if he gets stuck in the pack of players and getting quest items and tagging the mobs he needs becomes impossible, then he's going to switch to heavy grinding to try and make some progress and split from the groups.
---
Oh sweet I’ll keep in mind. Playing shaman for classic
---
Not that it was easy for me to navigate Wailing Caverns, Gnomer, or BRD, either.

#♛ **&lt;Diadem&gt; ♛ Hardcore Raiding | Horde | CST | NA-PvP**
---
**Schedule:** Tuesday + Thursday 7-10 CST. *Tuesday + Wednesday 7-11 CST during progression periods.*
---
**Loot Distribution:** EPGP. *Loot Council during progression periods.*
---
#**PHILOSOPHY**
---
♛ **&lt;Diadem&gt;** is a server-first guild starting in BWL.
---
♛ At **&lt;Diadem&gt;**, we understand that many of you are unable to commit fully to a raid schedule which removes you from your daily life for extended periods of time. We seek raiders who are willing to put in the hours necessary to prepare for the beginning of each content phase at their own pace. You will not be pressured to play in **&lt;Diadem&gt;** provided you are prepared when the time comes.
---
♛ **&lt;Diadem&gt;** is entirely altruistic. Players must be willing to part with their time and effort in order to assist the other members of **&lt;Diadem&gt;** -- and therefore the guild as a whole -- in order to create the best possible guild they can.
---
♛ **&lt;Diadem&gt;** operates on a hardcore raiding philosophy *no longer than is absolutely necessary.* Upon completion of any progression raid upon each content phase release, **&lt;Diadem&gt;** *reverts wholly to a semi-hardcore/casual environment.*
---
#**&lt;DIADEM&gt; IS SEEKING...**
---
♛ **&lt;Diadem&gt;** is currently in infancy. We seek ALL roles and classes for raiding and PvP ventures. Non-viable specs are welcome on non-server-first nights, meaning the guild will permit ALL roles and classes after the first reset of each content phase.
---
♛ **&lt;Diadem&gt;** is looking for Officers, Raiders, non-raiders (including Rankers), a Raid Leader, and others who adhere to our philosophy.
---
#**WHAT WILL &lt;DIADEM&gt; PROVIDE ME?**
---
♛ As the top guild on our prospective server, **&lt;Diadem&gt;** provides you with prestige and a learning environment focused on camaraderie in your Classic adventure while asking nothing more than your cooperation, altruism, and willingness to succeed.
---
**PM Aphid#1433 for more information.**
---
I remember the first time I played a wasd/mouse game.  It was Doom in the 90s.
---
I was so frustrated because I couldn't shoot shit.  I was constantly looking at the ground or sky while running.
---
But it only took a day or 2 to get mediocre but able to actually start enjoying the game, and it only got easier each day.
---
Same thing happened when I wanted to play PS4 games after a lifetime of kb/mouse PC games.  I decided I would learn on Destiny.  It took about a week before I was ok enough to start enjoying the game.  Now I can play any game with the game pad and I'm fine.
---
She'll get used to it, and it won't take long.  The human brain + body is an unbelievably adaptable machine.
---
Interesting! Never seen those images before. They make it quite easy to see good grinding spots at a glance. Bookmarked.
---
Don't get sucked into arguments.
---
This sub is filled with argumentative, hostile fucks who will stop at nothing to "be right" (read: have their feelings validated.)   
---
They'll be playing alongside you. Stay safe.
---
I think some players will but no for me it's more a matter of grinding out a some levels here and there. Especially when decent quests become scarce which happens a lot 40-60.
---
Also I like to have alternatives in case questing becomes too inefficient due to intense ganking or high server pop.
---
She subscribes to the healer only mentality. Which isn’t a bad thing but I don’t think I could get her to go for it. I think she might hate classic less if I could make food/drink for us and portal us around places without the super long flights (for the most part)
---
Would be great for a dual druid gank squad to mess with a hunter. Just taunt back and forth the hunters pet.
---
LFG - Alliance - NA -PvP realm
---
Young adult with a full time job seeking to experience the end game of vanilla wow for the first time. A former altaholic who will dedicate to one toon if there is a fun/active community to help me reach and play through the end game content. 
---
Currently undecided on a class due to a history of rolling many toons, but leaning towards rogue/mage or healer if a support role is needed. I'm extremely excited to quest, raid, and pvp this summer!
---
Obviously I have restrictions due to my current lifestyle but I can make time for the game since I have no serious commitments outside of work. I see myself as a mature adult that can follow community rules and will dedicate time to progress to end game content. I hope I can find my future guild in this thread. Please message if interested.
---
From what I have read, it seems that GB's were a thing on boss fights, hence my query regarding DPS :)
---
The ideal endgame professions for a tank would be armorsmithing and engineering. Without regards to anything other factor beyond engame desires, I'd start with mining/smithing. max out smithing. set aside consumables and drop the mining and level engineering.
---
So does retail? You can only get accurate position from friendly party members, not enemy players.
---
Good to know! Can abuse it for a few patches, haha!
---
Just don't use it. I'm sure there's a boatload of people who've leveled several times on private servers who just want to hurry to cap. It doesn't hurt your ethereal experience at all.
---
Considering the game is using the modern client, I'm assuming the same addons available in Retail will work in Classic, unless Blizz decides to disable certain features. I would love if they did but I'm not holding my breath.
---
I was just recently doing a random quest run of ST with some level 54-58 guys on my small level 49 Shaman and this guy got some fucking insane healing gloves that were apparently basically pre-raid bis. I didn't know about the random ST gear but I did some research and learned just how many viable pre-raid items drop in there. I love Vanilla
---
I mean what would she play?  If you wanted to be a dwarf warrior she could then be a gnome mage to level together and still get the portal and food/water benefit.. you can still do alchemy or something for consumables and she can get a tradeskill to match her like tailoring / enchanting.
---
If you're asking about a class to help your gf, would help to know what she'd like to play as too.  But yeah mage would be a good all around good idea for you probably.
---
You don't need godlike gear, but even with a pocket healer, undergeared warriors are underwhelming. You want to be at least in average gear compared to everyone else in the BG to have much influence. A caster with 1 tier better gear could 1v2 you guys no problem.
---
Its 100% fair since its within the rule-set you personally and intentionally opted into when you chose a PvP realm.
---
There are ways to avoid it and thats PvE realms. 
---
I 100% can understand people getting frustrated over the situation, but it isnt griefing or anything like that. Its PvPing.
---
I identify as a hunter.  You’re just being an elitist.
---
AFK crafting to make an profit of 3s each crafted headband prolly

No matter what realm ive played on desolace was always dead, other than near mara
---
This is the only answer 😂
---
My favorite name for the DK ghoul I've ever gotten was "Pebblethief".
---
the names of trash items will be grey coloured
---
yeah as a healer, you are very happy for free water. As to the travel, personally i dont mind a 5min flight. Gives me time to grab a smoke or just strech my legs.
---
Paladins could judge one seal on one target and a different seal on a different target and occasionally whack them both to keep the judge debuff active on both.
---
This is another thing that pservers get wrong.
---
Get into IT. Currently on salary, "unlimited" PTO. Not even a senior level position either. Texas.
---
Private servers can have higher pop because they alter spawn times etc.
---
Classic is supposed to be a recreation of classic and blizzard deliberately tried to keep pops around 2500-3000 due to resource scarcity IIRC.
---
No, forsaken are humanoid.

on the more geared end of the spectrum, with some great editing and music, there's Voidims "Enter the Void"

Gives a chill (puns puns puns) feeling of just having a great round in BG's while listening to an awesome playlist (rjd2, dj shadow, that kind as opposed to the very screamo stuff you'd get from many others).
---
Now would cleave benefit from hitting all of the targets? Say you had judgment of healing on one and judgement of mana another?
---
One thought I had for enchanters to make money really early on is to roll out as many [Greater Magic Wands](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=11288) as they can and post them to the AH early. These babies are totally BIS for the 13-25 level range. Leveling a caster is so much easier during this time because the wand is stupid OP, especially for a level 13 to have a wand that is more powerful than the DM quest reward wand that most people don't get until around 19. I leveled a warlock and priest recently and I think it was faster to just wand mobs to death rather than use spells.
---
Am I the only one whose been using the same name in MMO's the past 10 years? It's not this name, though.
---
Haha this is very interesting!  For the most part you are correct.  The emphasis is on the gold sellers and not the players.  I wouldn't exactly say there was no penalty for buying gold, as it was a ToS violation, but rather one we were less motivated to go after, and in general it was the gold sellers and farmers who were being reported, not the buyers.  
---
Many of the gold sellers were also not real players, whereas the buyers often times were.  In general, we wanted to keep the real players in the game playing without interruption.  Certainly there are times when we had to step in, but in general GMs didn't want to ban real players.  
---
This isn't limited to just gold buying, but I would say most gray area behavior that is commonly accepted in MMOs but is technically a ToS violation was more likely to be viewed leniently.  We wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to the player when we could.
---
Ah, so, BfA then?
---
&gt; Difference between us two is I have experience from Vanilla relevant to this I can draw on, as do many others. 
---
Interesting how you assume you know anything about me.
---
You are wrong of course, like all people who delude themselves into believing in their omniscience. I did play in Vanilla, and the only time we ever got told by a GM to stop ganking, was when we blocked the Hunters Camp in Stranglethorne to all questers for 3 hours straight.
---
And the reason why he told us to leave wasn't because we killed lowbies, but because we did so in coordination with some people from an Alliance guild on the same server (we were horde). They killed every horde lowbie...we killed every alliance lowbie.
---
The part about our behaviour that was unintended, was that we didn't attack each other as well, despite being different factions (we were in ventrilo with them the whole time).
---
And yes, this was explained to us in detail by the GM, after he teleported us to the arse-end of southern Tanaris.
---
So, my uninformed friend with delusions of omniscience, as you can see, I do have experience to draw on regarding the subject matter, and said experience says you are wrong. Now, kindly press the aforementioned key combo.
---
&gt;And you are adult right? You are able to have conversations without resorting to hostility and insults?
---
Is this the crow calling the raven black?
---
She only plays healers. I’m a little nervous to level a mage just because I never really have in my entire wow career but with the release of classic I was contemplating trying out a new experience and figured that mage would fit well in that area and to bring a moderate amount of the QoL that she’s used to so she doesn’t give up on it. I think she’ll get used to it and then have fun but she’s already digging her heels in on classic and I need to get her over the hump so to speak.
---
I appreciate the brutal honesty I was hoping the Druid could shine in some aspects as a caster and healer over the Shaman but I was right to have my doubts lol. I didn’t even think about druids being flag carriers and I assume if I were to roll one in a premade that would be my role. I think I’ll go with shaman.
---
I believe that was limit was changed in Patch 1.7.0:
---
“Reputation gains given to a player on the Alliance, Horde, or Steamwheedle Cartel factions directly will now cascade down to member factions through the middle of the Exalted reputation level.”
---
wow lol thats so original
---
That's not just mages though, that's pretty much every single class in tbc compared to vanilla. And the main reason for that is resilience.
---
Ofc a mage using ice Lance is gonna deal more than one ignoring it. You're making it seem like spamming Icelance would be the preferred tactic, which it absolutely was not. To act like frostbolts did no damage is absurd.
---
The best way to ensure that a paladin isn't going to help you is to fight mid and bitch about healing
---
So I just did some spreadsheet calcs, and 56 spirit is the breakeven point where the buff from Imp. Drain Soul will return the mana cost of Rank 1 Drain Soul (55mana over 10 seconds at 50% mana regen). I did it based on gnome base stats, which would be around level 23 naked. Imp. Drain Soul is a net mana gain after level 23, and scales with spirit on your gear as well. 
---
Since you can still talent into Imp. Life Tap, if you are leveling in Affliction, I'm not sure why you wouldn't get both since there are some dumb talents and you have to fill out the tree somehow. 
---
If you are chain pulling mobs, as soon as one dies you are pulling a new one, so having DS interrupt the 5 second rule doesn't matter as much since you are probably about to start casting dots on a new mob(s). 
---
I'll prob just get both talents, but its interesting to see that Imp. Drain Soul is a net mana loss before 56 spirit unless you are using it to regen out of combat.
---
You are over thinking the discussion to an extreme level.
---
Also, I was not the first person to use the term perfection. I responded to another person who said the game was perfect as it was. Which to me is incredibly naive.
---
Goal past is in exactly the same location it has been from the start. Use big words and try to sound fancy when in fact you are completely wrong. The goal past was and still is looking at changes to make life better. The caveat I have in the op is to make sure the game does not get over influenced or broken in the process. The goal never has been to make the game "Perfect". That is an unattainable goal. 
---
Good try using some convoluted logic there though. A+.
---
Sorry to hear that man :(. It puts my situation into perspective for me, won't take it for granted.
---
Because some people like to feel that they are different from the crowd, an individual, someone who say no to the normal. What they seem to forget is that there are thousands of others that are doing exactly the same, trying the same off meta picks to be different, therefore they all end up being the same as someone else.
---
What often happens is that these types of people also don't work well in a team because it suppresses their individuality. It becomes a compounding problem in a raid scenario. Too many of these and you will not have enough healers or tanks to get anything but the simplest boss killed. It is fine to gimp yourself while levelling but when maxed and insist on playing off meta too many breaks a guild.
---
I love the cardoor, but face of death and some of the other naxx shields are awesome.
---
Always hilarious when gankers whine at counter-gankers about not having a life. Like really, you think dunking level 18s decked in greys and greens in Redridge is any better in that regard?!
---
Depends on if they have a nightfall
---
I can appreciate you wanting to experience Classic in the old graphics, and that option should not be taken away from you. Nevertheless, I don’t see why remastered assets would or should ruin that experience, and because “you say so” isn’t an argument.
---
WoW in 2004 was experienced very differently due to huge variations in players’ computer power and internet speed. An equal experience wouldn’t even resemble the game back then.
---
&gt;feral druid

&gt;innervate
---
Awesome insight, thanks man.  So it sounds like at your level of GM, you just focused on responding to tickets.  If you guys banned a gold farmer, it just ended there and was considered handled - there was no directive to take the additional step of investigating to whom they had been selling?
---
But presumably if I'd been behaving flagrantly about purchasing gold and it prompted someone to report me, *then* action may have been taken?  Sort of a "Don't ask, Don't tell" policy then?
---
You can get insane mileage out of lucky RNG drops in ST. Used a Shadow Wrath version of the offhand that drops from the drakes up until I got the AV exalted offhand.

“In the WoW Classic panel, Ion Hazzikostas mentioned sharding might happen at launch to prevent overcrowding, but suggested it wouldn’t be an everyday occurrence” from an online article. I remembered Ion having said something, but it looks like it isn’t 100% confirmed yet.

I tend to go Engi first with mining. I don't consider BS a must-have for tanking but it's nice to have.
---
ToC was what ruined WotLK for me.  
---
Ulduar was the best raid they ever created and then it was followed by what was probably the worst raid they ever created.  
---
It felt rushed and just shoved in for the sake of filling time while they got ICC ready.  
---
It killed my guild and really killed ICC hype for me due to those factors. 
---
It also showed in the biggest thing I did post Ulduar was organise a 10 man pug group to get 'Herald of the Titans' achievement before the end of the expansion as we assumed it would be removed.
---
Vurtne?
---
From my understanding the modern healbot isnt anything like what it was when it first came out.  It used to automatically select either the target or the heal you should use (i forget which now).
---
I havent used healbot in a few years, but now its just an all-in-one package for easily setting up mouseovers and having healing frames that show what you need to see.

Tanks want the unchanged version.

Undecided on class but I can roll anything for the most part. Looking for a group of Hardcore raiders that want to clear content and compete for server firsts. Have experience in classic, but not as much as other expansions. Raided retail TBC-Cata and cleared all endgame content, re played TBC on a pserver, and now i'm ready for classic.
---
Haha yeah!  It was chaos!  But it was a good chaos, we had a lot of fun that day because it totally broke the normal flow of life.  The tickets were hilarious that day because they ranged from total freak out that the world was doomed to complete reverence with people calling us geniuses and everything in between.
---
Havent they already said the API will be modified for Classic?
---
I had https://classicdb.ch/?item=10796#comments the offhand from Sunken Temple drop for me with “of frozen wrath” +7spell damage +20 frost damage. Not a better offhand till nefarion.

 **&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[NA - PvE - A\]** is a new two night raiding guild recruiting all roles for WoW Classic.
---
If you are...
---
...looking to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
...T3 BiS minded
---
...seeking a work/play balance
---
...thinking being in a guild that formally schedules vacation rotation is a wonderful idea
---
...and hoping to play with mature friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
**About Us:**
---
We are Vanilla veterans with full time jobs who are excited about Classic.  We’ve played WoW and other MMOs since 2005 at all levels of dedication and leadership, and have fondly held onto our Vanilla member berries as some of our most treasured.  Our goals are intensive, but we aren’t necessarily intense or strict in nature.  To us a major component to having fun in an MMO is efficiency and proper organization.  We seek to be driven but friendly and aim to build a cohesive team of like-minded members.
---
**Purpose:**
---
Celestial Born is being built on a foundation of striking a key balance between real life time constraints and completing the Vanilla raid experience.  Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS.  In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner, but will also work to keep the fun and adventurous spirit of Vanilla in everything we do.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended.  In order to achieve this we are requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks.  Please refer to the Charter at [celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) for the napkin math behind this.  We won’t require this rate of play to be sustained beyond the leveling experience.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Tuesdays:  6-10pm PST
---
Wednesdays:  6-10pm PST
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible.
---
In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing a rotating raid attendance schedule.  With just a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system allows all of us to take breaks for real life, eliminates the standby bench, staves off burn out, and provides some measure of roster protection.  As currently planned each member can expect to take a week off about every 5 weeks.
---
**Loot:**
---
Pre-assigned loot sheet (see Charter for further details).
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are in our founding stages and currently recruiting for many positions.

---
Thanks for reading.  May you find your perfect guild!

Southshore was a great place to gank lvl 20ish horde
---
Sounds like the Shaman itself holds way more value just as a class all around and not just one spec. Someone mentioned being a flag carrier for pvp and that’s one thing I don’t want to do. Just being able to nuke players as a caster in PvP is what interest me. Also being able to get some decent damage just through talents sounds like a huge plus to me. Thank you for the insight man guess I’ll be living in a mud hut as a shaman for the next 2-3 years lol. I’ll be missing the nostalgia of Ironforge though
---
If you're getting ganked on a non-pvp server, you deserve it...
---
All my Vanilla chars are still in Darnassus... idk why but I just to just love it there, very cool vibe.

When battlemasters released I planted all my twinks there too haha
---
I remember back in 2005/2006 after the GM resolved my main issue we continued chatting for a bit. When he asked me if he could help me any other way, I asked him for "some gold" for the class trainer. He replied that he can't do that and a few minutes later I received a letter, attached to it 1 piece of "Gold Ore" (http://classicdb.ch/?item=2776).
---
Cheeky bastard.
---
Was this within the "rules" or could he have gotten in trouble for that? Regarding "interference with the game world".
---
XP gained is split in a group:  [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Mob\_experience#Group\_Experience](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Mob_experience#Group_Experience)
---
There are no quests that can't be completed in a group but most quests don't share drops with group members.  So if you need to collect 15 defias masks for alliance.. that is essentially "30" you need to collect for a group of 2, and "45" for a group of 3.  Also any items that you need to interact with in the world that despawn after, you each have to collect separately.  
---
Of course you can skip those types of quests and just grind if you wanted or do other quests instead.  You may level a bit slower overall but it may speed up in a sense that you can kill 3-4 mobs at a time or more.. instead of the 1-2 at a time you can pull solo.   Especially if you have a tank or healer killing things.   There are pros and cons.
---
Cloth can be fed to a tailor but don't forget you may want to still level your first aid for those times you are soloing and not in the group.
---
Haha omg!  Yes!  Total blast from the past but you totally minded me of the phrase "PVP solutions" 
---
Curious if you don't mind me asking, which office did you work at?

When you start playing you release how silly a picture of a Demon Hunter killing a Red Dragon in the middle of Zul'Gurub actually is.

It has been mentioned on here before. I'm sure someone with knowledge will post it again. I remember that they broke it down by weapon skill versus chance to miss/get glancing blow. Both with 2H and duel wielding.

Sorry all your chars are crispy now

Had to go all the way to gamepedia for a reference, but that claims it was availible in 1.8, with ‘of sorcery’ or ‘of restoration’. Looks like I’m wrong.

Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST.

ABOUT US:
---
Atlas is currently recruiting high-level, team players. Our current core is tight-knit and made up of players who played retail Vanilla and on private servers. Many of us are proven to be the best at the games that we play. We have stuck together through multiple MMORPGs and other competitive, team games. We know what it takes to be the best and welcome others who share that vision.
---
WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?
---
We are striving for an enjoyable launch experience by streamlining levelling and pre-raid gearing through cooperation and communication. It takes a team to clear raid smoothly. The same goes for levelling, questing, and gearing. We are looking for players who will put in the effort to ensure that our team is in the best possible shape, not individual characters. We will conduct our first raid at the end of the second raid reset.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED?
---
Atlas is a hardcore guild. Understanding loot council and giving/receiving criticism is a necessity of our team environment. We need some major poopsocking on launch in order to meet our goal of week 2 raid. After the launch, we expect 100% unexcused raid attendance.  
---
APPLY TO ATLAS:
---
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers on Discord (AEric, B, Carlt0n) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

This was pretty much my intention with my sarcastic responses. 
---
It’s fine to play off meta if you want to just play something goofy etc. 
---
But when you’re just objectively being stupid because you’re trying to be unique and edgy or whatever in a group setting?  
---
That’s just annoying. 
---
As for leveling - whatever floats your boat I suppose. 
---
Leveling as holy though just feels like a cry for help.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid
---
you're forgetting that in patch 1.12, innervate is not a talent
---
Mage would be good for free water for her.. And the intellect buff so she can have more mana.  I assume she'd go priest then?  Since you said dwarf earlier too I am assuming you are going alliance. 
---
For portals too, remember you don't get portals until level 40 for SW and IF (org and undercity) and at 50 you get a portal for Darn (thunder bluff).  So you wont be making a ton of portals early on.
---
So we all start at 0 honor earned in P2 right? Like you can't save up HKs or anything?
---
I'm sure it's no coincidence that these were all dungeons I avoided.  I never realized it at that time, but looking back I clearly avoided the 'open' dungeons and stuck almost exclusively to the 'loot corridor' dungeons.
---
IMO, cloth level 1st aid, tailoring. Everything else: sell who cares how much all the shit sitting in your bank will go for in 2 months. You need gold for a mount and skills now.
---
I think it's equally important to have a look at the alternatives then the item itself. Atal'ai Gloves of Healing are pretty good, maybe BIS but hard to farm. Hands of the Exalted from BRD are very easy to farm and very good.
---
Sham elemental pvp: https://youtu.be/aymQJv9v8jA
---
Posted that somewhere else recently. This was one of the first pvp videos I ever saw, and it’s interesting seeing what a good player could do before a lot of people had figured the game out.
---
That moonwalking tho
---
If you want to get back into playing rogue just make sure to level one when the game drops and don't waste too much time. Dicking around while leveling should be done on an alt, because fury and rogue will *immensely* profit from the early guild rush when raids still fill their raid roster and invite anyone level 60 and ready to grind them level 60 dungeons.
---
Chain running 20min UBRS runs with your guild, 20 runs a day for 2 days will make sure that all melees and casters get what they need and alchemists secure flask of titans and stuff. 
---
Once you are late to the party, acquring key pieces like Dal'rends and Truestrike will be an absolute pain. 
---
So melee DPS classes that are often overpopulated profit from being level 60 decently fast (first 2-3months when raids are still recruiting broadly).
---
Anyone who said healing was for girls had a deathwish.
---
Keep your feet on the ground, horde friend!
---
If hord is a option shaman is a good choice the ancestral recall is awesome and travel form at 20 is nice and we all need more shaman healers in the game. You can play warrior getting to level whit wf is an experience. But you vill slow the travelling down a bit. On the other hand you have a excellent start for dungeons groups
---

---
I dunno, I played a rogue, and never even noticed. People really over exaggerate how good it is. Only class orcs can play that has a stun resist talent is warrior, and I wasn't going to start with the warrior anyway. Sap or blind him, and get to the squishies.
---
Nah, you only start from Phase 2, any other pvp activity gives nothing in terms of ranking.
---
There’s really nothing wrong with insta accepting and completing quests. I already do it with holding alt or something. What’s the difference? That I don’t click complete? Ur really being a weirdo on this
---
Yea, as others said go direct hdmi cable. I used to raid Molton Core and AQ on my 56in first edition Samsung 1080p DLP TV. It worked pretty well as long as you scaled the UI and sat maybe 5-6 ft away. 
---
I usually moved a recliner and the pc closer into the middle of the room when playing that setup. If you also buy keyboard and mouse wire extensions. You could leave the PC by the TV, which would be nice. As the time I kept the PC close to the chair though.
---
My setup has refined much over the years, now using an amazingly comfy setup. La-z-boy electric recliner and dual monitor wall mount swing arm have been absolutely my best setup of any over the years.

Prepare yourselves, gents. The 'ORLY?' is just around the corner.
---
&gt;This addon goes against everything that Classic represents
---
You don't get to make that call for me.
---
Hell yeah. First thing I did was check the source to see if it was made with tables. Sure enough, it is.
---
Maybe. But I don’t think intention is used the same way as intentionality
---
I think you greatly overestimate the “difficulty” and more importantly the mechanical complexity of Vanilla fights.
---
Mobs hit harder != a more difficult fights, the fights weren’t harder the were longer especially when you count in the downtime between mobs due to slower regen if you didn’t had stacks of food.
---
Raids were also considerably simpler and with the exception of maybe 2 fights not exactly challenging on the majority of raid members.
---
While retail now is a lobby game the complexity of fights has gone up considerably.
---
Vanilla was still fun because it was a logistically complicated game, but comparing it to souls is pretty silly.
---
Who remembers the order you click the statues off the top of their heads? I sure as shit dont.
---
this one: [Vicious Mage Clazzi](https://youtu.be/_8iSRYlfr70)
---
Tank prio :) Best looking on orc tanks - that facial expression of "kill me now".
---
I will second this since OP seems to be concerned with helping the guild. Engineering is great for threat\aoe\utility, someone "has" to go blacksmithing, and frankly if you're going to be the guild tank\MT, you are going to be living in 5 mans for forever, so it's not like you'll have time to be mining your own.
---
From a solo perspective mining\eng, herb\alch, or a lot of combinations could work, but if you're looking at this in terms of guild play then by "sacrificing" for the guild in going bs\eng, someone in your group should be willing to feed you ore and go mining\whatever.
---
So simple... it just. Might. Work!
---
Can you just let a guy be funny?
---
Tons of guilds recruiting here  [https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=rqigeuM-JHA&amp;redir_token=4bnIEoljmJvdRjembkgZvBTD2Ex8MTU1NjAzMjcyNkAxNTU1OTQ2MzI2&amp;event=video_description&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FHNT7UPq)
---
still only two slots and the useful one is for healers. Like green lens got it resistance variants after vanilla and all is loosely documented so when and how it changed is also bit of mystery.
---
Fuck 60s that farm other peoples quest mobs. Yeah thats right, fuck you.
---
Hehe, I see. But I'm sorry, not sure why you are replying to this in that case xD
---
Because these were meant as a filler for gear so you didn’t had to farm MC for 3 months.
---
If these release earlier they would trivialize raids even further MC isn’t a hard raid it’s just a gear check and an AFK check for about 20 of the 40 people in the group.
---
I think it depends on how good your name is.
---
We would take note of compounding evidence for sure, because sometimes the players reported would lead to the "Kingpin" of sorts, I guess you could say if it were for example a gold selling chain.  In general though you would be correct in that my main focus was tickets.  There were just so many issues from so many players you needed your front line folks on the front lines.  There were GMs specifically for investigating compromised accounts and things of this nature to though, so the investigations were generally passed off at a certain point.
---
Yeah had someone reported you and you had been in Orgrimmar spamming you purchased gold from someone, you probably crossed the line to where you would hear from a GM.  Not only are they obligated to step in at that point as they received a ticket and but all kinds of violations are happening.  I still don't think your penalty would have been as strict as the seller though.
---
But with mage priest-paladin is better thou
---
Those items should not be available prior to Silithus content patch so rather obsolete by then for existing geared characters. Still there is a chance it will leak content progression - then it could be useful for sure.
---
I was thinking more along the lines of farming for herbs or ores
---
Probably got clearance for it, but it was small enough it may have been cleared because it was a joke of sorts.  Definitely not standard though, and had they done that without permission it could have gotten back to them.
---
Link?  I was looking for some obscure info like boss armor and such
---
Now we’re talking some REAL BiS gear!!
---
Time moves slower the faster you travel, which is the opposite of what you want to achieve
---
It’s vanilla wow. Every dps class is 1-3 buttons. The tank has like 5 non CD buttons, and healers use 3 spells, but have 3 ranks of each they use. 
---
Boss/mob mechanics are unforgiving but simple conceptually. The game world was made for a 2004 audience—you know where a game like Morrowwind or FFX were the latest rpgs.
---
I'm probably going to play a resto druid and I played a shaman in classic so FWIW, if you want to be a burst caster, there simply is no comparison:  shaman is the correct class to pick. They have burst that you can barely imagine unless you've PvPed on a geared fire mage. They are a crit class so they work well bursting. If you go 30/0/21 you can heal and DPS. You can use NS+ChainLightning and then frost shock someone before they know which way is up and take a HUGE chuck of their health. Keep kiting and drop earthbind and you're gonna win a ton of fights. The downside is you will be OOM a lot and have to drink a ton. But if you don't care about that, you're gonna LOVE Shaman.
---
I'd say it depends on what you're measuring.
---
This is awesome insight.  It's kinda neat how we were able to generally piece together y'all's policy, purely based on the fact that none of us were ever getting banned lol.
---
Honestly, from a business perspective it just made sense.  If someone's spending money to buy gold, you know they're gonna be a loyal player that maintains their subscription.
---
Racist!

Druid tanks have a tough time progressing into end game raising.

**&lt;IRONFIST&gt; (Horde-NA) - Raiding &gt; PvP** 
---
Hey everyone,  
---
I'm going to make this short and sweet. &lt;IRONFIST&gt; is going to be playing WoW: Classic and we are looking to bring in some more folks to join us. We actually still play on Burning Legion (US-Alliance) and are a day one guild, so we know a thing or two about original WoW. (We will be going Horde for WoW: Classic because we have spent 15 years as alliance and desire a change.)  
---
We want people who just are looking to have fun with friends and get stuff done but not take it super seriously. **We will raid, PvP, run dungeons all of the stuff you expect**, but we are realistic when it comes to game/work/life balance as most of us who have been playing since 2004 are adults and need to get things done before video games. Toxic people who cannot get along with others are removed, we do not have time for that.  
---
So, what do you need to do to join us? Just hop over to discord and tell us you want to join. While waiting for Classic you can join our members in other games, join in on some conversations, or if you really want, just hang out until the servers launch.
---
Raid times TBD: We are adults and want to come up with raid times as a collective that works with everyone.

So for PuG BG's, I should either play full disc or Shadow?
---
Why are you getting so worked up about me not wanting to play on a PVP server? I'm happy that you care so much about me that you wouldn't want me to miss an experience that you find fun, but it simply isn't for me, friend. 
---
It's okay for people to dislike PVP and opt out of it; that's why other servers exist. Plus, I still have battle grounds if I'm ever in the mood! 
---
Also, I wouldn't order the steak dish. I stay away from red meat for health reasons. I would order the chicken meal instead.
---
I'm sorry for whatever it is that's really bothering you in life. I hope your day gets better, friend. This is not intended to be sarcastic. Sorry if it reads that way.
---
I thought if I traveled at the speed of light for 1 year and came back to earth that more than 1 year will have passed for earth. What the actual dilation is I’m not sure. In any case that would mean that I could travel for let’s say 5 days and that would equate to 2 months on earth.
---
Unless I in fact have it completely backwards. In which case, pretty embarrassing.
---
Not explicitly true, he could be the 1/40 that can off tank and switch to dps.
---
Upvoted because I appreciate your candid response
---
GB were a thing, the +4 was changed from 3+ in TBC.  They were also reduced from 40% DR to ~22% DR.
---
The general rule of original wow for melee was:
---
Armor Pen/Haste &gt; Weapon Skill &gt; Hit &gt; Crit  
---
This is normalized per itemization cost, and Armor Pen and Haste are super rare.
---
300-&gt;305 weapon skill is the most powerful itemization in the game.  305-&gt;315 is more than 1.2% dps per point, while 1% hit would be around 1%.
---
Oh man green lens, that sexy sexy cloth twink head :)
---
Thats fine, my issue is when there are level 60s spawn camping NPCs that people leveling need for quest items.
---
I know about Fury and Prot. I think arms is only for pvp, but IDK. You'll still take pvp hero warriors as offtanks, so arms can still raid.
---
Holy Pala
---
Holy Priest
---
Resto Druid
---
Resto Shaman
---
Frost Mage
---
Fire Mage (not in MC or BWL tho)
---
Combat Rogue
---
Shadowmastery &amp; ruin warlock
---
That makes 11 including arms, and those are the ones I can name off the cuff. The below is mostly guesswork tho.
---
Probably also some other kind of warlock, shit is still being debated. The tank will probably want a talented blood pact buff bitch.
---
Some kind of hunter, pretty sure it's marksmanship.
---
Disc priest might be a thing?
---
Warlocks want shadow weaving which is 20 points in shadow, but IDK if that counts; with the 15 sec duration on it you might be able to fit it in a healing build and really trigger the shadow priest mains.
---
Eh?
---
*Nothing* we have seen so far has used the new graphics (if we discount water and shadows).
---
If you're min-maxing, then play human. The dps boost from racial weaponskill is more than nothing, which is what the other races get.
---
When fighting targets 3 levels above you, which includes all raid bosses, 40% of your attacks will be glancing blows, which cannot crit, and they deal 70% of normal damage. The 40% chance cannot be reduced, but the 70% damage penalty will be mitigated as your weaponskill goes higher. At 315 weaponskill, glancing blows have no damage penalty.
---
Note, some of these specific numbers might not match classic, but the overall ideas are correct.
---
Well I’m glad my pain made someone’s life better! 😂 lmao
---
Yea now it's just flooded with racist brain dead trump worshippers and edgelords.
---
Thats basically the role I've played throughout my time playing Mmos. Someone who can swap between roles tends to be valuble for groups.
---
Such an odd video. He has imp ghost wolf and chain lightning at 2.5 sec cast. And everyone was so bad. It’s pure vanilla.
---
Rogues are definitely a nightmare. I don't seem to have as much trouble with warriors.
---
Don't forget that it was made for dial-up users
---
Ah okay good point. Might be good for someone who doesn’t have a healer set yet and needs a quick piece
---
After rereading your post, I’m not sure either.

To be honest, Addons shouldn’t “help” you play the game, whether its a reforging app, AAP, the raid addon that let you draw on the ground, or scripts in vanilla that let you pick up wsg flags insta.  
---
IMO, Addons should be mostly limited to altering ui. Things like bar Addons, uf Addons, chat window Addons, seem okay. Things that optimize the presentation of existing information—okay.
---
In addition to classic. I really want either a wow 2 or an expansion that takes us back and consequently removes a lot of “features” including the shop. I’d lean more toward a wow 2 where it’s vanilla with changes.

Haha, atleast you got me thinking!

Not really. You have almost 0 downtime as healer warrior and can do alot of the elite quest by your self. As stated above it is really good for instances sins you only need 3 more ppl. Not 2 more ppl and a tank. And maybe best of all it makes levelling a warrior fun
---
I see the card bears are already crying about getting ganked on pvp servers instead of just being the betas they are and rolling on a pve server problem solved.
---
I tend to think that your learning curve goes down proportionate to what you enjoy playing.  Example, if you like kiting you'll probably have a natural tendency to do it more and get good at it. Hunter at level 60 is often described as high skill cap so you can weave autoshots, kite, etc. So if you're in the mindset of "meh" for that stuff, you'll be bad at it. Otherwise, you'll research it and practice until you're good. Learning is about repetition anyway and they'll be LOTS of that in classic, so don't worry about it.

Those games were made for a 2004 *casual* audience. There were a lot of RPGs and MMORPGs that were hardcore, in a way that not a single game is today.
---
It annoys me when people think the ancient Romans were too stupid to hold a spoon the right side up, but this weird meme that people couldn't figure out games in 2004 is just baffling.
---
yeah but warrior was not the talking point here, he just said he is going mage.
---
The original version was BIS tank, the changed version is BIS dps.  This is why the #nochanges and PServer progressive itemization is retarded.
---
like 70% of orginal wow players experienced post 1.4, and probably post 1.8 only, when the AQ servers opened.
---
I just watched a video showing updated graphics using the current client on the CDN. It was way more than water and shadows that were updated.
---
Well, yes and no. 
---
It depends on who you ask, the people who are "standing still" or OP who is zooming around at a heckin' rate.
---
For us, his clock will move slowly. This of course causes his perceived time spent zooming to be less than what we perceive it as.
---
Assuming of course that [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#Velocity_time_dilation) is not trying to fool me, but since the documentary "The Planet of the Apes" supports it, I am confident.
---
Thanks for the response, appreciate it! I think I'm more trying to understand if its make or break or not. Whilst I certainly min/max and sim my heart out, it would be great if its like a few % and gives the freedom of race choice :) Don't want some orc with BF up smashing me aha.
---
Thanks dude.
---
OP's time would move slower from the point of view of Earth. But from OP's point of view time on earth would move quicker.
---
No one knows what happens if you could somehow travel *at* the speed of light. However, you will experience some time dilation if you travel *near* the speed of light relative to the Earth. Thing is, in order to start noticing the effects of time dilation you need to get to greater than about 10% the speed of light. Speed of light is about 670 million mph and the fastest object that humans have created is a space probe which (according to a lazy Google search) has gotten to around 165,000 mph. So why don't you spend some time trying to get our fastest speed increased by about a factor of 400. 
---
You won't likely make much progress, but this'll give you something to do while we wait for Classic.
---
I’d say a well played ele/resto shaman in battleground group settings is pretty complicated to master. You have many roles to fill and you’re essentially an offensive support role. Support first, clean those viper stings, wf those warriors, twist in a grounding totem if applicable, throw a shock or lightning bolts to burst someone down if you can afford to not heal someone, Purge warrior targets and any shields, tremor ur brothers. Oh yeah and FAPs may be nice for a class that has no way out getting closed in on other than pvp trinket or getting a cripp poison to overwrite other slows that u can remove. 
---
If you do this right you can turn games. If you do this wrong you will have dead teammates and lots of killing blows.
---
No, tri-spec is very good for organised PvP whilst SPriest is generally useless. Both disc and tri-spec are the go to organised PvP specs. If you’re just going to solo queue it doesn’t really matter but you’ll struggle getting past rank 8.
---
Haha memes are so much funnier when they’re true. 
---
Do I start the war and get a free kill only to have him jump me at an inopportune moment orrrr do I leave him alone only to end up regretting it when he invariably jumps me anyways.
---
You never know, I'm banking on some luck when classic drops, having never seen a BoE epic drop before myself
---
Hmm I wonder if we will get paladin exorcism working on undead players again.
---
what a boss, thanks man
---
Painful isn't it!
---
Holy fuck this got my classic boner so hard 
---
Might have to play mage or another clothie this time around, there's so much gear like this thats BiS or near for them, will be fun to work on outside of raids.
---
I like wasting my life away. Hense why I want to play classic wow. 
---
I'm right there with ya man. I'm almost at the point after waiting for 1.5 years after announcement and 7+ years for an actual official option to play classic wow where I'd rather them release it sooner rather than later even if it wasn't 100% polished.  I know... Unpopular opinion of a life time.
---
We all know what the base of Classic WoW looks like and blizzard has already said that they will allow us to play classic wow for the rest of our lives as long as WoW is still going. Let us just dive in! Oh god incoming the down votes.
---
It is theoretical after all. Thanks for humoring me though.
---
Exorcism worked on live retail for a while.
---
OT is common.  MT pretty hard to do for progression but fine for content that is on farm.
---
It is theoretical after all. Thanks for humoring me though. :)
---
You can expect to heal, or become undergeared overtime.
---
Sure, you may find a guild that doesn’t have their feral spot earmarked, but the odds are low. In most guilds, the feral, spriest, enhance/ret, prot warrior roles are spoken for via friends of the gm, long before you even have a chance to say you’re interested. 
---
If you are willing to heal in raids, there will likely be only a few druids. You can likely scoop feral loot. By bowl, if you’ve been actively collecting loot, you could make for an off tank, at the very least, you’ll be a bit formidable in PvP.
---
I did the same for shadow on retail, I’d raid heals, then respec shadow for PvP/farming for the rest of the week.
---
I have turned my back one to many times only to hear the stealth sound and break out in a cold sweat
---
go play live you filthy person.
---
I think travelling at the speed of light would make time dilation absolute.
---
Assuming the release date is in 60 days. If you can travel at 99.99% of the speed of light you can pass that time in about 20 hours and 22 minutes according to the first calculator that came up on Google.

South Park season 10 episode 12.
---
A person of culture
---
I'm currently (because I can't make up my mind) thinking about going feral as well. I think it is possible to raid, but a lot of pre-raid bis are BoE pieces that will cost you on the AH. Also, consider that after Bags hit, you can be a flag carrier. Could be boring at times, but the group will love you for it.
---
My biggest concern was if I could make gold. I've heard of a couple ways. 1. Sell tanking services (there are many ways to do this including reserving a drop like the first crusader orb, asking to keep all non-needed boss drops, to DE later, or just ask for straight gold). 2. Get some int gear, no Respec needed, and tag multiple mobs with moonfire and then hurricane. There's a CD you can use that prevents spell interruption from being hit. 3. The obvious gathering professions. Druid's ability to shapeshift is handy when nodes are close to each other, and cat sprint and stealth is handy for cave gathering.
---
DI for agro reset is a terrible idea.  There is so much that can go wrong with agro chaining.  It is safer to let the agroee die.
---
If they would die safley, then DI would have worked anyways.    
---
If they would not die safley, then DI would have chain agro'd anyways too.
---
was always nice to test your biggest crits on them
---
STV is more like two zones in one. There is a 32-38 part and a 39-42. Unless you like to grind you have to leave the zone after the first part for Arathi or something.
---
Theoretical? That you could make a machine to go that fast or that time dilation occurs?
---
I was fortunate enough to be busy with the military for about a year after the announcement and sorts forgot about it until recently so I haven’t been full of anticipation for as long as most. I think I’d go insane thinking about it all the time from announcement lol
---
You can go feral druid tank and get BiS from quests like Battle of Darrowshire or saving Moira Brozebeard :)
---
I think most of the ppl that claim that, was a small child at the time, and assumes that everyone else was a small child as well. 
---
Anyone that played in the "serious" progression guilds were as good at the game as players today, if you have put like 2k+ hours into the game it is obvious that you have learned how to play. Technical limitations does however make some difference.
---
Ohhh! Good old days, had a human warrior and was levelling , chilling in STV and I woke up with an UD warrior lvl 60 in front of me... my thought was ,, I’ll better run to the graveyard “ then he wave and left me alone ... later in the day I found him camping 2 lvl 60 mages ... sent a message for people to come in STV to help those cuz an UD warr is camping them , every one was ,, oh no!” ,,it’s that guy , no no “ , I think he was very feared by ally... my brother played in horde side and chat little bit with him and I told him to ask why he doesn’t kill low lvl and he said ,, There is no honor in killing low levels “
---
Not my fault you didn't choose to play the best Alliance race.
---
K3? There’s a guild on there who are designed around this.
---
Oh I know. I am well prepared to give that extra mile. Either raid with nightfall or to do the respec. 
---
I'm planning on leveling a mage alt so I can farm to support it.
---
Sweet! Does this account for higher ranks of life tap?
---
You seem like you’d be the opposite of fun to group with
---
Most fun you can have on a PvP server is leveling through STV when a server has just opened.  It truly is the best battleground Blizzard ever made and it has tons of quests too!
---
Nice.

&lt;Knights Templar&gt; - Alliance |NA – PvE| Semi-Hardcore
---
Introduction:  
---
Knights Templar roots were established during World of Warcraft’s launch on the Zul’jin |US - PvE| server.  Our guilds mantra was “The causal guild that raids hardcore” and we will continue with that mantra during Classic WoW.  We accomplish this by having a very casual guild environment, but a very focused and dedicated raid environment.  We expect to progress through raid tiers in quick order.  
---
What we Expect of Members:
---
We are looking for members who share the same mantra that was referenced above.  All members are expected to be respectful and polite when dealing with other members of the community.  It’s important to remember that when you join our guild, you represent us at all times.    
---
For raid members, you will be expected to show up to raids on time and prepared to pull by raid start time.  We also expect raid members to be well read in our raid strategies and able to follow the raid leaders instructions. 
---
Guild Culture:
---
We want this guild to feel like home, as it did for the members who were part of the original KT guild!  We are committed to building a guild environment that is friendly and helpful and is respected throughout our server.  
---
Raid Times:
---
Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday 8:00 -10:30 PM EST.  Sundays will drop off when content is on farm.

Druids are a fast leveller and you will find it easy to get dungeon groups. Finding a raiding guild will be harder, if you are really sett in playing as feral there will be maby one raiding spot in every guild. A little easier if you don't mind healing. If pvp is your thing you are a awesome flag carrier and you can always get away from a unfavourable situation in wpvp other then that you kinda falls into the Jack of all trade master of none category
---
I would consider that too, bear tanking seems more fun tbh
---
[This is from TBC](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217012503/http://elitistjerks.com/f81/t18771-protection_guide/). Though maybe battleshout didn't work that way in classic.
---
Expect to carry around 3 bags full of gear depending on whether you’re tanking, DPSing, or healing. 
---
And if you pvp expect to have different gear for that too!
---
Be glad you ended up Horde though, Tauren look awesome but night elves, well not so much.
---
Thanks for the actual response. I guess I could’ve googled it but I also enjoy the community and conversation in and around WoW classic/vanilla. I get bothers by “just google it responses” because then what’s the point of asking questions in a forum. You can literally google anything these days.
---
After having a deeper look at the wikipedia page:
---
You would have to travel for an infinitely short time at true c (spd. of light) since the formula (for the Lorentz factor) seems to indicate that the "speeding up/slowing down" approaches infinity as you approach c.
---
If you traveled at half speed (c/2); you would move about 15% quicker in time. You would need to speed up to about 98% of c to skip time at a 5x rate. [Saws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#/media/File:Time_dilation.svg).
---
Warrior being asked to tank stuff “god forbid I have to fullfill my role every now and again so that people can help me get insane 2h for myself”
---
Great, tell me how it went! One more question about your night elf racial remarks:
---
How does elunes grace make it possible for you to stand a chance against a t2/hwl warrior? 10 % dodge chance seems pretty marginal at best. And even if you land a dodge, doesn't that mean you'll eat a critical overpower afterwards?
---
Awesome post thanks for this!
---
If you are comfortable doing research and switching roles a lot then you can probably find a competent raid leader who understands your worth.
---
It won’t be easy but it is doable.
---
Hardiness is literally the only thing that’s offered for orc casters. If I get stunned as an ele sham, I essentially have zero racials to fall back on in a battle. Blood fury is useless for casters and is pretty bad in group pvp unless used at the right time. I get so angry when I’m healing a warrior trying to go off and he thinks blood fury will lead him to victory. 
---
Escape artist is amazing
---
Stone form is amazing 
---
Perception is situational, but very very good in battleground scenarios such as entering a flag room or approaching an enemy node that looks too quiet. 
---
Shadowmeld is VERY good in arathi basin, wsg, even wpvp and fd drink/eat trick with hunters. I cannot tell you how many times a well played Druid or ne hunter delayed a flag cap due to shadowmeld buying them a ton of time. 
---
People need to stop with the horde radials r op. I get that hardiness can be a bitch as a rogue, but you guys also have a class that can free heal for 12 seconds in full plate gear and can dispel anything that isn’t a curse, and never runs out of mana. We’re not asking to nerf divine shield.
---
There are maybe a handful of fights that will use a druid offtank over a fury warrior in tank gear. I mean, Trump is President so anything can happen.
---
Follow your dreams. Boomkin tanks 2020
---
FD Trap, then pull, then trap, then Wyvern sting.  A hunter can CC 3 targets for 10s.
---
Theoretical in the sense that if you could make a machine to travel at the required speeds then you could achieve the time dilation that I desire.
---
So for 8 or 9 days you are in the same zone doing the same quests and killing the same mobs, the only thing that change is the class you're playing ? Please kill me !!!!
---
Not a big deal man.  Just don’t group with me then?
---
It works for all physical snares.  It worked in ToC in Wrath, it worked in TBC, it worked in Cata.
---
There are some INSANE debufs you can cheese with BoF.
---
No I was on Discord. I mentioned it on the warlock class discord lvl channel and another guy responded with math that showed 11 hours. The original person that said 13 may have been in another classic discord. I was surprised, because I never thought 5 seconds of skinning could add so much time.
---
He was going mage to make the experience better for his gf if she plays healer in a warrior combo she will have less of a mana problem and it will be more symbiotic sins she will make his experience better aswell. And as a warrior/healer combo you have the option to level more like a healer whit alot of dungeon runs and elite quests
---
EfFicIeNcY iS aLl tHaT mAtTeRS
---
Viable is an interesting term. If by viable you mean you can make it thru a raid with an MS warrior, then sure. But Mortal Strike pushes critical debuffs off the boss for no benefit. It can completely ruin your Fire mage team's DPS by pushing off ignite, or a nighfall proc. It can push 5 stacks of sunder armor off the boss and screw the melee.   
---
So, sure its viable, but there is no reason to run it over fury spec and it has some pretty large down sides.
---
&gt; Lets assume we are going to have the unarmored mounts in phase 1 and starting with phase 2 they will be replaced with the armored ones. 
---
Prepare to be disappointed.
---
DMB radar tracks friendly players in your raid which is what the API allows. You can't get a perfect range check on enemies.
---
If I play with a buddy and we drop boe - we sell it and split  50\\50. Another case is if someone needs it as an upgrade.   
---
For pug situations, I have to agree that communication is the key. There is no golden standard. If 3\\5 in your party agreed on rolling for gold, you should either join them, or give proper arguments against.
---
One of the best examples of this is the Firecaller trolls right outside Zul'Farrak.  They are Elites but have very little HP and they cast a long 3 second Fireball so you only eat every other cast while killing them.  Because they are Elites, the xp is baller at same level.  Definitely recommend grinding on these if you're just waiting for group mates to arrive.
---
Scarlet Magicians outside of Scarlet Monastery.  I basically grind these while waiting for SM groups.
---
I think STV was more like MCX... (Most Extreme Elimination Challenge)
---
&gt;The value is not the same for a fury warrior looking to get geared for raids compared to someone getting a chunk of gold.
---
But what if they use the gold to get BiS for raids?
---
Yeah right... Lowbie stealth does jack sht against a high level player.
---
I'll have to see how it is. Depending on when classic actually hits I might have some lotro buddiea joining me. 
---
We have been enjoying the legendary servers over there but once janurary/feb hits. That game is dead again for at least a year
---
I don't know to be honest. I haven't heard that but I know there's a lot of informational stickies on the forums, so the answer would probably be there.
---
Yes everything must always be perfectly efficient.
---
Sometimes you find a better raider who is not an ideal combination but knows his shit.
---
I’m just telling him if he works at it and finds the right guild he can play his character.
---
You don’t have to act like a knob head.
---
&gt; Is this the crow calling the raven black?
---
In a sense, but mine was a reaction to your brilliant initiative to make this hostile.
---
As for the rest of what you're saying which I'll just summarise with:
---
&gt; I have experience, too.
---
I never said you didn't, in fact I assume you do since this is /r/wowclassic. 
---
What I *did* do was extrapolate that you didn't have experience with this particular situation.   
---
I have. I was contacted for almost that exact situation by a GM.
---
Just because you haven't, doesn't mean it wasn't part of Blizzard policy. That's you trying to prove a negative, which cannot be done.
---
Now, here's the thing. I have an actual, concrete case of why OP's case can be called "light griefing". 
---
--- 
---
Keep in mind this is the only question I'm debating with you:
---
**Question: Was OP's use of "light griefing" warranted?**
---
Argument 1: It's a colloquialism. Strict definitions are not required in langauge. We exaggerate, downplay, use sarcasm, irony, etc for the sake of forwarding a point. For OP it was exaggeration. *This is okay*, if you don't feel that way you are breaking with almost the entire population. That's on you, not us.
---
Argument 2: I have a legitimate case of Blizzard *sometimes* caring. Perhaps the person I griefed was a child?   
---
This does not mean what happened was policy breaking, but that it did constitute a kind of griefing.
---
Answer: Being killed in an unfair fight (higher level, or you are low on HP/Mana, or you are fighting mobs) is called ganking. People who are ganked relentlessly over time by the same person/people, refer to this as griefing.   
---
Emphasis:  People who are ganked relentlessly over time by the same person/people, **refer to this as griefing.**
---
You'll just have to deal with that, it's not going to change.
---
That said. Despite the fact you at no point referred to any statement from BLIZZARD on the matter of what constitutes griefing, you are correct. As a general rule on PvP servers Blizzard didn't give a shit one way or the other unless hacks or exploits were used.
---
Ref: 
---
&gt; Life on a PvP realm can be nasty, brutish and short. Justice is in very short supply. Every action you take in the world carries with it an added level of risk, from questing, to hunting down profession materials, to simply traveling from place to place. You can be attacked at any time, sometimes by an overwhelming force. Of course, the shoe can also be on the other foot, and you'll be able to turn the tables on your attacker, or find clever ways to delay them or escape from them. Some will become roaming slayers, seeking out enemies to destroy.
---
&gt; In short, the experience on a PvP server is different. We want it to be different, and that includes everything from honorable conflict on the field of battle to horribly despicable ganking. It's all part of the fabric that makes a PvP server what it is. 
---
&gt; Let the blood be spilled.

---
Strangely enough I don't remember this! o.O
---
In all seriousness, the way a lot of critters look in retail bugs me. They're weirdly over-detailed but still no closer to looking realistic. The bunnies look like they have their whiskers drawn with a sharpie.
---
The old models do more with less, I guess is how I'd put it.
---
On a private server now playing Alliance for the first time in Vanilla - I did not know the grief that was Red Ridge. Those Horde ganging assholes
---
What would armorsmithing be used for?
---
"You are supposed to be running that flag; not healing me!"
---
Rogue - Theres so many tools in your kit, so if you don't use *most* of them at the right time, you can easily fuck up. Even 1-10 is miserable as a rogue, it's arguably the hardest class to level early on. I've also seen *alot* of rogues that do pretty weak damage in dungeons. Granted, I've never used a dmg/heal meter in Vanilla or private-server experience, but you can tell when one person is kind of weak on the damage side of things. Sometimes they're contributing very little, but sometimes they destroy the place, with the same quality of gear.
---
I'd also say druid healer. Hear me out... theres really NOT a lot you can do as a resto druid, so everything you do right counts. I play resto, havent done any raids yet, but I already know theres always much more I can be doing, such as utilizing tranquility and natures swiftness better. Plus, if your healer doesn't use lower ranks of healing touch, have fun fighting 1 boss with 6 seperate heals before the healer OOMs. Also, innervating yourself in a raid... :/
---
In TBC, when you had summoning stones, my best friend and I would trick people into running gnomer.  We'd say "LF3M DPS for RFK" and then summon people to gnomer.
---
Ah shit, IDK if I wanna play if I have to think. Fuck that.
---
1. You may be mistaken about the API having a perfect range check on enemies.
---
2. Blizzard has already said they're going to be restricting certain parts of the modern API that don't fit with Classic game play.
---
So we retail now?
---
Moopoop and Moofuss send their regards

[Exiled] is a PvE/PvP guild playing on a PvP realm as HORDE. We operate off of Eastern Standard Time. Our raid schedule is as follows: Wednesday, Friday and Sunday  6:30-9pm and may carry past 9 depending on how the raid is going. We love to PvP but PvE will take priority to get gear in order to PvP at the highest levels. 
---
We currently have 30members signed up and still expecting more to register on our discord. We will be using Loot Council / DKP set up for loot which will be a combination due to individuals ability to abuse the DKP system. This process will be transparent for all. 
---
If you are interested in our guild or looking for more information you can message me directly or hit me up on discord at JayD#9596.
---
...everything in naxx is on par with t3...that’s the point...it all comes from the same place.
---
Just like aq gear is on par with t2.5.
---
A full t3 player would have advantage over a r14 player. The pvp sets are (essentially) high Stam t2 sets with less impressive set bonuses, no hit/spr, and two less items. 
---
For example, r13 priest helm is 33spell dmg, 4 mp5, 30 stam
---
T2 is 48 healing, 22 spr, 17 stam 
---
T2.5 is 28 spell dmg, 7 mp5, 1 hit, 22 stam
---
T3 is 75 healing, 5 mp5, 22 spr, 22 stam.
---
I wasn't saying he shouldn't go feral. I was saying that he shouldn't expect to do much tanking beyond 5 man's. Feral tanks and DPS have a very niche role, most of the best tank gear didn't become available until AQ20 and most leather DPS gear will go to rogues and fury warriors over a cat druid. It's not naysaying or 'muh spec' mentality, it's being realistic of what to expect in the end game. Not trying to be a 'knob head', I'm just offering a realistic set of expectations for anyone that wants to be a druid and raid.
---
Remember, to raid you will need 40 people. Guilds have to be large, consistent and fair. Gathering up 40 people at one time with a singular purpose is not exactly easy.
---
Its an American mentality as far as I've learned and not private server mentality.  
---
There is a greed button for the very reason of taking something for gold and not needing it for a gear upgrade. You greed for gold and you need for a item upgrade or the very least bis item gear.  
---
How would you know it would go towards ssomething like that? It might just aswell go towards an epic mount. If you want gold go farm gold.
---
Whoops I meant rogue sorry about that
---
I grinded exclusively from 20 ish till 60, took 10 days played and I ended up with around 1500 gold to show for it. Was brutally mindnumbing though so I don't recommend it nor would I do it again
---
Looking for Guild
---
27 year old. Full-time job. No kids. Looking for a hardcore/semi-hardcore pve guild. I have been playing off and on since release. Looking to experience end game content with a good group of friendly people. PM me if you have any more questions!
---
Completely false.
---
Yes it's overpowered, but no changes is better than trying to further balance vanilla.
---
Applied on Discord
---
That's not the orc way.
---
This is https://gfycat.com/corruptathleticbug
---
I used to write down on sticky pads the very memorable ones but aways lost them, addon would be awesome for this.
---
False. Black bear.
---
That's because they are immune to POSIONS, not nature.
---
Base absolutely was not 15% anybody who played a rogue can vouch for that
---
They buffed these greens in one of the later patches. A green chest with +40 spell power wasn't a thing during the MC/BWL era.
---
Druids can hibernate hunter pets or other shapeshifted druids.
---
Tell that to all the paladins who play ret...
---
Hunters who try to melee...
---
Druids who try to play boomy...
---
That Archivist Cape of Healing is so, so sexy.
---
See you on the other side vs 39 twinks camping the gangers :-)
---
I learned my lesson. NEVER leave a rogue in open combat. They’ll hunt and gank you regardless of what you do, so it’s best to simply take them out any and every single possible chance you get.
---
And never leave well-enough-alone. If they’re lower level, kill them anyway. If they’re higher level, kill them anyway. If they’re in a group - make that the one and only one you do kill, if at all possible. Hell, even charging into a group solely to kill the rogue is honorable.
---
Any decent group can do a 45min baron really, as long as you don't wipe you are fine on time.
---
Yea OT raids is fine. Get blammed when things to wrong less lol
---
Long as I van tank regular runs I can get my fix
---
What is your wife and yours timezones? 
---
We are PvP / PvE holding raiding above PvP.  
---
We will use a combination of Loot Council and DKP due to people abusing the DKP system. 
---
Let me know if this fits, we kind of fit your credentials. 😀
---
If the classic weather and skyboxes aren't in the game I dont think ill be playing at all; its honestly one of the major aspects of the game, believe it or not
---
Thank you! Thats the one
---
Yes! Thank you!
---
And here I thought Pallies were only good for bubble hearth. Lol!
---
Even if you had only 1 character, you'd be effectively doing "the same quests" and killing "the same mobs" throughout the entire game. There's very little distinction between killing a spider in Stonetalon Mountains or a spider in Hillsbrad. The only variable during leveling that can actually change your gameplay experience is class (and spec), not the particular monster you need to collect 10 hides/heads/hooves of.
---
So you miss when blizzard have an idea, say they will do something, half commit and then scrap the whole thing? 
---
Don't worry, they still do that.
---
Wrath was awesome but t9 was actually terrible and wasn't ICC the top raid for over an entire year and all we got in the middle was one single dragon under the temple? Blizz also said they'd make much more bosses for that area and they never did. Still, ulduar, the crazy level of lore from being in northrend, finally seeing arthas in person, and how fun my dk was(still my main character) make it by far my favorite expansion.
---
join the 39s twinks man! there will always be ppl around 40, always, wpvp is back!
---
As a melee hunter I approve this msg. You can keep that agi shit, it's all abt str and stam for this huntard!
---
Your Saphron video fails to mention he drops agro on landing.
---
It was required to raid in vanilla too.
---
It did exist, and yes people will use it in classic.
---
Level 10 quest rewards a nice dagger. Level 20 quest is a must so you can unlock poisons. Nothing else reeealy imp, you can get some nice boots that improve stealth at lvl 50. Thats the ones i recall.
---
Unfortunate. Oh well
---
IIRC their reasoning was that the heavier effects of Vanilla caused players to be unable to see anything, so they couldn't quest.
---
&gt; If you don’t have it you can’t get into a raid group and if you do it ruins the whole gaming experience IMO.
---
No.
---
Your guild at least not on pservers, can't check if you actually have the addon or not and if you just play the game properly none will ever notice you don't have it.
---
Not sure but it was typically light judged for that raid wide hot
---
Hell nah, those those dwarfs with the engineering goggles are the worst of them all!

ZA was so awesome. I loved seeing the guild slowly get more and more decked out in war bears. I was SO SAD when I rerolled DK in wrath and couldn't use it anymore. But then they changed it so you could but then I realized you can't jump out of water with path of frost with the war bear so it went right back to being useless.
---
I wish it weren’t a thing, but it is and most people will use it. And I’ll use it too, to avoid being at a disadvantage.
---
That looks like paladin gear if you ask me.
---
Human or Female Night Elf...purlely for asthetics...because fuck gnome/dwarf
---
Engineering...because who needs racials when you got Engineering anyway...be a man.
---
Mining because while they're all fighting mobs to make their way through the cave to those mining nodes, we're just stealthing through to them..SAP..Mine...Vanish
---
Oh you want to play 2s but you aren't a druid or warrior?
---
[Semi-famous wow video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM94UkLBEOE) all the way from original beta.  A warrior grinding mobs as fury dps slam spec.
---
I suppose it’s harder to tell in 40 mans right. There are less mechanics so it might be less obvious. I personally think the existence of DBM has ramped up the difficulty encounters in retail so much that they are designed with the use of DBM in mind.
---
I gank everyone but rogues. Piss a rogue off and he can make your life miserable.
---
I'm leaning towards mining/blacksmith (armor) or mining/engineering. Both seem to have pros and cons. Engi seems like the dynamite and bombs and shit can help with pulling and getting initial threat on mobs, which as I understand it is a problem for Warriors. 
---
But BS would allow for making gear and there's some nice crafted stuff, but classic being classic it probably requires a big time investment to get the patterns and mats.
---
Woo no bag slots. Oh well lol. 
---
Tbh tauren is the only race on the horde i dont hate. Though I am hoping that being horde gives me a better shot for tanking since I only need to compete with warriors instead of warriors and paladins
---
Honestly so excited to do the level 40 class quests in here!!
---
It’s always nessingwary’s camp...
---
The real power play is to wave and then stealth
---
I was saying the same thing about every night elf rogue when I was leveling in warmode at BFA launch. Honestly? Horde or Alliance don't matter: people who pick uneven fights are just assholes.
---
I put up with it for the 10% EXP boost but shit was not worth the grief.
---
Rogues that know how to systematically use their interrupts/stuns/cooldowns are near impossible to beat by any class if they get the jump on you...and in the end they can always reset or run away with vanish/sprint
---
Yeah but hillsbrad is a lvl 20 zone for horde but 30 for alliance so it fucking sucks to be horde there.
---
Some of the BOP resist patterns, Dark Iron Plate, a few others but I can't recall. It isn't a huge deal but if someone is asking a min/maxing question its pairs with engineering for maxing well.
---
I feel you. It just seems like everything we talk about in this sub is preserving things and making them they way it was originally intended. I don’t think blizzard ever intended DBM to exist and to me it totally ruins the game.
---
Lucky lucky you haha. I've been wanting a official classic wow for a long time and then having the actual announcement has actually made everything worse since its taking so long haha.
---
&gt; twinks 
---
yeah close to WSG vendor
---
weird because I've played on several PServers and on every one of the all of the 60 Druids I saw were wearing Tier gears...Shamans too.  Must not be too hard.
---
Leeeeeroooooyyyy
---
To be expected that you have to prove yourself multiple times, before people really appreciate your value.
---
People simply wont believe you and rather have a 17th fury dps in the raid group, rather than to think "wait - gearing so many DPS warriors with offgear wont work, darn..."
---
I don’t get a lot of pleasure tanking lowbies but everyone has their own idea of fun!
---
There are far too few corpses in that screenshot.
---
Done it before. All that matters is how hardcore I end up playing lol.
---
And if he does tank. Tauren bears get more health so there’s also that
---
That 1% dodge though haha.
---
You know what ... I've always been a player who avoids ganking Alliance, as a Horde. There are situations where I feel like its more appropriate, if we are fighting over resources, doing the same quests, and we're both equally geared and the same level. I usually leave lowbies alone, unless some lowbie Horde is ganked by another lowbie Alliance.
---
But after seeing this picture, I kept thinking about all the Alliance I have met over the years, the ones who even won't gank me until I'e aggroed several mobs, or they leave me alone, until another Alliance member joins then engage.
---
I'll have to reconsider the amount of mercy I give. I just don't want to gank new and drive them off this amazing game.
---
Though, here are a few class and race combinations I will always gank, because they are mostly min-maxers, and they won't quit the game even if I gank them a thousand times.
---
- Gnome Warlock and Mage
---
- Human Warrior and Rogue
---
I see what you mean - fair enough!
---
&gt; So in what world is 2 comments in a 70+ comment thread stating druids are a weaker class hateful then when they are a weaker class.
---
We're obviously getting nowhere here. If you didn't understand me the first three times you're not going to understand me next time either I'm afraid. Enjoy living in your delusion where the world is purely black and white and the truth is always a good, pure, and noble thing.
---
No its not griefing. Do you really believe that fair and honorable ganking is whats going to happen in pvp servers? If so I got some bad news for you. People will kill you no matter what level you are or how much health you have left. As long as someone chooses to be on a pvp server they should expect to be ganked repeatedly and not have an “equal lvl and health” fair fights.
---
Thanks for this. Never played arena content.
---
250k first day sales hype! Man, how times have changed.
---
I suggested last week that the not-so-uncommon practice of "reserving" an item be done up front and while recruiting group members, and I was down-voted noticeably. I don't know why, because it seems like it would be the answer to your dilemma:  
---
"Paladin healer L.F.M. Blackrock Spire, looking to reserve Draconian Deflector, p.s.t."   
---
Then, only people who 1.) want to tank or D.p.S. Blackrock Spire and 2.) Are not interested in rolling on the Draconian Deflector should send you a personal message.   
---
Would that NOT be preferable to what you suggest, which would be a protection paladin who might try rolling against priests/warlocks/mages on cloth chests for their holy off-set? A restoration druid who might roll on physical D.p.S. leather over a rogue for their feral off-set? A restoration shaman who might try to roll against a warrior for a 2-h mace for their enhancement off-set?   
---
If everyone rolls for literally anything they could equip in any capacity, it takes longer for each specialist present in the dungeon to snowball into power at the role they came there to do. I would argue that \*everyone\* suffers, \*except\* perhaps the people like who who don't mind being less-than-great at everything in order to be able to do it all. For anyone who just wants to be the best at their \*one\* preferred job, rolling on single-spec gear or \*reserving\* off-spec gear seems like the best compromise as long as it's communicated in advance.
---
I want to use my old name but people make jokes of this name at least germans.... and at the same time I'm afraid that I miss some old pals from the past
---
Sure, if you are planning to go ranged warrior, I suggest getting the fire element gun and getting the Flame Buffet debuff. However, this depends on if it scales with spell damage and what patch exactly Blizz decides to implement for them.

Boom roasted

A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me, or join Discord at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a)
---
"Oh great, a free Battle Shout!"
---
Just keep in mind the threat generated is divided between all mobs in combat, like a heal.
---
It's still good, but it's not a one button tank
---
How does leveling professions work? Are they gated by player level from the very beginning (ex: lvl 1 can't go above lvl 5 tailoring) or can low level characters be used for things like crafting mooncloth?
---
If professions are completely gated by level, what level do alts have to be to craft the cd gated items (mooncloth, arcanite bars, deeprock salt, rugged hide)?
---
I literally leveled a shadow priest healer in vanilla. You’ll be fine.
---
This is 1.12 state so will include all item changes over time. Wonder how Blizzard will handle items that changed with time.
---
If you're worried about the extra responsibility just don't play druid since they don't have a standard rez. Personally I'm also thinking of healing because I've also only ever DPSd or tanked. I'm not worried about people thinking I suck because I remember dungeons being super slow paced and people will adapt to that really quickly or fail. You can also heal in a dps spec in 5 mans and shamans fortunately have a pretty good elemental/resto hyrbrid that works pretty fine in pvp and pve.
---
Tanking any class has highest learning curve simply because groups expect a tank to mark and pull everything. So you learn all the dungeon mon locations pathing. Which mobs need to be CCd or killed ASAP. Learn how to LoS pull manage rage so you can snap aggro back from mobs all while watching your go bar for when you need oh shot cool downs.
---
It's a streamer /s
---
Same happened to me. Payed a little visit when i got 30 i found the same guy still camping. it was fun ganking him back
---
What’s DBM?
---
I have leveled 12 characters to 60 on private servers over the past 5 years. Banning an addon like that is pointless because I already have every quest in my head.
---
You'll have a blast as a Druid man. 
---
I wrote a little Druid hype post a while ago since Druids basically get shit on in a lot of threads here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ongg/i\_envy\_those\_rolling\_druid\_for\_the\_first\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ongg/i_envy_those_rolling_druid_for_the_first_time/)   
---
In short, leveling is SUPER fun. Battlegrounds (especially WSG) is AWESOME. The "only heal" thing is true, but even that is pretty fun in my experience.
---
[Furen's Favor](https://www.wowhead.com/item=6970/furens-favor) was always my favorite.
---
You'll be able to leave most of that gear in your bank though, most groups form up in capital cities usually. You don't need to carry your tank gear at all times.
---
Thanks! I knew the poison one was around level 20 and 100% necessary. The dagger quest is probably pretty worth it especially if you haven’t gotten any decent drops by then. Had never heard of the boots, “Whisperwalk Boots”, increase your effective stealth level by 1. Good stats and the bonus is probably really nice for things like BRD pickpocket runs.
---
Yeah, you might have better luck hanging onto the mats to sell later when people start having money.
---
Demo isn't indicative of final build. Also if it's in the final build then it's either vanilla blizz-like or a bug that should be reported. They have a working 1.12 reference client and server, blizzard has better resources to prove these things.than our faulty 13 year old memory.
---
&gt; Emphasis: People who are ganked relentlessly over time by the same person/people, refer to this as griefing.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;You'll just have to deal with that, it's not going to change. This crusade of yours is ridiculous.
---
I have no problem with people saying that, or believing that. I simply point out that they are wrong to believe it. It is you who seems to have a problem with me doing that.
---
So, right back at you my friend. I am going to point out to people that ganking on a PvP realm does not constitute "griefing" in any meaningful sense of the word. And peoples opinions are not meaningful.
---
You just have to deal with the fact that I am doing that, and will continue to do so whenever it suits me. This crusade of yours is ridiculous.
---
Even more so because...
---
&gt;That said. Despite the fact you at no point referred to any statement from BLIZZARD on the matter of what constitutes griefing, you are correct. 
---
...this. I am aware this quote by Daxxarri exists, I just saw no no need for bringing it up, because you were making such nice claims. I knew that simply asking you to prove your claim was the easiest way to win this discussion because, well...there is no such proof :-)
---
Childish? Maybe. But then again, this is a subreddit about a fantasy RPG.
---
Have a nice day =)
---
People used CTRaid, which did a bunch of things, namely raid frames, assist information; basically mandatory stuff. It also had a boss module that had boss timers. The main difference was that they weren't as accurate, and it had to wait for the first use of a boss ability in a fight before it could predict future uses of it.

**&lt;Frozen Dawn&gt; \[A\] EU PvP Server | Suomi PvE/PvP**
---
**Intro**
---
Frozen   Dawn is a Finnish speaking guild recruiting for Classic WoW. As we are   targeting people speaking finnish, the following recruitment post is   completely in Finnish. Do trust that it does not include anything that   is against the rules or norms of these forums.
---
**Meistä**
---
Frozen   Dawn on vuoden 2006 alussa perustettu aikuisille suunnattu lähinnä   MMO-pelejä pelaava suomikilta, joka sen jälkeen on muodostunut   massiiviseksi pelaajayhteisöksi ja suomiportaaliksi, jonka meriitit ovat   erittäin vakuuttavia ja peliskaala hyvin laaja. Killan toiminta alkoi   pienestä Dungeons&amp;Dragons Online -porukasta ja on ajan mittaan   kasvanut ja levinnyt mm. World of Warcraftin, Warhammerin, AION:in,   Lotron, EVE Onlinen sekä monien muiden pelien maailmoihin. Jokaista   näistä peleistä pelataan vielä, toisia enemmän ja toisia vähemmän, ja   tarkoituksenamme on myös jatkossakin laajentaa peliskaalaa tulevien   pelien pariin. Tällä hetkellä killan toiminta on aktiivisinta Final   Fantasy XIV:ssä, Guild Wars 2:ssa ja kestosuosikki Dungeon&amp;Dragons   Online:ssa.
---
Frozen Dawn saapuu   Azerothiin ISOSTI, sillä WoW Classic tulee olemaan yksi yhteisömme   isoista peleistä, jossa pyritään saavuttamaan merkittävä status tulevan   Classic WoWin maailmassa. Tavoitteenamme on rakentaa suurin ja   menestyvin Suomikilta alkuperäiseen Azerothiin ja nauttia oikean   MMORPG:n yhteisöllisyydestä ja haasteesta. Me olemme jo aikuisia ja moni   myös perheellisiä, eikä meillä ole välttämättä aikaa enää raidata   viittä päivää viikossa, mutta me teemme kaikkea contenttia aina   raideista PvP:hen sillä ajalla, joka meillä on käytettävissä.
---
**Mitä tarjoamme?**
---
Pitkäikäisen   ja menestyneen pelaajayhteisön, jonka riveissä SINULLA on mahdollisuus   pelata juuri niin paljon tai vähän kuin haluat, mutta silti saavuttaa   myös menestystä pelissä hyvällä porukalla. Me emme halua pakottaa sinua   mihinkään - saat pelata täsmälleen sitä hahmoa jota haluat, täsmälleen   niin paljon tai vähän kuin haluat. Toivomme ensisijaisesti uusiksi   Frozenilaisiksi sosiaalisia, hurttia huumoria omaavia ihmisiä. Se,   oletko nopea tai hidas levuttamaan, ei ole tärkeää. Tärkeää on se, että   sinulla on järki päässä ja sydän paikallaan. Meillä ei ole   osallistumispakkoja, vaan osallistumismahdollisuuksia. Meillä on   kuitenkin yleisen vapaan ja rennon toimintatavan ohella myös   mahdollisuus pelata ryhmissä, joissa on korkeat tavoitteet, ja näihin   toivommekin ensisijaisesti aktiivisia ja pitkäpinnaisia pelaajia, joilta   löytyy tahtoa toteuttaa asioita.
---
**Raidaus**
---
Tällä   hetkellä suunnittelemme, että Classic WoW:ssa tullaan raidaamaan 2-3   kertaa viikossa inhimillisellä aikataululla. Alustavana tavoitteenamme   on kuitenkin clearata kaikki PvE content pelissä, mutta maaliin ei ole   kiire. Tarkempi raidausaikataulu toteutetaan yhteistyössä koko killan   jäsenistön kesken lähempänä julkaisuaikataulua.
---
**PvP**
---
Killassa   tullaan myös järjestämään organisoitua PvP:tä. Myös korkeampaa PvP   rankkia metsästäviä killasta löytyy ja tahtoa saavuttaa suuria asioita   myös Horden nirhaushommissa.
---
**Hakeminen**
---
Meille voi hakea yhteisömme web-sivuilla: [https://www.frozendawn.fi/](https://www.frozendawn.fi/) Selaa foorumeille ja sieltä löytyvälle alafoorumille ”WoW Classic hakemukset”. Hakemusohje löytyy foorumin kiinteänä viestinä.

They wont be so profitable if everyone is farming them
---
Man, hearing all this, I know you're right. But as a druid main my whole life, it still hurts lol
---
Paladin buffs vs Shaman totems, which is more annoying to manage.
---
Which would be super dumb. There’s no way to know if Private Server experience is relevant.
---
Hardiness is objectively not better than escape artist, stoneform, will of the forsaken and war stomp. 
---
It’s a passive, it’s not guaranteed, it’s annoying to deal with for rogues and paladins, and that’s why you want it changed. Snooze
---
You had to be certain levels for the next bracket of professions.  For example, you had to be over level 40 to progress past 225 profession.
---
Yep. My classic character will be my thirteenth 60. I have seen and done pretty much every quest chain in the game. While I really dont need an addon, having the option to just instantly accept the quests when I know exactly what those quest givers want me to do is just a luxury that wont affect anyone else.
---
C'Thun casts a chain lightning attack that will jump to other players if they are close enough. The trick is it doubles it damage with every jump. The boss pull requires the tank to peek to pull the cast on himself while the raid runs in to position.... but when tank peeks badly the 39 people will create a perfect chain :) On a healers raid frame it was... beautiful.
---
As a Female Dwarf Priest soon to be main. I will wave with the best of them.
---
Vendorstrike was so bad it was bad even for alt-spec paladins.  Ret/seal of command is extremely dependent on slow weapon speeds.  You really need something 3.60 or slower, ideally 3.80 range.  Venderstrike is on par or worse then a slower blue 2h.  
---
There are basically no weapons for druids in raids, so no real concern there.  This is before weapon DPS converted into feral form damage in any way.  
---
For ret you would probably get to roll at 2h after any arms dps warriors.  Fury is typically better, so it was reasonably common to see alt-specced rets with high end weapons from the current raid tier.  
---
In terms of a shield, you will get any of the caster shields on priority,  Only paladins will want them on alliance.  A shield like malistar's defender has caster stats, but due to just the high armor alone is good enough to overgear tanking any 5man dungeon.
---
Yes it is gated and I can't exactly remember the intervals, but lvl +225 professions are from level 35+. So that means mooncloth, arcanite bars, etc. can be made from level 35 alts.
---
Right? Chill out man we know how to do ST.
---
Yes, eventually. It's not that hard when you have no armor, no spell resistance, but the point I was trying to make; Shamans can easily kill you without **casting** any spells
---
Whelps in Badlands and Swamp of Sorrows. Badlands has a small chance to drop the Dark Whelpling pet, SoS have a minuscule chance to drop the Tiny Emerald Whelpling. Plus they are Dragonkin which have better drops in general, and skinable. 
---
Basilisk cave - Crystalvein mine - in STV, out of the way, decent greys to vendor, rare named spawn, skinable, and I think there is a chance for some unique green/blue drop but I can't remember.
---
But it existed from nearly the start. Guilds used DBM or bigwigs. So having them is preserving how it was. I don't ever recall raiding without them.
---
Source?
---
Deadly Boss Mods. An addon that helps alert you of raid boss mechanics.
---
I am going to need a source for that.
---
Use to ride the boats back and forth there with a friend mage while leveling up. POM Pyro for both of us and try to see how many we can kill and still get away via the ocean before they finally ganged up. Probably some of the best memories I have of vanilla really.
---
Ah, yes. That’s right.
---
Thanks.
---
Halo 1 2 and 3
---
Don't have a definitive answer, but if I were to guess it relates to the mechanic not being place for channelled spells before this point. They could only proc on successful channelling cast.
---
So for AM this would move the proc chance from the cast to the first missile.
---
Pally or priest should heal. Frost mage. Fury warrior. Feral Druid. Let the druid tank most mobs.
---
All rogues caught out of stealth git got
---
This is actually a great example of how important animations are to a visual experience, not just polygons and textures.
---
I think animation quality tends to get short shrift in people's consideration of games' graphics, because it's harder to quantify or capture in a screenshot. Which is a shame, because it's a thing that developers can choose to invest resources in that will improve everyone's experience without significantly raising client hardware requirements.
---
I'm bothered because I don't want this game dumbed down by the likes of you. If you don't like PvP, and can't fathom that this whole game evolves around two factions at war, then go play a different game. *Period*.
---
You're removing essentially half the game. Most of us dislike this because you're trying to change an already amazing game in to something it's *not*. Maybe you can stick with BFA? I heard there's 0 PvP there
---
While its not something that needs to be worried about in Classic really, the one time i *have* used it recently on retail is for doing the old Tol Barad dalies.  Accepting 3 quests from 4 different quest-givers gets old, and ive done them all.  I just want to get it over with and get my badges for the mount.
---
Its just so much easier when you have no reason to read through the text.
---
They are bis until about 20 then you get the quest wand from BFD.
---
Most of the good stuff in engr is non-consumable, so you just need to make each thing once.  
---
The only exception is grenades, but you can farm a couple of hundred of iron before you drop mining to supply most people for months.  
---
With herbalism/alchemy,  everything is consumable so the mat prices stay high.  
---
That being said, there is window in a servers life when mining is far more profitable.  It is when people are just leveling up their professions or make boe weapons like arcanite reaper, and before the majority of the server is using consumables in raids.  I would guess that would be all of phase 1 and maybe phase 2.  Somewhere around phase 3 herbalism should overtake mining, and by naxx it should be far more profitable.
---
I allow myself to disagree with numbers ... as far as I remember ... MC was a blast as a hunter and numbers were rolling :P 
---
but if you could bring some historical data I would much appreciate it ... I would really like to dig into some data to analyse it
---
If you're speed leveling, it's pretty dumb if you do level at least herb and mining. You can usually get away with skinning.
---
Not using dbm/bigwigs in modern mythic raiding is how you “ruin the whole gaming experience”.
---
In Vanilla raids, there isn’t much you need dbm for until aq and naxx. But I swear to god, anyone who blows me up on vael or geddon should be gkicked.
---
First of all, you misspelled poisons (and put it in all caps on top of that), but more importantly,  POISONS deal nature damage.  
---
Couple of links:
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Poisons
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Nature_resistance&amp;oldid=1499207
---
It's in the patch notes for 1.6, along with several other dual effect spells not dealing damage to immune targets.
---
"Mind Flay - Will now cause damage to targets immune to movement slowing effects."
---
do every class quest. I even wish they added more
---
So you are going for "axeman"?
---
Everything is easy "once you get the hang of it" lol wtf
---
Also, depending on your class. There are some simply must do quests.
---
The warrior whirlwind weapon, the hunter pet quests, the warlock voidwalker.
---
Sure you could possibly do it without, but at great disadvantage. other quests though, could be skipped without problems. Succubus quest for instance if you are on a pve server and don't intend to pvp on your way to 60.
---
Me too. I get it
---
Feral tank, warrior priest dps, pally heal
---
Pou took a beating.
---
Reference [http://liquidcode.org/\~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/](http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/)
---
Priest will be a better healer for 5 mans, plus their dps sucks
---
Pally or druid should tank and let warrior dps
---
I think I'll take the consequences of being on a PVE server just so I can avoid the constant bitching between elitists like you and angry lowbies that don't know how to avoid ganks. It's honestly exhausting... Instead of giving someone advice on how to avoid gankers it's just this extremely hostile gatekeeping.
---
In modern DBM you can turn off individual bosses, or even specific alerts. That way you can keep all the useful stuff like pull and break timers while ignoring all the flashing alerts and ability timers if you want to.
---
It would be cool if there were guilds dedicated to holding territories and conquesting new ones.  Make the world feel more alive, having to pay attention to which faction is controlling the zone you're in.  People would get bored of it though.
---
With a great group dungeons almost gets good enough, but is never quite as good as questing.  Starting around mara, and defininelty by BRD the gear is good enough to be end game useful, so sometimes especially as a healer I would dip out of leveling early and just start spam running those to gear a bit as I finished leveling.
---
you should state if you were horde or alliance, it makes such a difference for feral.
---
Streamer won’t make it past ashenvale.
---
They were only good for low level stuff as they would get rocked by and reasonable damage.
---
It's a rogue...
---
What's DTF? Furries down to fuck?
---
Yes it would be dumb, thats why I said sadly.  It is the truth though for people who feel elitist.  They want gear faster they will ask questions to see if you have/have not cleared the content more recently than 15 years ago
---
I think I still have fraps. The good old clone copy someone I know sent me lol
---
I loved grinding elemental earths from elementals in Badlands
---
Can you or OP elaborate on the differences?
---
drakefang talisman
---
Druid doesn't excell at anything and on top of that has a high skill ceiling.
---
The only change needed for Vanilla is raid boss/mob hp increases and removal 16 debuff cap. 
---
Rogues can alReady blind lock people from 100% to dead, how is it not balanced that 1/8 of the races have some minor ability to resist a stun?
---
From the opposite side, mine are:  
---
* Undead Rogue/Mage
---
* Orc hunters.... I hate orc hunters
---
Are we talking hardcore or casual?
---
Because HC guilds wont care about your versatility
---
Tbh after firing up the retail client to have a look at the water effects, I think I'll go with the 'Good' setting, rather than 'Ultra'. Ultra I think goes a bit ott with the reflections to the point that it's distracting.
---
Mage and rogue.  Both have enough control that if played perfectly can cover up for their missing HP.  Most other classes have to at some point in a fight trade blows and if you are missing too much gear that will trade will kill you.
---
A BoE that can bought from AH it is impossible to "need". Everyone is getting the same effective amount of gold regardless of their ability to use the item - even if someone equips the item they are essentially wasting the gold they could have gotten from selling it.
---
The Mind flay used by PvE mobs is not the same Mindflay that is used by the Priest class. Blizzard making a fix to the player specific version of the spell does not imply the NPC version of the spell also behaves the same way.
---
Just because poisons deal nature damage does not mean that the mob is immune to nature damage you goofball
---
Spriest and enhance/ret are truly wasted slots. Have one priest spec for the shadow weaving but heal as disc (not enough debuff slots and threat issues for enh/shadow), and just say no to enh/ret (their dps is bad, like to 40% of dps classes bad) . Feral would easily double the damage of the other specs, esp as alliance, but requires extreme amounts of consumables and farm.

ferals benefit the most from kings and the least from windfury. as a horde feral tank ur racing vs fury warriors that are buffed with wf and Don't have salvation.
---
Probably not. They couldn’t make the toggle work properly in retail, so there is no reason to think they would be able to in Classic. Also, old armor and even landscape textures clash very hard with the new models, it’s just not a cohesive look.
---
Fucking lul!!
---
IIRC Pre-wrath, anyone with a shield could block a physical snare completely.
---
What would you say are the most engaging pve classes?  Anyone have  options that aren't mind-numbing?
---
Undead rogue all day everyday MINIMUM
---
Truth lol!!!
---
Hmm i was planning on rolling with alch/herb, but then again. I did level my mage with tailoring/enchanting last time.
---
This time though, I'll be rolling lock, so i might still do that. Are soulshard bags still a thing or were they purely a tbc thing?
---
Well define hardcore? We cleared AQ not in the first, but 3rd ID (C'thun is a bitch) and cleared Naxx (mainly probs with 4HM/KT) after5 weeks.
---
No we didn't create additional private Servers to practise tactics like other guilds did - and we didn't aim for first kills. (Fun Fact: On quite a few bosses speedkill records)
---
get the cloak, not the boots.
---
To this day, I don't understand how they managed to make something cute out of 5 polygons or so! &lt;3
---
This is the correct attitude.  You know a rogue is going try and gank you as soon as you pull a mob, and he probably just ganked some other guy 5 minutes earlier, so he has it coming.  Get rogues or get ganked.
---
I hate the new Blizzard. The bad mood Blizzard.  The always rude Blizzard, spaz in the news Blizzard.
---
We AREN'T planning thats why our cookies look crazy
---
What exactly do you mean by hybrids? How many are you going to be using? What's your tank?
---
AQ really doesn't have all that many gear(in this case dps) checks, the bosses are easily tanked, healing needs to be solid but you can always bring more healers and there's no fight's that really demand high dps perhaps besides Cthun. 
---
I could see you clear up to him, heck probably even kill him. In naxx you can do about half the bosses because they can be killed with tactics alone.
---
I'll be the 29 twink protecting the young ones in Redridge.
---
Shaman totems are always annoying to manage individually. Paladins are more raid wide cooperation but there are very good addons for that for the 1.12 client and I'm sure there will be just as good if not better ones for Classic.
---
Since we'll be running the 1.12 version of spells, pally buffs will last 15 minutes and are castable on classes unlike there original 5 minute iterations from early vanilla.
---
I'm not sure on the original state of totems but in 1.12 there are worse to manage than pally buffs.
---
tl;dr Shaman totems are more annoying to manage.
---
CTRaid!
---
&gt; Now there's a name I've not heard in a long, long time. A long time.
---
-Obi-wan Kenobi
---
It's more just because I've never really healed or played shaman at all. Looking forward to learning something new though and as long as I can find a few nice people I'll be good.
---
The ele/resto pvp spec is pretty much why I am choosing shaman in the first place. Wanted to play ele and pvp but too lazy to tryhard playing ele whilst raiding. And healing seems like it will be good fun
---
horde feral tanks are completely viable, feral druids do the most tps because of crowd pummeler even with windfury scaling worse.
---
Maydie is the prob the movie I watched the most back when I was a lil shit kid, good times.

---
This. Wotlk was garbage and the start of the end for me.
---
Most def, was in barrens yesterday on pserver and for about an hour this guy was going on about how his alt was named nuck chorris lul
---
Indeed they do! Played Alliance and will probably roll Horde on release.
---
Horde might appreciate a Feral even more with that Crowd Pummler TPS
---
She’s in the kitchen
---
New models?
---
Since I know how time consuming it can be to farm all that shit for Feral (lots of consumes+Crowd Pummlers) I might skip going that route for Classic and probably play a more laid-back class
---
False
---
Hunters are just below rogues and warriors until ZG, by that time they are about same dps as warlock/mage.
---
you named 6 things that arent QoL changes
---
I'd say make druid tank as feral, warrior and mage DPS.  Priest can probably do more damage as shadow than ret so might just make pally heal but priest might get better gear access for healing earlier on so priest might need to heal.   and depends if pally has a good weapon for ret or not too.
---
So pally and priest could probably be interchangeable based on gear. but the others I would probably keep the same.
---
To make matters worse, the database you're referencing has inflated reputation values.
---
i know they are viable, its just inherently harder on horde side.
---
There are some thing's you're just gonna have to have.  If you don't have the required DPS for some fights, or necessary healers or tanks, you're gonna have a bad time.  I think you have the right idea though.  I would say with ALL the time people have had to sit and contemplate everything, the cookie cutter Min-Max Spec-Class combos aren't interesting to me anymore.  Everyone knows these dungeons can be beaten, why not spice it up a little by doing something crazy?!? Anyone else remember that 40 man all priest run of Onyxia?  i say we can do better than just doing the best boring old perfect class/race/raid makeup combos.  I'd rather watch a raid full of shamans doing BWL than another minute of just another group doing Naxx...
---
You can literally solo it as a hunter so none cares about warriors wanting it.
---
Holy shit this would be a hilarious place to camp on launch thanks
---
Wouldn't you gain more advantage from the warrior tanking? He'll get rage from taking damage and the feral can be behind the target.
---
Robe of the void but you can just farm for t1 felheart robe or go for robe of volatile power also from MC
---
I cant wait to get them and the bunnys as pets again. Miss the old models, they are cuter.
---
As long as you aren't limiting your raids to *only* hybrid classes in suboptimal specs, I don't see any reason you can't full clear everything. It may take a little longer on Cthun and some Naxx stuff since your other dps will need more gear to make up the gaps, but you can definitely still bring a couple of ret pallys/ele shamans/balance druids or what not. It's not like they do 0 dps or anything like that.
---
Colorized, lol
---
They actually did commit to doing a lot of these community-oriented things and followed through on a lot of them for a very long time before they eventually faded away. One simply needs to check the tabs across the top of that page and the news posts from back then to see the evidence of this.
---
Purge the heathen with holy fire and the holy nova.
---
You can totally go tailor/mining
---
This is kinda cool to see, it brings back good times haha.
---
Historically I've been completely split between Alliance and Horde. But being able to play as a tall, proud upright Orc shaman would have me completely swayed to their side.
---
“How you expect to run with the wolves come night when you spend all day sparring with the puppies?”
---
That's the proper philosophy I follow as well. I am more than likely to help a lowbie horde who is about to die to mob than gank them. I want to fight them when they are ready, at full health and mana, and with neither of us having the element of surprise.
---
You don't get better at PVP killing people who's spell literally can't hit you.
---
Could you explain this a little further please sir?
---
The feral is going to have an easier time holding aggro most of the time. Warrior threat isn't really great until fairly late. You certainly could have the warrior tank but: Feral tanking isn't a huge loss to dps. Warrior tanking is a huge loss to dps mostly. So Warrior tank + cat feral = less dps than Fury Dps + bear tank dps
---
Are we talking about 4-6 / 7-10 / 12-18 "hybrid" specs in your raid?
---
Always remember: it's the player behind the screen not the spec. Sure a Warrior gonna do more DPS than a Feral - yet still there are so many terrible players and them only playing "god tier"-specs wont do them much if they're still messing up mechanics
---
Blizzard has said that they wil be restricting and modifying the API to only allow certain types of addons. 
---
For example, they made it clear they will not be allowing any one button rotation macros. 
---
With these restrictions and limitations in place, I believe it is safe to say that the live add-ons will not work in WoW Classic unless they just happen to not break the limitations.
---
you need a microwave and small fridge or icecooler :)
---
If you don't have it, and die in fire, then you are no longer allowed in my raid until you have it lmao
---
The Pally Power addon manages your paladin buffs for you. I believe there's a shaman totem addon as well, but it is a bit more complicated.
---
Straight back orcs
---
In modern WoW that’s totally true, but in Vanilla things are a bit lopsided with the majority of Horde leveling through Mulgore/Durotar/Barrens, often not stepping foot into contested territory until 30.
---
Alliance on the other hand are thrown into contested territory at level 13-14 at earliest and 18-20 at the very latest no matter which leveling route they take.
---
Prot warrior, enh sham, feral druid, priest healer, druid healer. 
---
Prot simply just has a lot going on, relative to vanilla--it is still pretty simple compared to mythic raiding combat today. 
---
Enhance and feral have funky rotations that require totem twisting or  hopping in/out of form. 
---
Healers are generally engaging, since every fight, every pull is different. Priest and druid press the most different buttons. Sham look to press chain heal as often as possible and paladins just spam flash of light or whatever.
---
Hunters pretty much auto shot and make sure they are not in motion when their auto shot wants to fire. 
---
Locks and mages spam shadowbolt or frostbolt or a 6:1 ratio of fireballs to scroch. 
---
DPS warriors and rogues have multiple buttons to press. DPS warriors have 4? buttons and rogues 3?
---
But raiding was different then. Mythic raiding in modern wow is the game. Raiding in vanilla wow (until naxx, when raiding got serious) was how you got loot to go pvp. At least on Arthas, most horde players slayed dragons so they could get more loot to go run in their guild premades. We would raid, clear mc/zg/ony/bwl, thatd take 3-4 hours, maybe two nights. Then after raid wed form into 2 wsg 10mans and spend the next 6 hours in bgs--facing alliance guild premades who had done exactly the same thing. We'd premade all weekend, we'd premade until pulled into the raid channel on vent. We raided to get loot to kill alliance. All the guilds had vent info of the others, so when a game devolved into a 50 min affair, we'd get on their vent and trash talk or and this happened a few times, we'd have the warrior flag carriers meet in the middle and 1v1 eachother to decide the point. 
---
Im pretty sure im rambling, but its mondya and i really dont want to work.
---
opposite for tanks in fact. 
---
Ally feral dps is stronger, however for feral tank horde is better.
---
It’s a fake, he has 5% run speed on his shirt lmao and who knows what else lmao. Just as a reference of what Troll is capable of (not trying to go out on a limb bragging about times), I’ve done 1-10 on Troll in 1:38:42 and there’s another guy that did it at 1:37:58 I believe and he’s getting close to a sub 1:35.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/hYbESSC](https://imgur.com/gallery/hYbESSC)
---
My point is is that blizz didn’t intend for it. I get it but it makes the game significantly easier for the most part and I wonder what the raiding scene would look like without it for once. Could be interesting.
---
EPA!
---
There are plenty of druids weapons available from raids after MC but the best weapon for pve is manual crowd pummeler from gnomeregan. 
---
The raid drops would mostly be for pvp and raid trash since it would be madness to try to farm up enough MCPs to pvp regularly and use on each trash pack in raids.
---
Warrior even with pre raid bis is the best dps in the game. The notion that warriors need to scale through raids and eventually become the best is not true, they start out as the best and only get even better and better. So yeah if that 17th warrior has been doing a good job of getting crafted gear and pre raid bis blues they probably do more than you, as unfortunate as that is.
---
Hi, /u/amnesia998
---
Welcome aboard!
---
I do like the straight back orc but why the hell did they give them the douche stance with the one shoulder slightly forward? What a weird decision.
---
Is the cloak actually the best reward when ignoring the stealth bonus? I had thought that the mask would be better.

\*\*&lt;More Scrubs than Brillo&gt; 
---
Horde |⚔ NA-PvP ⚔ | Leveling/Casual - ?? Guild\*\*
---
I played vanilla W.o.W. as 90%+ Alliance from vaguely 2006 through most of Wrath of the Lich King before quitting for years, and was elated (as many of you are) to hear the news of Classic approaching.
---
I'm 34 this year, and remember being 20-21 years old and this being my first M.M.O.R.P.G. I didn't know about slow main-hands vs. fast off-hands or why it mattered, that active weapon enchants wouldn't proc in feral forms, how much hit chance gear I needed to properly dual-wield, and much more. Through mutually painful trial and error, I was shown many tricks and much trivia over the years by those who knew more than me, and there is ever room to learn...but a year flew by before I knew it, and vanilla had transitioned into The Burning Crusade, rendering irrelevant much of the content that I never had gotten a chance to explore for myself. Aside from a couple of Zul'Gurub P.u.G.s, I never raided in vanilla, and solely focused on end-game dungeons, leveling alts/twinks, professions, general farming, and helping friends and lowbies do friend and lowbie things.
---
This go 'round, I am eager to reboot my old leveling/casual guild, &lt;More Scrubs than Brillo&gt;, in order to hit the ground running. Fresh servers await us, and it's the wild west of possibilities out there. To borrow a freshly relevant quote, "When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives". I feel that a leveling guild that recruits the moment the servers open will have an advantage over solo players, but a leveling guild that recruits \*\*before the servers are even announced\*\* is getting the jump start on getting the jump start. As a certainly older and hopefully wiser self, I wish to pay forward some of the patience, assistance, and camaraderie that was offered to me over those years. 
---
1. Leveling: Though I won't be no-life'ing this process, I'd like us to get to 60 relatively quickly, helping one another with group quests and professions, more important than ever on a fresh server without an established economy. The first tailors (myself) making bags for those who need them, the first alchemists making potions, and so on will be crucial members of the community. I'll be main'ing a mage to tailor/enchant, create portals for those who need them, food/water for those who need them, and try to reduce downtime for the group that way. Get creative, help one another, and let's beat the opposing faction to 60 as best we can without "no-life poop-socking" it.
---
2. Gearing: Though no resentment will be held toward those who use our community as a place to grow until they are 60 and able to join a committed raiding guild, those who reach  the cap and decide to remain will ideally group up to run end-game dungeons for pre-raid best-in-slot items. Grinding instances on repeat can be tedious, and so people who know one another ought to work more cohesively and have more fun by default. The chances of wondering \*if\* someone can even do the job, whether or not they'll compete for your drop...I believe communication should remedy many of these concerns. I will be looking to establish a Discord once the release date is officially announced, as it appears to have replaced ye ol' Ventrilo.   :P
---
3. Raiding(?): Much of this is contingent on unforeseen variables, but, should we manage to first get many of us to 60 and then get a number of us geared from end-game instances, it would be super nifty to attempt a raid. To be a \*casual\* raid guild would, I think, be the mark of success for what I set out to do, here. By and large, this guild is a leveling/casual guild with the first and foremost goals being to help one another level and to gear up via instances, and even if my guild simply becomes a fly-by for a hodgepodge assortment of levels and gears as they quest/farm/dungeon/etc., I'll be happy to be here and be a part of it. Still, if we ever managed to get 30+ people in pre-B.i.S. to fill out most/all of a raid roster, I don't know why we wouldn't want to at least \*try\* that once a week. 
---
So, that's the bulk of the mission statement, for now. I've got a Google Drive document where I've written down the Reddit usernames of the people who have messaged me expressing interest in the guild, and I plan to send out messages when an official date is released to gauge interest, and then a second message when the servers are open/live indicating the name of the server we will all be migrating to (as well as the Discord information). Though this style of organization won't be for everyone, I am open to suggestions/questions/etc. regarding this leveling/casual style of guild with the hope of dabbling in raiding end-game, but ultimately just being a crew and having a blast. If we band together and help one another with leveling/farming/professions/gear/etc., we can influence the fresh economy, tilt the balance of power on the field, and start to snowball the server in favor of the Horde!
---
Best of fortune in your endeavors, regardless of your path!
---
\- Tom Wolfe
---
You're right - my statement was more into the direction of loot distribution in a raid enviroment. All those Meeles DPS still in BWL with probably "shitty" weapons&amp;eq. whereas a Feral has his gear at that point probably allready
---
Yep like some people have said, it was required back then as well and people will continue to use it when classic is launched.
---
You look at fights like... Lets just look at Magmdar in MC for an example. He has a fear every 30 seconds. If your tank gets feared you either have to rotate another tank in, or magmdar runs free, or just blasts your tank and can be a wipe.  Why risk that? Get a damn timer, so your warrior can stance dance it properly or have a priest fear ward / shammy totems up. There are plenty of fights like this where bosses have mechanics that people need to know about and knowing the timer on those abilities is extremely important. 
---
I think NOT using DBM or Bigwigs or whatever you want to use in classic is just you intentionally nerfing yourself for no reason at all. I dont know about some people, but personally I dont get off by wasting time where the fix is an easy solution of having a timer for an ability lol.
---
THAT A MAN OF MY STATURE SHOULD HAVE TO WEAR A DRESS
---
Also no shame in clicking a few less-used abilities when needed. Not really running around much as a healer.
---
at lvl 35 you can learn max lvl professions
---
I dont know, compared to the other datadisks the pvp in Wrath was still pretty mild. Arenas could go on for fucking ever.
---
care to explain why?
---
You should just play on US servers, the lag playing from that distance isn't too bad these days.
---
NA Pvp undead warlock looking for group or guild to level with.  Looking for priest/shaman/mage any body to grind tag mobs quickly together. A healer and tank main would be great to farm dungeons quickly as elite mobs give good exp.
---
Two great options there, scarlet elites are around level 30/31 and ZF ones are 43/44.
---
No problem you asked a good question and I wanted to spew out my thoughts =)
---
Blizzard definitely intended something like this to be in existance. They allowed addons to the game very early on if not on Day 1. I didnt look into that timeline. 
---
But people have been keeping timers on monsters and abilities ever since Everquest was a thing. To allow addons into a game and not expect someone to make "timers" for boss abilities woudl be ignorant lol.
---
When 'just more HP' on stuff was actually pretty good because it reduced your downtimes when leveling and made you die much less often.
---
This is the reason why I'm going to play lock.
---
Is that a factor in 5 mans, or mainly in raids?
---
It won't really make a difference, Warriors are THE premier tank class in vanilla on both factions. Pally tanks in vanilla, unfortunately, are more of a meme than anything due to limitations in their kit (mostly their heavy mana usage with no way to regain mana and their lack of a taunt) and vanilla itemization being really bad for them. They can only really get away with tanking 5 mans and will basically never tank in raids.
---
I'm not trying to change the game, though. Have you been reading what I've posting? As I mentioned, I don't want anyone to take away PVP; I simply don't want to play on a PVP server. I played on PVP servers for the first eight years that I played the game. I'm older now and have less time to play. I don't want to deal with PVP if I don't have to. I'm not trying to change the game; PVE servers have been part of this game since it was originally released. Just because you feel that PVP is essential to you, does not mean it is an essential part of the game. That's why PVE servers existed at the start of the game.
---
Again, I'm not trying to change anything. I want you to enjoy your PVP server, and I'll enjoy my PVE server. We can both enjoy the same game in different ways. I want to play Classic because, when I started, I wouldn't read quest text. I can't go back and do those quests on live anymore, but I can with Classic. I want to explore old zones that got destroyed in the Cataclysm. I can't do that on live anymore. I want to relive doing quests to gain my warrior stances again. I've always played Horde, so I want to see things from the Alliance perspective as well. 
---
I don't want to take away your fun from PVP. I'm glad there are ways for players who enjoy PVP content to have fun as well.
---
Assumptions:
---
*WoW Classic releases in 85 days
---
*We're travelling at 99% the speed of light
---
Your second would be equal to approximately 7 seconds on earth, so a little under 12 days.
---
Windfury increases dps by a lot for melees but ferals don't get that for dps, so horde feral dps is bad.
---
However because bears do so much TPS with pummlers, they are stronger on horde because TPS is more important on horde.
---
I can't imagine what atrocities those NPCs witness and what they think.
---
"I just want to finish my goddamn book and these idiots keep slaughtering each other."
---
Almost fucking nobody is going to farm that shit.
---
Hoping that official moderation will help tame barrens chat on classic. P servers run rampant with racism and other obnoxious shit. OG barrens was just disgusting, baffling, and chuck norris jokes. I miss the OG barrens.
---
"Wow, they're ripping off WoW!" /s
---
mostly raids. everything works in 5/10 mans.
---
IMO druid is the highest learning curve. Playing bear is easier than warrior tank, but feral DPS has the hard to master powershifting rotation and in my opinion healing as a druid is the most complex in vanilla. There are several different healing specs which have different playstyles, and you always feel like there's something you could have done better - it's a very proactive type of healing. 
---
Most of all, as a druid you always feel like you're playing the class not the spec, since there are numerous situations where you might want to throw out a few heals or decurses when playing as a feral DPS or go into bear form and tank some adds as a healer.
---
horde has threat problems, ferals do way more threat than warriors.
---
but most guilds will end up using dual weild tanks over a feral
---
This is an awesome post. Are there posts like these for other classes somewhere?
---
if you are a lock you have to be early to raid becouse you HAVE TO farm souls for healthstones and summon people and Soulstone healers like ALOT,
---
 mages you will be getting whispers nonstop for water/food/portals. just spend 15 min making 300+ waters before raid and you also have to buff.
---
warrior, you have to tank, if  you dont have any problem with that then the only annoying thing is that you have to bring your dps/tank/FR set/ consums for dps and for tanking, you will be sharing your dps weps/rings/trinkets with rogues.
---
Rogue, you just showup for raid with your consums ready, you have to interrup??, oh yea poisons fuck that, if you are a horde just on your offhand lul
---
Gathering profs are worth picking up, extra gold or save the mats. Crafting profs get kind of expensive as you progress which means less gold saved at 40 for mount. I'm planning to do skin+herb to 60 and save all mats on bank alts, then drop herb for either lw or alch.
---
"Sneakybeard", but any other juxtaposition of stealth and facial hair work just as well.
---
"Secretstache"
---
"Mysterychops"
---
"Gimliganks"
---
Yeah but 1-10 is like...1-2% of the total leveling.  11-60 it's definitely the easiest.
---
I’m going to be skinning my ass off and farming cloth for tailoring to sell bags.
---
Oofff. That sounds rather unforntunate for them. 
---
One thing I dont get. So many people on down on druid OT/DPS. But druids get a rez. Ideally no one should die to complete a boss, but it happens. does a battle rez count for so little in wow?
---
If blizz didn't intend on it I'd think in the last 15 or so years they'd have done something about it.
---
Well Blizzard did say #nochanges
---
Overall, totems are just a constant annoyance in terms of having to cast them constantly.
---
The main annoyance for paladins is dealing with prima donna DPS warriors constantly asking for 5 min buffs if theyre arent enough Paladins and also getting whispers for buffs running out when theres 2-5 mins left. We can see how much time is left, please stfu.
---
So the Shaman mechanic is way more annoying while the Paladin buff meta is more annoying
---
Humans can purchase the human mounts with no rep requirement, so the horses. If you want to purchase the nightsaber mounts you would need to be exalted with Darnassus.
---
ah okay thats what you meant, that makes some sense.
---
You need to do a little bit of research before you just go spewing bull shit made up in your own head.  Making one mistake is fine, but sitting here trying to defend it is just embarrassing.
---
They're immune to NATURE damage, and poisons as a result because poisons are NATURE damage / school.  This isn't even exclusive to elementals in MC.  You can go to Ragefire Chasm, or many instances, oir open world areas throughout the game, and run into elementals that are immune to nature damage.  
---
Source:
---
Many hours playing as a rogue and druid at max level during retail vanilla and countless private servers.
---
Not definitive 'official proof', but simple google searches document various other players talking about the problem with elemental damage dealers (shaman specifically, a druid to a lesser degree since you had arcane spells available to help) in vanilla WoW.
---
I don't believe I can link directly to the post as its based on a certain server we can't mention here, but here's a quote from it (first hit when googling the topic):
---
&gt;Shaman vs Nature-based elementals is such a broken match, unparalleled.
---
Nature: The lowest dungeon in the game, RFC, already puts a fourth of the mobs being rock elementals immune to it. Maraudon packs a number of nature immune mobs as well, Roccor in BRD and every rock elemental in Molten Core is as well.
---
Classes affected: Shaman and caster Druid. A moonkin can just stick to moonfire and starfire (which has a higher spell quofficient than wrath anyway).
---
Well, there's only so many classic posts and even less blue posts; OSRS on the other end, is essentially endless.
---
(Unless you're Lynx Titan.)
---
I did it in 2004 and started again on a pserver a few months ago and it's honestly not that bad.  You have 0 downtime for food or mana, so you can grind mobs like crazy.
---
Addendum:

I'm 34 this year, and remember being 20-21 years old with this as my first M.M.O.R.P.G.

Aside from a couple of Zul'Gurub P.u.G.s, I never raided in vanilla, and solely focused on end-game dungeons, leveling alts/twinks, professions, general farming, and helping friends and lowbies do friend and lowbie things.  
---
This is an opportunity for myself and others like me who were young newbs when vanilla was out, and want a second shot at making the best name for themselves, experiencing more of the lore first-hand, and just overall running it back. Still, no discrimination toward first-timers who want to experience what the hype was all about for themselves, for I cannot pass judgement on a person for wanting to appreciate for the first time that which I myself have long appreciated.
---
Something about rolling a warrior and demo shouting critters was super satisfying.
---
"Yes...yes...I can feeeeel your angahhhh"
---
DS/Ruin lock has better damage than SM/Ruin.  The latter, though, is still nice to have for a tank group (phase shifted imp's blood pact) or when corruption can be used up to an extent, plus it is flexible for grinding and even PvP. DS/Ruin is full glass cannon and quite poor in PvP.  
---
A second and third (and even fourth and fifth) come for mages and rogues due to variants:
---
There's arcane/frost mage (standard dps frost) and winter's chill (frost/arcane, just a lower damage debuff-bot for winter's chill's +10%crit on frost spells).  A single winter's chill mage is more than enough, though, and the lowest geared one is the best to fulfill this duty.
---
For rogues it is combat, sure, but dagger and sword are different. And when crit rate gets high enough the door gets open for seal fate builds (usually dagger-based, but there's the sword variant).
---
All of this is strictly PvE, of course.
---
Healing isn't necessarily "harder" just different. I couldn't dps for shit in raids but healing came natural to me. If it were simply easier vs harder roles then I should have failed miserably as a healer.
---
*with a dot on your ass :P

UD Rogue main here.

This meme is scarily accurate.
---
Chuck Norris jokes would have to be my enduring memory of Barrens Chat. I had an Orc Warrior alt. It was Chuck Norris jokes on Barrens Chat all the time. It was relentless, 24x7. Don't people get bored of Chuck Norris?!
---
You are wrong

Achieving something is an achievement, that has nothing to do with THE achievements with were introduced later in wow.
---
I for myself had fun in grinding things and working towards a goal, going a way I discovered by myself. To me the road was more fun than reaching the finish line in the most time efficient way. And I think, this is were people differ. I didn't level cooking for raidbuffs and min/maxing.
---
It WAS kind of funny at first, but the reason I was doing the run in the first place was a different undead warlock had been camping the FP in Auberdine. 
---
I saw her off the road near the fork to Grim Batol, kept running without interacting. 2 minutes later I see a skull level void walker chasing me down. I die, Rez, no one around. As I get to the first tunnel I see something flicker out of the corner of my eye—she’d been hiding in a bush. Camped me through the tunnels until a level 30 something Paladin ran through. 
---
That part made me laugh, Bc I saw them enter as I died, they kept running without helping, and I could see on my kill screen that the warlock waited a beat, then turned around to chase after the pally.
---
As someone who spent countless hours watching TBC PvP videos on WCM back when I was at uni and lost all this precious content when my old drive died, this is an awesome gift.
---
I'll download all my favorite movies again right away. Thanks a lot!
---
It's quite the step up from pooping in a sock like the old days.
---
Look how far we've come.
---
In pvp, horde druids don't have to worry about shamans dispelling their hots.
---
My tauren priest is named “Holycow”
---
I cant tell if youre serious or think im retarded
---
If you are going dwarf, go priest for fearward and if you want you’ll have shadow for pvp which is in my experience lots of fun in vanilla
---
\*feigns death when things go badly\*
---
Implying they wont already be trying to make your life miserable, I've never met an honorable undead rogue, and that's how it should be lol.
---
Is this BWL? I don't remember the druid class call on nefarian being this weird.
---
"Druids...MIGHTY FINE TIME FOR A PICNIC DON'T YOU THINK??"
---
Hunters are in every raid. If the goal is to be in a hardcore guild the slots available will go down as the raid levels go up. But hunters are very good dps in early raids and dungeons. Every raid NEEDS hunters for kiting and for tranq shot etc.   
---
Druids don't get shreded in openw orld, they just root and run away if it's not favorable. As for healing in raids, again depends on your guild choices. For casual guilds, you can probably dps. But I would expect to heal if needed.
---
Whoever signs up. Id still take people based on performance if we have more than 40. Id be willing to take feral tanks
---
*The music*
---
*it's so amazing*
---
I got to rank 13, after playing a couple of different classes to 60 and raiding up to BWL. 
---
The trick to the system was having pre-made and building a spread sheet of everyone's honor if you were all friendly and take it in turns to cycle the ranks among your pre-made groups, You did have to no life however.
---
I found that the PVE raid gear gave you more damage, and the PVP gear gave you more HP with slightly less damage than the raid gear, from a Mage's perspective.
---
A few trinkets were needed from Raids to give you that 1 hit kill pyro for WSG pre made vs pre made matches, tho I had more fun playing a frost mage defending the flag while leading the BGS.
---
When Naxx came out that gear was probably better, tho my Rank 13 gear + the Rank 14 weps you could buy in TBC lasted me for a very long time while lvling in the new zones. Had was my go to set for the Ogre mage tanking boss fight super HP!
---
Around 10 danish guys. Some serious, some more casual, looking for an alliance guild on a pvp server. Would love to raid and pvp

i think the only race that is restricted to just their mount and thats tauren. (outside of r11/av/zg/strat mount)

**&lt;Completion&gt;** Horde | East Coast NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore     
---
Sixty iterations off the central finite curve, there's a semi-hardcore guild called &lt;Completion&gt; that will dominate world PvP, raid Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm, and create a family like community.  Our discord has neatly organized collections of all of the top class guides, profession guides, and BiS lists. Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.     
---
**Who are we?** Our guild is run by experienced and skilled players that have played since 2006, and our leaders have achieved PvP ranks ranging from Rival to Gladiator on retail, and raided at a mythic level with exceptional parses. We are looking to min/max our characters at a relaxed pace to dominate all aspects of PvP and PvE and have a blast doing it.    
---
**Who are we looking for?** We are looking for more like-minded players with relaxed character min/maxing aspirations with a passion for PvP and raiding to join our ranks and fill out our 40 man roster. We expect our raiders to have extensive knowledge of their class and their role. Prior boss knowledge and research is preferred but not required if you're playing at the appropriate level. We are also accepting any casual players looking for an active community.     
---
**What will we be doing?** We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday, 8-11 EST and will use a DKP system for loot. We will offer spots to all specs so long as the dedication to play is there. We also will be doing many world PvP events and PvP raids, as well as an extensive amount of premade BGs. We will make a valiant attempt at rank 14 without killing ourselves in the process.  Also, we will have other weekly community events such as dueling tournaments, "where is X" events, and weekly bounties against certain Alliance players, all with gold prizes.    
---
Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.  
---
Message Khoopa#1365 on discord for an invite!
---
I'm fairly certain that the only mounts (sans Horde ones, obviously) that humans couldn't use is the Mechanostriders. Only Dwarves and Gnomes could ride them.
---
Humans have no other restrictions if I'm remembering correctly.
---
Might join your discord for a chat.
---
So if I want to be an undead priest but also want to level in the barrens and leave trisfal at 10-12, will I miss any race-specific quests that reward a new spell or useful reward?
---
No! Only priest, elemental shaman and moonkin caster dps!
---
Also the Barrens is a massive zone. Many players there at the same time.
---
Even on pservers it's pretty much just an edgefest.
---
[mum, bafffrooom!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F8bs_THKiY)
---
&gt;The cloth donation quest to gain reputation was introduced in patch 1.5, this means we can't rely on that.
---
And Classic is 1.12....which is after 1.5...so...
---
&gt;Lets assume we are going to have the unarmored mounts in phase 1 and starting with phase 2 they will be replaced with the armored ones.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; (these mounts where replaced in patch 1.4 with the armored version) 
---
Now...to address your question.  If you want to do this it is possible to reach Exalted with Darkspear by around level 47ish or so.  What you have to do is at level 1, no matter what race you are, you go to Orc/Troll starting area and start questing there.  Do all quests at the level they are given for (in other words, don't wait until 60 to go back and do them...WAY less rep then).  You get the most rep for quests at the level range they are intended for.  All quests that give any type of rep for a specific faction, also give a little rep to every faction.  So questing is the way to go.  
---
You may also want to do some Googling and see if there's a list of quests that give Darkspear Rep, and Rep in general, and you want to do those quests for sure at the level range they're for to get max rep.
---
I did a google search.  This looks promising for what quests to do.
---

---
Well I didn't do it as a comparison VS life tap, since you can do both (IE Drain soul, life tap, and start DOT-ing again).
---
I *did* chart out if you were using Imp. Drain Life and Imp. Life Tap to maintain health and mana to see if using Drin Life -&gt; Life Tap was MORE efficient than Imp. Drain Soul in terms of regaining mana. The answer is that Drain Life-&gt;Life Tap is gives you more mana, but it takes 6.5 seconds with the full channel of Drain Life and then Life Tap gcd, so it's kind of a waste of time. You'd be better off DOT-ing everything and wanding everything to just start natural 5 second rule mana regen.
---
**TLDR:** I guess after doing this math, I think Imp. Drain Soul isn't as insanely good as everyone claims, but it is free mana if you are planning on chain pulling the next mob when your current mob dies. If you are about to run and can take advantage of natural mana regen, probably not worth the mana of Rank 1 Drain Soul.
---
We aren't limiting them to only hybrids, but as I said in another comment I think one issue were going to have is a lack of willingness for pures to accompany us. Why would a fury warrior come here when he could go to a speedrun guild and clear raids in an hour. (unless he wants to be put in a group w 2 enhance and a feral and get 9% crit + windfury)
---
In addition, im guessing many healers would join us and say "oh I can go shadow/enhance/feral? well fuck healing"
---
so we may have a tough time filling required role slots.
---
Dead serious. Wish more guilds took this kind of approach.
---
u bear will do way more damage and threat than a warrior tanking.
---
How hard would it be to go herb/alch and then switch to engi/alch once I can sustain myself off ah herbs, or would it take forever with fresh servers? I'm basically trying to help with consumables since there is approx 8million, but also don't want to miss out on the sweet sappers. But almost feel like helping with consumables/using them to make money is a good thing to have in my pocket too
---
Managing Pally buffs pre 60:
---
Is there a way to make it less painful? My Pally Power addon only works on Greater Blessings :-(
---
Roll a Tauren, their starting lands are pretty great looking
---
Server transfers aren't confirmed to be a thing. They weren't in vanilla (afaik, maybe at tbc prepatch?)
---
The comments are accurate. Battle shout threat got nerfed either during TBC pre-patch or on TBC release, I can't remember which. It was there for all progression up through Naxx though.
---
likely 12-18. Not by choice, but I think if we did this it would be likely that we would end up with most of our guild being hybrids looking to raid.
---
Its going to be like any other guild, performance + first come first serve = raid slot.  If no pures/tanks/healers show up then we would have to have a huge hybrid raid.
---
Yeah the BRD gloves are very close, I don't know anyone who attempted to grind Atal'ai Gloves of Healing. But Atal'ai Gloves of Nature Resist were BiS NR gloves going into AQ....I attempted that while waiting around for AQ launch on my priest on pservers....never got them, RNG for the drop plus correct stats is crazy low.
---
I agree, however I won't be in the starting zone forever, and will be have to move into the less good looking zones which is my concern.
---
During leveling, hunter is pretty dominant. Your pet carries you pretty hard and you can legit beat most people just meleeing then with your pet until the 40s when you actually have to start playing.
---
WPvP hunter is an awkward class. You rely heavily on AotC and keeping range and random mobs can mean your death. Theyre very dependent on terrain aand mob spawns because of this.
---
Hunter is heavily dependent on how the engagement begins, technically you should win any fight that you open at max range and your opponent isnt mounted. At mid range, Enh Shaman and skilled Mages will have the advantage against you. Ele Shaman, Warlocks and Priests are generally the easier matchups. The rest are about even.
---
It's unfortunate, but at least since it's a remake of the game, people who roll pally will know what to expect this time around and won't sink time into a Pally expecting to be able to main tank raids. As a side note, if Blizzard does eventually release Classic TBC servers down the line, pally tanking becomes *much* better. But that's neither here nor there.
---
&gt; does a battle rez count for so little in wow?
---
Battle rez is valuable in wow, and in fact one of the big reasons why Druids are brought to raids (the other big one being Innervate). That being said, you should never need more than 1-3 battle rezzes in the raid group; if your raid needs it more often than that, there are player problems that having more battle rezzes won't fix. But yes, people do value having a battle rez or 2, and they are often the difference between a kill and a wipe.
---
I will say this about Warlocks.
---
Everyone is too lazy to run to instance entrances and expects you the warlock to always make the walk and be there for summons.
---
Then always end up in a situation that they cant accept it, or they afk for some reason after asking for a summon.
---
Then they remembered they forgot to do X or Y and want you to re-summon. Using up another shard.
---
x-x its not the worst plight but damn its annoying.
---
Otherwise is great.
---
I now roll a holy priest (retail) and rolled holy/disc (vanilla).  For me it is just part of my personality (I'm in the medical field IRL). 
---
Pros
---
1. You never have an overly hard time finding a group as healing is always required.  Only tanks have an easier time.
---
2.  You get to be co-captain, so to speak, with the tank.  The group doesn't move without either of you. DPS are your children.  You get to be a leader.
---
2. Healing is very complex (especially in vanilla with scaled spells) and overhealing.  Anyone can drop huge heals, but its hard to do so effieciently and not waste mana on overhealing. DPS doesn't really have anything like this.
---
3. All aspects of healing are measurable. It's easy to see where you are deficient and can make improvements.  You can track, heals, overheals, dispels, etc so you can constanly improve.
---
4. Due to the previous two points, it is challenging.  Trying to keep a group up (especially a bad one) can be extremely hard.  Spam healing DPS that is standing in poison, tanks who think you can just zerg everything, dps breaking early, etc.
---
5. You are always engaged.  Except on extremely easy fights or with great groups you can generally expect to be engaged the entire duration of any dungeon/raid. People are always taking damage.
---
Cons
---
1. Thankless.  if you don't like to help people and get little thanks for it you probably won't enjoy it.  Healers don't get the glory, not in PVE, not in PVP, not ever.
---
2. Be prepared to take most of the blame if you fail.
---
3. Bad groups can get really old really fast.  Trying to heal people who don't listen or don't know mechanics is horrible.
---
4. Depending on class, leveling can be a pain.  Especially in vanilla where respeccing cost a ton of gold.
---
All in all being a healer is pretty great, I like it over any dps (I have yet to tank anything high level).  Sure it can be challenging and frustrating at times but it is very rewarding.
---
I even looked at it now and thought “could hunters shoot some sort of fireballs?” Then your comment. Wooooooooow.
---
Mara sucked too.  Got lost in that place too many times.
---
I was considering making a mobile site with a small message board for people to track where the guild was going to get placed on server-wise, but I think I wanted to wait until more info about classic gets put out there, like a release date for example.
---
Also played on EU Darksorrow
---
Damn those alliance premades from Ninjapartio, the Paladin Rageknight in particular :D
---
I think you're overestimating how much people want to min/max. This sub is not an accurate representation of what the classic pop will be like. A majority of people want to play with a group they enjoy hanging with that fits their schedule. You'll have plenty of people that just want to clear some content.
---
One mostly does frost damage and makes water.
---
The other mostly does shadow damage and summons people.
---
Pretty sure one of the last quests in Tirisfall is a lead-in to Barrens.
---
That said, Touch of Weakness is your level 10 skill (largely useless, tbh) and you have to go to UC for that. 
---
But Barrens does have a quest that sends you back to UC, so maybe you can pick it up then, if you somehow didnt before you left for Kalimdor the first time. 
---
IIRC Devouring Plague is 20--you may even be considering Alterac Mountains instead of Ashenvale/Stonetalon (shit zones imo) at that time.
---
Yeah I get it. I truly do. Some parts of me don't want to play on a PvP server either, especially during reputation farming in Silithus. But for me, it's such a big part of the game, that I can't remove it. It would break the immersion for me.
---
It’s not so much the issue of threat. While leveling, warriors don’t generate rage very well. The benefit of group leveling with a warrior is that the warrior can take on more mobs, generating more rage, thus having enough rage to actually use abilities. I do agree that the bear will be better for holding aggro, but the fury warrior is going to do even less damage by not tanking.
---
Hi, /u/Raibyo
---
Hunter is one of those easy to play hard to master classes. Because anyone can play a hunter but it's hard to be a good hunter that pulls good damage and able to keep up into the end game.
---
Not sure what you're talking about, barrens was raided 24/7 in vanilla, the Crossroads was constantly under attack and usually mostly dead. I had my hearth set to camp Taurajo just so I didn't have to deal with potentially zoning into an active massacre attempt.
---
And when I say constantly, I mean constantly. Almost every horde player goes through barrens, and alliance knows it.
---
I think my best friend and I largely missed Mara back in the day.  Usually went from ZF to ST.
---
Warcraft I, II, and III.  
---
Wrath introduced a lot of the systems that helped turn Retail into what it is now, whereas Frozen Throne was probably the best end-cap to a trilogy in gaming history.
---
How do we know for certain?
---
it'll be good to be back
---
Which healers can dispell enemy effects off of friendlies (defensive dispell)?
---
Thank you for such a detailed answef! Exactly what i was looking for. Think i’ll be going with warlock then :)
---
Howdy. We are recruiting for a guild that aim to raid twice a week in order to progress through content while it’s relevant. We will in to way go for server-firsts or such hardcore goals but we believe we can get into Naxx and hopefully take down KT. We are around 50ppl now, looking for all classes still. 
---
What I wonder, with such a large group as yours, roughly how many are interested in raiding at all, how many want to go hardcore and how many are going slow, just lvling 14 alts, that kind of stuff. 
---
There could absolutly be room for you all, we can have social players and pvpers in the guild and they would be welcome to sub in on raids if they would be needed. 
---
//Glamorama
---
Hopefully so. Truth be told though, as long as we have enough healers and tanks I have ZERO issues with a raid of 25+ hybrid dps. Even if just for the notoriety and laughs of being that "stupid fucking hybrid guild" and how much discord would light up when Nefarian went down.
---
One of my movies are there! Cool! :D
---
I didn't make that connection when I wrote it, but yeah! That's totally what retail is like!
---
Those are my top 3 favorite classes (rogue &gt; hunter &gt; mage)  
---
What does that make me?
---
Maybe start by putting your intentions in the Looking for Group Monday thread(s) here and on the discord. Can add/change certain details as the weeks go by. I would bet that there are lots of people out there looking for a guild that won't pigeonhole them.
---
Yes but only on specific items.  Granted the green belt, gloves, leggings and boots mail items of Sorcery are still quite good until you get better sp items.  Also, you can't do summons until whenever that content is made available.
---
Perhaps, I am also fearful that people would be extremely interested and I would crack under the pressure of too many applicants.
---
If you're red, you're dead to me. I'm CATCHING ALL FADES! WALK RED, GET HIT!
---
Talk Shit! get Rekt!
---
Hi, /u/Bernhard_NI
---
I like 'Stabitha' for a female dwarf :D
---
"Looking forward to duo my old lady"
---
Why am I thinking of the wrong thing...
---
The starting zones are only a small percentage of your adventure. After level 20-25 everyone is sharing the same zones. If your goal is to reach Level 60 you will take 90% of you leveling time outside those zones.
---
Come join my horde guild when it launches where we want hybrid class leaders to encourage and teach people to play these specs better
---
Haldir Yahoo over here.
---
NA or EU? Or perhaps the rare aussie??
---
As a Horde player who recently rolled Alliance on a pserver to get some vanilla Paladin experience and plays a Dwarf Priest on a TBC server, I’d recommend you to go Alliance. As much as I love Dwarves (3rd coolest WoW race after Goblins and Orcs), I miss my primitive mudhuts, the pre-30 leveling experience and I still can’t get used to encountering an Orc player and realizing that the name is in red. But at least I’m no longer considering playing a Paladin, now it’s just a dilemma between Priest and Shaman.
---
I’ve never played a Druid, but mained a Shaman on ED years ago. Leveling is pretty horrible, PvP is not as cool as you saw on those youtube PvP videos until you get good gear from BWL/AQ, and while it’s very fun to raid as a Resto, the usual raiding spec is pretty much useless in the open world or BGs. The main reason I quit back then was the constant need to respec between 30/0/21 and 0/5/46. If you pick up a Profession which doesn’t need that much farming to make constant money at 60 or play the AH it should be bearable though, my mistake was going Engineering/Mining.
---
Bro Barrens chat was never moderated in retail, and it won't be in classic, grow up and turn it off if you don't like it.
---
Yeah an early good wep helps a lot :)
---
ActiBlizz too busy counting their money to make a good game. It's obvious they don't actually play their own game.
---
There are two types of Horde players.
---
Those who contribute to Barrens chat, and those that should have rolled alliance.
---
if everyone's doing it then you have everyone to gank!
---
Yeah but barrens is horde territory, making it so lowbies can't be killed unless they take an action first
---
Exactly, which is why I'm unsure about my choice due to the majority of the zones outside of the starting area don't look great imo
---
lol, I was about to type almost the exact same. but you beat me to it :D
---
As someone played Rogue through Vanilla and had a 2nd rogue alt... That never made it past L31 due to spending too much time killing people in stv and not actually levelling...
---
*insert stealth sound* heh heh heh
---
Yeah totally agreed. If you're my level or close (~4 away) then red is dead - otherwise, you're just adding to the misery in the world.
---
For pvp. Mages have a lot of mobility and tools to break cc(double ice block, blink out of stubs).  Whereas warlocks are much more tanks and have more of a walking turret play style.    Warlocks are probably much stronger in duels and world pvp 1v1.   Whereas mages are probably better in bg’s and world pvp 1vX or raid vs raid
---
That's an entirely different kettle of corn, but numbers will be necessarily limited by faction, server type and time zone, so I wouldn't stress too hard about it.
---
Osteoporosis!
---
If you get bored of Chuck Norris he will think you out of existance, it's best not to make him angry
---
Eventually you will all share zones (contested zones). Pick the faction that appeals to you as each side has zones that appeal to someone.
---
It is very strange haha. He went for a weird mix of melee and instant casts and only hard cast CL for a kill or at a distance. Makes me wonder if it could still be viable. Save all your free casting time to run or do a heal instead. Maybe the cast time reduction isn’t totally necessary?
---
Either way definitely a very classic example of vanilla pvp hahaha
---
Druid bait ;p
---
One slowly eats away at an enemy's health and can take damage. The other tries to blow up the enemy while not being able to take much damage.
---
Not sure if he meant fat sight or sentry totem
---
I think druids get stuck in cat form.
---
Both can be griefing, the one doesn't preclude the other
---
I just told her I’m not going to exist for a week and I’m taking vacation days.
---
Past level 20, you generally start to be going to the same zones as the opposite faction, which are contested (both factions are fighting over them). Some of them have neutral settlements, but in general, they tend to have different quests. The storylines are very different, except when they tend to be dealing with mutual enemies. 
---
You will probably have to go to almost every zone past level 20 in Classic unless you do a lot of dungeons. As Horde, it will be very easy to start in Tirisfal Glades and move into Silverpine Forest. The quests there tend to be harder and less dense than those in the Barrens, and then move into Hillsbrad Foothills, which is often an open battleground between the Horde and the Alliance, even at low levels. From there on, you pretty much have to travel the whole world to get to 60.
---
As a Horde player, I will say that Loch Modan, Dun Morogh, Redridge and Duskwood are fantastic and often better than their Horde equivalents. The downside is that the Alliance quests tend to get less dense and interesting after the 30 mark, whereas the Horde quests tend to start slow and get better than their Alliance counterparts past 30.
---
As a Horde player, I will immediately concede that Ironforge is straight-up the coolest city and it's not even close, imo. I'm not a fan of Stormwind or Darnassus, though. 
---
Orgrimmar's biggest appeal is at night time, and a bank that you can stand on top of. All the people in town sit on the bank and talk and gaze at the stars. These are some of my fondest memories of Vanilla.
---
Or a awful streak.  I never got the devout head gear from sholo.  I did that instance 48+ times. Never saw it drop.    I ran with a ugly warlock headgear until I got  the t1 ...... 1/8 for it to drop meaning it should with good probability drop within 16 runs.
---
Alchemy doesn't offer you anything BOP that I am aware of. Herbs are one of the more expensive mats to buy outright. No profession is hard to level if you have the mats and/or unlimited gold.  I would sit down with your core play group and determine what you want to do/what is needed and go from there. If you plan to level alts with gather skills then no biggy to go engi/alch but again, for maxing, the alch doesn't offer you anything.
---
I agree absolutely. It is my opinion, that in my opinion this definitely means that the classic WoW beta is, in fact, in my opinion, confirmed.
---

They’ve said twice now to anticipate a classic wow summer. Think you can step down from that ledge my friend
---
How is a warrior camping 2 mages though.. are they not using abilities?
---
I used to love faking rogues out, getting them to pop stealth and then act like I couldn't see them. Once someone would take the bait, I would stop and slowly turn and stare at them, target and kill.
---
If this is a joke, its in poor taste. 
---
If you are at all serious I'd encourage you to reach out for some help. If you need someone to talk to and don't have anyone to reach out to please feel free to message me. This sort of thing isn't healthy.
---
Agreed. That was the most fin progression for me. Most all classes /specs were viable (I remember competing for top dps as a booking with numerous other classes), the content was still hard, and pvp was about as balanced as it ever was as well.
---
Good times.
---
holy shit take your upvote good sir
---
You should call someone dude. Or talk to me!! Your life is deeply valuable. Therapy is really great too.
---
Oh I see, thanks for explaining
---
Sounds awesome, will drop you guys a note
---
&gt;Yeah I get it. I truly do. Some parts of me don't want to play on a PvP server either, especially during reputation farming in Silithus. But for me, it's such a big part of the game, that I can't remove it. It would break the immersion for me.
---
No, I definitely respect that. I'm just glad we're getting an official Classic. I'm excited for people who want to go back and experience the game as it once was, I'm excited for people who didn't get a chance to play the game to experience it for the first time, and I'm excited for people who weren't even born yet to get an opportunity to experience the game. I hope you enjoy your time in Azeroth!
---
Huh, I didn't see a soul from 110 to 119 and when I hit 120 I couldn't leave the city without getting ganked so I turned it off then. The bounty system is really nice though.
---
I honestly wouldnt worry about suboptimal dps. There will only be a handful of guilds pushing for stuff like that. If you are good at the class you choose, you will be far better than a crappy player running an "optimal build"
---
I appreciate the use of a movie from 2004 to drive home the point.
---
Are any of the drops bind on pickup? Could be a useful checkbox or something if so. Nice work!
---
&gt; ugly warlock headgear 
---
Dreadmist doesn't deserve this vicious hate.
---
I remember Blizzard as it used to be, not the abomination it has become.
---
If this was TBC, I would give the edge to Druids, as balance has a ton of sustain through talents in TBC and mangle becomes available for ferals and bear tanks to absolutely dominate both pve and pvp.
---
In vanilla, you simply can't match the damage and utility a geared ele shaman brings, all the while being able to heal simultaneous unlike a druid or shadow priest that get stuck with just shadow or balance spells.
---
Thank you!
---
I’m down for this. I’ll be your enhance shammy your gonna give me dibs on Sulfuras tho right?
---
Thanks, was not aware of that.
---
In MC, youll be after Aurastone Hammer or Azuresong Mageblade (IMO, the sword should be defaulted to mages/locks first, then back fill with paladins) for healing. 
---
Warriors will be after OEB, Spinal Reaper, Bonereavers edge or Hand of Rag--in terms of 2h. That leaves Finkle's Lava Dredger and Earthshaker--both of those can go to Paladins/Enhance sham from the first drop. Finkle's is pretty shit, imo. But Earthshaker gives some AP, has 263 top end and comes with a stun--its like a shity Unstoppable force. 
---
In BWL there is Herald of Woe (there is also Draconic Maul 3.5 speed 27str 2crit off trash in BWL) and in AQ there is Hammer of Jizhi. 
---
In terms of shields, I dunno man, you'll be the only one needing healer shields, while the raid ultimately needs 8 tanking shields on various warriors. You get Mallistars and/or Red Dragonscale Protector, but youre gonna have a real hard time making a case for Drillborer or Elementium reinforced or the blessed quiraji. If you're up for it, you may be able to get a craft of Force Reactive Disk in. But still, I struggle to find the reason you need a tanking shield. Prot Paladins are by far the 3rd worst tank. Ret is viable in pvp and if dedicated you can even argue for one in pve. But prot is just taking gear away from real tanks--at least a feral tank doesnt make you choose between that and another prot warrior.
---
If your in full priest gear it’s not pretty.  On my lock it was fitting tho.  No hate to the lock gear only painful memories of no drops.
---
Undead main here as well.
---
I can confirm everything the comments mention, if I am minding my own business and don’t touch any one, I either:
---
A) I have noticed your presence, but will wait to catch you off guard later and kill you
---
B) I have ganked so much and I feel sated
---
C) I haven’t noticed your presence, you kill me maybe and then if I can’t find you I will unleash hell on every poor soul
---
It’s like a vicious cycle. Before ganking was a thing, I am pretty sure no one rolled a rogue so they can grief. Someone, somewhere started a chain of events that will last as long as this game exists.
---
Evil.
---
You likely wouldn't be the only enhance shaman, and you likely would be competing for it as everyone would.
---
? How does his question to relate to anything on this list?
---
Luckily for us, so far, it seems that our Classic Dev Team seems to really care and appreciate the game.
---
I don't think the same can be said about retail.
---

---
I actually find healing more laid-back and relaxing compared to being a DPS, especially if the group is at least somewhat competent. No rotations, no pressure to top meters, and it’s quite reactive and engaging compared to just dealing damage. I’ve leveled two classes to 60 on pservers, a Shaman and a Warlock, and while the lock was a way better leveling experience (except for the constant ganking from Hunters), I’ve got bored a few days after hitting 60 due to the abhorrently boring PvE compared to healing as a Shaman. Also finding groups is way easier as a healer, you’ll even get random whispers for Dungeons while leveling.
---
TBC was when I started playing WoW, but since I was young, I was a level-20 something druid just chilling out in the Barrens, fishing for Deviate Fish, talking, and selling skins in the AH. I did this for years, and it was my "chillout time" after school. When wrath came out I became a death knight and did pretty much the same thing, except I would also mine the dead scar and sell the copper in the AH.
---
In vanilla, we told our druid he could go cat as long as he was on top of dispelling curses as required. He learned real quick on Lucifron to dispel himself first, cause otherwise he was meleeing the boss in base form. :D
---
Ah man, I use to look through the screenshot of the day section so much. Admiring characters that were way cooler than mine haha
---
\&gt;thinking you can get from 30-40 in just stv 
---
LUL
---
I grinded my warrior and all of my other chars from 1-60 and mostly did quests for the prebis items and other questchains that needed to be done at 50-60. I grinded pretty much exclusive beasts and had 1100g when I dinged 60.
---
I would much prefer dungeons to questing. I'm looking for a guide that shows pre-quests for in dungeon quests. The rewards and XP per dungeon. Obviously you would need 4 other solid reliable players. Is it comparable to questing if done correctly? Do you have a 5 man dungeon leveling guide?
---
no problem, you should play what race you like the most and if you care for the atmosphere, environment and aesthetics you should take a look to the main cities. you will spend more time in ironforge, stormwind and orgrimmar compared to the time spend in starting zones.
---
Oh man, did not even remember that site. Sold my poor teenager soul for the devil👹 right there. 11am 15th of Sept 2005. It was very first days of fall, sun🌞 was shining and leaves 🍁🍂 were dropping. Would not hesitate to do it again, too bad im not that young again😂

He shoots those at everybody nearby. Any person who dies by it heals the boss for some amount. I remember we had him at like 10% outside undercity and he used that shit and healed way back up.
---
You're missing that there's actually a bunch of alliance-flagged mobs scattered around barrens for quests, like the dwarves around southern barrens, the patrol on gold road, the warlock demon guy near taurajo, northern barrens, of course near WSG of course, etc etc.
---
You're gonna spend more than a reasonable amount of time in the barrens flagged as a hordie.
---
This guild is 96% Norwegian with some odd swedes in between, and the guild council would prefer to keep it that way. It's always hard to say no to someone, but in this case we have to. Sorry &lt;3

If you are decided on getting engineering, you;ve outted yourself as someone who intends to play "hardcore" if playing classic hardcore is your thing, then you're really just half assing it if you arent fully prepared with consumables in your bags at all times. 
---
If thats the case, then mining/herb to level, then swapping out mining for eng is that way to go. Eng isnt too expensive to maintain at 300 via the AH. Buying potions, oils, food, enchants, tubers (and other out in the world buffs), elixirs, flasks is fucking expensive. Getting your cooking/fishing/herbalism up to 300 will save you thousands of gold over the course of the content.
---
The classic animations are still far better than the new ones from retail. Mind boggling. In 15 years they have only manages to decrease the quality.
---
You could cut ties with all the lies that you’ve been living in.
---
That’s brutal, I love it
---
How did you solve the problem where your legs start sleeping?
---
Legitimately curious.
---
Sure, but let me give you a comparison. Alliance are in a contested zone at all times and can't choose when to do their quest that'll flag them... because they are already in a contested zone.
---
Yeah you can say "but horde are flagged like half the time" yeah that is still 50% of the time when alliance are flagged. Also getting killed at RR fp is astronomically more annoying than flying into any of the barrens fps as a horde... since you can't be killed instantly
---
Idk man.. I imagine your guild having an extremely difficult time progressing BWL. If more than half of your DPS are hybrids, some of your healers are hybrids and you don’t have an excellent warrior MT I would see Razorgore being a wall. For your idea to work you really need to be an absolute god tier guild leader and raid leader. My suggestion is to advertise that off-meta DPS are welcome to try out rather than advertising as a dedicated hybrid guild.
---
Yea I'm just gona go ahead and give this whole thing a big nope.
---
Now where exactly did the commenter say anything about perfection? Hmmm? I’ll wait because this is the comment you replied to with your accusation about perfection.   I see you insist on keep digging yourself in a hole.  Could I offer you a shovel?

Warlocks tank hits and spam fear. Mage does stupid AoE plays then waits 5 min for iceblock so they can be cool again.

Hey man, I removed this thread but just so you know, this isn't healthy. Suicide isn't a solution. Search for your local helpline and get some help. People around you love you.

We were not prepared...
---
Oh man, I remember hitting lvl40 and going to redridge with my friends.
---
Best part was we were all undead (and a Tauren druid), where the underwater breathing mattered.
---
When a solo lvl60 came to kill us, we jumped in the lake, and our mage polymorphed him, over and over, until the drowning damage was enough to kill him (with a little help from us). I don't know if it's fixed, but polymorph in water used to send the toon to the bottom of the lake.
---
Good times
---
My opinion based on gear and leveling:  
---
Druid builds STR and sta for primary tanking and cat dps. STR provides 2 ap in both cat and bear.
---
Warrior builds STR and maybe agi for dps. Not a lot of need for sta if not getting hit.
---
Mage... profit.
---
Pally builds ret for dps. Not primary healer as it needs additional sets.
---
Priest can only build caster sets, putting it in a good place to heal from the start without having to carry additional sets.
---
No just google
---
This dude ruined literal days of my life in Legion. The rage I feel in my heart at this very moment is unreal lmao. I wish I could have fought him back then!
---
Same, looking back you can see that alot of the additions that lead to what wow is now started in WOTLK but back then they didn't seem bad at all. Definitely Peak Wow for me.
---
You outlevel the zones and use the same ones on max lvl, but the faction stays the same.
---
As somebody that's very strongly considering playing a hybrid druid with a focus on PvP, I'd be quite interested in this.  Done a lot of raiding as a perfectly min/maxed rogue and warrior over the years, and while fun, I think I want to approach the game a bit differently when classic comes around.  Never got super into PvP in the past, but really looking forward to it for Classic.  I realize that I'll still need to raid (and I'll want to anyway) so if I can find a guild that's cool with me raiding with the HotW spec as a druid with the ability to both off tank and heal, that would be ideal.
---
People can mod the game how they want. If it's against the TOS, that's another issue
---
Elemental before ZG is available? *Laughs in retadin*
---
You mean it doesn't sound fun to drag your ass to Gnomeregan for a consumable 6x 30sec charges per hour between reset lockouts?
---
I remember hearing about a couple bears out there that tanked Thaddius on live but some of the shit people get up to on private servers is just a function of boredom...
---
Well frick,
---
Orc racial is the reason most pvpers role horde. On insta 60 pvp servers, the meta is 100% orcs almost any class that can play orc because the orc racial is ridiculously powerful, and passive. For pvp the clear choice is orc and for pve the choice is troll for berserking
---
Shaman, and Priest.

I remember that night, I was in CA, so as I was leaving to go stand in line, guiltiest were logging back in from east coast having installed and were waiting (as gates opened 12am pst nationwide). I hid my toon behind the portal (genius I thought).
---
It's not as bad in vanilla as there's no orcs that stand tall and proud, not even the (best) Warchief. I imagine it's going to be jarring if you main a upright orc in Retail though.
---
Nobody plays paladin. Druid does not benefit from windfury totem. Get ready to grind manual crowd pummelers every day of the week, as the threat increase from them is the only reason to take a druid tank.
---
I always gank mages, warriors and rogues because they are usually min-maxers. Best is of course to mind control someone off a cliff so they have to run all the way back or off the boat.
---
I don't remember ST being all that confusing to navigate.  Definitely more to it than your standard dungeons beyond vanilla, but not on BRD's level for example.
---
From what I've seen and read it's about 20% difference in perfect circumstances, so if you only care about PVE dps it's the obvious choice, however dps warriors can very easily go overboard on threat if they aren't careful so you very well may need to slow your own dps if you don't have a great tank.
---
It also really does pigeonhole you into using swords or to a lesser extent maces, now sure there are some very good swords in the game and the end BiS are both swords but those are going to be very competitive seeing as all the other warriors and rogues are also trying to get them, axes are slightly less popular but (assuming no weapon skill) can actually beat out swords, think deathbringer or crulshorukh.
---
If you are ever interested in PVP however humans are pretty mediocre, a lot of top players at least on private servers actually play gnomes or dwarf as alliance because they know they don't need the damage increase in raids but being able to escape slows and poisons is huge forever.
---
You're going to have hemorrhoids the size of golf balls.
---
What time zone?
---
&lt;Deus Vult&gt; is a Horde PvE guild with 2 raiding nights, Friday and Saturday 11pm to 3 am EST (8pm to 12 am PST)
---
We are currently happy to recruit rogues!!
---
Our leadership has killed done the first half of Naxx in vanilla, Kil’jaeden in BC, cleared all WOTLK content, and was a heavy mythic guild in legion.  We’re serious players, but we are mostly in our 30s.  There’s about 20-25 of us so far!
---
If you wanna play nights and weekends, send me a DM!
---
Hi everyone! Extremely hyped for classic, but I haven't really decided on a class to play. In TBC and vanilla I played Rogue, Mage, and Warrior to fairly high levels so I'm not interested in those again.
---
However, now I am just at a loss of which class to play. If I want to level fast so I can farm quickly and build out twinks (my favorite past time), I'm thinking hunter or warlock. 
---
For off meta classes that I've always found interesting in pvp, Shaman, Druid, and Pally also seem fun. Especially elemental, balance, and ret builds for them (respeccing to heal for raids, but keeping off meta for pvp). 
---
At the end of the day, I'd like to be able to casually raid and slightly competitively run PvP, while also being able to AoE farm (that's always been one of my favorite parts of the game). I'm okay with being a healer but wouldn't like that to be the only thing I do in endgame. 
---
With all of that being said, I feel like I lean towards Warlock, Paladin, Shaman, or Druid, but open to any input!
---
Hey, tried messaging you on discord but says you're blocking non-friends messages. I'm in NA and have a friend who'd like to join up. Would be a hunter and rogue for raiding. lmk
---
I played Tauren as a resto shaman on K3. Warstomp was neat, came in handy here and there. But this past week I’ve been dueling my rogue buddy over and over on a private server with pre-set tier 2 level gear. Orc racial is f ucking nuts. Resisting cheaps, kidney shots, tidal charm stuns. Shit is a game changer. You’re gonna make alliance pallys tear their hair out when you resist HoJ and you won’t ever have to worry about facing an orc unless you duel. It’s amazing
---
Good to know. I knew you'd beaten his time, but it's a shame to learn that he cheated in this way...
---
I'm Goetia on barrens chat, btw.

you and [147 other people](https://i.imgur.com/8W49GCo.jpg). and that's not even counting the people with accents on various letters

stun resist is pretty good, but so is warstomp, so it somewhat comes down to preference. personally i'd say warstomp has the edge coz the setup allows for a very nice burst.
---
but then again i wouldn't roll a tauren because i want to have a nice mount before phase 3.
---
I haven't literally laughed out loud to a meme in ages but everything about this made it so I couldn't help it.
---
Even so, it’s not a sure bet for would-be gankers to find flagged lowbies in the Barrens, and even if they do if their target logs off the ganker is gonna have to go hunting again.
---
Compare this to any above-15 Alliance questing zone where an ample supply of lowbies are flagged whether they like it or not. Gankers are looking to get as many easy kills as possible and Alliance low level zones deliver on that much better than the Barrens ever has.
---
The fucking Black Ash Robe though... Drops everytime too -.-
---
Appreciate the response. I was leaning orc, strictly for the passive, but really havent had a ton of pvp experience on vanilla servers.
---
Pretty sure only dwarves and gnomes can ride the robo chickens, I’m a horde player though, so can’t say for sure.
---
Does it deserve to be nerfed? Yes
---
Should it be nerfed? #nochanges buddy
---
I'd say this, tbh. Pally tanking and druid dps instead.
---
I agree, that's why we don't see feral tanks very often.
---
It's really boring as fuck to play and doesn't reward you with anything but being a little tiny snowflake. I'm not sitting here saying that feral druid is the best tank and everyone should play it.
---
Please elaborate? It looks like an item with a 3 minute cooldown, shouldn't that mean I just need 6 of them and then I never need morem
---
Quite easy to get into a dungeon group, even easier to get a raid invite, and if your group is somewhat competent, you can get away with way more slacking than the other roles.
---
Btw I’ve mained a Goblin DK in retail, no idea what that would tell you about my personality.

Do you like blue fireballs or purple?

Most of the retail pics look significantly brighter than the vanilla shots IMO...

Ok! Have no idea how to disable that, but if you send me a friend request we can talk!

Losers. Losers are cutting off their leveling to gank.

One of my struggles in mage vs rogue class choice is having to flask as a mage.   It's expensive.   
---
How many hours a week is spent farming for flasks on a mage ?
---
Angryman
---
I was a committed ret paladin all the way into early MC.  I have no regrets, but I don't feel like doing it again.  Probably due to peer pressue to go healadin, and that I found I like playing mage better.  I also went full enhancement shaman in BC, but that didn't seem to be as taboo as being a DPS pally.
---
AQ20 Quest/Rep gear also has a Feral Attack power 1 handed mace. 
---
iirc there are only a few feral attack power items in the game.
---
* Aq20 quest/rep
---
* One of the World Dragons
---
* AQ40 Quest Mace
---
* Naxx mace
---
* Legendary staff
---
I would always charge cows and rabbits and other critters, but make sure to click away before I closed the gap so they would be left unharmed, albeit probably scared to death.  I only did this because I would feel bad killing the critters, but now that I think about it, I hope it helped the Warriors behind me, too!
---
I grinded prolly about 95% 1-60 on my draenei shaman at BC release.  4d 10h 23min to lvl 60. It was twinked and I had pretty much all spawns for myself as everyone else was in Draenor.
---
I haven't played since 2007, was chocked when I found out that questing is faster than grinding.
---
A fresh 60 mage can kill a fresh shaman in 1 CS + shatter combo.
---
Oh that's nice, I have one with important quest items that should *not* be vendored.
---
I used to ignore opposing faction because I'd just want to quest and hope they'd just do the same. More often than not, they'll just jump on you right away, or wait til a better time to jump on you, pretending they won't before hand.
---
This lead me to just ganking any player I saw on sight because the jump was a good enough advantage that I could win most fights if I spotted them first. This also kept them away long enough for me to quest in peace.
---
This made me realize I should play on a PvE server lol.
---
One feral one balance per 40 raid
---
I personally don't use this addon but I basically do all of this *anyway* when I'm levelling, I haven't really read quests since 2007, at most I'll skim read for information if I'm lost, and I think that's pretty common between wow players.
---
You could say it "ruins the game" but using this addon is a choice that would only effect you, and not even in a big way, if you don't like it just don't use it?
---
Looks like you’ve got you answer. I’m planning on playing a shammy and I want to focus on pve. I can’t stomach looking at troll feet all game long, despite their racial edge. Probably will play an orc
---
The Classic PVP discord sometimes says Orc &gt; Tauren &gt; Troll, and then they sometimes say Orc/Tauren &gt; Troll.  
---
Orc racial is super attractive because it's a hugely powerful ability that doesn't require any action on your part. It either RNGs or it doesn't RNG.  
---
Tauren racial requires more timed use, and I personally believe most of it's functions are already present in other shaman abilities. Need to stop movement? Frost shock. Need to stop spell casting? Earth shock.  
---
Need to stop stun chains? Well only hardiness has you covered on a shaman.
---
I agree. This only complicates things for gearing up pre-bis.
---
I feel like if they do progressive itemization it should be selective. Like PvP gear for sure, but beyond that idk.
---
But if I had to take all or nothing I would choose no item changes.
---
Bears always felt like they had low armor but high HP to me...
---
*laughs quickly turn in cries in retadin* :)
---
You’re right, but people trying to “replicate” barrens chat is way worse than what barrens chat ever was. I definitely recommend turning it off, because it’s straight up annoying/cringe at best. 
---
People definitely won’t be able to get away with what goes on in private server chat, though.
---
I plan on going feral but there is no way in hell I’m farming those.
---
only someone that doesn't yet realize the Horde is the only faction worth playing would consider adding straight-back orcs to classic
---
I dont see the shadow deflector. It drops in scholomance if im not mistaken
---
I want these servers to be a museum, our closest recreation of what Vanilla wow was. 
---
But in 3 years when blizzard has to release Bc classic or restart Vanilla classic, I hope we get a Vanilla 2.0, I dunno how they do it. As even things we all agree suck (16 debuff slots) have profound impact on gameplay (even if boss he is increased), as new specs become fun and viable and specs that seemed great in the old paradigm (frost mages) seem boring and unimaginative (a problem for mages that didn’t really get fixed until Cata/mop).
---
But up there on my list of things to change, with no downside, is the textures, and visual effects in general. Modern wow’s animations, from characters to spell effects kicks ass. The only reason I don’t like the new models, is my relationship with the old ones. Modern WoW has dank lighting effects and other little elements that make it beautiful (until you start playing, then it sucks). 
---
Make it totally toggleable like the models are on WoW now, I dgaf. But looking at how far WoW has come visually, and what blizzard did with sc remaster, d1 remaster, wc2 remaster, and what looks to be good work in wc3 remaster (we can only hope d2 remaster is being worked on) gives me great hope in their ability to touch up visuals for modern times while not losing any of the “-ness” that made it so iconic in the first place.

People are still debating whether tauren or orc is better for pvp really. I think in general it's a bit more orc sided but it's close. Pick what you rather want, a sick chance to resist stuns, or a free stun to cast CL. Both are completely fine options.
---
Yes, BWL. Shaman and a druid.
---
Yeah, but even if only half of them are flagged, you have basically every horde running through barrens, so you're still getting twice as many flagged targets as any alliance contested zone.
---
Honestly just watch some mage and warlock pvp videos, they will give you a WAY better clue about the differences than any forum post could describe.

&lt;Deus Vult&gt; (Horde, PvE server) is an 18+ (mostly around 30) guild with a focus on PvE raiding.
---
Raid times are Friday and Saturday 11 pm to 3 am EST, (8pm to 12 am PST).  We’re going to take raiding seriously, but we won’t crucify you for missing a raid every now and then because we’re all adults.
---
We current have over 20 Raiders and an experienced Officer core with multiple expansions worth of content under our belts.
---
We are recruiting all Classes currently, with a particularly strong need for Rogues.
---
We will be using a Guided Loot Ladder system.
---
Send me a DM for details and we’ll get you a Discord link and see if you’re a good fit!
---
True, it is pretty bad, but I think people on here are being big babies about it, it takes 5 seconds to turn it off. Plus I highly doubt people will be as bad as they are on pservers, since you don't pay for pservers, pservers are temporary and retail does at least temp mute people who are reported enough. Personally I am going to flood Barrens chat with shitty old trolls like "Why do they call it the xbox 360? Because when you see it you turn 360 degrees and walk away".
---
Well, if you're following Joana's guide, you'll end up in Stonetalon at 15, and Ashenvale at 20, and you're completely done with the southern portion of the Barrens by 23, and its all contested territory after that.
---
Sure, you could hang out in the Barrens until ~25, but you'll be inefficiently grinding mobs to level once you run out of soloable quests in the northern half until you're high enough to do the southern half.
---
Modern barrens chat on private servers is /pol/lite lol, the ignore list isnt big enough to block all the identity politics-obsessed morons
---
Its exhausting for you because you are reading to much into a game. You want to fight anywhere anytime under any circumstances pvp server. You want to fight when you are ready only and in a "fair fight" pve. 
---
There is no grey area other then mental gymnastics people have made in their head and developers have tried to appease to maintain player base.
---
Pretty cut and dry.
---
No addons I know about, but managing a 5 man group isnt really that difficult, just buff everyone at the same time as yourself and use your own buff as a timer.

Hi, i'm having trouble finding your name on discord. Let me know if i'm typing something in wrong.
---
If they didn't want to gank you they wouldn't have rolled rogue
---
Its a fact
---
Orc for PvP is awesome. I pvp’d as a resto shammy and the orc racial saved me so many times. Was Totally op in vanilla. 😂👍
---
It has charges. I think 3? So you need to keep grinding more to continue using the active.
---
thats what i wrote
---
No... no you aren't... 100% of alliance are flagged, 50% of horde are flagged. (Which 50% is ridiculously generous of a number, it's probably closer to 20% tops) if any horde sees an alliance by the quest mobs they switch quest. An alliance sees a horde they can't quest... you see the problem?
---
I miss that game so much. Incredible community too.
---
Honestly, I quite like this idea. A ton of people (myself included) could potentially shy away from going hybrid because they know they are not wanted in the hardcore guilds. I really appreciate the more chill way of approaching it and focusing on everyone being able to do what they want to do. 
---
I‘m not quite sure if I want to go full shadow priest or healer but either way I would be in, just because it sounds a lot better community wise.
---

For tank, warrior is the hardest, and warrior is the easiest.
---
The ghost run back to the entrance is the most difficult
---
So I should be using my lowest rank Shadow Spells, Fishing for Blackouts and mana burning their Healers/DPS mana users? but still using the normal sets of other spells i.e. heals??
---
You're allowed to multibox on retail!
---
At 1st I didnt see the toilet. Now everyone in the restaurant where I'm at thinks I'm insane. Thanks, lol
---
My guild has 2 feral druids and we killed Cthune first week of release so..
---
In PvP it's probably the hybrids; druid and shaman. Paladins are a bit easier though. Warlocks and hunters also have a very high skill ceiling. 
---
In PvE the hardest class/spec is definitely the warrior tank. So many abilities while having to balance being defensive and doing enough threat to carry the raid. You also have to worry about positioning and 90% of vanilla mechanics only affect the tanks. Raid leading usually also go to the tank so that's another thing. 
---
Other hard one are warlocks because of their delicate threat balancing. I've seen vast differences in dps on similarly geared warlocks, not so much on the mages, rogues and warriors.    
---
Druids I also found very hard to heal on. It gets easier once gear becomes better but it's still definitely not easy.
---
Now i want to get this for retail, but i agree, this does not need to be in classic. But then again, there's people who have mixed feelings about these things.
---
People give too much credit to WOTLK, imo.
---
I always liked the dragonkin in burning steps. Get in the caves and farm away. Skinning and getting black dragon scales, which are needed for Fire res gear for Rags and BWL. 😀👍
---
Oh look. You have your own personal Ret Paladin.
---
I roll Horde because I like the races better, but I do think Alliance cities are far cooler. Depends on what aesthetic you want to use to make your eventual choice.
---
I did zero quest on my warlock (pserver) after lvl12, only 100% grind. It took me 8days /played to reach 60. Send pet, DoT and wand. 
---
12 - 25 Barrens (random beast, then kodos, then dwarves)
---
25 - 32 Hillsbrad (bears/spiders, then turtles)
---
32 - 40 Alterac (yetis, then ogres)
---
40 - 45 Hinterlands (trolls)
---
45 - 50 Feralas/Tanaris [imo the most painful moment by FAR] (nagas, ogres / ogres)
---
50 - 56 Felwood/Azshara (Furbolds, satyrs / ghosts, nagas, murlocs)
---
56 - 60 Winterspring (yetis, moonkins)
---
The hardest part was to find the convenient grinding spots. Grinding is painful, but you must completely commit to this task if you want it to be efficient. Spending nearly 30 hours in the very same spot is mind-numbing... But it works.
---

Hi, i looked you up on discord and your name isn't popping up. Maybe I messed something up when i was typing. Anyway, i'm interested in your guild.
---
Yeah, old Barrens chat was more light-hearted and naive, folks were after a laugh or a "wtf? lol" - seems like the newer internet trolls are much more driven by vitriol and contempt rather than wanting to type something absurd and funny to endear yourself to your fellow servermates - pservers I met so many selfish pricks who treat everyone like garbage that it was tough to keep playing only for that reason. I mean we're playing a game together... let's have some fun, what's with the derisive attitudes?
---
They have 3 charges of their active ability, after that it's a shitty stat stick, that's why you have to farm them. Unfortunately it drops from gnomerragan which is tedious to get to for horde druids. However, you can easily farm enough for a night's raid in 15min. They are great for increasing your tps and cat DPS. Nonetheless, well geared ferals have great tps and cat DPS when not tanking, more so than an equally geared fury offtank.
---
Let's assume Classic comes out in 3 months.
---
If you were to pop into a space ship long enough to pop a hot pocket in the microwave, heat it at the recommended 2 minutes (single hot pocket) let it cool down for a minute, then eat said hot pocket while watching last night's 68 minute episode of Game of Thrones.
---
You'd need to travel at 299,792,414m/s or at .9999746C / 99.99746% the speed of light for those 71 minutes.
---
I actually cant stand this model, I was super hyped for it, but it ended up just feeling like a stretched out dwarf to me, something about them just felt off.  I think the vanilla orc models are the best.
---
it's not about learning the ins and outs of those particular OS, it's just to teach them about differences.  Also win7 they will actually encounter in their future jobs,   but nobody except hobbyists uses older versions.
---
While leveling, the druid should tank. It is much easier to heal a tanking druid as a healer in my opinion(as a healer). Let the paladin dps/off tank. They do okay dps while leveling. The priest should heal.
---
Thus spawning vengeful rogues, and the cycle continues
---
No you don't, It's molten core. Sharpening stones, while nice, are not worth switching that frequently. Also, I literally cant think of a mob it doesn't work on.
---
Depends how they will handle it. Private servers that don't leak anything just remove every cultist or Cenarion NPC. The greens can also drop from cultists themselves so even without summons they could leak. If all tiers of summons would leak then  BiS lists could be severely impacted as those tier 2 summon blues can be quite strong, AFAIK competing even with devilsaurs in some cases.
---
Nothing I like more than making the 15 year old content, widely regarded as the easiest raid content in the game ever outside of naxx 40 (being hard) and naxx 80 being easily the easiest real raid ever (read as: prior to lfr) even easier. 
---
When Grizzly or some other Vanilla min maxing guild clears Vanilla content its “yawn, people did that 15 years ago”. Where is the fun in raiding if your aim isn’t literally to get it over with ASAP. 
---
Now if a guild roles with 5 of each class, (maybe 8 warriors, and 4 hunter, Druid, lock) and roles with that raid from mc to kel thuzad, doesn’t class stack but for the extra warriors on 4h, and manages to get it all done with the raid NOT needing every consumable and world buff for each and every attempt of each and every boss—that’s something, at least. 
---
I too can break Vanilla raiding with a group of nothing but warriors, 1 priest, 1 Druid, paladins and mages. But how is that fun? 
---
I’ll min max my character all day, even 1 more avg dps is important to me. But this compulsion to min max raid comps for easy content is beyond me. Who cares if spriest, enhance sham and hunters do less dps than locks, mages, rogues or warriors? The content was designed around having 1/4 - 1/3 of your raid dead or auto running into a wall. If all 40 are there playing shit specs to their most, you’ll be fine.
---
Oh okay, that makes sense
---
Thanks for the response dude. Threat is a great point, I'd love to go UD for warrior due to the female animations but 20% is huge.
---
Honestly, if youre gonna hit that old school grind to the point where your legs go numb, then have a timer for every 30 minutes and do 10 air squats whenever it goes off.
---
Well he doesn’t have to be stuck in 5 mans as the MT. He just needs his preraid bis. 
---
Show up raid with the gear and consumables and you are Gucci.
---
Also, if grinding DM E then mining is highly advised.
---
Hey, thanks a lot for your response and interest! Thats strange, here is a direct invite to the discord. Feel free to look around and check out all of our organized class, profession, and other guides that we're adding to every day.
---
https://discord.gg/3mnm8P
---
Well thats just poor deaign right there....
---
Perklunt was on my server and we used to crowd him for duels all the time. Wasn't there a dick that flashes up for a single frame in one of his videos?
---
Yeah but that frontflip increases your street cred 100% and honestly if you want to go horde it's even less of an issue because they are REALLY capped on threat and you'll at least have a better chance of getting some nice swords as all the orcs would be going for axes.
---
Actually, with a pserver, it makes a LOT of sense to create 2 accounts if you have alts. The first account would have a maximum of 9 Alliance and 1 Horde, the second account would have 9 Horde and 1 Alliance. The two singleton characters would be the ones that learn enchanting. After all, one of my pet peeves with Enchanting prior to WotLK is that your enchanter could apply enchants to any character in the same faction, except your alts on the same account.
---
Watch them literally cry as they get jumped the second they enter contested
---
I plan on going full poopsock
---
I know, but it was just an example that they care more about forbidden things.
---
1. Unbreakable
---
2. Swifty's incredible warrior tricks
---
3. World of roguecraft
---
4. Rifle lovin' videos by rifluvr
---
5. Can't remember the name, but it was with a troll rogue and the video featured music from German rapper Sido
---
It was goofy and immature on retail, but orders of magnitude worse on pirate servers.
---
I find it interesting that this is a classic wow sub and we're all really excited for Classic this summer but then a lot are reminiscing about how BC and WotLK were the best. Speaking on all the various 10 man and 25 man options. It really makes me wonder if most of us want actual Classic or just BC &amp; WotLK?
---
I'm ready for those hard to fill 40 mans, even if that means mostly tank &amp; spank raid content. MC to BWL was quite a step up in mechanics and I did really love that. However maybe I'm just more nostolgic for Classic since I only played a couple month of BC into WotLK and only played about 3 months of that. I really poured my soul/no lifed Vanilla WoW like nothing else.
---
&gt; You may level a bit slower overall but it may speed up in a sense that you can kill 3-4 mobs at a time or more..
---
You also gain full quest xp, so if a quest is "kill x" then it's a lot better doing that in a group.
---
You miss more so you proc overpower and deep wounds more WeSmart
---
Green itrm with 48+ fire damage damn.
---
&gt; Its PvPing.
---
To me, PvP is about the added challenge of facing other people. Attacking someone who's at half health and 25% mana is hardly a challenge.
---

---
Can you share any details about how you would like to see it implemented as an addon?
---
Are you simply porting in the checklist style guide you have on your website, or are you looking to add new features?
---
A arms/fury warrior in leveling dungeons does not need the extra survivability or tools provided by port spec in order to tank. 
---
Taunt, blood rage, demo/battleshout, Sunder and revenge will be all you really need with the odd interrupt or shield block (to proc another revenge).
---
You’ll want to tab target packs spreading auto attacks, revenges and sunders to keep threat...because this is wow 15 years after launch...no one respects how much harder it is to hold agro on two targets, each being smashed on than it is to hold onto one mob being smashed on by two people. (But I get it, no mage wants to start casting a 2.5s cast on a mob that may only be alive for 2.3 more seconds. No rogue wants his finisher cut off because the mages frostbolt hit, knocking the mob from 10% to dead.)
---
Rogues are vengeful from the moment they picked their class.
---
Auto loot, colorblind mode, loot trading, improved graphics settings, improved menus.
---
Soon you can say: Kruul IS a bad boy
---
Lol, so what? People are running around 2 hours for hunters right now, 1-10, wait for it, WITHOUT A PET https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=904

---
Awww, isn't he cute?
---
_\*stab\*_  
---
Your skill in Daggers has increased to 115.
---
Nice..
---
Why should a mage use a flask and a rogue not?
---
You may be right, I did some for awhile recently in feralas that were bears and wolves together NE of camp Moj (good spot btw!) and the wolves seemed to die much quicker.  Maybe wolves are just lower hp I don't know- I don't have addons or anything that detail mob hps.
---
I came here to do 2 things:  
---
Farm Fire elementals, and dot rogues.
---
And I just ran out of fire elementals...
---
If you really liked just casually fishing, I would give the edge to a shaman.
---
At level 20, you have total free reign over The Barrens to fish for deviate and ghost wolf to farm copper / tin all day.
---
because SoupaSoka is the biggest douche on the planet lol.  We all wish he'd go back to his Call Of Duty crap and leave WoW alone
---
Honestly it's easier to compete for that tank spot on the Alliance side. No WF totem so your warriors TPS isn't as competetive.
---
90% is about the wand. 10% about stacking spirit. Make sure you grab the BFD wand. It’s a level 27 wand and Horde can obtain it at level 18.
---
Priest 100%
---
You're not thinking about the math, buddy, but nice downvote.
---
In an stardard alliance 20-25 zone, like say redridge, you have basically just one race- humans- wandering about, for the most part. Let's call that 100 players.
---
so 1 race, everyone flagged, that's 100 targets.
---
Now we have the barrens. Where you have 4 races, very nearly 5 (a decent number of undead go through barrens in vanilla, simply because that's where everyone else is/friends/etc.)
---
We'll call it 4, maybe 5 races. that's 400-500 people. even if we take your absurdly low of 20% being flagged, that's still the same number as in redridge.... except not only is it going to be higher than redridge, you're forgetting that the barrens is huge, it has by far the largest zone level range. You're running around the barrens pretty much constantly from level 10-25, and then still returning constantly for quests/dungeons until 31 or so. No other zone has as many people. So not only do you have 4x-5x the people in there, they stay in the barrens nearly twice as long.
---
So instead of 400-500, you're actually looking more at something like 800-1000. Even using the very low 20%, that's still twice as many targets as RR. THEN you add on that barrens, especially rachet and XR, are horde transportation hubs, and that you used to have to travel via flightmaster one hop at a time, and everyone going through was flagged?
---
There's a reason Crossroads was always Under Attack. Redridge can't even compare.
---
I wouldn’t tank dm n as a fresh arms level 60. But you’re probably okay in Lbrs, school, strat. 
---
Dm n has low mob count, which means the mobs it does have hit hard and have big health pools. Without more hp, you may get nearly 1 shot.
---
Just a tip for people who haven't played on a fresh server. In the beginning no one will have any gold to spend on the AH, so don't expect to sell low level herbs and ore for a good profit.
---
3 charges on a 30sec cool down with a 30sec duration.
---
No it won't, because I'll be on Max settings graphics option like a real gamer.  Gamers play for graphics...everyone knows this
---
Paladin. Leveling will take twice as long as everyone else. You can't kill things. You must heal. No other options. A single spell lockout applies EVERY spell you have.
---
"semi-famous" :D
---
They will probably attack you once anyway. But if you give them reason to they will camp you.
---
Fishing and cooking are amazing money makers. Hardcore folks who want to flask up for mc will need a constant stream of fish or fully cooked meals. 
---
When you yourself get to aq/naxx you’ll need those consumables, having the skills maxed will save you a lot of money during that progression.
---
yupp, still there too xD
---
yeah, I drop a corruption on every critter I run past
---
The thing is you wont know, likely for quite a while especially if you start playing at launch. The numbers will also be skewwed for a while until the population numbers stabilize with people who dip out early.
---
Those AddOns are always terrible. They just select an apropriate rank to use on a target that has taken damage. They do not account for anything that is happening around you so the AddOn may end up selecting a 500 heal when a human would have know there is a large incoming raid wide damage in two seconds.
---
On top of that, multiple people using the AddOns will mean you have the same piece of code making the decisions. So two players may end up just healing the same target while another dps is dying right beside you.
---
&gt; Your guild at least not on pservers, can't check if you actually have the addon or not 
---
/dbm ver
---
is a thing that exists and will print a raid-wide version check. If a version is listed, they have the addon.
---
Playing WoW with broken arms can prove difficult.

**Real Men of Genius**
---
**Horde** // **NA-PvP** // **Loot Council**
---
**Raid times**: 9p-1a CST Wednesday/Thursday
---
**About**: RMoG's core is made up of friends, some of which have been playing WoW together for 14 years and others which have been met while raiding on private servers since Nostalrius. Many of us are tired of finding ourselves in guilds with corrupt or incompetent leadership. This time around, we're building something ourselves that will last throughout Classic and let us accomplish our goals. We have the experience to lead this guild through Naxx and the drive to create a strong, cohesive community along the way.
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
**Recruitment**: At this stage before the launch of Classic, we're recruiting for **all roles**. Having experience with the content is a bonus, but isn't critical - the important part is that you're an active player dedicated to performing well, willing to listen to criticism when necessary.
---
**Apply**: You can apply to the guild via this link, which is also available on our Discord server: [https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA](https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA)

**Contact**: Here's how to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before applying:

&gt;Hunters pretty much auto shot and make sure they are not in motion when their auto shot wants to fire.
---
Not even remotely accurate. You have to constantly weave aimshot and multi-shot so you don't clip your auto-shot. You also have to micro-manage your pet to allow it to DPS and still stay alive.
---
I'm currently afk Skilling while browsing this sub.
---
Im wondering if doing groups of 3 furies/rogues + 1 feral + 1 enhance totem twisting would work out, or if they would end up just being threat capped. Perhaps the shaman could totem twist windfury + tranquil instead?
---
Theres also the thought of doing a boomkin in each caster group, a few nightfalls on the enhances, and of course the spriest buffing the warlocks, leading to a ton of magic damage possibly?
---
My main concern was to help save gold with providing consumables/make gold selling them, and if it's not a huge deal I might just skip over it
---
Hunter ... period.
---
What recording program do people use these days anyway?
---
But thats to you tho. No offense but PvP defintion is just Player versus Player combat. Not specific rules or gentlemens-agreements within it. 
---
So even if thats not PvP to you, its still PvP in actuality.
---

---
Right, my bad.
---
You're going to feel a little down during level 1-10 because of mana issues, but stick with it and once you get Bear Form at 10 it becomes a great leveling experience instantly. Then when you get Cat Form at level 20 you're going to feel unstoppable.
---
So you mean a normal vanilla raiding guild that without any issues should clear all content in due time?
---
&gt;Enhance and feral have funky rotations that require totem twisting or  hopping in/out of form.
---
What? :D Apart from totemtwisting (Oooh, I can press two different totems within 8 seconds) you are literally only using Frost shock. Cant even use Stormstrike because of debuff constraints so the class is literally autoattacking while hitting 3 buttons in the same order every 10 seconds over and over.

**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply**.** Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**What we offer**: Membership on an experienced, skilled and dedicated team ran by incredibly dedicated and passionate leadership with the time and flexibility to build and run an organized, efficient team.  Our roster is already very healthy  but we welcome every recruit with the potential to excel in a team environment and those dedicated to enriching themselves and those around them.
---
**Current Activity**:  Currently a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We also have guild jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on **discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916**

If everyone is a lvl 40 undead rogue there will be zero alliance
---
If I intend to level engineering twice to get both goblin and gnome recipes- does it matter which I do first besides the teleporter location?
---
Which classes can solo Devilsaur?
---
If he were "legitimately minding his own business" then he wouldn't be called a "rogue", WOULD HE
---
thx :)
---
No problems, was worth a shot. Good luck!
---
Bashiok once snapped at me for saying they looked like they were ripped from an N64 game.
---
I have no idea how much pvp will occur on pve servers once Classic launches. This isn't the same era as when the game first launched. Lots of open world pvp happened on pve servers back then.
---
I suspect some pve servers will settle into the raiding meta and very little pvp will occur. Others may have some guilds more open to flagging.
---
I hope the the later.
---
I am usually not against repost but this is most likely the most posted picture on this subreddit :(
---
yep, you are definetely right. But that is only 80% of success. others 20% come from gear optimization :D
---
&gt; **&lt;xyz&gt;** NA-PST-PVP
---
We're a core group of 12 players who all played and raided in vanilla WoW, Scriptcraft, and Nostalrius. Our team is creating a competent, quality over quantity raid team to progress through everything classic WoW has to offer. That being said, our ultimate focus and reason for clearing PvE content is to dominate in PvP. 
---
**Loot System**
---
Loot council, to ensure the entire raid gets gear fairly and efficiently for the health of the raid.
---
**Raid Times**
---
2-3 weekday nights, 7:00-10:00 PM PST. We will adjust the days and length of raid depending on what content is available and what we need to clear. We require our raiding members to be available during scheduled raid times, and there is no tolerance for poor attendance.
---
**Expectations + Philosophy**
---
We don't expect everyone to go 110% no-life to min-max every aspect of their PvE performance, but we do expect **competence**, **efficiency**, and a **willingness to excel** from all of our members. Our experienced players are willing to help guild mates run dungeons, get attuned, and understand their class, gearing choices, rotations, and the raid encounters. We'll gladly take a proactive player who is learning a new class over a veteran who isn't willing to put forth the effort. Additionally, we are a PvP focused guild, but we will take members who are only looking to raid if they can meet our expectations. 
---
If you are interested, give me a message on Discord: **Etc#7848**
---
I would say if you are rolling a pve realm you are trying to separate your pve and pvp experiences, so no you arn't really missing out experiencing something you dont want.
---
Its been a while since i read into any of it, and i didnt play at the time that healbot was like that, but i thought at some point i had read that the addon was actually designed to communicate with others that had it to prevent that.  i could be wrong, though.
---
That’s a great group!
---
First priority should be player preference honestly. You all should make a plan and possibly revisit it at 40 when Druid gets Moonkin and priest gets shadowform if they want.
---
unless you’re just trying to min max as much as possible in which case Druid tank, priest heal, all others DPS.
---
Amplify Curse (just to be sure)
---
Classic will make retail way worse. Why cater to ppl that liked Vanilla in retail when they've now been provided for with Classic?
---
Wouldn't be surprised to see retail go full blown watered down garbage.
---
💯
---
"He can't do that. Shoot him or something".
---
You're not wrong, but that's Vanilla itemization for ya :P Just one of the quirks of the game. The devs were very experimental with a lot of itemization in Vanilla; some of it worked out in interesting ways. You gotta take the good with the bad.
---
Compared to the top casters who simply press "1" all night, yes, having to time your button presses within a debuff window is funky and non inuitive--never said it was tough.
---
What 5 races do the horde have? Because in vanilla theres only 4 Races per faction, but thank you for the clear "I have no fucking clue about vanilla hurr durr" statement...  
---
Now, the alliance race split is DRASTICALLY human favored. So out of 400 players, On a 10k survey (5k said alliance) 22% said human (which is 44% of alliance). Thats 176 players that are human. RR is the best zone to go to for dwarves/gnomes/humans since wetlands is a bit too high, and you finished loch modan and westfall. You could go early wetlands, not saying you couldnt but most people go for RR for at least a couple levels. You are getting around 200-250 players out of 400.  
---
On the horde side you have 4. 4. 4. Races, and UD may go to barrens but they dont have to... So you have 300-400 players. not 400-500... Even with 50% of horde being flagged, which is ridiculously high you have 150-200 players flagged. Which is a high number because you have to include everyone AFK. Even people doing the quest that go "need to go grab a drink and piss" and they leave for 5 minutes? Guess what they arent flagged any longer and they are still doing the quest.  
---
Every afk person in the zone for more than 5 minutes isnt flagged, every player not doing those quest isnt flagged, every player traveling the big ass zone running to go turn in quest or to go start a quest isnt flagged. You are only flagged while doing the quest which is a fraction of the time spent doing a quest. If it takes you 20 minutes to kill the mobs, so you are flagged for 25 minutes, and spend 5-10 minutes walking to and from. With a drink break and to do ANYTHING IRL, you end up with less than 50% of your time being spent on the quest that you are logged in. So even people on the quest that you say are flagging you is going to be 50% of their time. Now not everyone is on those quest you are looking at maybe 50-60% of people at most on those quest, and only flagged half the time. Its really close to 30% if you are want to push the numbers and go with high bounds.  
---
Even with 50% of players you are wrong. And the number is much lower than that. Also I didn't downvote you, but sure, get salty at me lol.
---
Just needs to get an ergonomic seat cushion on top of the lid.  Put the lid down when you don't need to go...
---
I've not seen it, if mods want me to remove it then I have no problem with that
---
I like the model updates a lot, but they lost a certain something in translation. The old models and animation had something about their look and animations that felt, I dunno, better I guess? The vanilla animations were pretty superb in my opinion.
---
Alliance has more hand-holding, albeit still not all that much and an overarching story, while Horde questing is more exploratory in nature. 
---
Basically, Horde stuff was never actually finished but coincidentally that gives it a more freeform sort of appeal. 
---
This is further compounded by the fact that Alliance travel options are bloody horrendous, while the Horde zeppelins are almost convenient, and in comparison an absolute godsend.

Drake Fang Talisman for proper cut and paste.

Technically we dont know anything for certain, besides the exact things they have told us will work in whichever way. But, we can make educated guesses based an previous information and what builds we have had available to us.
---
Can't wait to farm for that Archivist's Cloak of Shadow Power and then lose it to a warlock.
---
OSRS is some good shit my man!
---
Half of 99 is 92!
---
Thanks for your input mate appreciate it. Street cred is massive ;) Just hope they don't look too gimp in plate! Not seen a vanilla UD model in plate tbh
---
Was sad at seeing what Blizzard did to this instance in Cataclysm.
---
Never played alliance, never will.
---
Also missing bottle of hand lotion and box of Kleenex.
---
Its a company giving consumers what they want in exchange for payment.
---
Is that a cash grab?
---
People pick rogues because they're vengeful people
---
To be fair, by this definition, cash grabs don't exist.  
---
I love the market.
---
Threat should never be a problem. Good tanks can hold threat on furies doing 1.5k DPS and rogues can manage threat anyways.
---
I don't suppose you could link the video?
---
Puzzle? It didn't even reset if you click the wrong statue. You could literally go in a circle, clicking each statue as you encountered it and would eventually activate everything you needed.
---
Vino! Thank you so much. Hope you're doing well.
---
To each is own I guess, but I need variety !
---
I’m going arms while leveling, both because I like world pvp and I haven’t tried leveling arms before.
---
I like healing because it is engaging, and managing your mana is a challenging meta game in and of itself.
---
Magic:  Priest Paladin
---
Poison:  Shaman Paladin Druid
---
Curse:  Druid Mage
---
Disease:  Priest Paladin Shaman
---
Special cases:
---
Fear:  Shaman via tremor totem, and kind of dwarf priest via fear ward
---
Slows: Paladin via freedom
---
Phyical debuffs:  Paladin via BOP
---
Mind control :  Priest and shaman via purge
---
I broadly agree with you, the other guy is just wrong, but you're wrong about horde not having to go barrens. Silverpine isn't nowhere near enough xp to take you to stonetalon, for instance, and silverpine and barrens are the only lvl 10 zones for horde - ally get westfall, LM and darkshore.
---
In classic as a speed leveling hunter...bring it on!
---
Hey thanks man. When I first started out I had no idea what I was doing and just slowly pieced together things with the help of others and tutorials on youtube. Video editing is always a work in progress.
---
The graveyard is so close too kek
---
Does it matter? As long as we can finally escape the babyland generation of games made today.
---
Depends on the value you place on it.
---
Holy cow, that a lot of unoriginal Holycow
---
It's like yeah you can be viable as a feral druid if you're dedicated enough to put in the time but someone else can just roll a warrior and do better than you with less than half the effort. In fact, rolling a warrior and another character as an alt is probably less effort than farming pummelers in gnomer 24/7.
---
"That name is already taken"
---
Every.  Goddamn.  Time.
---
Hueh hueh hueh. In all seriousness I didn't realize that one till you posted. Good catch.
---
This is great news. Hopefully I can get exhalted and get a ram!
---
1-10 hunter has no pet, it is a fact. That’s all i said. What part of retard town are you from? Dumbass
---
It's basically - do you want to hang out in mud huts or the marvelous feat of engineering that is Ironforge?
---
Me personally, I cannot comprehend why someone would play on a PvE server. It’s not the same game anymore if you do. 
---
For example if I saw a horde shaman poking a Black Lotus, in World of Warcraft I would kill the shaman and take the herb spawn.
---
In whatever land/game PvE servers are, i would have to stand idly by and watch the black lotus get plucked, even if I /PvP the shaman can just take it and walk away. Which is STUPID.
---
It’s World of WARcraft for a reason
---
Why not have both and have a hybrid-inclusive guild?
---
There was an automated healing addon in vanilla. It was also nerfed in vanilla, though.
---
To some people, all there is are cash dumps and cash grabs.
---
heavy leather, silk, mageweave, rugged leather all gonna be worth to keep (if u can afford the mount at 40-44).  
---
the leather rises in price once the majority drops skinning at 60 and later realizes they need it for some high-level quests.  
---
silk is always in high demand for tailoring since u need like 500 bolts (á 4 cloth) to push to mageweave.  
---
my plan is to keep everything I find since I often did vendor stuff I needed later on some Voldemort servers
---
It takes an hour, maybe to each week to farm what you need as a tank. And within that time you have 30 min per hour waiting for lockouts where you can log your bank and sort consumes.
---
People like you make it sound like farming MCP's is some huge fucking monumental task when it really isnt.
---
Right on!
---
Iron is heavy.
---
There another fact.
---
lol
---
okhand epic
---
haha me too haha epic
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tx0zfziIhE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tx0zfziIhE)
---
haha now this is haha epic me too litty
---
Hi, /u/Nesertyx
---
I hope you mean as DPS, because if you plan on tanking, but dont want to put in an hour every week farming MCP's so you can provide unmatched threat output to your raid then why should they bring you?
---
Its easier to just have a hunter run in with their NR gear they farmed for huhu, soak the first beam, feign and swap gear.
---
That's what we like to hear!
---
it was litty
---
now this would be epic and litty haha epic
---
The game is as good as people think it is.
---
As for classic, well there's lots of people who are interested in the game who never even played vanilla, that alone should say a fair bit.
---
I do apologize, I don't know horde pathing that well for leveling, I generally always do Barrens but I assumed it was skippable with Undead pathing areas and early entrance into contested zones like hillsbrad and such. Albeit I've only maxed 1 horde toon, and it was Orc.
---
I haven't seen it yet, so ty.
---
Just try them both and see what happens
---
totally epic idea haha litttty
---
That is unfortunate for you. I find I can comprehend most anything that I do not agree with or even like. I just know my own interests.
---
Ahh I love semantic trolls.  
---
You are making an assumption that he did not think the game was 100% perfect. How do you know he does not? Hence the ? at the end of the comment. I was inquiring because the idea of any QoL changes to improve things would leave open the idea that they believe everything was perfect. He did not respond or clarify, so here you go.  
---
I brought up a discussion to maybe make things a little better or more user friendly, and it got dismissed. What does that imply to someone with a brain as large as yours? Please fill me in on the details of their thought process. Please tell me precisely what was meant by giving a big nope to some QoL fixes.  
---
Implying no changes are needed would imply something is.... pick 3 words here. Go ahead Mr semantics.  
---
Considering they are already making a massive change with the release being 1.12 and the pvp gear will change the entire gearing component for competitive play, Making no changes at all from vanilla is already out the window.
---
It was pretty early, first content patch I think
---
Warrior/rogue/lock + disc/rdruid
---
Sure, but pvp is varying levels of fun for different people.  If I don't want to get into a gank fest when I get home from a stressful day, that may be beneficial
---
Not really. You wont have Paladin Blessings on Horde, which means you are losing out on might and kings. Horde have Windfury for tanks to make up the threat difference, but you dont benefit from that, and since you are in the tank group you wont have agility totem either.
---
Horde looks on paper like its the best faction for Feral tanks, but in reality the group composition constraints and lack of blessings make it less desirable.
---
I love when he clicks the second instance of HOJ on his top bar when he has it bound to number 6 on the main bar.  6 is too hard to press!! haha.
---
I can really only answer the druid portion. Rank 13 never saw the need for pushing for rank 14 as I already had will of arlokk and  end of dreams.
---
Druid is war of attrition you outlast  wont be pulling massive numbers (maybe the odd 1.2k maul crit) to burst people down but the class wasnt designed for that.  The jack of all trades statement rings true, You're not the best at anything but you're there to play to your enemies weakness. where a mage would get stun locked by a rogue you soak it, with a warrior you kite and whittle them down, mages well your cc doesnt work on me (seeing that panic as shift out of frost nova is always funny).  many classes have the BIG burst to drop enemies ,druids dont but you're enemies cant tank heal and kite all at the same time.
---
Hunters however are a problem &gt;&lt;
---
The fuck's a boomer?
---
Would have mentioned portals instead of water to keep with the comparison.
---
Im playing Feral tank in a raid that clear AQ40 on a weekly basis in about 1 hour 20min.
---
And a moonfire for me to hear my old speakers crackle!
---
Blizz went out of their way to implement spell batching so I say it's 50/50 :o
---
LOL PvE
---
I have never read quest texts and I don’t plan to start 
---
The way you play is different from other people, you do you and I’ll do me. No problems.
---
Only Onyxia, BWL, and MC - later on ZG. I was the #1 PvP druid on Vek'nilash which was cool I guess.
---
You're absolutely right
---
Drop rate is 40% and you can do what like 5 dungeon runs per hour? Let's say you're lucky and get 3 per hour. That's still only 4.5 mins of uptime on the buff per hour farmed, and you won't always be that lucky. If you're trying to progress on a boss and you don't know if you're secure a kill, it really seems like this pummeler farming bullshit will get old QUICK.
---
The way I see it, that time is way better spend farming consumables on a class that doesn't require such a ridiculous niche weapon.
---
I don’t think the skin of your ass sells that well. But hey, prove me wrong.
---
&gt; And Classic is 1.12....which is after 1.5...so...   
---
&gt; And Classic is 1.12....which is after 1.4...so... 
---
Patch 1.12 means we should have Dire Maul, ZG, BWL, AQ and Naxx, yet we won't ...

 I’m not planning on hardcore raiding but might dabble. I plan on taking my time leveling and doing mainly PvP. 
---
If I raid I’ll heal but for all other content I’ll be feral for sure. 
---
Based on other comments farming the MCP’s needed takes much more than an hour. I don’t mind a grind but sometimes it is too much.

I don't get it, I just see the same image twice.
---
Primary reason: for the pvp if you enjoy the challenge of open world leveling while perma-flagged. It is a unique and challenging experience. I've played on both types of servers and I find I enjoy some classes more on pvp servers while others more on laid back pve servers focusing on social interactions more than conflict.
---
The greatest advantage I see for playing on a pvp server is the mastery over your class you will obtain far earlier than you will on pve servers (unless you BG full time basically ... even so BGs just isn't the same sort of experience as open world pvp).
---
You will never master your class until you master it in pvp. It's just a simply fact.
---
So wait, you're sitting here trying to argue that Barrens is worse than Redridge and you've never even dealt with Barrens? 
---
*lol*
---
IIRC, Taurens cannot ride other racial mounts in Vanilla. Even with exalted. It was a lore reason: Only Kodo are large/strong enough to support Tauren. As a Tauren, if you want a raptor you have to pray to RNGesus for the ZG drop.
---
So maybe drop Tauren from your plans.
---
I was just wondering, where all the waste would go?

Hunters who try to play melee--while even less dps than ranged hunters are still fulfilling their role of DPS. 
---
The main warrior role--since they are the only ones who can do it in a raid--is to tank.

You can play to World of WARcraft on a PvP server. No handshake to kill an enemy, this sound weird since the Warcraft thing is based on the war between Horde &amp; Alliance.
---
I made this mistake once in Cata. I turn with my mouse, so if I right click on an enemy and don't drag my mouse enough, I start attacking. There was some worm boss thing where its target box took up the entire room for some reason. Despite being incredibly careful, I accidentally wiped our group by turning too slowly before the fight began... I still feel shame. I also quit playing a few weeks after.
---
Yeah, that was my bad, I was thinking 'four races, and then add another because orc and troll share starting areas' when I should have been thinking 'three STARTING areas, then add another race because orc and troll share starting areas.'
---
I like how you randomly went off on a frothing rage, then called me salty, though, especially when you're aparently trying to complain about redridge being worse than barrens when you've basically never played horde.
---
I also sent you a request on discord! I'm onetwo.
---
I have a hard time believing casuals will pay 500G for a piece of gear and HC players won't be that many.

Who knows if some genius figures out a way through the api limitations.
---
for when i wanted to see just how hard Aimed Shot could hit...
---
Not gonna miss this from retail.
---
It looked good as it does now on picture, but as soon as you have the model ingame and your start moving around.
---
No, god, just no!
---
I mean... could this be exclusive to the server you are playing? I'm just wanting to get actual proof either way,
---
Baby Boomer.
---
Technically it's the generation born to the baby boom after WWII. This makes them older than nearly anyone playing Wow so it's used instead as a modern reference to low tech savvy people of any age.
---
Most of us here are technically Gen X through to the most recent generations now into gaming.
---
Not a problem :)
---
Your best option to gear up while levelling is walking up to AH, selecting slot you're interested in and looking up for the *of the* **suffix** items. 
---
That's really about it, that's how the Vanilla itemization works. I guess they've made it back in the day to encourage trading between players. 
---
The quest rewards are shit in 90% cases compared to this, as it's up to your level and has the stats you precisely selected! 
---
Dungeon drops also isn't an option, some slots might not even be presented all the way untill the late dungeons come into play (BRD and futher).
---
Yes there is an exceptions like whirlwind axe and such, but every rule has its exception :)
---
It's not that expensive either, just grab the ones that set x3-x4 off the vendor price and you're gucci. Technically you don't even *need* the gear as caster, it comes handy only in pvp scenarios where the stamina is the king, but hey, who doesn't like upgrades? :)
---
Priest/rogue was pretty popular, yeah. But balance was still pretty poor, and warrior/druid was by far the most dominant.
---
Lol, everyone saying warriors as tank are the hardest class clearly have no idea. 5 mans are simple and their mechanics can be learned in a single run. Tanks may lead 5 mans just because they are pulling, but they rarely lead  40 man raids because that role is better suited to a class like a mage who has a better POV of the fight and is only spamming 1 button.
---
The hardest class has to be shaman in PvP. They offer so much ridiculous utility if played right and are responsible for healing
---
guaranteed to be a thing. I have never seen anyone enforce dbm or bigwigs on retail but im sure it happens. No one cares if you have it or not and there are a couple of people in my guild that dont use it. Now if you repeatedly fail mechanics....especially in a pug....you will either get questioned or kicked. Thats on you though. Pretty sure it will be the same thing.
---
I love the fact someone used the "Chuck Norris" language option on the second-to-last screenshot.
---
Really feels like 2000's!
---
I got into healing partly because I was getting bored of WoW and thinking of unsubbing, so tried to change things up a bit (it worked) and partly because it's basically a guaranteed group spot. I switched between healing and tanking until I started running heroics with my friends in Wrath, and there was already a tank and plenty of DPS. Since I played a paladin, healer was the obvious choice and I've loved it ever since.
---
It isn't that I'm some kind of natural caregiver or super nurturing (I'm not, I can't even keep house plants alive). Until I started healing in WoW I always preferred some kind of range DPS/nuker role in games and for the most part that's what I default to in single player games if available.
---
I just like healing and buffing. I don't need to see big crits or be top of the charts to feel like I've contributed to the group's success. I like healing in PvP as well. There usually aren't enough healers and having more healers on your team than your enemy definitely tips the scales in your team's favor.
---
I know for a fact that the cats in sorrow you kill them for vendor items.
---
discretion is the better part of valor
---
Your faction only really decides the first few starting areas that you will see. 
---
The main thing I would say is because you identify with Horde more, pick Horde. 
---
The main noticeable thing, to me at least, is the fact that:
---
 Horde is Offensive
---
 -Shamans are Horde only and are a class that helps teammates overpower enemies. So Horde having shamans plays I To how the horde play, whether in PvP or PvE
---
Alliance is Defensive. 
---
-Paladins are Alliance only and provide a ton of protection, escape possibilities, and bursty quick healing. 
---
Zones are very diverse and all look very different. But if you play Horde there’s a higher chance you start off in zones that are desert-like. You CAN however work around this and never play those zones if for some reason you don’t want to. For example you can play an Orc Warrior, but instead of starting in Durotar where it’s desert, you could walk to the Flying Zeppelin and Fly to Tirisfal Glades, a darker forest area where the undead start.
---
Just because you pick a race doesn’t mean you HAVE to play that starting area, it’s just a hassle to walk to the other one.
---
Lol, I love those messages
---
"You're on my KOS list now"
---
Never sure how to respond to that since I'm firmly in the red=dead camp
---
Yeah so this was already an add-on in classic. Called quest helper I think. It helped you level and everyone used it.
---
 Everything is a cash-grab. Everything.
---
&gt;  I just don't want to gank new and drive them off this amazing game.
---
They could just roll a PvE server and avoid this. You are doing nothing wrong by killing players in a PvP realm dude
---
Planning on playing an undead, so I should be fine to play in my favourite zones. Thank you!
---
I use two charges for Vaelastrasz, one for Broodlord and Two charges for Fankriss. The last charge I save in case Im tanking Garr first in MC using the burn strat.
---
Thats two Pummelers each week. The rest of the bosses just arent threat sensitive enough that I need anything other than Blessed Qiraji Warhammer. With 40% droprate (I believe its 50%), it will take you no more than an hour to do weekly which is nothing when it comes to Vanilla raid prep.
---
Most raiders in my experience just spend that time dicking around in Ironforge doing absolutely nothing anyway.
---
It depends on the server but PVP servers really do get the more warcraft feel of the two sides against eachother, you get more immersed imo cuz you get to face the enemy more frequently.
---
That said, wpvp is not the golden rose of pvp, in fact 90% of your fights will probably be being ganked at 10% heath after a mob kill or such.
---
Warlock obviously is good in pvp and is in no way off-meta
---
Feral in pvp is quite good in world pvp, and usable in bgs as a flag carrier.  In fights they are like a low-dps, low-disruption rogue, but since they have bearform they can't just be swapped to and punished the way a rogue can be.  They seem useful in AB as well defending caps or stealth pushing with a rogue support.  
---
Moonkin is pretty much dog tier.  It isn't just anit-meta, it is basically broken.  You are too squishy if focused, have to shape out of moonkin to add any support, and don't do the burst that basically any other caster is capable of.  Imagine playing a mage without blink, iceblock, barrier, nova with a cast time and scorch as your only viable dps spell.  
---
That being said, there is a hybridish style where you play as a resto druid with a bit of spell power.  You mostly heal+root to setup kills and use your dots to be able to slowly kill dps isolated from their healers. 
---
Elemental is quite good, high damage and high burst, the only flaw is running out of mana too fast.  You can get away with acting like a pure dps in pvp, but I think the great elemental shamans played mostly as support.  Purging, buffing allies, offhealing when primary healer is behind or getting CCd, and then only dropping their damage when a narrow window arises to secure kills.  
---
Ret is probably the most played bad spec.  The number of people playing it make it impossible to call it anti-meta, it is just more accurate to call it anti-good.  I guess id rather have a ret paladin then no paladin.  Blessings, bop and freedom, extra cleanse is all super powerful, but Holy paladin is the best pvp healer, so it just hurts to see rets running around in pvp being a waste.
---
I think theoretically ret can be good support, but in practice it never really seems to happen.  I think the issue is that to do good damage ret has to gear so little int/regen that they cannot play support without OOMing ~1min into every fight.  If they gear that int/regen they now do so little damage that they might as well be holy specced.  Most of the other healer hybrid specs are casters so getting enough mana to do their base support isn't really an issue.
---
Really confused why it's being used in reference to Classic.
---
Is it just a shitty meme to call anyone who's older because last I checked WoW wasn't all that hip with 60 year olds.
---
&gt;For anyone who just wants to be the best at their \*one\* preferred job, rolling on main-spec gear or \*reserving\* off-spec gear seems like the best compromise as long as it's communicated in advance.
---
This is the bit I have a problem with. Its not main spec or off spec because I'm playing a hybrid spec. I change roles by swapping gear and don't need to respec. 
---
I play hybrid because i want to do whatever is required to get the job done. Which makes it more efficient for everyone looking for a group. 
---
Yes I agree that reserve runs would hell with this but as you experienced a large number of people seem to be against them so advertising one would go against my purpose of making finding a group quicker.
---
A cash grab is often used to describe scams, people capitalising on the popularity of something for a quick money reward usually at the cost of quality, the recent Fortnite fest in the uk being a prime example. (dumb ass parents desperate to please)
---
In this instance the community knows exactly what its getting as it was demanding it for nearly 7 years+ from the people providing.
---
Or until AV. Caster get nef offhand last.
---
I ganked there a fuckton in vanilla. Then I played alliance on a high populated p server and karma fucked me in the ass.
---
The first time I went there was to turn in 1 quest and fly out. I was killed 6 times, then had to run back, because the flight master was dead
---
Maxed a horde toon? I always do barrens? Did you even read what I posted?
---
Looks like you got your own shovel. Enjoy
---
Ok now look at this from the perspective of someone who's actively wiping on bosses pretty often. This WILL be the case in classic. You'll see some guilds of people from pservers dominating but for the most parts the populace will be fully noob again and you WILL be wiping. Do you really think a MCP is worth it for a druid in that scenario? I sure as hell don't.
---
New to me and got a good chuckle out of my wife while we sit in a waiting room!
---
Don’t pick a faction for its starting zone.
---
Classic exists for one reason only:
---
Blizzard was losing control of their IP to private server emulation. The audience migrating from their shrinking audience of retail wow and those lost long ago who preferred pre-cata, was moving to private servers en masse. Pservers had a significant audience and only needed to host their servers in countries outside of American legal reach.
---
Classic Wow is Blizzard officially gaining control over this loss. Interest in Classic obviously was large enough for Blizzard to formulate a business model and go for it.
---
All other reasons beside this are inclusive yet lesser.
---
It's basically your oh shit button when you have nothing else to do on melee yea. Perplexity a rogue on YouTube has some high skill level duels with a warlock on his channel where he explains what both classes are doing etc.
---
I don't think they'll make it past a level 17 Hunter.
---
Yeah I’ve been having the same problem
---
I mean, basically never played horde? I have over 100 days played time on horde toons. With numerous experience leveling through barrens. But yeah, I clearly know nothing compared to the guy talking about 5 horde races in vanilla. #rektme
---
Rofl who is this making fun of that clip of him about the lettuce is him, good laugh.
---
kind of ashamed how true this was of me.
---
raid leader telling us 'we stack for this part, we spread at this part, adds first here, kite here," etc etc
---
as soon as the fight starts its all out the window
---
Dunemaul Ogres in Tanaris
---
And just like that I'm almost interested in their 'content'.
---
I’m pretty much agnostic on whether it gets added or not.  I may use it if implemented, and if not there’s always Discord.
---
This is extremely helpful! Thanks for taking the time to write up your response. I think from your descriptions Holy Paladin and Ele support shaman seem the most up my alley in terms of playstyle. I only lean towards Paladin because I imagine it would also be capable at AoE farming for gold (I've seen some cool videos of Prot Pally farming). Though I have a soft spot for the Horde...
---
I'm pretty sure that website was awful even back then. Raidbots and class Discords (which usually update Icy Veins too) is where you'll find your info on live, no doubt this will follow through to Classic too.
---
Sometimes, but having things like Bloodlust/Bladestorm in arena made killing people in globals possible. [Ex. wizard cleave](https://youtu.be/hXDgb3aZPMc?t=28). Beast Cleave hit insanely hard too. I forget the name of the cleave with two warriors and one holy paladin as well. Either way Wrath is where you really saw CC in arenas being not as important as before and burst taking center stage.
---
Not to my knowledge, obviously assume Dire Maul gear wont be in yet.. as far as items that were available on launch but modified later in the game they will use the 1.12 stats (bonereavers edge etc)
---
And there he goes! *tail between legs as he scampers off*
---
You can see pretty well even if the room is brightly lit. Except perhaps in Duskwood.
---
The "kill on the way" technique is what Joana used set the world record.
---
It is the most irreplaceable item among the three rewards.  What do you mean by "when ignoring the stealth bonus?" - Whisperwalk boots do not have the highest stealth bonus in the boots slot and they're not that much better than the crafted ones. The mask is not worth it at all.
---
I don't know what the private server crowd has been using but retail players for the most part stick to Wowhead, icyveins, and their individual class discords for rotations and the like. I expect both wowhead and IV to likely expand into classic once it launches given how little effort it is (everything is 1.12 unlike retail still getting patched). Simcraft will likely be less useful given BiS lists already exist for 1.12.
---
As for realworld numbers I remember using world of logs back in vanilla but it's pretty likely warcraftlogs will expand into the classic as well and I would recommend that given how much more robust it is features wise.
---
true. but as much as I like wow, I also like sunlight and making a living. Not sure how keen I'll be to farm up AV rep on a mage if I am already a raider. 
---
Now my alt warrior? Bet your ass, need that Unstoppable Force. 
---
Also, i sorta like the white stats on staves, esp for pvp.
---
We asked for it, so it's not a cash grab it's a fair exchange.
---
Obvious answer, read about classic
---
most of this sub seems to be on the boomer/zoomer border so i'm not sure.  lot of people who were literal children when wow came out and have nostalgia for hitting level 30 before tbc came out and never actually played at max level
---
lol, you're gonna sit there and try to hard on that as hard as you can, aren't you, because we both know you have no other argument.
---
Fraps..
---
Cant have it all kiddo...
---
Nah totally skipping profs until 60
---
You sir have made Thousand Needles questing even more enjoyable!
---
It cannot possibly be added according to the purists roaming about on here. That would be a game play altering mechanic.  
---
I personally would not mind this in the least, but it is not part of "classic".  It would make the communication component that many cherish easier, but different. I am all for voice coms over typing as it is just smoother and less gets confused.
---
Patch 2.4
---
"Elemental creatures are no longer explicitly immune to poison and disease effects. Elementals with nature school immunities will still be immune to nature-based poisons, however."
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.4.0
---
Don't encourage him, while I off-by-one'd the races, because I was thinking in terms of 'races' and not 'starting zones' when I added one for the shared orc+troll, I didn't even get into the fact that alliance has easy access to barrens from four directions (ratchet, ashenvale, dustwallow, and a slightly longer feralas-&gt;barrens) compared to Horde, which is Stonard -&gt; deadwind -&gt; duskwood -&gt; elwynn -&gt; redridge,  STV-&gt; duskwood-&gt; elwynn -&gt; redridge, or try to go through burning steppes and get turbofucked by every alliance running around burning steppes for MC/LBRS/UBRS/BRD/etc.
---
Meanwhile, let's not pretend horde at ANY point sat around trying to drum up Redridge raids in trade chat, I've never once even heard of that, let alone saw it, yet any busy night on alliance in vanilla you would see people drumming up crossroads raids.
---
Trying to pretend that Horde 'had it easy' leveling through 10-30 is dumb at best, and outright lying at worst.
---
Mostly I'm into it because I just find it more immersive. Big, player-driven, open-world combat is probably going to be super rare anyway I reckon, so if that's your sole reason for joining a PvP server you'll be disappointed. So I guess you could say, the appeal of PvP servers IS that risk of getting ganked, because knowing the risk is there makes the game feel much more alive.
---
This is really only true while leveling or at lower levels of gear, and if the warlock goes soul link with a voidwalker he's nearly untouchable
---
Raid lead often goes to the MT because that's the cornerstone position of the guild. The raid leader will almost always be at every single raid and is often the most stable guild member, so it makes sense that the raid leader would adopt the role of MT for the guild. However I've often seen the raid leader be a healer or dps. The raid leader of the most successful guild on my old server was a healer, and the raid leader/gm of my previous guild was a rogue.
---
I'm with you, OP. I think Classic *needs* to have the original graphics, and I don't really want to see Classic's launch delayed by attempting to port over the updated graphics. I know the modern API and the 1.12.1 API aren't the same, but I've seen how much work changing those old DBCs are and the new DB2s don't look much less complicated. I am 110% confident it would take a non-negligible amount of time to do so, even if we don't discuss how much work may or may not be required to make a working toggle vs a separate downloadable optional patch.
---
I am hopeful that when Classic proves successful they can justify the expense of giving it the Starcraft and WC3 treatment with an optional graphical update.
---
Well kiddo, you can, it just costs 50g.
---
They don't have much incentive to improve retail because the sub numbers are linked. I wonder why they did that... Sooner or later they won't be able to avoid the fact that the majority of their subscribers aren't consuming any of the retail content and as a result they will probably make the next retail expansion a mobile game. They are that out of touch. Do you guys not have phones?
---
Most zones will be contested, meaning you get flagged for trivial things. Same-level PvP was very common on PvE servers, because everyone was always flagged anyway for looking at a guard from 200 feet away.
---
The only real difference is ganking lower-level players in lower-level zones. That's generally extremely rare. Anything above level 20, people will get flagged pretty easily.
---
What? I completely dismantled your argument. And now you refuse to address that and instead are trying to distract me with smoke and mirrors. Claiming I never or barely play horde. When that claim was proven to have no backing you still just try and go "you didn't disprove my argument twice" no shit unless you make a new claim there is nothing else to say
---
Horde feral druids still do crazy threat which makes them really strong on horde, but on ally the threat is not neccesary with salv and sword spec TF tanks.
---
Being horde and have only 2 raid nights, and not being on weekends is just what I'm looking for in a guild:
---
-Are you willing to accept foreigners that do speak good enough english?
---
-Are you playing on a heavy populated/streamer server or going to emptier ones?
---
You dont use pummelers on progression lmao.
---
The toggle was problematic enough that they couldn't be bothered to fix, support, or as far as I know even continue it.
---
Pservers handle model/music/etc patches like game patches, and that's a route Blizz could explore. A separate downoad that overwrites and requires a game restart to take effect.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you but I guess im not sure what you expected? All of the players are in BFA zones. You were in content that is over a decade old and lasts an hour or so at best. If you are looking to actually play wow, use the boost and start at 110. You will still spend a few days leveling with other people.
---
ITT: sociopaths
---
Lol leave it to a boomer to think this is all about them. I don't have numbers to look at but I'd bet that millennials / gen x will vastly outnumber them in the classic player base
---
P.s. quake is pretty great, miss quakelive tbh
---
It's not nearly as bad as people think if you have a little bit of experience with damage mitigation and keep up your cooking/first-aid skills.
---
Being better than everyone else doesn’t mean much; the bad is set so low to begin with.
---
Blizzard has announced they will ban adding that  “go against the spirit of vanilla” such as décursive.
---
BigWigs was a big name back in vanilla, I’m not sure when DBM became “the name” but boss timers have been a thing for awhile.
---
Hard to ban a simple timer that’s based off of when a boss starts combat.
---
TO BE HONEST, I’d fucking love it if they banned raid-help addons
---
China knows about this one.
---
grinding is ok. myself will grind 20-25 levels.
---
but some questlines are funny and i will make them. i dont grind before level 34
---
“Engaging playstyle” 
---
*Presses wand
---
That's silly. Why would you mindnumbingly grind for hours at risk of bad pulls and banks when you could spend 1g to respec prot and run dungeons all day instead?
---
Not only is the loot better (elite mobs usually drop more money, higher chance on greens/ higher level greens, blues obviously) but also if you pair up with enchanter you can get a bunch of shards from blues which people don't need, make a ton of connections with a lot of people and help out a bunch of noobs by tanking for them.
---
And when group sucks or being toxic, you can just leave and find another group quicker than you can stay "LFG" .
---
I'll try and find it too. I remember the discussion based around Humans/Orcs because of their racials giving +5 to a specific weapon skill.
---
This is what I'm looking for, philosophy and schedule-wise
---
Melee dps on horde side has to optimize insta cast abilities with their swing timer to benefit the most from windfury. Ideally you want to use instant abilities right after your auto swings so you can get the most dps gain from a potential WF proc, and that adds a layer of concentration to each fight. 
---
There are of course harder classes but I don't care to mention some of them since if you want to dps for real you're going to be playing warrior/rogue/mage/warlock
---
Nope, I just turn it off. I can look at a damage meter if I need to but it doesnt change anything.
---
**Warlock to the rescue!**
---
Endless Breath.
---
Cool thanks!
---
Having played (and still playing) rogue on a TBC server atm, I could not disagree with this advice more. If you try to pre-gank a rogue, you can bet your ass that they are going to make it their mission to make your life miserable for the foreseeable future - between stealth and a full set of cooldowns, odds are good that they can, even if you outmatch them in a fair fight.
---
This only applies in situations where a rogue is farming/leveling in the same area as you of course. If they have to PvE and expose themselves that way, good rogues know better than to risk provoking people. Especially in vanilla, your ability to escape while caught fighting a mob is extremely limited as a rogue.
---
So in the end, basic courtesy prevails - whoever is dumb enough to break the peace is going to suffer the consequences and ultimately cost everyone involved valuable time.
---
&gt; What? I completely dismantled your argument.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA what? *What?* You literally did no such thing. You went 'HURRDURR YOU HAD A TYPO' and then proclaimed victory. Even with the typo corrected, you have no legs to stand on.
---
&gt; Claiming I never or barely play horde. When that claim was proven to have no backing you still just try and go "you didn't disprove my argument twice"
---
You literally said you only ever leveled one horde character to max, and I notice you VERY POINTEDLY never said if it was on a pvp server, or even in vanilla.
---
&gt; When that claim was proven to have no backing you still just try and go "you didn't disprove my argument twice" no shit unless you make a new claim there is nothing else to say
---
Kiddo, you gotta actually prove your claim in the first place, not just proclaim victory because you attacked a typo.
---
Cool so just as I suspected. You private server players are SERIOUSLY warping the perception of what classic will be like. You're all talking about druid viability as if everyone is going to be 15/15 naxx day one. No. Everyone will be in questing blues and greens and have to struggle through content like intended. Druids aren't really gonna do shit all except for heal for 99% of guilds at this point.
---
I feel like this is an important comment. The risk of hostile attention from the opposing faction makes the game feel like there is risk involved in every decision. I haven't personally experienced a PVE server, but I can imagine that I wouldn't feel that the world is as alive or as potentially dangerous without that PVP element. It would get dull faster.
---
The problem you might have is getting good players that aren't playing the "meta" specs. I'm likely rolling a fury warrior, if I was in your guild I'd be going arms for PvP instead. Why would a warrior spec for the top DPS in raids in a gimped raid setting?
---
Hey, thanks a lot for the inquiry. We have no problems with foreigners whatsoever and hold no prejudices in any way and would love to have you aboard. Our goal is to certainly stay away from the streamer servers, but we also don't want to play on an "empty" one either. Choosing a server will be a difficult task, as we want to be on an active medium to high pop server while not on a mega crowded streamer server, but I think we'll be able to find one that suits us well.
---
More likely to be min maxes, yes.  But they're just the most popular classes in general too.
---
How much do you recommend investing talent pts in the DL support talents like fel concentration and imp DL? do you think that you use the skill enough to warrant many talent points in it?
---
Wouldn't matter at all, most guilds at the time used Vent, later TeamSpeak. Even if it wasn't built into the game, everyone had voice chat, and can still do the same stuff, easier now.
---
You know I think I'm just going to pretend I'm playing like I did back in the day and read my talents as I level and decide what I want in the moment.
---
I didn't notice it was a ledge and thought they were all really, really tiny.
---
It was on the newest pvp pserver, so no shit. I like how you didn't even reply to everything else after I said hurr durr. So just go read the other 4ish paragraphs I typed after that disproving your math. And proving RR has more flagged players at any given time.
---
There's no inherent advantage, but anytime I've played on a PvE server, I end up feeling like "what's the point?" I mean, you raid to get gear and then you... just keep doing that forever. I despise leveling on a PvP server, but at 60 I just can't see the long-term appeal of a PvE server when we already know all the content and strategies for every little thing. Not unless it had a healthy BG scene, which PvE servers rarely do.
---
My main was a tauren and I rode AV wolf no problem
---
When i was playing on private servers barrens chat was fun for a little while but after a day or 2 of seeing the same stuff, [Thunderfury blessed blade of the windseeker] or [The Nicker] (the nicker had its name changed to the blackrock slicer in TBC so those jokes wont be happening in retail) but yeah its mostly just people linking items and creating their own little stories with them. With the threat of account ban when they are paying for a sub i dont see barrens chat being unbearably bad.
---
It's a bannable offense on retail, so I'm assuming that rule will carry over.
---
I don't even recall the Cloak, just looked it up. How effective is the fall damage reduction?
---
Rip the dream
---
PvE here, so balancing isn't at all essential to me. However, login queues are. So, I'll be picking a realm with a shitty name because I prefer mid pops rather than high, and people are going to cake to servers with "cool" or "badass" names.
---
However, for PvP folks like yourself, I could certainly see the benefit of controls. Launch day/week is going to be a shit-show regardless though.
---
Is the first phase 3 or 6 months?
---
IMO it can be worth it. DL also procs Nightfall. If a rogue jumps you and gets some HP off before you can react you can sac VW, dot and drain him a bit and get back to full HP. I think DL works with Grim Reach and those talents stacks with Shadow Mastery. It can help reduce downtime in PVE/leveling with Life Tap + DL.
---
Muradin's beard! You're right! A stretched out dwarf is what I really wanted.
---
Down for tuck
---
Purely grinding mobs to 60? Can't be done. There is discovery experience.
---
This is worth watching just to hear them attempt to say Pendulum haha.
---
Nicely done! Thanks dude.
---
personally I think tbc is just the best version of the game being in the middle of vanilla and wotlk gameplaywise, but the other 2 are good as well.
---
my rationale is also that if i want to ever get to play on an official Blizzard TBC server, classic's gonna have to be a success.
---
Druids can be challenging and harder to play, but are very fun if you enjoy them. I LOVE playing Druids after vanilla, I hate playing them in vanilla.
---
Can be difficult to master and can therefore be frustrating, but they are fun
---
Thought about including portals and soul/health stones.
---
I feel like water and summons are what people get the most excited for when a mage or lock joins the party though.
---
Please post your character names for those planning on doing this.
---
My feral druid will be waiting to pick you off. ;)
---
As a priest if I can help I will. Bubble, heal, renew, heal, bubble self, renew self, heal. (For reference I’m talking early 20s)
---
I remember using an ingame VOIP back in BC, but not sure when it was added. It wasnt super popular because most of the time it was just kids blasting Linken Park over their speakers, which in turn would have you disable it.
---
If you want brief cliff notes on this id recommend reading through the old game guide for WoW, pretty much sums up the background for all the races and the state of the world following the events of WC3
---
itemization.info
---
That was the reason I went paladin back in classic.
---
Idk, my female orc rogue named Mankrikswife was always well received.
---
maybe it depended on server, but i honestly dont remember it being 'bad'
---
mostly full of lame jokes, people giving smartass answers to questions and the like.
---
the global trade channel/world trade or whatever it was called was way worse, but that didnt last too long
---
Not all hero’s wear capes
---
I want you to be able to have your best life and live it the way you want, but when it comes to group activities, it's going to be difficult, because others have to \*choose\* to associate with you by definition.  
---
In the vanilla Warcraft meta, holy paladin was \*the\* spec, as protection lacked a taunt and retribution simply couldn't pull near the numbers of the other D.p.S. classes in a raid. Again, PURE retribution was considered trash, so I just can't imagine how one plans to put talent points in 2/3 or even 3/3 trees and expect to be even decent at any one of those roles. I'd love to be incorrect, but my assumption is that you and people like you are like...maybe 0.21% of the player base, and that only 1/500 or so players are going to run into the specific loot drama that you're describing. You sound like you literally want to equip everything that you can possibly equip, and I suppose that's your right insofar as no one can stop you, so...  
---
I guess do it. I only implore that you learn the loot tables and be up front about your intentions, because a warrior or rogue looking for Hand of Justice trinket out of a dungeon might not choose your particular group if he knew that the paladin healing the group planned to contend for it. Everyone's time is valuable to them, so finding a way to get what we want in a setting where everyone knows what the stakes are preemptively avoids drama.
---
Overpower doesn't procc off of misses. It proccs from dodges. All you'd be doing is gimping your deep wounds damage.
---
I don't see much hate towards feral. 
---
The only time I see hate towards feral is when somebody tries to claim they are better than warriors as tanks for raids. Which they just are not. Druid are amazing dedicated offtanks, and great Resist tanks, that's about it.
---
As a rogue, I’ll throw in a gouge and keep walking.
---
They have not announced dates for any of the phases and afaik don't plan to.
---
Except warriors are also the top dps class in the game...?

Classic WoW is to Cash Grab, as Relaxing is to Stranglethorn Vale.
---
And the fact that bgs won’t even come out until months down the road
---
You can avoid Barrens as horde and just don't create a troll or orc to avoid starting zones. You'll probably enjoy Silverpine, Hillsbrad Foothills and Arathi Highlands I think. They're beautiful zones.
---
I wouldn't recommend investing any point until imp drain life until you have the hit to take points out of suppression (in pvp). Fel concentration is worth taking right away. I usually put all 5 points in it and skip the damage to coa as it seems less impactful. I'm usually using tongues/elements/shadow curses as nf/Conflag anyway. Like someone else said, drain life procs nightfall which turns a fight in your favor very quickly. You always have searing pain, immo and Conflag when/if you get kicked on drain life.
---
You really don't need reliable people to run with. You'll find plenty of people to group with even if it's just for 5 minutes to take down a hard mob or one with a long respawn timer. Social interactions are a strong suit of Classic WoW.
---
As far as experience efficiency, who really cares... Would you rather spend 10 minutes grinding by your lonesome competing for tags, or 15 minutes having a decent interaction with someone which may or may not turn into a dungeon buddy later on or a name you recognize at 60 who recognizes you back.
---
A group of 5 experienced WoW players since 2005.    Looking for a Central Time-zoned guild that will be semi-hardcore raiding a couple nights a week.  Warrior, Rogue, and Frost mage have extensive experience with vanilla WoW raiding and would be staples of any raid group!

I hope it doesn't get added just because of how annoying it is on retail. A while back it used to give me long loading screens (I'd get a string of WoW voice chat server errors after said long loading screens) which I tried to solve by deleting the .exe file responsible for the voice chat...which would work for a while, but the .exe would find itself creeping back in each time I restarted WoW.
---
There's no way to disable it. Even if you go into parental controls to disable it, it just disables the use of it, not the actual system itself. I think most people just use Discord anyway, even PuGs tend to set up discord servers when voice chat is needed.
---
Retail will keep this feature. In retail.
---
They'll all be grinding mobs in desolace because there are no quests there.
---
There sure is, I found this exelguide a while back on a redditpost on this forum.
---
Enjoy and be sure to spread it around to others who might need it :)

Yes, don't pick your classes based on this happening. The chances that all 5 of you are going to stay within a level range that lets you level together for long is slim to none. Not trying to be cynical, that's just the way it works. People end up playing at different times, some play more, some play less, by a week into the game you'll all be different levels.
---
Why would I reply to math that we both know is in bad faith? You're literally trying to claim nobody is ever flagged in the barrens, when if you actually went through the barrens in a pvp server you would know that most of the people in the barrens are flagged.
---
More to the point, you're trying to claim that RR has far more people in it than it ever does- you can literally skip the entirety of RR on every alliance race, and a lot of people do because between the orcs up north and the murlocs all constantly pulling extra mobs, plus all the kill quests, RR could be tedious and other zones were better XP. Much better to take darkshore/loch modan/westfall to ~18 and then hit ashencale/duskwood/hillsbrad/wetlands while sprinkling about some ez xp from stockades or even hitting stonetalon (but lets be honest, pretty much nobody actually clears stonetalon)
---
Meanwhile, horde, your options are barrens, or try to do silverpine, and then barrens anyway. Not to mention Barrens' proximity to org/TB for following up on 'Crossroads is under attack!'
---
I remember this video when it came out, I'm glad he spoke up. I love JonTron &lt;3
---
Yup, and if you do end up pulling this off at all, be prepared for high turnover from those people. 
---
Even of they enter with the best of intentions, frustration at stalled progression when your the top parse/one of the ones playing the pve only spec is ruff. 
---
You'll also definitely get people who can't get into a better guild just using our as a gear pitstop for sure. Was in a low tier guild that I stuck with for way too long in vanilla where tanks and healers would just join, raid for long enough to get some tier ect. and leave for a better guild in a month. Guild was stalled 2/3s through MC till it disbanded.
---
I'm a wifi warrior, who wants me?
---
Redridge absolutely sucks way way way more than barrens. That's just a fact.
---
I was a lvl 59 feral grinding skins for coin in Felwood. For a change I'd attack geared raiders collecting mats. I was near pre-BIS.
---
Damn fun challenge. Lost more than I won, but taking out a T2 geared player was worth it.
---
So you have the wrong idea in mind. Even MC is hard and you can easily get stuck at 8/10 or earlier for months. Do not go into MC expecting alot. It will feel bad if you don't get far.
---
Getting stuck wont lead to those cool cheerful moments on discord. More likely it will just give you more drama, cause the core players to leave and make raid attendance low. Raiding in Vanilla can suck and players just move on. 
---
All the veteran players who tell you that you need to be "raid spec" to raid. They all overcame the challenge and made raiding fun. 
---
DPS will be your problem. DPS is the key to easy raids. You will have hard raids. 
---
So maybe do other stuff than only raiding to build some extra cohesion in your guild.
---
Exactly. There’s legitimately a place for shadow priests and survival hunters and feral druids in Naxx-clearing guilds. But the players that are willing to put in the time to make it work will not be willing to join a guild that may or may not make it past Chromaggus before AQ40. Your biggest challenge will be recruitment of quality players.
---
clearly never played vanilla
---
This is on ND didn't think that had to be specified. No reason to talk about the game 15 years ago when we ca discuss the current meta.
---
You sit in a special waiting room just to wait for classic release? That be some dedication right there.
---
Oh nice, what a great idea to just read some of the books while waiting for the release! Thanks a lot for the list!
---
Hillsbrad leveling at 18. Dude the fact you don't play alliance but try to claim you know alliance leveling routes is fucking hilarious
---
Honestly, the «ANAL [spell name/ item name]» jokes are still funny
---
Fuck you
---
The problem with this approach, is the guild needs at least a handful of players who sacrifice some of their spec for raiding. For instance a warrior really needs to put 11 points into protection to raid tank. More like 16 ish for the extra threat if you have even a few "good" DPS players. 
---
It doesn't feel good to be one of the couple guys that sacrifices for the a raid of people who aren't willing to. I'm rolling a warrior, if I was in this guild if go 31/20/0, or I'd find a new guild. That builds useless for tanking and not good at DPS, but the it'd be great fun to PvP with. 
---
If I had to respec for the good of the guild, id find a new guild. The only way this works is if you have a core group of people already willing to fill the key roles and not leave.
---
Nope. CoS was added in TBC. But if you're a dwarf, Stoneform is almost as good in that it gets rid of poisons, diseases, and bleeds. Only thing that it doesn't do that CoS does is get rid of Warlock DoTs.

I honestly don’t really see that happening with Classic. Retail has been the nexus of competitive PVE for a long time and the most talented players don’t play on illegal servers. Raids are also 100x harder now than in Classic and everyone knows it. Clearing Molten Core on a pserver is nothing compared to Mythic Jaina on Live.
---
I'm a huge fan of the Souls series (obviously vanilla too). Some of the best games ever made (also loved Bloodborne and and currently loving Sekiro). That said, the two are so different that it's hard to compare them. In fact I can easily think of way in which they are drastically different (not even in a gameplay way because that's low hanging fruit. More about the philosophy of the games). Armor and weapons is one such area. One of my favorite things about the Souls series is that you can  take a standard weapon you start with or find within 5 minutes and complete the game with it and it's not particularly unusual. That ratty wooden handled spear you looted off an early enemy? Within a span of time you can be shoving that in the guts of a dragon if you feel attached and you don't even need to upgrade it if you don't want to. That workmanlike knight armor you looted off a corpse in a graveyard? It's good enough to last until the final boss and you can go face to face with actual deities while wearing it, and the flashy fancy armor you can get is hardly any better if it's better at all. Meanwhile, WoW? All about the loot. I really love walking into a boss arena in Dark Souls and being confronted with a God/Primordial entity who has existed since time began/guy who invented MAGIC--and making them taste the cold steel of my standard issue claymore. Guess even the gods don't like  a sword to the heart, huh Gwyn?

Alliance would camp the blimp tower in STV on my server. You either jumped off early and swam in, or got off any way other than just walking off or you were just asking to be dead.
---
Hi, /u/Qcfishy
---
Forgot about having one of your general purpose bags replaced with a soul bag. So you're running to the vendor more often to sell off your trash.
---
Feel free to join the Discord. Always excited to have new players!
---
&gt; There's no inherent advantage
---
The advantage is that you can attempt murder on the other faction whenever you want to.
---
&gt;simply because groups expect a tank to mark and pull everything. 
---
If only that were true.
---
Yeah, altho it'll be a while, it'd be nice if they took Classic into BC and WotLK. However, if they do, I would want then to fork the server. That way I can always go back to my lvl 60 classic char and still be able to progress onto BC too. Sure I wouldn't play that char for a while when BC was new, but I'd always like to be able to go back if I wanted down the road.
---
vendors are the heroes best friends
---
Alliance don't have level 20 quest in hillsbrad. Its clear you don't know this because you've never leveled an alliance in hillsbrad. How do I know this? Because it's fucking impossible to. Unless you grind between the horde gangfucking your corpse then you might be able to get a level or two lol.
---
As a Priest I just start sweating and burst into tears while running the other way.
---
Basically, but you will always want to hotkey several of your lower ranked heals so you can be optimal in your mana usage
---
Rogue 😂
---
Having a big toolkit =\= hard to play
---
That makes more sense. 
---
Yeah having 1-2 Ferals per raid has always seemed like a good idea to me. Good on your guild for bringing them
---
Ohhh Alex
---
Sounds like a dude playing on NW launch, he played tauren hunter, everyone hated him in voicechat :D
---
I got one solo farming ZG on my death knight during WotLK, so it was still available yes. 
---
Sadlythat account got hacked after I quit but before bnet launcher integration, so I can never log into that toon again.

One of the problems with druid tanking is that you need to pop out of bear form to leverage your utility like innervate and brez, however if you pop out of bear form with a decent sized mob on you, you're gonna get instagibbed. So a druid tanking basically surrenders all of their utility. 
---
It's better when you're an OT, since eventually the mob you're tanking will get killed at which point you're free to leverage your utility.
---
I'm going 20/31/0 pally to tank 5 mans and heal raids
---
Execute him!
---
Yeah. Demand will be lower and I don’t think blizzard will allow mafias to exist
---
You're trying to tell me a level 19 twink is going to corpserun from STV zeppelin all the way to RR just to harrass some lowbies? 
---
And besides that, a level 19 twink rogue would get turborekt by the guards or flightmaster, you can quest in peace and still turn things in, not to mention basically any kind of group can kill the rogue and corpse camp him, it's a level 19 at the end of the day.
---
Did you ever play horde in vanilla on an active pvp server, by any chance?
---
Exactly. My point stands. 
---
He asked for a build to do both he got one. 
---
Top tier dps builds. An fun in casual pvp without costing 50g? Yes pls ty. 
---
But I concede I wouldnt take him in a premade, with just 1 war space without Ms, this from a 2450 rated bgs on warrior on horde side with pre bc exp.
---
But is that what his question was about? Hardcore pvp? or you you just being a stick in the mud?
---
Yea the pvp gear and the BoE 1.10 stuff were the only things I felt would be major deal.
---
Wolves in ashenvale, hyenas in 1kneedles, cats in stv.
---
I really want to roll an elemental shaman because I’ve played one on retail for a long time.  I’m not all that interested in healing but if I want to raid do I not have a choice?  I’ve heard Elemental is only good for pvp and I don’t know much about Enhancement
---
Sexy ain't he tho
---
It wasn't designed to be the BiS druid tank weapon I would assume. Just designed as a fun item. People figured out it was and used it. At that point there's no good decision for blizzard to make....
---
Not really true in vanilla WoW. The hybrid tax is real, and pure classes just perform so much better than their hybrid counterparts. The problem is only made worse in raids where you bring 40 people along. With so many specialists, there's not really a niche for generalists. Druid utility comes out more in zones like ZG and AQ20 where you have fewer players, and the fight mechanics are more involved than the earlier MC and BWL raids.
---
You’re being nice about it, but your opinion is garbage. Just so you know. People like you I actually hate more than the kids ganking people at 25% hp. At least they’re open and honest about being assholes (they walk the walk basically), but people defending them... makes a person go 🤔. If you’re gonna be asshole just say you’re being an asshole. I’ve ganked random lowbies—we probably all have. But while I’m doing so I’m under no delusion that I’m “pvping” with that person. I’m being an asshole and acting like a child because it makes me feel good or chuckle at their misfortune. People saying “pvp happened” at deluding themselves. Just admit you’re acting like a spoiled child stomping on an ant hill in some fucked up show of power and move on.
---
There’s pretty much 1 way into red ridge. And one quest hub. A couple high level horde can completely shut down that zone. You can’t come close to comparing griefing in the barrens to redridge
---
Man I miss old school tf

So while I'm trying this in BGs, I'm getting no Procs really and wasting all my globals are there main targets I should be putting SW:P on

Seeing as Horde racials are arguable better for PvP, there's a good chance a PvP server will have a higher Horde population.  Just slightly though.
---
This may work in your favor if you wanted to roll Horde.
---
Again, you ignore literally everything to try and pinpoint on a single detail to act like this 'justifies' alliance leveling being harder than horde. And those numbers come from the official guide,btw.
---
Also, btw, even if you try to pin your argument on 'alliance never go to hillsbrad at 20' you're just shooting yourself in the foot- Alliance generally have the level advantage vs horde by about 5 levels in hillsbrad, if you really wanna die on that hill.
---
Rogue: A little more base hit. Rogues miss so fucking much?
---
Warrior: Heroic leap. I love me some heroic leap. 
---
Shaman: Ghost wolf works indoors and you can talk to NPCs.
---
Hunter: I'd love if more things were tameable (deer, worms, bugs  etc) and the other animal families were a bit better just to see more pet variety.
---
Paladin: Buffs last 30mins/1hr by default. I'd never play one otherwise.
---
the alliance mount option for exalted with Alterac Valley is a Stormpike Ram, this may be an easier option for you if you find that model acceptable.
---
Top 10 list of 5 items is next level.
---
Hell yes brother
---
Watch a few vids. They have to drink after they buff
---
Zzz.
---
You could melee between attacks in Vanilla. Don't know if you can do that on pservers though...
---
A couple of high level alliance can also turn the barrens into a completely unusable clusterfuck as well, and they have far easier access to crossroads. Let's not pretend horde ever attacked lakeshire more than alliance attacked crossroads.
---
I'd be wary of grabbing two gathering professions what need tracking. There is an addon that remembers resource node locations, but they don't actually know if the node is up unless tracking is enabled. So I'd avoid grabbing both herbalism and mining. Instead grab skinning and then either herbalism or mining.

Dungeons and raids, preferably
---
You have stoneform so relax. You can get out of that orc rogues blind
---
Or in the immortal words of Jamie Vardy “chat shit, get banged”
---
How reliable will you be? Can you raid 4 hours for 4 nights a week and grind the other 3? Do you have a general preference for tank/dps/heal?
---
I always tried to try save the critters from wolves. Poor rabbits!
---
Very untrue. Multiple entrances to the zone, multiple hubs, one hub with VERY strong guards. Completely different and in no way comparable to the ability of horse to shut down and camp people entering redridge. 
---
I really don’t care as an alliance player, I just skip that zone
---
I'd be interested in this. I was considering a druid/shaman only guild, but would also be interested in this - would certainly be easier.
---
No, there are far more unfair things in classic. Looking at you paladins. That being said, #nochanges.
---
I’ll be reliable. I’ve played every role and prefer healing over the others, and I’ve enjoyed a support style of play rather than just straight up throwing heals and not much more
---
I keep wanting to play OSRS at work, but always put it off. I need a clear goal to get me to start, I just haven't found it.
---
*heavy metal intensifies*
---
You can clear Naxx with almost any composition as long as you have capable warrior and druid tanks. Heck, you could even have a Paladin off-tank.
---
&gt;You're trying to tell me a level 19 twink is going to corpserun from STV zeppelin all the way to RR just to harrass some lowbies?
---
I can't tell you why lame people do what they do, but I *can* tell you that these people exist in droves on every single high pop vanilla server I've ever leveled ally on. I've never not gotten ganked in redridge at least once. Most of the time they'd stay around to corpsecamp too.
---
By comparison, I've only seen the Xroads get overrun once.
---
I've been trying to find/remember an old vanilla pvp movie for a while now, if anyonr can help. I'm fairly sure it was a warrior but the one thing i definitely remember was that it featured refused - new noise. That song was made for frag movies, i swear.
---
Found the rogue
---
iirc, Crossroads had low level guards like RR, but it was camped by alliance so much they buffed them. Also, not really multiple hubs. Camp Taurajo really only had like 6 quests, ratchet has maybe 20, half of which take you through XR (maybe not half), but most was through crossroads.
---
You just made me even more hyped for this gem of a game, damn you!
---
The demo was a $50 cash grab
---
On opening, you're not gonna really have any idea as to the future of any given realm. Honestly, if you have no information, I'd do a name lookup on each realm and do a traceroute and ping to each of the potential servers/realms and pick the one that has the least number of hops, or the shortest ping time (latency).
---
So... I play a little retail. The feature is there... but no one uses it. Current guild uses a discord. Every game I currently play has an in game chat system... NO ONE USES ANY OF THEM. So I don't think it'll matter if its in classic since you'll just have a discord anyway.
---
I put the list together in this thread.
---
Hope you find it useful.

Priest dps is terrible in dungeons. Constantly oom, things not living long enough to get value from SW:P, causes high threat and has no aoe. Pally autoattacking would be stronger, just let the priest heal.
---
Put together a group and you can always go visit. :)
---
Lol you want to use the official guide? Im dying lol. Hey bud blizzard never had horde bias in their guides and they sure as hell never released any inaccurate information about their game... lol i can't stop laughing
---
I leveled together with my girlfriend to 60 on Nostalrius and we had a blast. Was it as fast as solo leveling? Not quite. However, sharing that experience with someone and being able to do all group quests easily just made it that much more enjoyable. It was especially nice as a warrior since I could deal a shit ton of damage without fearing for my life constantly like I would be playing solo.
---
I did this last year. Got stuck in early server progression where there weren’t any Searing Gorge quests released yet, so I grinded the Slag Pit for like 4-5 levels. Pickpocketing lockboxes was nice as well.
---
25% wand damage bro its sooo much better than paladin
---
Well yeah, but it's a fun thought experiment. 90% of groups/guilds/plans/theorycrafting people are doing now will be thrown out the window when Classic releases, but at least it gives us something to do now.
---
They should pay some royalty for Nostalrius devs, tbh. They should treat it as releasing a game developed by Nostalrius. Because it WAS. If not for Nostalrius, there would be no Classic. Nostalrius devs are really the ones who did most of the work.
---
Probably not it, but this series is the only one I remember from vanilla with an Orc Lock
---
https://youtu.be/ucZ1TLwxFas

It sounds like warrior and MTing may well be a good choice. If you can turn up to every raid, ready to go and will indeed be reliable, then MT might be the role for you. Just know that as a prot warrior, grinding for mats will be a PITA. Maybe roll an alt.
---
I knew you couldn't resist. Just proving my point.
---
I played on pve because really the only thing I liked at end game was raiding. Sure I'd do battlegrounds with friends but the main goal was spending time with friends, not doing the BG. Raiding was always what I really loved about the game and I just didn't want the aspect of the game I dislike getting in the way of my farming for the part of the game I do like.
---
I’ll definitely try for that. Thanks!
---
Imo, based on your other comments below, I would suggest a  shaman. Shaman's can play a few different roles. Warriors are basically tanks in the early game. YES Fury warriors are insane, but with the lack of tanks last time around, groups were ROUGH to find as a warrior for much. I personally LOVE fury warriors, but as far as being of value in raids and groups, the war is pretty one dimensional. Shaman can heal, dps with 2 separate specs, and in general is more fun then the warrior.
---
Actually I have leveled a hunter from 1-42 only by grinding. 
---
As a teen i was very curious about how gold farmers level their chars, so I spent hours watching them. I concluded that grinding obviously must be faster, when they are doing it all the time. 
---
So i did it as well on a new char on a server where i knew nobody.
---
As far as I can tell you:
---
It sure is boring as hell, but you end up having a lot of gold by grinding and selling herbs. 
---
Buying the mount was no problam at all. I could also buy the newest gear and stuff. When I started this char the server was already very mature and TBC was right around the corner. The gold income is probably a different story on a new server. 
---
Another pro argument: You really dont have to worry about where your quests are and where to quest next. Just stay in a area where the mobs are your level.
---
Right and technically the patch they're rolling out for Classic is 1.13, which is 1.12 but with content releases based on the schedule they use.
---
You're either lying, or you've been in barrens literally once, ever.
---
Crossroads is camped so much Blizzard literally references it in their lore, just like SSvsTM.
---
There's no real way to explain it. If you get to lvl 35 on a pve server and are killing your 8th tiger trouble free in STV and realise you're bored as shit, that's when you know you should be playing on a PvP server.
---
If I have enough time to level two characters, shaman is definitely going to be one of them.
---
shamans are by fun the most fun healer imo, having played druids and priests (no pallies). Tanking tougher in 5 mans but really not fun in raids until end game. Dps is always fun, some classes definitely more than others.
---
Yeah its one of if not the best solo classes.
---
Probably will be thottbot, once they finally datamine that beta client.
---
That or they're 11
---
Buy mats on the cheap and afk-craft stuff to vendor for small profit
---
hunter is one of the strongest class in vanilla dont let you tell nonsense
---
Yea but a lot of people aren't interested in getting better at PvP, they're interested in stacking the odds in their favor and shitting all over people.
---
&gt;make retail wow better
---
No. And, by the way, you do not want to do that. You think you do, but you don't.
---
&gt;Wonder how Blizzard will handle items that changed with time.
---
I don't think they're going to do anything about it. No one's going to complain that MC/BWL is under tuned and overly easy. People might care that AQ is too easy, but by the time its out, anyone still playing isn't going away.
---
Some bosses are tuned to use a druid tank so being mt/ot mix in a tryhard guild is what's expected from 1 feral.
---
People who generally roll on PvE servers do so to avoid world pvp in the first place, and only flag themselves when grossly overgeared, in which case other people who are looking wpvp aren't really going to try and figh 5+ people in perfect gear on their terms.
---
So, World PvP "Does happen" but its has to be consensual and at that point its not really world pvp, but agreed upon glorified group duelin -- which in my opinion is so far removed from what people picture world pvp as so I stand by my statement of there is no world pvp in pve servers.
---
Wut? How do you ever get flagged without deliberately doing so on a PvE server? Isn't that the whole point of PvE, so that you aren't flagged unless you specifically attack someone?
---
Being a holy priest in a 5 man group with a druid. Druid buffs everyone with Mark of the Wild, and Thorns.
---
Click off Thorns, whisper druid: "If I get aggro, the last thing I want is for the mob to get even more annoyed when it hits me. The Mark of the Wild is welcome. Please don't give me Thorns again."
---
Pretty good summary of pvp servers :)
---
I go full fuck it mode when I finish a questing in an area. When I get the kill I just mount up and go back to town. No camping and a much smaller chance for retribution.
---
I’m talking about Ratchet
---
I know of that list, but it lists some items that are going to be practically impossible for me to get (like a drop with random stats from both ST and Strat) so I'm looking for alternative solutions.
---
The best thing about it was that it was so awkward that, depending on positioning, I would sometimes just not even bother DPSing. When you’re in healer form and you’re just missing or barely doing any white damage, the chance of getting hit could sometimes be worse than just hanging back and getting ready to pick up the healing game due to largely regening your mana.
---
This is me always, except I do both because I just grind NMZ while I'm working and/or reading Classic Wow Reddit
---
&gt;  often not stepping foot into contested territory until 28-30. 
---
That's total exaggeration though. You go to Stonetalon at 18 and to Ashenvale at 20 which are contested, and past that it's Hillsbrad/Thousand Needles which are contested too. 
---
It's true that the Horde has quests in the Barrens/Silverpine until level \~20, but it's just a couple level difference compared to Alliance zones. Westfall is contested but there's pretty much no Horde going there anyway, so the whole lowbie ganking thing seems to be a Redridge issue for the Alliance, with some retarded Horde greykillers running around there.
---
Hmm, this might be a pserver / vanilla disparity. Cause I'm not fucking lying, and I've leveled plenty of horde. Did you only play in vanilla?
---
You come off to me like you've never ever leveled through redridge, so we probably have a divergent experience somewhere.
---
Druid, Warlock, and Mage are really difficult to master in PvP/Solo play.  No class is really complex in PvE unless you powershift feral druid or something crazy.  Shaman is pretty hard too because of all the situational spells/totems.
---
Exactly, no only do deal next to zero actual dps in full healer gear and specc'd as such, you risk getting killed by cleaves or the boss itself by being in a more dangerous position. 
---
The druid class call is basically just turning off your ability to heal. However, as for raid impact its actually the least threatening because the number of druids per raid are usually quite limited and it gives you a good chunk of mana regen when it end.
---
I often see people make comments like "maybe classic will teach them something and they'll follow up with retail" but i Get the feeling the games will possibly just divide into two different target audiences, two different games.
---
Which, isn't even a bad thing. Blizzard is a corporation, they're gonna make money, of course. i just want them to not leave out a big chunk of us who loved the game before they warped it. Maybe this is how they do that.
---
Foreigners definitely accepted as long as you can understand my English.

We will likely be on a heavy populated server that has a lot of competition that brings most top skilled raiders.

This. I'm usually peaceful but if you try to fuck with me I will devote my remaining free time to making you miserable. Even if I can't flat out beat you in a 1v1, you'll suffer.
---
I knew you were baiting me, but I've recognized you are choosing to be an idiot and I've stopped trying to convince a lame horse to drink. I brought you to water and you refuse to drink... so dehydrate and die, idgaf
---
On my 60 druid I would always put Fearie fire on every rogue I saw in stv lol, make em feel unsafe for half a minute. You just know they were pissed but couldn't do anything about it
---
This is the reason I want to to roll on a PvE server, but there's no hardcore guilds recruiting so I'm stuck on a PvP server. That's also partially why I'm no-lifing it, so I can leave in peace and avoid 100% of the shithead horde who gank lowbies (since there will be no horde higher level than me)
---
No advantage to pvp server. Only drawbacks. Somehow everyone has been convinced it’s the best way to play. I have no idea how anyone thinks getting ganked is fun. Pvp belongs in battlegrounds only and you can do that on PVP servers.
---
I feel like thats how it works. Something gets super popular, inflates like crazy, pops and then whats left behind (and what returns) are the interest folk.
---
&gt;but it lists some items that are going to be practically impossible for me to get (like a drop with random stats from both ST and Strat) so I'm looking for alternative solutions.
---
Ok, that's all I've got unfortunantly, I hope you find what you're looking for.
---
I've played horde and alliance vanilla, and horde pserver vanilla.
---
retail, I went through RR twice (iirc) in vanilla on pvp server (paladin rogue), and crossroads probably 4 times vanilla pvp server (Hunter warrior rogue mage)
---
There were probably some throwaway toons I don't remember for each side that I never got to 60 (actually, I had an alliance warlock too, so that's three.)
---
You could have mentioned what class you're playing. There is a few lists done already for some classes.
---
You get 3 charges per Pummler - not one. Farming them isn't a big deal honestly, since you don't pop it for each boss
---
Yeah, I am stuck leveling a tank on the horde side, which I am inclined to go Druid as I can server other roles. I have to level one toon with my wife and then another when she gets bored or doesn't want to play.... So the struggle is real for me to pick right now.  
---
Leaning towards a shaman pretty heavily as I really enjoyed enhance back in the day.
---
Turtles usually give good loot that can be sold to vendor. 
---
Can farm them in 1k needles and in the lake in the Hillsbrad zone.
---
Maybe Show Cloak is unchecked
---
I'd kill for a toggle between old and new graphics, because I prefer the new one most of the time. One can dream :)
---
for me the Fights  looks ok even with 2 rogues.
---
Huh? I'm not intimately familiar with Nostalrius, but I thought the game ran on an old WoW build while Classic is almost being reverse-engineered to run on the retail build. What exactly did they contribute to Blizzard's version of the game other than proof that it's a viable, if somewhat niche market?
---
Have been there any official statements regarding what happens after when we get to the last stage?
---
Will it run for years?
---
Will they start a new server from the beginning like P.servers does after Naxx have been farmed?
---
I just used my last silver, if I had some I’d give this comment platinum holy shit that was good
---
Rip playing as C’Thun.
---
It's a joke you CHODE
---
Im almost set on female orc rogue or female human rogue (with black skin).
---
Or warrior
---
iirc, didn't guards attack whoever had the lowest rep in the steamwheedle cartel areas first? I definitely remember there was a way to make the guards attack the other person and 'help' you and you could take the time to split while they were chasing the dude you attacked.
---
I'm pretty sure they changed that later, but I'm not sure when, might have been BC?
---
But yeah, don't assume high levels would be deterred by high level gob guards, the high levels probably have more rep.
---
Granted, that might be a moot point, I doubt that is going to exist in Classic WoW since it's on the current engine and probably still has that changed.
---
Video is satire but in case y’all are curious let me save you 3 mins of the worst voice ever used to record a video:
---
Sentry cloak, level 19 agi/cloak, world drop
---
Feet of the Lynx, level 19 leather agi/star cloak, world drop
---
Shadowfang, level 19 1H sword, drops only in SFK trash
---
Staff of Jordan, level 35 epic caster staff, world drop
---
Pendulum of Doom, 4.00 speed 2H axe, drops from Uldaman trash
---
The Activision blizzard
---
But ion and lore know best right? Fuck the players right?
---
the thing I like a lot about them is how they attack in bg pvp
---
huge range and they dont care about spell pushbacks unlike other ranged classes
---
great pokers
---
I've been playing with my bro on a private server as a sham/war duo and it's been a lot of fun. Great for questing as well as dungeons.
---
Apart from casting them constantly, you have to look outto not leaving accidently a totem behind, where mobs are patrolling and ninja pulling.
---
This was incredibly entertaining. Thanks for that. You should save yourself this headache and just go for a PvE server.
---
This ain’t no rooty-tooty point and shooty.
---
This is planet of conflict creation.
---
Why is that? Easier to farm?
---
Greens likely can be ignored. But will everyone be ok with blues? Like from one side more dedicated people will progress quickly even with all nerfs to gear to resemble very early vanilla but many other guilds will struggle and more disparity will show up (which then may affect PvP rankings etc.). Also end game dungeons may loose on value when like those blue sets like cadaverous leather one will be in their pre-buff state. Some buffed blues aren't that much BiS but some are very good.
---
If MC/Ony could have a release date during first phase it could also be used to unlock some of that questionable gear too. Plus giving end-game elite quests and dungeons more time to shine.
---
Yeah they are definitely solid pvpers, The post above only really touches on PVE
---
Can confirm.

Priest, either Shadow or Healing depending on what my guild allows.

#tilted nothing to expect from an apple user
---
You’re pretty much forced to heal unless you play in a very casual guild that *might* let you play Enhance. Elemental is insanely good in PvP though
---
A couple of hours at most.
---
That's an offensive dispel, OP is asking for defensive dispels/dispelling debuffs from allies.
---
Missing the timing or animation for mechanics and wiping the raid tends to ruin the experience, too
---
Well if he is MT he is probably going to be helping others get their bis.
---
Mage:
---
Pretty easy rotation, free water and food. Also easy travel with teleports which is really saving you tens of minutes each time.
---
It is a pro and contra too, but you will get whispers asking for food/water and portals. You can make decent money just sitting in a city.
---
That Polymorph effect saved my mage from a ?? paladin in Stranglethorn Vale's elite murloc reef. He came up just in time for me to sheep him again after his Divine Shield wore off, I felt guilty.
---
I know, just sharing memories from a long spread of time
---
Nah it’s cause paladins have cooler animations so farming for ur mount is less boring
---
Holy Pala looking to duo up with a class like Warrior who would do well with a healer friend. I won't have any friends coming over to classic so I will be lone and I would like to help out a Warr, as I have heard leveling is rough for them. Ultimately looking to make a friend! I'm a 32 year old (won't hit on you if girl or guy, have wife) dude, if that helps.

not even going to respond? just downvote and move on? I gave you more info than you'll ever find elsewhere and no response. pearls before swine smh
---
It's gonna be you walking around with pvp tag on, anyone can start attacking you if they want, but you can't decide when to start the fight. Basically they will fight you if they are cool guys or think they win. Most likely it'll be the latter.
---
If you dont plan to play W3 you can still see videos about the lore it presents. If you plan to role horde the Foundation of Orgrimmar campaing is awesome.
---
Does anyone know if you need level 60 to buy the unarmored mount? Assuming they implement it, if I were level 50 and I knew they were going to remove them with the next phase, could I just buy one if I had the gold but not the skill, and just hold onto it until I'm 60?
---
I mean I've only ever played pvp vanilla servers. So I find it like breathing. This is the game I love.
---
i remember the good times where I had /spit bound, right next to my cremating torch and gin-ji knife set
---
I am not sure why so many on here think there is no pvp on pve servers.  
---
Most people I know flagged regularly for some back and forth combat and the majority of the server did the same. The MAIN reason people play on pve is due to ranking and pointless ganking of people who have 0 chance of competing. That is a garbage playstyle IMO. Yes, I know there is a huge population on here that loves that, but to me and my friends, that mechanic is just dumb. We enjoy the actual fighting. The back and forth of combat. We do not take pleasure in killing some helpless lowby who is just trying to level up.  
---
Pvp objectives would REALLY help with this stigma, but WoW released those WAY too late for anyone to care about them, and it looks like they will follow that. Unfortunate in my mind, but there is plenty of pvp on pve servers if you are in the right areas.  
---
Also, many many many people would follow you around and try to get near something you were targeting to kill. If you hit an aoe or any form of cleave ability and hit the person, you would get flagged. I saw someone ask how you could possible flag for pvp accidentally. That is how.
---
PVE is a much more relaxed environment and play style to me. I played on a pvp server last time around and it was chaos. Some nights we just logged off as we were getting camped by higher level people and it got really frustrating. So, if you enjoy always being on the edge of your seat wondering when the next fight or gank is coming, then pvp is much much better suited for you. If you like just grinding away and engaging in pvp when you are feeling edgy, then PVE is the way to go.
---
Just because they can do something doesn’t mean it’s not going to affect how people see them doesn’t seem to register. Love how they always get salty when you call them a piece of shit for doing it too.
---
So the quality of those talents is going to depend on how often you actually cast DL, and that will depend on your overall spec. Deep destro with conflag? Who cares, you'd rather be spamming Searing Pain than draining life. What about Soul Link? That 30% damage reduction means you're getting more value out of every point of HP gained, so drain life becomes better. Are you specced Nightfall? Drain life gets better again. Did you go deep enough in Afflicition for Siphon Life? Then stacking life gain can benefit you if you're going for a slower dotty style.
---
The second thing to consider is your gear and what phase of the game you are in. There are a lot of high quality talents at the bottom of the Aff tree. Instacast corruption is almost considered mandatory, so there go 5 points. Suppression gives you spell hit, easily the most important caster stat in the game. Imp Drain Soul is a staple for leveling, but pretty mediocre if you're not wearing spirit gear while out farming. Imp Lifetap isn't as important as it once was thanks to Life Tap now scaling with spell damage in 1.12, but still a decent talent. So as you get more spell hit, you free up points from supression. As you get overall better gear, you free up points from Imp Drain Soul since you can grind just as effectively without it. Even Imp  LT becomes somewhat optional as it scales up with gear.
---
Further up the tree, Fel Concentration is competing with Imp CoA, which is a very under appreciated talent IMO. This one scales up excellently with gear. However if you're going deep Aff, you become more likely to lean on CoEx. Also with Fel concentration, it depends on your play style. If you restrict your use of Drain Soul to when a target is feared or attacking another player, then Fel Concentration is pointless. If however you're more of a duelist where you'll spend a non-trivial portion of the fight face tanking the enemy, Fel Concentration is great.
---
So yeah...it's complicated.
---
For real? just selling greys?
---
Paladins got a free level 40 mount, as well as Warlocks.
---
You don't need to use those to tank as a feral druid...
---
They do generate more threat than other weapons but it's not a necessity.
---
If you plan to play a feral druid for PvE you'll have to find a spot as an offtank. They're best suited as the 3rd tank. Honestly it's about as hard to find a spot in a raid as a feral druid than as a warrior tank. Most guilds already have their MT and offtank usually and will look to fill the other tank spots with fury warriors or a feral.
---
As far as dungeons goes, the tank is always the hardest role to fill and bear tanks are as good as warriors in 5 mans so you'll have an easy time running dungeons.
---
And if you ever get bored of tanking you can always swap to resto. Resto druids have the easiest time to find a spot in raids as it's always the least played class and you always need at least 2 of them per raid.
---
I'll finish by saying that honestly feral druid tanking is pretty boring compared to warrior so I wouldn't recommend rolling one but if you do you'll be just fine.
---
Source : Played both resto and feral as well as warrior in endgame vanilla.

Check this video out, it's a handful but it's well put together and might help you decide which faction you like more from a non-gameplay perspective.

---
If classic does well it will show the gaming industry the type of MMO players are actually looking for. So if Blizzard doesn't learn from it hopefully another company will.
---
What's good to farm from these guys?
---
I use to enjoy Lore with his old YouTube videos he did. Tank spot and junk like that. But man has that guy turned a 180 since getting hired in there.
---
When Blizzard first announced that "You think you do but you don't" guy as CEO of the company I had a suspension that blizzard would do everything they could in the background to make Classic fail. Now I am sure that Classic will be the only thing that keeps them alive.
---
I think this explains it well, some of us are altoholics or quest/item hunters and may be better off on a PvE server. 
---
Some of us may just be looking for a bit of excitement, more actions per minute type of gameplay they might fair better on a PvP , and both of these players want to do it in a fantasy world. WoW.

Thanks for stealing my post, glad you found it so funny :)

No one seems to have suggested it yet, but the first two WoW chronicles would bring you up to date on the history of Azeroth and Draenor, along with the First and Second Wars. The third chronicle also covers WC3 and TFT, but also the WoW expansions up to Cataclysm (if I remember rightly?), so you may want to just read up to Classic, or just read the entirety of it.
---
Alright man, I only have this for healing priests but it's still solid so check it out. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l2o5WhYf18AsprwRoLYvuaSP96Y2xxJE743xXyenfHk/htmlview#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l2o5WhYf18AsprwRoLYvuaSP96Y2xxJE743xXyenfHk/htmlview#)
---
it's for before the AQ gates open so you can use this until phase 5. And by then i'm sure you have figured the rest out by yourself. Good luck.
---
You think I’m gonna scroll down 34 days and “steal” a post?
---
First I never downvoted you, and I'm not trying to attack you with this but I have no idea how accurate your simulator is, it looks good and if its accurate then I retract my previous statement about hamstring spamming being better. I don't know much about how your simulator was programmed or how accurate the values you put in are or where the values came from, I have heard different things from what I would consider reliable sources, so its hard for me to say anything about it because I know very little about programming.
---
Haha, yes I was thinking the same thing. Boomers are the least represented generation in gaming and were the least represented generation when classic launched, but of course this guy thinks Blizzard is desperate for that sweet, sweet, fixed retirement income. 
---
Give me a break OP. You don't matter here. Just enjoy the game and try not to fuck anything else up before you die.
---
Hmm. I don't know then. I feel like my position is very obviously true, but you obviously don't agree.
---
Me and two friends 3-manned every dungeon up to, and including ST. Hunters pet was main tank. It worked but we had to be really careful with CC and kill order. I wouldn’t join a random pug with a pet as tank.
---
No official statement yet, only speculations. And maybe Blizzard doesn't have any concrete plans yet and want to see for themself how things turn out, and how the community feels in a couple of years.
---
I disagree and allow me to give insight on why you're getting downvoted - because twinking is largely competitive and widely agreed upon, amongst twinks, that 1 shotting noobs is not competitive. 
---
Most twinks actively engage on other twinks in bgs to prove who is superior and in those brackets because everything is toned down, there is a high skill ceiling for dancing, terrain exploits/advantages and rightly timed consumes
---
Especially in 10-19 bracket where only a handful of people leveling will stop in for one or two wsg queues, the bracket is home to competitive pvpers for both factions. Regardless of anyones opinion if lvl 19 is "skilled pvp" or not, the twink community agrees it is, and that's why it exists. 
---
An asshole is an asshole and can be an asshole anywhere in WoW. Generally these players if they choose to make a twink are gonna be farmed and mocked for their inexperience and ill intent
---
Remember you can't use potions in bear form. So there are less consumables anyway, with or without the pummeler farming.
---
&gt;	Westfall is contested
---
I can see why one might think so given its story, but Westfall is an Alliance zone, not contested. If you encounter flagged lowbies there it’s because they were noobs and whacked flagged Horde that was passing through.
---
i want farm alone i dont tell you where i make hundreds of Gold.
---
Priest/lock means heavy gear competition. Hunter offers what you want from lock (sustained ranged dps + pet tank) while removing this drawback.
---
Friend and I are doing rogue + shaman. Rogue can kinda suck to level just because you take a lot of damage when killing even one mob, shaman can tank and/or heal while rogue maxes damage. Add in WF/GoA + SoE and baby you got a stew going.
---
If our third commits he’s likely going to tank in some capacity so that we can do dungeons easily as we level.
---
Alliance can obtain it at level 20.
---
For Raiding, i'd say Prot Paladin or how they are called in classic, "Tankadin".
---
I can only think of myself playing it, and it wasn't easy at all in the beginning. But when i got used to it, after Grinding alot of ZG, AQ20 and high level dungeons i managed it really well and even started tanking in 40-man raids. The furthest i got was AQ40, i didn't get to tank Naxxramas because i quit.
---
I don't want to say Warrior Tanks and Druid Tanks are easy to play, but they are definitely easier then paladin tanks.

Changuk Smasher for one. Lots of greens too. Couple chest spawns. Not sure if there is something specific people are going for though.
---
This is why I don't bother to post more than "wrong".
---
I have the data and I put many hours of effort into making sure that my simulations and results are accurate. And at the end of it all when I post it to someone they say "well I heard different from someone else"
---
You have nothing to back up your claim and no response to what I posted. I spent 20 minutes re running the simulations and taking the screenshots and posting them here and we can't have a discussion about it because you don't know shit, you're just regurgitating what someone else told you.

It's a fucking waste of time, so thanks for this experiment, and from now on I'll just continue to post "wrong"

Ahh yes, the wonderful aftermath of a chain lightning slowly bouncing through 40 people.
---
Considering I made this meme on my phone....I guess you did.
---
There are specific servers where it's physically impossible to kill someone unless they allow you to do it. Perhaps people who are so against getting ganked by higher level people should play on those...
---
Problem for me is I can only play osrs hard for about a month. Then I take a year break.
---
Haha you made it? Okay buddy, did you make that notre dam meme that you recently posted too?
---
Naw, most of vanilla was Gen X (1960s to 1980s) and millenials (1980s - late 1990s). Boomers (1946 - 1955) were barely computer literate when vanilla  launched in 2004. The youngest of the boomers was already pushing 50.
---
At least in pre-raid/Tier 1 gear, feral tanks have equal survivability with warriors, and even without the pummelers their threat is better. So just because going full pummeler is mostly for farm raids doesn't prevent them from being a great choice for the main offtank.
---
its also incomplete/wrong.
---
I play WoW so slay dragons, not be unwilling entertainment for an autistic 15 year old.
---
I think PvE server is what you’re thinking of
---
Buddy im sure you can find something yknow its not a biblical text. Some guilds will raid early morning and some will raid late night.
---
Does this factor in progressive/evolving itemization (which won’t be in classic?).
---
Nah, it couldn't be that simple, or this guy wouldn't be so worked up about it. There's gotta be something more difficult about not getting killed by higher level people than simply choosing a more peaceful style of server...
---
Join a guild that raids either when you’ve finished work or on your days off
---
You get flagged by going into certain areas of contested zones. 
---
Guards in towns are also flagged, and will attack you if they are of the opposite faction. Once you get flagged, you tend to stay flagged unless no one attacks you for five minutes. Being hit or attacking the opposing faction NPCs or players, or going into these areas in the contested zones, resets the timer.
---
Many people seem to have forgotten this. From [Wowwiki](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/PvP_flag):
---
You attack an NPC marked by a PvP flag, like most quest givers, guards, and vendors. This usually applies to NPCs of the opposite faction, but also to neutral factions if you are at war with them, and in rare cases, your own faction. Certain quests require you to kill these type of NPCs. You may also be flagged without attacking aforementioned NPCs, but instead they striking you, this is considered to largely be a bug that has existed throughout the history of the game, be wary about getting attacked by guards.
---
You are in proximity to certain NPCs marked by a PvP flag. These NPCs are often found near settlements of an opposing faction, such as Goldshire and Razor Hill.
---
You accept some of the PvP quests. You will remain flagged as long as that quest is in your quest log.
---
You enter a specific territory. The scheme for flagging by zoning-in is shown in the table bellow:
---
Hey man, you are the one lying on this subreddit, I am just calling you out on it.

this one is the best for priests.
---
It's just a game lol. Don't take it so personally. I gank low lvls all the time because it's hilarious.
---
True that, I was not focusing on Tauren. I just put them also in.
---
Afaik this was never super clear. Private servers have it at 18-21 IIRC. A lot of people believe it was supposed to be a few levels later but some other info showed that it could be obtained pre 20 (from the 10-19 twinking scene because it was super bis for wand classes).
---
Well, sure, it's very likely those people have some sort of personality disorder. They gain nothing out of other than the knowledge that they're making someone else's time worse. But it is part of the game so it's either that or a pve server... and who wants that
---
"I don't like someone, I hope they suffer" You guys need to do some self reflection, maybe experience some personal growth. I genuinely hope none of you are adults with this little self awareness.
---
Killing lowbies is making the game healthier. Bonus points if you can get them mid mob fight and have the mob deal the killing blow so they get repair bills. Hunters with Viper Sting vs casters is the best for this. Find some lowbie mages AoE grinding, drain all their mana, lols.
---
Stop karma baiting
---
Oh get over yourself. 
---
Calling people filth because they gank people is ridiculous. Doing this isn't gameplay killing and immersion breaking. It causes the community getting ganked to ask for help and get other high level players to come help defend the area which in return causes more fun pvp battles.
---
If you don't like it, go on a PvE server and it won't happen to you. /s
---
Barrens chat is only bad for snowflakes and cucklords. Everything is offensive these days.
---
I appreciate your honesty
---
yeet

crYYY
---
Yeah you're the only one. PVP is PVP and there are no unspoken rules. The level 51 is dead meat, but better not touch that level 49.
---
I plan on playing a priest on classic. I've healed some during my wow years but only as shaman and monk.
---
Should I practice some priest healing on retail to get me familiar with healing as a priest? Would you guys recommend it?
---
My first char was a mage named Wizard, not gonna happen again since in the meantime I grew some taste of my own
---
Like everyone said, you don't spend most of your time in the faction specific zones or cities.  However, to get to level 20-25 is going to take around 20-30 hours of playing.  That's a long time playing in those zones.  If your initial experience is poor, you're setting yourself up to not like the game.
---
Go for the faction which aesthetic you like the most.  You'll be spending most of the city time in Orgrimmar (mostly) and Undercity for Horde or Ironforge and Stormwind for Alliance.  The background behind the races for both sides is really interesting.  We kind of just ignore the Alliance usually because they're more human characters, but they've had a lot of difficulty in the past too.
---
Ganking people who are totally outleveled is the lowest form of PvP. It's like the playground bully would would get his ass kicked if he picked on someone his own size. Lmao
---
&gt;12 hour shifts 4-5 days a week alternating between day/nights
---
What kind of hell did you get yourself into rofl
---
You pretty much are mandated to go to all of the zones while leveling, even in the 10-25 bracket.  I always fill in the 10-20 by doing both Barrens and most of Silverpine.
---
Depends, improved stealth actually does a lot.
---
Thats a very diverse group, many options there. I would say you should ask what they each want to play in terms of roles first. The grind to 60 is very long any many pre raid BiS items are from quest rewards and leveling dungeons, so they should play what they intend to main if possible. 
---
If lets say the druid is itching to be a caster dps let him. One of balance druids biggest weaknesses are their mana pools. Having a mage to supply water constantly can off set this. Balance brings on demand hibernates for dragons and beast, roots for melee, off heals, faerie fire etc.. 
---
If you priest wants to go shadow let him, paladins and druids are both great healers. If the warrior wants to tank let him, the two hybrids have options to cover.
---
Play what is fun.
---
I’m considering playing a Warlock so I can sic Infernals of lowbies of my own faction as well.
---
They say to do gnomes first so that you can make your own sapper charges.
---
&gt; I'll happily insult him
---
It sounds like you're the real issue.
---
Do people forget this game is called WARcraft?  Nr 3months guys jeez.
---
Its people who never grew up past 16 and have nothing good in their lives apart from WoW.
---
Pretty sad.
---
Kruul attacked Manor cities during the dark portal opening event at the end of Vanilla.
---
Warrior is the most complicated?
---
Tankadin is way more complicated and harder if u seriously want to be able to tank in raids and be efficient. With that i also mean 40-man raids. Bit as MT obviously, but as anything else.
---
I will never get how people make a statement like that even though they might've never touched a Prot Paladin. Maybe because they didn't play on private Servers and with that, they don't know about specs that weren't viable back in the days but now are because people found out how to play them. This goes for Feral Druid DPS too for example.

Not quiet sure as I don't main priest but looking at that list it seems to be correct. Now if 2 items are similar you can just look the 1.12 stats up urself and just choose the better item. Lists like these are never 100% as people sometimes prefer different stats for different specs/situations. It's made to give you a general understanding.
---
As a self-proclaimed professional gank artist I would like to personally thank you for the interesting read, but sadly now I must wipe my ass and get back to work.
---
Beyond wpvp, the only advantage I can think of is items on the AH likely have a higher value.
---
Warriors suck for leveling.  They are super gear dependent and have no cool abilities, but are top DPS and tanks.  The no cool abilities really gets me though.
---
The paladin police force will love it lmao
---
- NA Region (west coast)
---
-PvP server ideally, PvE or RP-PvP are okay if the guild seems to suit me
---
- Plan on going alliance, but again a great guild horde side would sway that decision.
---
-Play times during the week will be from around 4pm-10pm pst (7pm-1am est) and potentially all day on the weekends.
---
-Definitely am PvE focused, although organized BGs can be fun as well. Depending on how life goes down the road, I'd like to get myself to rank 13 eventually.
---
-I'll be playing as a feral druid this time, assuming the MCP doesnt get nerfed, maybe even if it does. :)
---
-I plan to take some time off around launch, as I fortunately work for myself, I'd like to get to 60 within the first couple weeks, and be working on my pre-raid gear after that. Hoping to find a guild with like-minded people.
---
As far as any experience goes...
---
-Most recently leveled a rogue to 60 on a pserver in just under 10 played days. Big chunks of that were spent afk, smoke breaks, etc. I wasn't trying any sort of speed run, so I think I can bring that down to 7-8 days played realistically.
---
-Originally had a 60 NE warrior that I raided vanilla with, tanking most everything up to the princes in AQ40. I'm familiar with the majority of classic content, but 10+ years can play with your memory haha.
---
I guess that got kinda long, but jeeze the hype for classic wow is hard to keep down! Would love to find a great guild to play with from day 1 right through!
---
i'm a puss i usually skip northern stv for this reason. Lose too much time. Although it's fun if you have a buddy or two leveling w/ you
---
I realize that, but my days off change week to week which means I'll miss a few raids a month no matter what. I guess I just need to join a casual guild that will tolerate a 75% attendance (at best).
---
People do model swapping on retail with custom client. I know people are working a similar custom client to change models in classic. I know people the files to swap from like you said UD -&gt; human or to belf / draenei.
---
On retail you can be banned, however since it's client side and there's no reported ban since 2017 or so.
---
I'd say most people here that have played on a vanilla pvp server are already acustom to the concept of being ganked. It's part of being on a pvp server.
---
There will be PVE servers, just play on one of those if you take this much offense to being ganked.
---
High levels won’t be able to attack lowbies and get the guards assistance, 1000000% it will not work that way, it would be a shit show. High levels can not fight goblin guards either. Maybe t2/t3 pallies or mages can get away, but still very likely to die quickly
---
(I think they mean "Boomer" in the memesense of late 20s, early 30 year olds)
---
Night elf would be better suited for PVE in my opinion and dwarf more for pvp. Although you could argue dwarves are better in PVE as well taking into account their increase to guns.  But it’s personal preference. I’d roll dwarf just because I focus more on pvp than hardcore raiding so dwarf would benefit me more
---
It sounds like Lazypig.  I use lazypig in vanilla and will use it if a version comes out for classic.  I've done the content 100 times I don't need to read about how some dude needs to kill raptors for hooves again.
---
Things that are better than Titanforging:
---
Wet socks
---
Getting autism from vaccines (/s) 
---
Not playing
---
Got the shoulders through pure luck while leveling a Druid. They're sneaky good even if you don't get an "of Stamina" affix. You can't get shoulders with more armor until Rank 10 gear. I didn't know you could solo farm them so I'll definitely be getting a pair when classic drops.
---
I played a rogue myself and can definitely tell you..
---
..i thought i couldn't get more bored but when i saw how many buttons mages have to spam, i was happy again to play a rogue. But they are not hard at all.
---
My Favoriten rogue spec will always be the hemo-rogue. Sadly, it's only first time useful as soon as u get a servo arm for ur mainhand and AQ40 trash mace (+4 mace skill or something) for ur offhand. Ideally u play a human for extra +5 mace skill, and not only ur damage will go NUCLEAR but also u support ur meeles a ton.
---
Region: EU
---
Realm: PVE
---
Raid Times: 8:30 pm or later, would be available for 3-4 nights for raid nights.
---
Priority/Class: would like to do raiding as early as I get ready for it, 95% chance of prot. troll warrior.
---
Rules: Semi hardcore guild looking to down bosses, not have endless night wiped on childish mistakes.
---
Feel free to PM for more info.
---
I'm a really chilled guy that played a bit of classic, but was in one of top guilds on server for TBH/WOTLK.
---
If you have to miss some then I doubt you will get kicked or anything just do the raids that you can, you might gear up slower than the rest but once everyone that plays your class is geared all gear will go to you, so if you’re casual I’d probably recommend playing a hunter, warlock (if alliance) or a resto Druid, less people to gear up, the quicker all the gear will funnel to you, I’d say those 3 classes never have more than a few per raid group so they’re safe to play, I’d stay away from rogue and mage though
---
That shadowmeld is like a second feign death. Definitely go Nelf for PvP.
---
It’s pretty easy to be aweful at rogues compared to many other classes, imo. At least from personal expetience with other rogues.
---
I’ve never experienced wands to be hard to get. But if they are, wouldn’t it be better to just get enchanting at lvl 5 and make the wand? Leveling without wand is a nightmare. I also put imp wand before spirit tap.
---
Have you thought of playing EU servers (guessing you're American) that fit closer to your schedule? One of my old WoW buddies lived in England and played on US Central servers because it worked better with his schedule.
---
Also, don't join a hardcore raiding guild? Find a guild that only raids on Fridays or Saturdays?
---
As for your personal life, what the f' kind of job do you have? That sounds like an extremely unhealthy working schedule. I don't know how specialized this job is, but I would leave that sucker in a heart beat.
---
Ah I see what you're saying. Yes if you run into an enemy town and start attacking their npcs you get flagged. Also there is a bug apparently that means sometimes just being attacked by these guards causing you to get flagged. If you're in a level appropriate zone it's very rare this would happen except on purpose, there's no reason to go near an enemy town 90% of the time.    
---
   
---
Also yes it is possible there are normal npc's to kill that are pvp/faction flagged, but these are very very rare. You're literally talking maybe 3 - 4 of these quests in your entire levelling experience depending on your route. Also if you run into an aerna (lol) you will get flagged, no shit.  
---
So yes, in your 200 hours of levelling you may unintentionally get flagged 4-5 times leaving you flagged for somewhere around 20-30 minutes total for your levelling time. So pretty much the same thing as just levelling on a PvP server, yup same diff.
---
Here's what you can do: Help them. If I was leveling and a horde actually helped me kill a mob I just didn't have it in me to gank them.
---
In classic shadowmelds only usable outside of combat. So it was mostly used then for setting up traps in high traffic areas and wait for an ambush or just for safety when you afk. But it serves no purpose during combat.
---
Yeah I guess the risk of bots is higher on a pve server since they can't be killed off.
---
The handful of optional alliance mobs *in no way* come even close to compensating for the entire zone of RR being auto-flag.
---
Hi, /u/boolean87
---
this is a really bad idea... if you find the rogue that doesnt want to gank you and will leave you alone as soon as you kill him he will camp you for hours
---
Hey man. I don't know if you've heard of it, but there is a new feature in retail WoW called "Warmode", it effectively removed PVP servers and ganking.
---
You should try retail if you haven't, it's catered and shaped by people just like you who made posts in objection to the way WoW originally worked. If you'd like to see how that alternate path unfolded, just check out battle for azeroth! 
---
I hope you like it man! I on the other hand am longing for an experience that is a little more rough on the edges. Maybe people like you that still haven't gotten over ganking in vanilla in 2019 shouldn't play, this game belongs to the #nochanges crowd and that ESPECIALLY includes ganking, get ready for all the angwe wannabes because they will be out in full force.
---
For PVE it doesn't matter. For PvP it's situational, dwarf for 1v1s and nelf for BGs.
---
You can't meld in combat how is it like a second feign death
---
you sound salty bro  
---
*saps*
---
Ranged attacks don't glance so the skill bonus isn't very valuable.
---
One reason I can't wait for classic is because pservers have a selection bias towards toxic bitchy assholes.
---
There are a lot of people out there who believe the Nostalrius team provided blizzard with everything they need and they just needed to plug in the source code.
---
This is clearly false as like you said, they are reverse engineering the game for accuracy. That's where this attitude comes from though.
---
I want to add that the efforts of the Nost team was a key factor of the original meeting that happened with Blizz. That portion can't be overlooked.
---
1. On what private Server did u play?
---
2. Our Feral Druid managed to beat rogues in DPS. Were the rogues bad? no. The Feral Druid was just awesome and BiS Pre Naxx Gear. My question here is, did u manage to be at the top of the DMG too?
---
Never heard that interpretation of boomer. Mid/late 20s is millenial gen.
---
Why is he lying? He's not saying he made it himself. Probably saw it somewhere on the internet and deemed repost worthy as its a very funny meme and I chuckled.
---
Well it takes 1 weekend to get exalted and classic is forever. Besides AV reward is better and you should not get the nef reward before all physical dps gets theirs, so its a really long time.
---
&gt;Sindrex#4881
---
I added you on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) for further discussion :)
---
Shadowmeld can’t be used in combat, the only thing it’s actually useful for is going afk or canceling spells cast on you in pvp, while out of combat.
---
Ok, when he provides the link of where he found it, I will stop accusing him of stealing.
---
Yeah that’s a very good point I forgot about. It’s safe to say dwarves are the superior choice for hunter if your looking to min/max just because their racial is pretty strong in pvp. Pretty well let’s you shut down rogues poisons and hinder what a priest/warlock can dot you with.  Night elves don’t really bring anything else to the table besides aesthetics which I prefer to the dwarves. But that dwarven racial is to good to pass up for pvp
---
Barrows gloves? They are BIS, if youve done that then go for a Jad kill for fire cape.
---
Two different games entirely. Leveling will take you long enough that you'll know your class pretty well when you hit 60.
---
Fel concentration is totally worth it, imp DL is not bad but tricky to fit into a build. Generally you'd be giving up points in Suppression, Imp Life Tap, or Curse of Exhaustion.
---
It’s common for nurses or firemen along with other industries.
---
Third party checking in: 
---
He never gave me the impression that he made it. I believe most people assume that any meme is a repost unless OP states otherwise. 
---
Also nice job on this one. 'tis funny.
---
I'm working 14 hour days including commute for 2 days, 2 nights then 4 days off and I've succumbed to the fact that I'm not going to be able to commit to a regular schedule. I will be trying to find a half decent guild and prove myself in the raids that I can attend so that they will be willing to accept my poor attendance.
---
On a private server I played on there was a Hunter who leveled to 60 by only grinding mobs, said he was just watching Netflix on the side. I think he only killed beast type mobs because of skinning.
---
I can't remember how long it took him (his /played wasn't that long when I asked, something like 5 days) but he did make a crap ton of gold while leveling. He said he bought his epic mount right as he dinged and still had several hundred gold left over.
---
Everything except rogue.
---
Stun, damage, reset, win.
---
Makes sense, they are very different games. Thanks for the tip.
---
Especially in battlegrounds. Every moment a rogue is forced out of stealth is a moment he isn’t hunting healers and FCs or trying to ninja flags.
---
Because of this, back in Vanilla my shadow priest made a point of keeping all rogues in casting range dotted to hell and back.
---
You might want to get the flight-path in Silverpine Forest before you leave for Barrens, but besides that, no.
---
Not to shit goal posts, but even if he did steal, I'm thankful as I dont religiously scan classicWoW every day, so seeing funny af memes being reposted I dont really mind if it means I get to seem them too.
---
That glorious feeling when my KOS add-on popped on my rogue back in the day. I knew I was about to have 30 minutes of fun.
---
In a good raid setting it isn't always the case, but it is the case in basically every dungeon you'll ever run.
---
I don't think I'm a high enough level for that let. I was gonna do skill training to make GP, I think I left off with high woodcutting.
---
From my experience playing flagged on a PVE server, the opposing faction will only attempt to kill you if there's more than one of them and you're engaged with a mob. Unless they play a lot of battlegrounds, there's also a good chance they're not very good at it either simply because some skills aren't hot-keyed. 
---
Full scale raids are common on both server types.
---
True, I had playable fps as well (like 40ish in raids), but alot of the ppl in my guild struggeled with it on certain fights.
---
*Exits Booty Bay* 
---
*Sounds of stealth'd rogues*
---
[Ain't war hell...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40JmEj0_aVM)
---
Normally I skip until I have my lv 40 mount. But for Classic I'm going to go slower, and keep my engineering leveled along with me, so I can grenade all these alliance bastards in world PVP while leveling.
---
\*sip\* yep, vanilla was a good game
---
Exactly the same reason I'm rolling alliance this time.
---
dude, there will always be trash ppl who thinks killing someone defenceless makes them a king. Dont get angry at these ppl, pity them and move on.
---
Everything beside Powershifting druid is easy pve wise. PvP, every class can become quite complex and enjoyable.
---
Man, I’m impressed by your skill. I’ve played a lot of priest pvp and I must say you really know your shit. Thanks for making this vid, very inspiring.
---
If you gonna make a pvp guide like you mentioned in another comment, I would love to see a “how to encounter a [insert class here]” kind of guide.
---
Have you even understood what I wrote ? I will gank all the time. But people who can actually defend themselves. Going to an low level zone to oneshot people is BS.
---
If he was camping people in stv they probably couldn't reliably hit him with spells.
---
One stack of copper for 10g, I'm sure someone can afford this.
---
Some things will LOS a dwarf that won't LOS a Night Elf.
---
Plus I hate the Vanilla gun sound.
---
If you consider getting ganked in wow to be suffering, you have so little awereness of the world that i'd rather ask a dolphin for their opinion before yours
---
Just remember, there is no honour among thieves.
---
The only advantage is that when you're stronger than the other faction, you can kill them.
---
This gives me no satisfaction, so I generally roll PvE servers if I have a choice.
---
No. You do not understand. Every time a guard hits you, you get flagged for 5 minutes. This is not a bug, this always happens. This is also how it works right now on retail and how it has always worked in the last 15 years of WOW.
---
Potato tomato
---
No I don't think they are cancer. I think they enhance the game and make it better. They willingly step into the role of villain. I enjoy hating them. I enjoy feeling better then them. It wouldn't be wow without the gankers. It's simply a must.
---

it explains +5 weapon skill cuts GB penalty in half and +10 would lower it to 0% penalty. Also explains how glancing blows can potentially cap your crit% of your white crits.

# [A] Seven Sins Late Night Guild EU
---
Seven Sins is here for all the nostalgic nerds out there that wanna play Classic and cannot do so the normal raiding hours. Started by a small grp of irl friends to see if there is interest for late night raiding. After some posts here and there seems people are interested to play at these hours so here we are starting the project.
---
***General info***
---
* We want to make a **semi-hardcore PVE** guild that will raid 2 times per week(3 on progress) and rest nights run dungeons,world PVP and all the good classic stuff.
---
* If you dont wanna go hard on launch and just wanna chill out but night is your time of the day you can play you can still join the guild as a social and play with more people at night!
---
Raiding info
---
* We aim to clear all content available at the highest pace as we can for a late night guild.
---
* We will have role officers/Raid leader and at the moment all positions are free for anyone up to the challenge.
---
* We will have application forms as we get closer to the launch and we have a good amount of people.
---
* We plan to raid around 23.30 (Server time) probably Wed/Sun(Thursday or Monday on progression). Exact hour and days will be discussed later on.
---
* We will either use DKP or loot council.
---
* Raiders should have 100% attendance especially when we raid 2 days only and be ready with consumables, enchanted gear.
---
* We will be a fun late night community but on raid times we expect everyone to be serious and focused so we are done with raids in 2 days max and have some world fun the rest of the days.
---
* People should be able to take criticism and have full knowledge of their class.
---
So if you looking for late night raiding,late night pvp or just to chat with someone late night Seven Sins is the guild you looking for.
---
For more info add me on Discord **KingMavros#2601**
---
or join [**https://discord.gg/3wj8duk**](https://discord.gg/3wj8duk)
---
One thing is that your race could use your mounts by default, but would need to be exalted with the other races.  So a Human could use the nighstabers, rams, or horses, but would need to be exalted with Darnassus or with Ironforge to use Nighstabers and Rams (respectively).
---
If you get nightfall and are placed luckily into one of the raidspots, you might be able to be an enhance nightfall procc'er. Other than that, if I were you, I'd join a raid as heals, get to know them, and once you get to the point where your guild is just farming content, you might be able to convince them to let you roll elemental. Rolling as a healer, you could probably rack up a bit of unwanted mail/leather casting items for a decent elemental set to PvP/casually PvE farm with.
---
First, look up a video and find out which classes she is willing to play, then pick your class and race based on that.  If she wants to go rogue, or just be a night elf in general, then druid sounds good.  For server type, I'd consider PvE since she has never played, or just leave it up to her and see what happens.  As for life balance and waiting to see if she enjoys the game, both of you can make alts and farm professions if the other isn't around.
---
World pvp is going to be alot more frequent in classic since: 
---
1. No arenas
---
2. Honor and bgs come out on separate patches
---
3. Worlds a lot smaller
---
4. Farming mats in the world are going to be contested
---
I for one, can not wait to get into some messy world pvp events. See you ally in hell
---
&gt; Calling people filth because they gank people is ridiculous 
---
Not because they "gank". Because they go to low level zones just to ruin gameplay of players who cannot even react. Quite a difference, in my opinion.
---
&gt; It causes the community getting ganked to ask for help and get other high level players to come help defend the area which in return causes more fun pvp battles. 
---
That's the theory. Rarely works like that in practice. Asking friends for help in that situation just ends up with the greykiller getting killed, logging out for 20 minutes, and then coming again. Fun mass PvP battles happen when the opposing groups are in the same level range, not when there's a skull involved. 
---
&gt; If you don't like it, go on a PvE server and it won't happen to you. 
---
 You either say "greykilling is cool !" or you go PvE ? I will enjoy WPvP to its greater extent, thank you for your attention. It's no PvP nor ganking I'm ranting about here.
---
Nothing will happen to me anyway. I'll level a character early on, and probably will barely touch rerolls, hence won't be greykilled. I'm just criticizing garbage behavior ruining the game.
---
If the raids were on weekends i would join
---
There’s like a 4 hour YouTube video out there that is just the cutscenes and cinematics from Warcraft 3. A lot faster than playing through the game. I found it pretty fun
---
I’m going night elf just to have shadowmeld. I like dwarves a lot better but I don’t want to pass up the opportunity to get a cat pet, have us both stealth and suprise attack in the open world.
---
I think that both gankers AND people like OP is healthy for the game. There will always be these "bullies" on pvp realms who will do everything they can to annoy the shit out others, so I think its cool that we also have people such as OP who will try to combat that.
---
Its basically just the good old "Terrorist vs. Counter-Terrorist"-game.
---
If you can live with that god awful bow animation on NE then go ahead. Shadowmeld+aimed shot is fun in bgs.
---
But in that case, I guess threat should not be such an issue if your top dps are not pulling big numbers anyway. You feral threat level should be enough to let people dps enough without being constraint, during the try phase imho
---
word
---
It wont have more polygons on max settings. So there is that.
---
If you're going to go tri-spec priest I recommend finding a way to get silence from the shadow tree. Do you really need the divine spirit buff in PvP?
---
isn't possible in 1.12 so nope.
---
Yes, yells in chat obv says Kazzak.
---
I always throw a bubble first, only to realize my target is out if group, it self bubbles me, and my heal is too late.
---
While leveling, the Paladin will have good DPS, because Paladins get good weapons while they're leveling.  They'll just fall behind at higher levels and end-game.  I would say that between the druid, warrior, and priest, whoever is most comfortable tanking and/or healing should do so.  I'd actually argue the druid should be doing one of those two, for a few reasons:
---
* Druids make amazing tanks and healers.  Their biggest problems are that they don't scale well as tanks at end-game (not an issue while leveling) and they don't have a real rez spell (not an issue if you have a priest and paladin.
---
* Druids don't really have a good DPS form until the late-20s.  You get cat form at 20, but it's not realized until the late 20s to the 30s.  Essentially at level 20, you've got the ability pool of a Level 1 rogue.  It takes some time to get all the pieces to even have a rotation.
---
Right, vengefull. What 11 yrs old boy is not pent up with hormones they dont yet understand causing them to go full aggressive/angst/vengeful mode?
---
Hey, man, Chuck Norris jokes are more tame than half the shit people talk about now. &lt;_&lt;
---
Exactly
---
I hope his pc breaks when classic launches and he gets his hands cut off :)
---
Sorry,  just my toxic personality speaking.
---
You're absolutely right, this spec would be much better:
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxzGs0bZfVzbZVMGpcz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxzGs0bZfVzbZVMGpcz) 
---
Still gets you improved mana burn from discipline, holy nova from holy, and some extra goodies in shadow.
---
I must have been a late bloomer
---
&gt; racist
---
Doesn't have anything to do with who you worship, or support.
---
I am actually glad I haven't used mine in quite a while and its awesome: Ætatjoes
---
I enjoyed it, PVP healing vids are rare !
---
&gt; At the end of the day, I'd like to be able to casually raid and slightly competitively run PvP, while also being able to AoE farm (that's always been one of my favorite parts of the game). I'm okay with being a healer but wouldn't like that to be the only thing I do in endgame.
---
Sounds like you should roll a mage. Undoubtedly mages are the best AoE farmers. I really don't know how viable warlock AoE farming is, but that might also work. Warlock or mage is probably a safe bet if you want to level quickly and funnel money, but really you should just roll whatever you're most interested in.
---
Paladins, shamans, and druids are hybrid classes as you know. You'll have to heal in raids most likely, but you can always respec for PvP, and might be able to get a raidspot if you stick with a guild for awhile and build a relationship with them. I'll mention that Druids are a safe bet, because everyone always needs a brez, and because you can spec a hybrid build with druids and still do decent heals.
---
In the end choose what you'll love playing the most :) also, if you haven't yet, check out the wiki on helpful resources for choosing a class.
---
Can't fucking wait
---
How is decursive "against the spirit of Vanilla" when Vanilla had the most overpowered healing addons in the game?
---
&gt; if you take this much offense to being ganked. 
---
I'm not taking any offense in being ganked, and I will myself gank to my heart content aswell ; people in my level range.  The whole post, starting with the title concerns greykilling. 
---
Do you really put slaughtering lowbies in zones where you have no interest to be on the same level than normal WPvP ? Is that really comparable to you ? Anyway, it's not to me, and I'm simply criticizing it in this post. Nothing special.
---
I agree. Also the type of people that gank low level players usually aren't the most skilled either (at least I've yet to see any pro/skilled players gank low level players), so getting revenge later on shouldn't be much of a problem. :P
---
This old forum post indicates Tauren can ride kodos and wolves, but still no raptors: https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=5015
---
Doesn't stop the nude mods, man.
---
The priest utility tri spec is actually pretty popular, but the idea is you build for imp mana burn, blessed recovery and silence as the most useful low level talents in the trees. It looks something like this. https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxMrs0bZbxhhZVMGdcd  
---
Divine spirit and holy nova are both basically useless in pvp (regen counts for very little when you ress with full hp/mana and everyone has water if needed, and holy nova is only 10 range so it's terrible at even knocking things out of stealth).
---
I'll mind control you off the Thandol Span bridge instead.
---
It is weird because the actual quest is required level 18, but the prerequisite is level 20.  So... yeah.
---
Yeah that looks pretty good
---
Options:
---
1. Join a guild that doesn't require DBM.  Hope that everyone is good.
---
2. Join a guild that only requires DBM if you fail a mechanic.  Hope that you don't fail the mechanic.  Also spend an extra 20+ minutes per raid while the people that failed install DBM.
---
3. Just use DBM and then don't deal with the problems of not having it.
---
I can't speak for Vanilla raids, but I can for TBC, which was very Vanilla-like.  DBM existed, and it was pretty much required in any guild that was actually trying to progress.  There's only one person who I ever saw get away with NOT having DBM equipped, that was my best friend who was better at mechanics than everyone else even without it installed.  Kicking him to enforce the rule would have been a detriment to the guild.
---
Rofl
---
If I had all the time in the world ? PVP.
---
Having a job now with limited time? Losing 5-10 minutes+ to ganks and other things like that(possibly 30-40 if being griefed) zero appeal and will be rolling PVP.
---
I have never in my entire wow career ganked a single person so the PvP aspect doesn’t do anything for me.
---
Yah I am curious about your Timezone and Faction.
---
This is perfect, thanks!

You have a lot of builds crammed into one tree.  A "feral" druid might be a pure melee druid, it might be a melee/healer hybrid, it might be a PvP healer that picks up a ton of feral content.  You've got 4 types of abilities crammed into three trees (balance caster, bear tank, cat melee, and resto healer) so learn what benefits your chosen style best.
---
&gt;  It wouldn't be wow without the gankers. It's simply a must. 
---
I'm talking about greykilling, not ganking in general. There was almost no greykilling in BC/WotLK due to separation of high level zones from the old continent, and I'm pretty certain it was still "WoW" and not an other game.
---
&gt;   I will be killing every red character. Gender, Age, level of helplessness. None of these will stop me from killing you if you are an Allie. You red, you dead. 
---
I will \[try to\] do the same actually, but it doesn't have much to do with my post though. Gankers are 100% fine. But there's a big difference between ganking and greykilling, imo.
---
Imp Rend is actually the worst talent. It's only good because you need it for deep wounds. If you don't take deep wounds imp rend is worse than HS.
---
Ideally you're going to be healing someone who can deal with any rogues that target you anyhow.
---
That's actually trolling, and it's absolutely awesome !
---
Your gonna want to take booming voice. Increases the range on your piercing howl and also improves battle shout duration.

Craft to DE for enchanting mats.

Hi, /u/RuFf-PWNagrophy
---
shamans cannot remove mc with purge
---
1. Exactly what you said
---
2. The streamer will be running with 50 people behind him at all times
---
3. The zone the streamer is in will most likely have some sort of lag
---
4. If you happen to be questing in the same zone - good luck
---
5. If classic doesn't live up to the hype, the streamer says, this is trash, stop playing it, your server's population will just crash
---
Wow this hit me with a truckload of nostalgia
---
Well, that escalated quickly.
---
&gt;I mean, you really have to be some sort of filth to actually enjoy killing people who are so low level they literally cannot defend themselves against you. It's absolutely garbage behavior that cannot even be considered as trolling, as it's not amusing to anybody, and as you do not give your opponents the slighest chance. It's gameplay killing and immersion breaking. Greykilling is literally cancerous gameplay, and if you actually enjoy it, it shows a very bad image of who you are irl.
---
Holy shit it's just a game.

A ROGUE IN AN OPEN COMBAT NED!
---
This guy..
---
Horde - NA West -PvP Server   
---
15 year old guild looking to fill out roster for 40-mans. 
---
**Guild Name**: 
---
Get of Fenris   
---
**What’s it mean?**: 
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse.  The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.  
---
**Our Philosophy**: 
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.   
---
**So what about loot and stuff?**: 
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.   
---
**What Gets us apart**:   
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.  
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage). This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool. 
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!
---
**A Brief History**: 
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.   
---
**Server Type**: PvP  
---
**Faction**: Horde  
---
**Raid Times**: TBD but likely evenings during the week, and early day during weekends (to allow for night activities IRL)  
---
**Guild Priorities**: Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days).  
---
**Contact us:**   
---
Discord: [https://discord.gg/YxwcmTT](https://discord.gg/YxwcmTT)
---
Drop us a line under #classic\_recruitment and let’s talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.  
---
Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we’re gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
While the servers are young there will be a lot of players skinning mobs as they level and few players with gold to spend on low level leather on the AH. I predict you will be better off vendoring low level skins idk about bags.
---
I am talking about vanilla world pvp.
---
&gt; Enhance shamans winning the matchup 
---
?
---
&gt; Ele Shaman, Warlocks and Priests are generally the easier matchups
---
??????
---
Couldn't be more wrong than that.
---
"People who don't think like me and enjoy the same things are retarded"
---
Different people have different obligations and are able to sink different amounts of time into the game. I don't have time to corpse run for an hour on a night that I only have two hours to play because some bored level 60 is running through STV one shotting anything that happens to be gray.
---
We're not all in high school anymore.
---
I remember there was an install error on mine, I had to install using two different computers because swapping discs caused it to crash.
---
Oh I'm rolling a priest or mage, I just know rogues are gonna be rough and want to know how to counter them.
---
I'm playing Horde but I was on the same server as this guild's leadership 14 years ago and I can tell you they're solid and cool with a lot of in-game experience and knowledge. Highly recommend (if you want Alliance EZ mode ofc }=)\~ )
---
Awesome thanks.
---
I too, absolutely hate grey-killers and will happily do my part to put them in the ground where they deserve to be.
---
But I don't want them gone from the game. They actually have a hugely positive effect in-game, IMO, because they drive World PvP. It all starts when you get a group attacking lowbies in Redridge or wherever - not huge by itself, but too much for one person to handle. Then you get 60s coming in to defend the lowbies. Then you get serious PvPers coming in to honour farm the 60s. Then this escalates into proper, full blown World PvP.
---
&gt;Already did that recently on PServs a couple times, and every single time the /1 was very supportive, to the point where the humiliated greykillers would either leave the zone or logout after poorly trying to defend themselves on the chat.
---
And then everyone clapped.
---
I play an undead rogue. I tend to leave people alone except in the following three cases...
---
1) You attack me. Then you are getting camped. I will wait until you are low health and kill you over and over I'd that is what it seems like I need to do. No rules in world PvP other than kill or be killed. If you don't want to be camped then don't attack me and hope that neither of these other conditions are true.
---
2) I am currently ranking and BG queues are going slowly. You have to die because you are worth honor. Simple. This is probably why we're in the same zone in the first place.
---
3) We are farming the same mobs/herbs/ore. If there's plenty of mobs to go around or another nearby spot to farm them then I'm fine with sharing or moving on. If you are limiting my ability to do what I want to do then you have to die or leave.
---
I had no idea what to pick for my character name, I have no clue what an MMO even was. My friend picked for me, a troll mage named Bigfirecrit. I didn't even know what crit was, and I hated mage, so I deleted it at lvl 6 and went for shaman. My friend again, chose my name for me. Bigmacecrit the Tauren shaman. So stupid. My younger brother wanted to copy me, and we had no idea what the name means, so he made a tauren warrior named Bigoxcrit. It made no sense. We had fun.
---
Which healer would you think would work best/ be the most fun alongside a warrior for dungeons and questing together, priest or pally?
---
What’s the general playstyle of both if they’re with a tank?
---
It’s like rushing a frat. There’s some hazing you’ll have to accept on your journey to 60, but once you pass that rite of initiation, you get to be on the other side of things.
---
Is there an online tool where I can ghost equip a character with any items I like, just like the [Classic Wowhead dressing room](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room), but including the non-cosmetic slots (neck, rings, trinkets etc)? Ideally with a summary of the stats.
---
Of course you're welcome! They are some great reads, imo.
---
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an absolute must.
---
the holy part is fucked up though.
---
Add the cheap shot icon to the final frame
---
man, this gives me an amazing picture in my head... imagine sitting with your guildies under a tent somewhere in the world and telling stories while waiting for the storm to pass... i can't wait for summer
---
So is classic just not going to ever experience expansions or?
---
now change blessed recovery for inspiration and holy nova and you got a proper tri spec.
---
Think this would work with the similar hunter ability?
---
PvP consumables, engineering items, and certain BOE items used for PvP will be in less demand.
---
I can see the economies being substantially different.
---
Look I'm not trying to say you didn't do the work, all I'm saying is there is a ton of stuff we don't know 100%, and I won't continue to say to anyone that HS spamming is better because you have provided me with sufficient doubt in my previous knowledge that until I can test it myself in classic that I can't comfortably say which way is better.
---
There's a certain rush that comes with world PvP that I couldn't play without. Would be too boring.
---
I would prefer to be on the outnumbered side personally.
---
&gt; Holy shit it's just a game. 
---
It's entertainment. When you watch a sport competition on TV and you see one of the contenders playing dirty you can call him a moron and there's no issue. Why would it be different for an MMORPG ? Maybe I've used too harsh words, idk, english isn't my mother tongue.
---
&gt; And then everyone clapped. 
---
I just pointed that out to show people you can actually do that with success, which imo is important.
---
It’s a deep and enriching experience, compared to say a frost mage or a combat rogue. 
---
Visually, the class has a very Warcraft feel to it, particularly dwarven and troll hunters .
---
Mechanically the class is very engaging, it is both mobile and powerful and you do feel like a master of the wilds when out in the world. On my hunters, I never feel overwhelmed by a pve situation.
---
The high skill cap in PvP is akin to that of an FPS. 
---
Class fantasy and lore is fantastic and pets provide a nice balance between depth and tedium. 
---
Losing a bag slot sucks though.
---
Thanks for the kind words man that I am really humbled by them. I actually only have about two weeks on priest, but I've played resto shaman forever so a lot translated.  I will definitely look to make a video like that once I have a better foundation. For my next video I'm deciding between a "Which healer should you play depending on your PvP style" type video or just a straight disc/holy priest pvp guide with talents, stats, gear, professions, races etc. I really just need to learn to edit first though I am an absolute neanderthal in that department.
---
When you’re in that first dungeon say in chat - first time healer. I did this in Legion, I hadn’t healed in like 2 years, and everyone was very helpful. Good luck!
---
Bank them and sell power engineering, blacksmithing and alchemy kits at 60!
---
Because a mage kills you and leaves. A rogue follows you around after you spawn.
---
that seems like druids are just worse on horde side compared to alliance but its okay because horde druids have more TPS than horde warriors. kind of like comparing apples to oranges to bananas. I understand and agree with your point but the justification seemed self-contradicting.
---
Interesting! Thanks for posting that. If that's the case and there is spillover up to half-honored, the grind may be easier than I expected. There are people in the comments saying that they got non-humans exalted before 40 (although it appears this was during early TBC).
---
&gt; Do people forget this game is called WARcraft?  
---
Oh well, killing unarmed civilians is prohibited by war conventions and martial laws actually. And I guess it's still harder than killing a lowbie in WoW. But I do not think there's any reason to take that this seriously anyway :)
---
Im not looking to prove anything and tank a raid, I'd just like to be able to reasonably fill any role for dungeons. Wife and I are playing together and it would be nice to be able to get into groups or raids quickly. I figure I'll heal for raids but farming dungeons would be fun for us. Didn't know you could tank with a healer shield.
---
Albuquerque office.
---
Personally I would avoid UD warrior wotf is ok on warriors but they already have enough fear breaks it's almost wasted. Also in a raid group you would be my last choice to get any weapon. Orcs will benefit more from the axes and rogues will benefit more from the swords. Of course that's all else held equal. If the other people are flaky/shit at the game it's different.
---
Rockcrusher made me laugh... those ghouls aren’t exactly beefy
---
Yeah, I server transferred in vanilla.
---
I understood. I just thought you should know that retail WoW doesn't have ganking of lowbies! Ganking means attacking someone who is disadvantaged by the way, either by surprise or any other exploited weakness. It's never fair, a gank inherently lacks virtue, so it really doesn't matter if the enemy is a lowbie or not! 
---
Have a great time in vanilla wow friend! I'm sure you'll provide some nice screenshot material to some future angwe-wannabe! Thanks for the downvote by the way!
---
Very bad thread
---
Pretty much force 'em out of stealth. A DoT works nicely. But priests are fairly easy prey for a rogue. Although a dwarve's Stoneform is extremely useful for rogues as well. Gets rid of that nasty poison after all.
---
Maybe I communicated poorly. I am saying I like grey killers. Because they give me someone to hate. They basically agree to ruin their reputation and play the role of the "villain". I enjoy this. I like the fact that these people existing has in the past motivated groups of sixties to form lowbie defense squads. I just like all that stuff.
---
Bro yeah, what servers are you questing on. Outside of my personal experience getting ganked by rogues. I swear like half the rogues I see are named like "Iganku", "shankyboi", or "getcampdkid". And those types of lore-friendly names don't seem indicative of someone whose not into ganking.
---
Long live pvp servers
---
Hunters for sure. Rogues are kinda scuffed 10-19 because when you're twinking you really should basically just running at people out of stealth like a gimped warrior
---
Pvp or pve server?
---
If you took all the village idiots, and put them into 1 village, you have the barrens.
---
Rogues if for no other reason than +15 agi. If you really go for it you can get some crazy Stam and Agi, have massive HP and one shot even other level 19's that aren't twinks. Or kill them in one stun.
---
Paladins also make really good twinks at that level if I remember correctly. Wasn't alliance main, but I did play an Alliance to 60. Just get a decent weapon, go Ret, BoF all day.
---
I’ve leveled through so many times now I was glad of it. I had great fun in the pre BFA events, the class weapon was a lot of fun. A few levels into the new expansion I got bored tho. It’s weird cos I can play vanilla all day even if I’m not doing much really.
---
Is the shout from Muradin in the first screenshot legitimate? I guess I was never around when Magni was killed. Is this a thing he shouts or is someone trolling in chat
---
Yeah, I don’t see it being a thing on PVE servers either.
---
How many times will this be reposted?
---
Except for all the people who won't give the tank lead so they can't mark. And all the dps that pull because the tank is "being slow" when he's waiting for the healer to have more than 0 mana.
---
I'd feel forced to get a cat pet and camp for Broken Tooth if I went Nelf. Dwarf is my Hunter choice.
---
I wish they’d just nuke bots daily on osrs feels so inflated from bot dumps!
---
I've always really enjoyed druids for the 10-19 bracket. Pretty much unkillable in bear form with stacked stam and a pocket HoT.
---
&gt;Already did that recently on PServs a couple times, and every single time the /1 was very supportive, to the point where the humiliated greykillers would either leave the zone or logout after poorly trying to defend themselves on the chat
---
r/thathappened
---
You just wanted us to know you had buddies didn’t you?
---
Warrior are beasts in that level too. But really, I used to have a twink Hunter and would fraps all my wsgs...  I would sometimes kill people with just a multi shot. It was really fun lol. Or randomly throw grenades at spawn point and rekill some non 19 who had just revived. Good times.
---
Well, nothing really beats stealth for its "aw, come on!" factor.
---
Mainly silver and mageweave. It’s great and easy grind xp in the mid to late 40s too
---
I leveled as Holy the first time round and will do again. ✊🏻
---
not priests, but horde priests. gravestone scepter is available to them, a basically ~lvl30 wand that transforms you into a machine gun.
---
Well I'm glad that you, the person who is not being stolen from, benefit from the stealing.
---
Truly evil. At least you're within the flavor of the class lol
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
I'll agree that horde getting paladins and alliance getting shaman was not a welcome change for me. I played Resto Shaman in vanilla and I loved that alliance couldn't. And I like paladins being a special challenge in world pvp.
---
But the other's I don't really agree with. Flying was a really welcome improvement at the time and had serious gate keeping with the cost being 5k i think for 280 speed. That was definitely a challenge for most casual players. 
---
Arena was and is just a different way to play the game, if a player doesn't like it, they can simply ignore it and it doesn't take away from their PVE experience. 
---
You could argue raids were made easier being capped at 25 ppl instead of 40 but that just reduced potential human error by 15. The fights themselves were a great mix of complicated and easy. I mean Karazhan was incredible, on 25 or 10, what a greatly done instance. SSC wasn't as fun but Lady Vashj was a killer! Defeating her was before the second nerf is still one of my proudest WOW moments. Kael'thas was impossible for weeks but I never minded the repair bills because end game grinding was the way I liked to play. 
---
Shattrath.... i've never heard anyone say they didn't like BC Shattrath and I honestly wonder what your issue with it was? Please elaborate if you'd like to. 
---
I'm in a similar place with your Blood Elf issue. Lore wise they make sense so I can only assume your problem with them is aesthetic, maybe? Again, please elaborate if you'd like. 
---
As for the accessible raiding... i have mixed feelings on this. Part of me thinks that is great that everyone gets to see everything. Its not like that takes away from my enjoyment of seeing something. But also I think that you're right, this is the beginning of the "a portal to everywhere" mentality that led to a lot of special things going away and a bit more focus than I'd like on the casual experience. But then again, Blizz has to make its money if I want newer harder content every 3 months lol.
---
Thank you for telling me what retail looks like, as I haven't touched since a while before even Nost launch, which means many years, between others because of PvP. I'm not sure why you're bringing that up though. Even in WoW PvP heydays, which would be around patch 3.3.5, greykilling was almost absent from the game. Maybe because everybody could check the Arena rating of the greykiller to judge his skill at that time ? I don't know.
---
Either way, the ability to greykill is hardly related to the quality of the game in my opinion. Also, I don't know who's downvoting you, but I'm getting downvoted into oblivion under this post too, so you're not specially targetted.
---
\&gt;haven't played since 2007
---
\&gt;confuses Outland with Draenor
---
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure buddy...
---
OBS or shadowplay if you have an nvidia card works.
---
Can't get away with that in retail anymore, the Raid add-ons report whoever tapped the mob first. And since the UI will be from the modern client it will probably be in all the classic add-ons too.
---
There'll be 100s of rogues all stealthing around looking for people to gank but not finding anyone because every one is a rogue stealthing around looking for someone to gank.
---
The Hatred between factions is a MAJOR part of Vanilla. Being ganked, and recognizing them 10 levels later to kill them as they’re mining a gold ore to steal it. 
---
It’s so much fun. It completely changes the game.
---
It's kind of weird that Priests get so many heals but no way to make them instant cast like the others. It felt great to have Nature's Swiftness or Holy Shock when I played other healers.
---
Would be nice to know
---
Lmao that sounds fun

#&lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP]
---
**Raidstyle:** Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun  
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace  
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette  
---
* Helpful cooperative environment  
---
**You are:**
---
* Patient  
---
* Sociable  
---
* A team player  
---
**Intentions:**
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Raids will be accomplished with a focus playstyle. All specs will be accepted and you will be expected to bring your A game with regards to be being punctual, listening to the Raid Leader, and bringing a reasonable amount of consumables (a few elixirs/flasks, potions and buff food.) We don't mind if you're min-maxing a viable spec with 20 buffs and years of experience, or if you're a new player with the minimum consumable requirements playing something a bit different - as long as you bring you're best you are welcome!
---
Raid days are Sunday and Monday. 19:00-22:00 UK (20:00-23:00 EU.) As previously mentioned there'll be other group content every evening. There is no minimum attendance required for raids.
---
Loot system has been discussed with a DKP and Loot Council system outlined clearly. Majority of current members like the Loot Council system proposed but this too is up for further discussion.
---
**Recruiting:**
---
Old players New players Casual players Semi-Hardcore players We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved!
---
**Interested?**

I did it during Vanilla on a priest. My friend also did it on  a Paladin. We didn't have time to raid so we closed the game together finishing this quest line. It was super fun, but very expensive and quite time consuming. The gear isn't so great either but it is rare and people will be inspecting you if you do it.
---
And here he is in all his glory:

http://imgur.com/gallery/KA8jGON

I've had the same idea! I played a prot pally for 5-mans on numerous private servers, and each time it was fun as hell. I was pretty decent at it too because I looked into how to play it, bought plenty of consumables, and while leveling, I would try to run dungeons I wasn't under leveled for. But it never failed, any time I would say I was tanking, at least one person "lol, pallys can't tank." Then I would prove them wrong. 
---
I would love the idea of a guild of vanilla misfit class specs. Give me all your arcane mages, boomkin druids, bear tanks, cat dps, ret pallys, or elemental shamans.
---
Afaik there is a way to get past the pre-requisite. I remember one private server found evidence and enabled it in retrospect.
---
I also know a friend that I trust - but please take this with a grain of salt - that only ever twinked during vanilla. He was an Alliance player and he promised 100% that he had that very wand.
---
And Fwiw on my last priest on one of the private servers (the smaller one), I grabbed it at 18 on Alliance after it had been recently changed due to video evidence.
---
My conclusions could still be entirely wrong, though. So please don’t forget that grain of salt!
---
having curse of elements effect nature damage as well.
---
in interviews, when asked, it looks like this was just an "oversight" and there was no official reason that they didn't have this in game.  (ref: Countdown to Classic Podcast interview with Kevin Jordan ep#98, On Shamans)  
---
This is a big reason that elemental shaman and balance druid are less viable as DPS classes in PvE content is because most bosses soak up so much of the nature damage through resistance, the spec is just not viable.  Laser Turkeys also give a caster group a 3% spell crit which is a buff usually overlooked because their dps is lousy and you'd rather just have another mage/warlock to fill that raid slot.
---
these changes would never happen, but it's fun to dream.
---
I only work 36hours one week, then 48hrs the next. It's a pretty standard continental shift pattern.
---
That is a great way to get the Druid to spam Thorns on you the entire dungeon.
---
Private servers and original Vanilla are different, and in your other posts you said you haven't played Alliance on private servers. I think most people arguing with you are basing their opinions on how Crossroads and Redridge are now on private servers, which honestly, stand a good chance of being closer to how things will be in Classic.
---
Back in actual Vanilla I'll admit that the horde rarely went to Redridge, but on some private servers, you literally can't see the ground textures in Lakeshire because it's covered in skeletons. Brief anecdote, there was a famous Horde rogue on the Rebirth private server, (which had a small community) named DirtyLarry, and he was nicknamed the Mayor of Lakeshire, because he would gank every single alliance player going through that zone.
---
As for the percent of flagged players in the Barrens combined with the larger population, that might lead to more flagged players in the zone on average, but the Barrens is HUGE. Most lowbies doing the Crossroads quests at level 10-20 won't be flagged for pvp. There's no one place for a would be solo ganker to hang out and get quick guaranteed kills on lowbies in the Barrens. Compare that to Lakeshire which is small and has multiple choke points, where literally everyone is a target, and you have a zone that makes for easy pickings.
---
I'm making a dwarf hunter alt mostly because I hate the idea of a night elf using anything but a bow and arrow because of the animations, but I like dwarf with all 3 animations so I can change weapons without fear.
---
This
---
It shouldn't be any different from other drops.  If a mage item drops and a mage rolls need, thats fine so long as he actually equips it as an upgrade.  If a mage item drops and a rogue rolls need because he wants to sell it, then that guy is an asshole.
---
It's a double edge sword. Those assholes ganking lowbies can trigger the most memorable and epic world pvp.
---
Haha! Love this.
---
thinly veiled scare tactics
---
only available in phase 3 though
---
What you love happens to be arguably he best class. Play warrior. 
---
Do it.
---
Just another reason to love Alliance. Less players + gnomes = the Ultimate PvP experience.
---
Balance Druid does not hit like a truck. It's a control / CC / survivability spec that also uses melee forms for utility and damage. Play Shaman if you want a caster that hits like a truck.
---
I really hope they add a RP-PVP server. My friends are most likely going to play on a PVP server, they have no interest in RP.
---
And I like the community and roleplaying of RP servers (I also like PVP servers).
---
A RP-PVP server would be the perfect place for my friends and I.
---
There's no penalty to dying in PvP. So nah, not a big deal.
---
Speed it up to 1.5 and its not that bad
---
and pay 50g every time I want to pvp? :/
---
This is a weird way to troll. It's part humblebrag, part /r/iamverybadass, and part confused gamer.
---
Before WoW, grinding was the only way to level :) 
---
I still sometimes prefer grinding because it requires much less focus and allows me to engage in a show or audiobook. I definitely wouldn't try to grind 1-60, but I've often done it in lieu of questing in crowded / contested zones like STV or 1k needles when leveling on a pvp server. I might do it post-20 on Classic depending on whether Joana's alliance guide is out at that point as well as how the servers are at launch.
---
As you said rogues are monsters in TBC. But no cloak in vanilla means one frostbolt or shadow word pain and you're probably dead.
---
Paladins can’t reasonably tank. A tanking spec that can be crippled by not having taunt, or simply mana burning it is shit. 
---
Your best bet to tank as a paladin is as an overgeared ret when you just beat the piss out of things and cause soo much threat, and your gear gives enough stam it doesn’t matter if you get hit twice in a row. 
---
And besides, that’s 100g everytime you want to try your hand at being just terrible at tanking...50 in 50 out.
---
Warlock. It’s a hunter of demons and gets a free mount at 40. Plus you don’t need to spend money buying ammo and literally just need to spec Affliction/demonology for it to be good til 60
---
https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/
---
just doesn't let you see the character. Even lets you sort by patch version of items
---
In classic you couldn't search for both at the same time however. So you pick one and skinning
---
I dont think orcs and humans(in wow) give 2 fucks about Martial law but I could be wrong.  I just can't believe how long it just takes people to learn what goes around comes around.  There are PvE servers for people who don't want to be harassed.  I didn't want people to rush me on SC when I was 12 but they did it anways.  The faster people learn that's not how the game is played the faster this kind of stuff stops bothering you.  Get to 60, pay it forward.  Maybe you draw a 60 to fight while ganking his lowbie friend?  That's why you're on the PvP server right, to PvP?  That's my approach anyways.
---
That was probably me Sunday night. I'm not a ganker by any means but my buddy was pissed off with being ganked repeatidly by Alliance in Hillsbrad.
---
So I showed him around some Alliance zones. I really like Westfall so we explored through there stealthed and ended the run in Redrige. He killed a priest and hearthed. I ganked another dude near the water then ran off and hearthed.
---
It was a fun time ganking for the first time but we got the hell out of there right away.
---
Then I went to Teldrassil just to check out Shadowglen. Love that place but I always play Horde. Was thinking I would just park myself there AFK for shits and giggles. (And let myself be killed) but to my surprise, some poor lv 4 bastard was somehow flagged for PVP. I just had to do it.
---
Let's call it even. You're right now: Some of these players live to gank. Not me though.
---
Jango Theft!
---
What timezone are you playing in?
---
I don’t think retail wow ENCOURAGES 0 social conduct; there are people that likely want to be quiet and enjoy themselves in both formats of the game, and there always will be. However, in retail, most classes can solo elite quests and some can even solo dungeon quests...this didn’t happen nearly at all in classic wow, you basically NEEDED a group for some quests, but that doesn’t mean that everyone enjoyed that.
---
There is no upside to playing on a PVP server unless you are the sad sort of person who likes to ruin other people's fun by going into zones you are much higher level than and killing lowbies who cannot defend themselves against you.
---
You can run around PVP flagged on a PVE server if you want to.
---
I view this as a better hunter specc simply for the extra 30% crit dmg. You're trading 3% parry and some useless talent.
---
OP I can't award you or anything but you're 100% right. Thank you for answering those guys who seek to ruin the game experience of other people just because they can't have a better moment of glory in their life than when they kill a lowbie.
---
Doesn’t matter. It’s opportunity cost and comparative advantage.
---
A warrior is the only class that can main tank (reasonably). Even if 70% of warriors only ever dps, without the prot warriors, no one would. Every class can dps, every class can do the fury warriors job. No one can do the prot warriors job. 
---
Same with healing, Druid, priest, sham pala all have dps specs in classic, they all have valuable support buffs. But they are the only ones who can heal, until enough of them are healing, all of them are. Their main role is to heal, excess members of that class in the raid can dps.
---
If you don't want to PvP, dont roll a PvP server...
---
Hi OP.
---
I’d absolutely love to pick your brain about about feral tanking.
---
How important is the 3 piece marshal set for pve? I keep hearing varying degrees of relevance.
---
Should I farm it?
---
Aw man this looks sweet, can’t wait for vanilla
---
There absolutely is an advantage.
---
If a member of the opposition faction is competing for the same quest drops or resource nodes as you, there is nothing you can do about it on a PVE server.
---
&gt; Killing lowbies is making the game healthier 
---
How exactly ?
---
&gt; Man, some salty noobs in here   
---
&gt; Gtfo pvp servers   
---
&gt; How does your own cock taste?   
---
&gt;.  
---

You're the one who seems terribly offended by my post here. Geeze, I wonder if you're actually one of the guys who enjoy butchering people who can just /clap you because you have 5 times their healthpool and two shot them ? Couldn't be, I'm assuming too much.
---
&gt; Bet you play Alliance. 
---
Lost you bet. I had a level 20 human priest once, and it wasn't even on Vanilla PServs. I don't know how it's relevant anyway.
---
You can kill horde that are competing for the same resources as you. This is particularly useful in gold spots, resource farming and shared quest areas like STV/Winterspring

Y'all have never felt the terror of being stalked by an angry kitty druid.
---
I don't think recipes will be remembered when you drop engineering to pick it up again. The specialties were meant to be mutually exclusive
---
DEHTA
---
Then the druid will have to take care of their own health....
---
And when I've played a Holy Priest, and one of the DPS keeps pulling, I've whispered to the tank more than once "Don't taunt off of the idiot, and I won't heal him either." I've also received more than one whisper from the tank, "Don't heal that idiot next time."
---
True human filth is some filthy lowbie thinking Azeroth is their oyster. Somebody needs to teach them a lesson!
---
See you in a contested zone kid. Nothing personnel.
---
Oh dude, I will definitely be vendoring my leather. As far as bags go, I will need them myself and I’ll be peddling the shit out of them lol. As much silver as you can give me lol.
---
This made me lol really hard and my boss yelled at me to get back to work.
---
You didn't link anything?
---
&gt;Cool so just as I suspected. You private server players are SERIOUSLY warping the perception of what classic will be like. You're all talking about druid viability as if everyone is going to be 15/15 naxx day one. No. Everyone will be in questing blues and greens and have to struggle through content like intended. Druids aren't really gonna do shit all except for heal for 99% of guilds at this point.
---
What part of my post could possibly have implied everyone would be clearing Naxx right away?
---
I have personally tanked a Druid through MC progression on a fresh realm all the way to BWL. I am not tanking AQ40 as a Druid on a different server that has progressed further. I know perfectly well how Druids perform in a raid environment where the guild is both just starting out and have the content on farm.
---
How am I warping anyones perception of anything? This entire line of discussion is about whether or not Pummelers are hard to farm. I just told you they wont be needed on progression raids, and I also told you Druids wont need a lot of them once you do get the content on farm. I sincerely struggle to comprehend how your post is relevant to what we were just discussing.
---
If you wish to debate Druids viability as a tank on preraid content, Im up for that. But thats a different discussion entirely.
---
This is exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!
---
yeah, kos was left over from earlier mmos that just had open (no faction) pvp and guilds had to act like gangs.
---
This would actually work out better for me even though I would still be missing raids on my day shifts. Maybe I'll test out the EU servers once they open and try to find one with a decent ping. 
---
I work every other weekend so a 'casual' weekend raid guild won't fit  my schedule any better. My hardcore raiding days are done, I just want to progress at a steady pace.
---
I'm a power plant control room operator. We follow the continental shift pattern which is pretty common, but you're right that it's horrible health wise.
---
You can unflag if you're getting attacked by players as long as you don't retaliate the guards however will still flag you. The only places you'll get flagged automatically on a pve server is going into enemy capital cities.
---
I'm planning on rolling an alliance lock for the reasons you stated. But honestly from the polls I've seen there will be more locks in classic than back in 04-06.
---
Warlock also has a DPS and PvP spec in-one. Sure, you can specialized and get a pure PvP spec, but locks have an advantage there.
---
[Something like this is a good hybrid spec for lock](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0duRbkAZZxx0tMbz). It's not the *top* DPS spec the class can do (that apparently goes to DM/Ruin once geared enough), but there is also no set PvP spec for lock... some go 30 points into Affliction, some go Soul Link Demonology for tankiness, and others yet go full Charm-glass-cannon with like over 40 points in Destro. So lock is sweet and has a lot of options.
---
&gt; How exactly ? 
---
Weeds out those who are in for the experience and those who want to have their hand held the entire time.
---
I was just saying what would have been said if you started whining about getting ganked in game in Vanilla. 
---
&gt; Lost you bet. I had a level 20 human priest once, and it wasn't even on Vanilla PServs. 
---
Did you even play Vanilla?
---
&gt; I don't know how it's relevant anyway. 
---
Because all throughout Vanilla Alliance whined about the game being to hard and getting it nerfed for them. Just like you are whining now about getting ganked.
---
Might wanna get “ya boy’s” name right fella
---
Mages where noobs I think probably still in greens , warrior was using thorium grenades / potions and he was in full pvp armour...I saw him killing them 2 times then left and continued my journey :D
---
Hey man, We're EST based but our times might work out. We're looking at 3 hours Tuesday/Thursday. If you're interested shoot me a PM on discord @ frail\_#3482
---
Ever tried to out NEET a dedicated NEET crew?
---
All the Lynx Africa and Axe body spray in the world can’t help you do that.
---
Be honest, how much do you plan on playing? 
---
8-14+ a day? warrior.
---
If you are gonna be serious, no life, WoW is my reason for waking up for the next three years...why wouldn’t you play warrior? 
---
Your pve dps rotation is more engaging than anyone else’s, you’re the only one who can tank (even more fun button pressing), your gear looks insane, and if you PvP (youre playing a warrior, fucking a right you are) your massive time investment will pay off in thecorpses of your enemies. 
---
Time and effort benefits the warrior most. 
---
If you plan on playing all 3 years all the time but you know other stuff, too.... maybe a lock? By the end of the progression you’ll be a monster in PvP and pve. Threat meters snuff you out in pve long before you ever get to do your most dmg. Your PvP button pressing is interesting and takes understanding to utilize. And you look cool af.
---
Mage and rogue don’t require a significant amount of play time to enjoy. From hardcore t3 raider to “it took me till phase 4 to hit 60” mage and rogue will be fun. Rogue looks sick af, but offers nothing but pointed sticks to the raid—that said if you’re more of a handbanana guy “all I know is rape and kill” you’re in luck. Mages look stupid af, and offer so much ooc utility, yet are so boring to play in pve you may quit the game (to be fair, locks are too), that said nothing is quite like playing an elemental or frost mage in PvP.
---
Having your settings turned up doesn't change the models themselves, so no, you'll have these aswell.
---
Hey! Sorry for the confusion, but that’s my discord name! I have another battletag.
---
I feel like it would be funny to just randomly stealth around opposing faction members. Not attack them or anything, just stealth and chill.
---
This is a moot point because you still compete with your own faction for these drops/mobs/resources. 
---
If you could pvp your own faction to death, then I would agree with you. But you can’t. So I don’t.
---
I'll give Blizzard respect where it's due: I like their fantasy better than Warhammer's.
---
But Starcraft is a fucking feeble imitation of 40k.
---
Make Azeroth Great Again
---
I thought prot paladin didn't have a taunt or reliable mana refresh mechanic in vanilla?
---
It cracks me up reading that stuff.  I never know if they’re serious or not.  If they are then that is some of the lowest intelligence I’ve ever seen!  
---
And I know low intellect because I live with myself.
---
I'm in EST, but I might try an EU server to allow me to raid during the day before night-shifts.
---
Hi, /u/Burstingmoney05

Same for me, I don’t like to kill someone that can’t defend

---
As a lifelong rogue player, I've always imagined the most fun part for the victim is when they take their eye of you for a sec and you suddenly disappear. It's always fun watching a mage panicking, running around in circles spamming AOE
---
Ah yes, Getcampedkid Lionheart, Alliance hero of yore.

Honestly Chris should be a rogue, but top tier meme nonetheless

This man. I work out of town 9 days at a time and I’m home for 5. I feel like there’s a slim chance guilds out there that will understand our schedules and at least let us fill in as substitutes when we’re back home.
---
Hey man, think we'd be a good fit for you. Hit me up on discord @ frail\_#3482 and we can discuss.
---
Crazy how some of us turned into this guy 15 years later
---
It depends if we are talking premade or not.
---
Thats because they are little one. 'pats head'.

It's a gamble if you will get a dedicated NEET crew that will be formed before the server launch or not.
---
Warrior for Tank (Feral)
---
Priest for Healer (Resto)
---
Mage for DPS (Balance)
---
Would be weird to have two classes representing one spec.
---
Id feel awful about myself even just speaking to those types on discord.
---
Why wouldn't you just take a screenshot....  
---
Either way, yes, I collected the set back in the day on my warrior!
---
And Stewie the Mage. Still works with all 4 of them. Fucking Druids getting 4 specs in modern WoW. I thought Druids were kinda weak in Vanilla overall, but BC+ they just got more and more ridiculous. Hated that class more than anything BC onwards.
---
Good to know.
---
No you don't lose an aspect of the game, there are BGs. I'm serious, even on PvP servers the best PvP was in the battlegrounds. Big groups of equally leveled people fighting it out over an objective: fun. Getting ganked and griefed by raid-geared 60s for no reason other than they're bored assholes: not fun.
---
I'm rolling PvE and will be doing BGs. If we're really getting patch 1.12 we'll have cross-realm BGs which eliminates the risk of joining a server where no one wants to do it.
---
pvp should be more skill dependent than gear dependent
---
I'm really surprised this isn't the common opinion here, given how frequently people keep citing individual reputation and community as a huge factor in vanilla.
---
I guess, but there's 2 different roles in that one spec and the general argument is that you are a bad Warrior/Rogue/Priest. No one mentions mage at all because balance is just a joke lol.
---
Hey, we are CST and our times will be afternoon/weekend raiding semi-hardcore. Feel free to shoot me a PM on discord as well @ Aoirc (Mysic)#8306 we are chill group and enjoy having new people to play with :D
---
I am very interested!  Exact kind of guild I'm looking for
---
How do I sell items on the Auction House?
---
level 1 alts can be used to disenchant every boe item in the game even level 60
---
If I want to be able to tank dungeons but heal in raids at 60, which class would be best for that? I realize I'm choosing between pally and druid. I have read that druid tanking is much better for dungeons than pally, but druid healing seems weak and I'm not a fan of that.

 **&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance** **Introduction:** Nostalgia is a raiding guild with a casual schedule, but a hardcore raiding atmosphere. We are built from a core of former top NA raiders that no longer have the time to commit to a rigours schedule, but still want to experience all that WoW Classic has to offer. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible.  **Looking For:**(edited)

We are actively recruiting all players, of any class, that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at the level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be.   **Looting Policies:**(edited)We will be using a fair and transparent loot council system for all 40man raids. All items of epic quality will be distributed using loot council.  **Raid Schedule:**

Friday will be our main raid night, and Sunday will be a spare night intended for extra progression during new content stages.  If you are interested in joining the guild, please use the following link to join our discord channel. Upon joining, please speak with myself through PM's to become a Member of the guild. All Members of the guild will be given a ginvite shortly after the guild is officially created, and hopeful raiders will be promoted to Raider upon reaching level 60 and the MC/Onyxia raid attunement requirements have been met.

---
the big allure of classic for me is that I will never have to grind out levels again after max.
---
I won't have to get completely new gear every 3-5 months, etc etc
---
By never expanding there is never another impending grind because everything you own is fucking useless now.
---
Healing in Vanilla is about managing mana “the 5 second rule”. Learn your way around that, begin to see healing less as a battle to keep everyone at 100 and more to keep people alive and limit overhealing. 
---
Downranking, cancel casting are important in combat. In preparation you’ll want to figure out what the spr::mp5 ratio is ( I can’t remember). 
---
In retail Vanilla there were mods that would show what your average heal for a given spell would be on the action bar button. You’d know what your 3-4 down rank 2.5s heal/gheals healed for and you’d prep casts on the tank and side step to cancel it as late as possible if he hadn’t taken damage by that point. You’d try to keep renews on locks so they could tap away and have appropriate raid healing as needed. 
---
On some longer fights—who knows if people will do this today with higher skill levels—healers would heal out their mana pool, then swap with someone so they could regenerate mana with trinkets or just spirit
---
F
---
Happy that my obsession of saving vanilla/classic related things is helping people
---
Ive played on both a PVP AND PVE server. I found having the freedom to do PVP is my choice on a PVE Server. Ive had just as much fun in battlegrounds than in World PVP.
---
I like to farm for crafting materials in peace and quiet you will not get that in a PVP server. So naturally i will be rolling on a PVE server. However PVP server is fun also but your allways on the lookout for trouble, EVEN if you dont want it.
---
this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQwH0atQZ0Q got me alittle hype for balance
---
That's the point of the meme I guess. Other classes doing the Druid's job better in every way.
---
&gt; This is relevant because you pvp realmers always make characters on realms with severely out proportioned horde alliance ratios. 5 horse to 1 ally? Better roll horde
---
I always played on a PVP Server and faction balance was never an issue.
---
Touche!  I never thought of that
---
Yup. Happened to my druid just yesterday. Get 2-shot by a guard and flagged for 5 minutes because I got too close to a Horde outpost. 😠
---
Warlocks are pretty good you can get insane health stamina and just dot fear wand people
---
ST is really not that difficult to get around if you just know the way.
---
1. there isnt any bonus exp for clearing the dungeon or anything like that, so you pretty much just share the xp with your 4 groupmembers so most people skip or only do the dungeons once for dungeonquests.
---
Warlocks are good too stack stamina dot fear wand people to death
---
Shadow priests represent.
---
We're the kings of garbage.
---
This is pretty much my experience
---
Join a guild that raids alot. Yea you will miss some each week. However you will have time to raid some. Not as often as you like but thats the best you can do. UNLESS you change your shift patterns.
---
That's my life already, spamming the F5 button on this sub.
---
Let me know if you do. We're raiding 19:00-22:00 GMT which would be 14:00-17:00 EST

Afterr seeing this I will have to update my own "the worst spec you can up with" list. At least for warriors.
---
Same name hots don’t stack.
---
Frostbolt spam and drinking in between fights then when you learn blizzard aoe grinding?
---
&gt; Then you are getting camped.
---
I love how you assume you're going to get a second chance, or that you're going to win if you do.  What, you think I'm going to gank you and then run around farming mobs at 10% health?
---
I can help you with this choice but, nothing you said really says anything about your needs or desires for the game. For instance how much time do you plan on putting in? Are you reliable in game? Do you like farming gold?... ect.. ect...
---
the cats from level 30-45ish in various locations drop a vendor item worth 7 or 8s every other kill or so and it can be lucrative.
---
That sounds like a lot more work than just keeping Thorns on yourself and using Fade. :|
---
I never did because raid gear just beat it in almost all cases, I'm glad they moved the release of it up a bit in Classic, I suspect the % of players that raid will be higher the second time around and the gear might actually be useful to them.
---
That does look pretty dope on a dwarf though, might have to get it on my priest the second time around regardless.
---
I would love something like this as well. If you get any leads let me know please!
---
Ele shamans, warlocks, and shadow priests are probably among the hardest match ups. I played alliance, but dueling paladins is truly annoying. I can't imagine for horde having to deal with them. Any decent mage that melee kites you will give you a hard time. Warriors are gonna be able to taunt your pet to break your trap if they are fast enough, once they start getting more gear (like r13) they become more and more troublesome to handle. As a hunter I never wanto get caught by another hunter when im not BM and they are. Ganking any powerful caster requires a good opening. Rogue's are who you hard counter, but you can always get stuck in an unfavorable crippling poison situation.
---
Sometimes you could bait someone into unsuspectedly flagging and jump
---
them lol. Like if a mage is aoe farming etc.
---
Got it done on my alt. By the time it came out my main was in t2. Was pretty fun, iirc. The ubrs part was hard.
---
I was already that guy 15 years ago.
---
Now i am just even fatter and balder
---
I felt I was an honorable rogue. Even on a PvP server I would keep my distance and not instigate something I knew I could finish. It’s like that one guy we all know who is just a freaking hoss, and happens to be the most gentle giant. But, piss him off and... well you’re fooked. It never failed though. I turn my back and next thing I know either a serpent sting, agony, or frost bolt is smacking me in the back of the head. They would always regret it. Only players I would go out of my way to kill were other rogues.... it doesnt make sense but something about other rouges really grinded my gears.
---
It's because a rogue doesn't kill you. He stalks and, murders you. Never at any point can you fight back. The fact the fight can only happen 100% on their terms, is infuriating.
---
Probably not much beyond level 12-15 if at all if I remember correctly.
---
That being said, skip the quest that involves going into the cave - it's time consuming and not worth the trouble.

Once you get a mount it's easy to round up a HUGE group, kite a few seconds in circles making the pack tight, dismount, Nova, cone, finish off with extra AOE.
---
This is opposed to feral, hunter and warlock which chain kill with no downtime.
---
I've played a ton of hunter and feral (leveled 3-4 of each to 60 on pservers) and have closely watched mages aoe grind to compare against the what is also known as top tier levelers. 
---
By the time a mage completes their mounting up, gathering mobs and aoe'ing them down and getting their mana up again to repeat, I could kill just about the same amount of mobs due to having zero down time. It may not be exact and varies by mob type due to the difference between magic resist and physical mitigation, but it can be damn close.
---
Remember though, that frost mage, feral, warlock and affliction warlock are typically a different tier when it comes to leveling speed vs most other classes.
---
I mained pally tank in BC and from what I've seen, vanilla isn't too different with a few major exceptions (no taunt, no shield throw, no damage reduction, no mana from heals).  I think I could try tanking in vanilla but the no ranged pull seems hard to me.  How do you deal with it?
---
Can anyone summarize in tldr or longer if willing, the differences in specs? I realize some specs aren't as viable in vanilla raiding for certain reasons. Would help players who missed out on vanilla to know what classes are and aren't available in terms of performance at 60.

**[A] Kiwi/Aus Semi-casual Raiding Guild (NA | PvE)**
---
In Vanilla WoW, many more people ran dungeons as they levelled. It was common to meet likeminded people and make friends as you journeyed through Azeroth. The world was huge, with lots to experience – and that experience was magnified for people who joined a guild whose members supported and helped each other.
---
This is a guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and give and receive help with classes and game mechanics.
---
**Are you a progression guild?**
---
This is intended to be a guild for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60, but there is an expectation to gear up and delve into raiding (and a bit of level 60 PvP).
---
**What are the requirements?**
---
The guild has a few rules:
---
[*] Be open and willing to accept all different kinds of players, with different levels of experience, a different approach to how they play and different real-life commitments
---
[*] Have a good attitude to the game in general and towards your guildmates, regardless of how they choose to play; be willing to help others where needed, albeit dungeon runs, supporting alts or helping people with group quests
---
[*] Be willing, as you approach level 60, to work towards pre-raid gear
---
[*] Be free for three hours, two nights a week for dedicated raiding progression
---
[*] Be communicative: let the guild leader or other guild officers know if you need to take a break or can’t attend a raid or event.
---
This is about community and helping each other enjoy the game; but understanding that sometimes life itself prevents you from doing everything you may want to do.
---
**Is this guild only for Kiwis/Aussies?**
---
We will be raiding 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week – but anyone is welcome to join.
---
**Do I have to have played vanilla WoW?**
---
I suspect many people who are going to jump into Classic experienced vanilla WoW to some degree. There may be a few dabblers or people who started in TBC or Wrath; but I predict that the majority of those who stick around through to level 60 will be veterans coming into the remake with a nostalgic view.
---
This guild is a place of acceptance, where anyone with the right attitude and willingness to learn and improve can find a home. I’m looking for people with dedication, who are willing to level to 60 and enjoy playing with like-minded people as part of a supportive community.
---
**I didn’t see a name. What is the guild called?**
---
We have a few names in mind, but I’m going to put the guild name to a vote once the game goes live, for two reasons:
---
[*] If I name the guild now, there’s no guarantee that the name will be available when we get the guild charter up
---
[*] Collective, or at least majority agreement on the name, will give people more investment in the guild
---
I understand that some people may not want to commit until they know what the name of the guild is. 
---
We will have many weeks, if not months of levelling to 60, so I don’t expect a full 40-man raid of committed members when Classic goes live. But it sure would be nice!
---
I am also hoping that those who are happy with the choice of name when the time comes will be willing to pitch in and help pay for the guild charter. The more people who pitch in, the sooner we will be able to secure the name that we agree on – if enough people contribute to the 10g fee, we may even snag the name we want within a few days (or even hours) of release.
---
**How do I apply?**
---
We have a guild Discord server (https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3) where you can put in an application; or PM me on Discord: Lokhor#2882.
---
Peace.
---
Its really far out of the way for alliance, so it greatly diminishes the amount of alliance that play there
---
I’d just keep playing rogue. They were cool in vanilla.
---
Interesting... I actually never heard about this and I played vanilla religiously. Is it a priest quest or something? (Never played priest until later)
---
Nah I was thinking pubs and duels, but what are the best for premades?
---
Yeah these kind of oversights are what I'm really trying to get at. I think its possible that we see future patches like 1.14 and so on. I'm interested in discussion about what kind of class design is possible in a no changes kind of debate. 
---
Your example is great and its the kind of thing I'm trying to point out.  Its my opinion that Classic WoW is going to be a huge game. Blizzard is going to keep investing into Classic, the only decent game in the near future is Diablo 4 which might be years away.
---
Over the course of vanilla class design happened every patch. If Classic WoW becomes a huge game we should expect the dev team to continue to support it.  As a community we should discuss what kind of future development were cool with. Correcting oversights and using small and vanilla-like changes to address class design is really something that could happen.
---
That is true about downtime, it's pretty much the only thing that stops mages from being S tier imo, they really speed up once they can get to a point of dungeon farming though (DM won't be at launch but the exp/hr on lashers is totally insane)
---
 Cringe dude.  You need help.  Yelling at other players in game about them doing a sanctioned activity sounds like you’re the toxic one with an issue.
---
Were you Druid tanking on alliance or horde?
---
I think I'm one of the few who actually liked ST. It's my favorite instance and I probably know my way around better than any other.
---
its a quest in bfd that rewards named wand. alliance needs a prequest for it though, which has lvl 20 as requirement, so its only attainable for horde in that bracket.
---
That was my initial thought, but I cant leave my chickens behind you know

Do you want a sticker?
---
Makes sense. As in casual guild, I mean a guild that doesn’t care if you’re going to be at every raid. If they plan on raiding every Wednesday and Saturday, just tell them you’ll make this week’s Wednesday raid and won’t make the next two weeks.
---
Most well functioning guilds have a signup for raid schedules (especially being in 2019 now), so you should be able sign up for ones you can make.
---
Every raiding guild seriously does not expect their guys to make every raid...unless they are shooting for server firsts. 
---
My buddies and I are creating a guild and I straight up told them that I’ll be present at maybe 25-50% of the raids.
---
Technically D2 was designed for non-raiders. The benefit of the set though is that the set is often the only true set bonus for some talent specs not represented well in raiding.
---
I plan on getting it for completionist reasons but, seeing how I will play a hybrid primarily, the set may actually prove to be functional for a meme spec.
---
Have your upvote and get out.
---
No I’m just pointing out your argument is baseless
---
What's that you say?
---
Sorry, I was too busy killing mages with my feral.
---
Can someone help me with my white whale D:
---
It was a male UD swords rogue... All I remember, vividly, was a duel between him and a reck pally by a lake in AV. When the pally has full stacks of reckoning, he pops his trinket, the music amps up (I believe it’s something from the Matrix OST) and it goes into slow-mo as the rogue eats a huge crit to the face.
---
I’ve never been able to find the video with this fight in it, but the fight itself I remember really well. Ah well.
---
Can't be killed, can't quest, because everything is dead :p
---
I don't know which is worse, but they aren't wildly different in the end.
---
Ah awesome. Very nice
---
What did the comment say? I can't see it /cry
---
Moron.
---
[Enjoy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRmldX9Mc00)
---
members of  good/fast guilds will spend like 300-1200g on items each, like on every pserver ,devilsaur,edgemaster,spell power rings and so on
---
I absolutely hate gnomes so im pretty biased but I say roll human, they just look waaaaay better
---
I mean, you dont get unnecessary run backs as often in barrens as you get in RR thats the point. Having to run back to your body and all the quest mobs/turn in is dead is worse than just having the quest mobs/turn in dead.
---
Yeah no idea what he's on about.
---
I died a few times to Alliance in The Barrens. The three mounted elites, never a player.
---
AoE farming, damage coming from spells and not gear (and wands are strong for a time), self sufficient on food and water, quick to teleport. Some pservers also use dynamic respawns for launch control - that benefits mages as they get more efficient mass mob farms. Hunters have low gear dependence plus a pet and aspect of the cheetah. Warlocks are spellcasters, have crafted shadow damage sets and have a tank pet. Druids also level quickly - speed in cat form, no downtime bear with the capabilities of surviving more than one mob aggro.
---
So it's okay to kill a grey level if you are MC'ing them off a high edge to their death, with literally no chance to do anything else, even run away, and give them a repair bill for death by falling, rather than someone walking up and killing them. Not only is the MC a longer corpse run it's repair bill. You are just talking out your ass.
---
I played a rogue to 60 and a warlock to 49, I found the rogue a lot more fun. You can always give mage a shot
---
Good job anyone who did - it’s a rough ride!
---
You’re probably lying so your argument seems correct but even if it is, one data point does not equal a an overall trend
---
I am going full Holy/Disc smite spec up to 60. Never really liked Shadow personally. Still getting Spirit Tap early since its great for leveling.
---
I used to run a guild which would raid whenever there was enough online and we felt like it. This was based upon 25 man raids though. It worked out really good actually. I had everyone understand clearly how it would work before hand. I think we had around 40-50 members total. 
---
Might give this a shot again, but not really a fan of very big guilds and with 40 man raids... Gonna be iffy to manage that with spontanious raids feels like.
---
But who knows, if I get invested enough might try something unusual like that again!
---
I know it is counter intuitive but it did in fact work that way.  I played priest on both factions and had an-alt shaman in vanilla.  
---
I haven't tested it in a long time, but I think it works that way in live still.
---
I rarely changed up my spec after 60, but I remember some guild members complaining about having to pay to go from one role in raids to another role the rest of the time.  It wouldn't be unreasonable to cap the respec fee at something affordable, but I doubt it will happen.
---
Solid repost, you'd think with how few posts get put onto this sub the mods would be better at removing garbage.
---
&gt; Leveling
---
You should stomp practically everyone. The only exception would be druid that can run faster than you/your pet and just run away. Your pet is essentially a warrior the same level as you. Every 1v1 fight you have is effectively a 2v1. The pet is nearly 50% of your damage output. 
---
Post 20/Pre-40: You have the mobility and the damage. Nobody should escape you outside of druids. As long as you don't get jumped on, you should be fine. Other hunters are the bigger issue, and mages can be tricky.
---
Post-40: The other classes start to scale better from the gear they have and get most of their toolkit, and the bottom talent of their talent trees. Expect matchups to get progressively harder as you get closer to 60 (read: they stop being an insta-win). Frost mages aren't as threatening anymore because of Bestial Wrath, which makes your pet hit like a truck *and* immune to all forms of CC while it's active. Everyone having mounts makes Aspect of the Cheetah nowhere near as good as it was pre-40. It's still extremely good, but it won't stop anyone mounted from catching up to you. Casters are generally the ones that can win a fight against you, but they also die pretty fast.
---
60: You can win practically any matchup if you have unlimited kiting range, but you won't have that luxury 90% of the time. Melees are easy, casters can be a pain.
---
Paladins: retadins have no way of catching up to you. Pop cheetah and kite away. If they're not dumb, they'll cleanse viper stings off and will take a bit to kill. You should never be in any danger unless they pop engineering stuff like rocket helm or gnomish nets. Holy paladins are not worth fighting because they'll take forever to kill. You'll be oom before you get them to under 50% mana 
---
Shamans: Enhances are retadins with a bit more range. Just don't get in shock range (20 yards) and you'll be fine. Elemental shamans are much more annoying. They have insane burst from shocks and can burst your entire health in 3-4s if the stars align. They can also cleanse your poisons through either totems or casting themselves. Ooming them isn't a viable strategy but forcing them to spend gcds on dispelling the poisons is one. It forces them on the defensive, and that's exactly what you want to do. You'll have to work on your totem stomping skills with your pet/arcane shots/autoshots to clear totems, especially Grounding Totem, as it eats Freezing Trap instead of the Shaman.
---
Rogues: A pain to fight without a trinket, and a massive pain if they're skilled enough to skull/reflect your trap. Thankfully those good rogues are rare enough. Abuse flare to find them/prevent them from vanishing. Serpent Sting is also a huge help to counter vanishes, just remember to remove it by putting Scorpid Sting if you want to scatter and/or trap the rogue. Trinketing the kidney into immediately scatter--&gt;trapping the rogue works wonders. Good rogues will pop reflector or skull in anticipation of that though. Track Hidden increases your stealth detection range, so make use of that if you know a rogue is around. You have many tools to deal with rogues, but you'll be in a pickle if they open on you and you don't have your pvp trinket ready. Just remember standing in flares in duels is not the best of manners.
---
Warriors: Usually the easiest matchup. You should be able to tag them before they can charge you, forcing them to stay at a distance or use Intercept. Once they use intercept, all you need to do is scatter--&gt;trap them and create distance again. Watch out for warriors taunting the pet, since that means you'll have to delay your trap otherwise your pet will break it.
---
Priest: Priests are extremely easy if you can kite them. You just viper sting them down and they can't do anything about it unless they're a dwarf. If you can't, though, they're a massive pain to fight. Fighting them head on will result in you losing much more often than not. They'll facetank your damage while regening some health. They'll also get stun procs that will mess you, especially if you were trying to create some distance. The good news is that they can't do damage while moving, the bad news is that Shadow Word: Pain still hurts like hell when it ticks. Not a very favorable matchup.
---
Mage: You can kill them extremely easily if you get lucky crits, but they can also kill you very easily if you slip up. Feign Death is useful here for not only traps, but also cancelling their casts on you, especially Polymorph or a Frostbolt if they're trying to shatter you out of nova. A beefy 2hander to scare them away from your melee range or 1h+skull can work against them, though more experienced mages will abuse your dead zone rather than needlessly get in your melee range and eat raptor strike crits to the face. Keep in mind that they have 2 blocks they can use back to back. Not a favorable matchup.
---
Warlocks: The absolute worst class to fight, in duels at the very least. Warlocks can be theoretically kited, but they benefit from it as much as you do if they get to apply 2-3 dots on you before getting out of range. Non-SL warlocks are somewhat manageable because you can burst them down. SL warlocks will win 99% of the time. I've never used it personally, but a shadow resist set would do wonders here. The worst matchup in my opinion.
---
Druid: They'll have a hard time killing you but they can run away whenever they want. Caster druids can be a pain to deal with since they're effectively the same as warlocks: they dot you up and outlast you. Ferals aren't too hard to deal with. Scare Beast is the key to victory here. Druids will either eat the fear and give you free distance+aimed shot or shift out, in which case you need to scatter--&gt;trap them. If you catch them in caster form, they're toast.
---
Hunters: Mirror matchup. Depends on whoever controls the flow of the fight. If the other hunter comes in melee to weave a raptor strike and you don't react to it, you're at a disadvantage. If they trap--&gt;aimed you, that's going to hurt your odds of winning the fight. Serpent or Viper Stings depending on how the fight is going. If it looks like a drawn out fight where both sides are hovering around max range, you'll want to viper sting. If it's going to be a fight around the deadzone where both sides race to kill the other, you'll want serpent sting. Keep in mind that both of these will break trap, cover them with Scorpid Sting if you're going to scatter--&gt;trap them. Fearing the pet after trapping the hunter is a good way to get an aimed shot without interruption. The pet matters a lot in this matchup, since it can eat traps for you and prevent the other hunter from getting an Aimed Shot off if they do trap you. BM hunters will have an advantage over other hunters because hunter v hunter fights usually end up with both hunters trying to use their opponent's deadzone to their advantage, which makes the pet's damage more impactful.
---
Keep in mind that a skilled player can be harder to fight regardless of their class or how well the matchup favors you.
---
I had this addon back in vanilla. Had everything marked off except some recipes from AQ.
---
....and Thistle tea. Learnt that recipe a few times, but kept dropping off my list. Not sure if players who weren't rogues weren't meant to learn it or something.
---
Kerp used to do it back in the days, and you clearly could see it in his videos. Don't think he ever got banned for it?
---
All I know is if you're horde and you die in SW side of the deeprun tram your GY is the GY in Elwynn on the border of Redridge, so don't die.
---
Put yourself in their shoes.
---
They are trash at PvP with fair odds against equal levels, so for them to excel they ha e to fight lowbies.
---
Makes perfect sense
---
&gt;I'm in EST, but I might try an EU server to allow me to raid during the day before night-shifts.
---
That would be perfect for me actually. How many days a week are you guys planning and do you need warlocks?
---
Use the way back machine to look up an archive of thottbot from the time period that corresponds to phase 1. Maybe like 3/1/2005?
---
Holy shit this video is better than 90% of PvP videos out there. Lol A+
---
The same could be said for your own argument.
---
I'm pretty sure you couldn't even see faction server ratio back in Vanilla so how someone was supposed to know one side is dominant is beyond me.
---
If you really want to check the facts go look-up the faction pop history for Agamaggan-EU. Whilst you're at it, come back with some data to support your outrageous claim about faction imbalance on PVP servers.
---
Just because the math is stacked against you, doesn't mean the skill ceiling is high. You can play a prot paladin perfectly, and the result is still gonna be mediocre at best.  
---
Lets say warrior has 8 abilities, and if played well or perfectly. He will do 750-1000 threat per second.  
---
The prot paladin has 3 ability, and if done perfectly. Will do 350 threat per second.  
---
It's not about who can bring the best result. It's about who has to be the more skilled, to get the maximum potential out of their class. The metric is relative in nature. It can be very easy to get 300 threat out of a paladin, and very difficult to get 350 threat. While a bad prot warrior can only do 400 threat, but played perfectly can do 1000 threat per second. If the difference between a new player, and a perfect player barely exist, the learning curve is not steep.
---
As someone who's strongly considering rolling on a pvp-server:
---
*Normal* (hint's in the name) servers are the standard, intended way to play the game, and pvp-servers are just that: servers with an additional rule set.
---
Going with that analogy you are going to that restaurant, ordering that steak-dish, insisting that the chef smothers it with tabasco sauce, then getting upset that not everyone wants that vinegary shit.
---
Meanwhile in the real world the normal servers are there on the menu, as are pvp and rp ones. No-one is telling the chef to leave out anything. Chill.
---
Some items made by specialties can still be use if you decide to switch speciality later on. They only require an engineering level to be use.
---
Sunday + Monday are planned raid days. All classes are welcome. No minimum raid attendance required either. 
---
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bg03cn/looking_for_group_monday_april_22_2019/elj2u69/) the full recruitment post with Discord link if you're interested.
---
I found a guild here that raids at like 10pm-2am or something crazy like that on Friday and Saturday nights.
---
Use the LFG thread, please.
---
Tauren Druid
---
Use the What Should I Play (WSIP) Wednesdays threads, please. Link on the right sidebar. Thank you.
---
“PvP belongs in battlegrounds”
---
..... lol!! I’m sorry but anytime I see someone hating on pvp servers I immediately assume you’re a terrible pvper and think less of you
---
All the replies in this thread give me confidence that Classic is going to be an amazing community.  PVP servers are the best!
---
This was actually a private server bug, it was supposed to be available to horde and alliance at 19
---
Attitudes have changed since 2004 but what remains the same is that people will say a lot of stupid stuff just to intentionally trigger other people, and given how easy it is to do that these days I'd say there's probably going to be a lot of trolls in Barrens /1.
---
It won't affect you unless you let it though.
---
So the goal is to lvl one, make as many of the items as you hope you'll ever need ever then swap to the other specialty? That seems like a lot of work for not much benefit to me. /shrug
---
You're right, I'm still stuck in the mindset where 90%+ attendance was required to be in a decent guild. Hopefully people will chill out this time around.
---
I love this meme
---
Not to piss on your parade too hard but likely if you have a guild that doesn't mind about optimizing builds at all and just have fun it will be hard to maintain a roster. People will likely get geared then frustrated by lack of prog and find greener pastures. That's just my experience from playing in a fairly casual raiding guild in vanilla. GL with it though! Im sure with a steady recruitment plan you'll be able to maintain a roster.
---
I feel like Nelf/Tauren Druid goes without saying :p
---
I think its a player, it has the box around his name where as npc's don't.
---
I know, and I agree there is alot of that type of pvp that happens. But especially in phase 2 alot is going to be mutual. I'm pretty sure you were exaggerating when you said 99% but for some reason that stuck with me cause thats nowhere near what it will be lol.
---
Undead mages are always super popular...can't imagine why tho it's a true mystery :^ )
---
As for unpopular I think troll warriors are pretty rare (also one of my favorites), female dwarf anything but definitely rogue is rare af.
---
Only people who are good at wow can play priests.
---
I can’t imagine with out LP. I even donated. Seriously the best add on ever. Turning in WSG marks became so easy.
---
afaik its actually the opposite, some private servers changed it to 19 both for balance reasons.

you:

also you:

"Getting ganked in WoW isn't suffering"

So is it suffering or isn't it? Why would you expect them to cry if it didn't matter? Why does the idea of someone crying appeal so much to you? The mental somersaults you've done to justify your absolute dogshit view on this matter are truly impressive.
---
The whole topic of this is two comments that were shitting and were posted as hatred. You said those qualify. So how based on either criteria do those comments equate to hatred.
---
To melt faces in PvP.
---
Found them all, along with more from their creators! Will be uploading within a few hours.
---
Frost mages are the most infuriating class in the game to fight imo, they can do so much shit and have no big weaknesses besides being squishy (even this is mitigated by mana shield) Hating on rogues is honestly a meme.
---
Holy shit these posts are annoying.  
---
Just play what you want people.
---
Troll anything is pretty rare.
---
Well then I really shouldn’t

Moooeow

Priesr Tier 1 with benediction is the most iconic vision of Vanilla WoW to me. Also, mind controlling off lumber mill in AB and in to the lava in BRM.  We are also not bad in PvP, check out my video if you get a chance.

One of my favorite vanilla videos
---
&gt; I will never get how people make a statement like that even though they might've never touched a Prot Paladin. 
---
Probably because Protection Paladins aren't even viable as a serious raid tank so people don't even bother to consider them as an option.
---
Haha, I'm really bad at this convincing-people thing.
---
Lolol so true
---
They have +50 in "relationship with kids".
---
It’s whichever is the furthest away.  Little insider trick.
---
could be worse. could be a mushroom.
---
Yeah, though a warrior that gets a charge off = dead anything. Smite's mighty hammer Overpower's crit for like 400+ w/ crusader up
---
Dwarf female anything
---
Couldn’t agree more with this take
---
I like to remember Blizzard when it was a way of life...a Vivendi--if you will. Today its so focused on being a forward thinking corporate entity, as though it has an...active...vision...
---
K bye.

Nobbel87 has a shitload of videos on his YouTube page having to do with wow lore and they’re quite good, highly recommend that
---
Region: NA  
---
Server Type: PVP
---
Intended Faction: Alliance  
---
Raid times: flexible(PST)  
---
Priority: Looking for primarily raiding but enjoy world PVP and BGs for funsies  
---
DM is fine for contact  
---
A Bit Extra: I played during mid to late vanilla have multiple years played on my rogue but also looking into warrior(for tanking), Would be Dwarf Rogue or Human Warrior for main.
---
It usually depends whether you are running with a group or just out soloing. Then it also depends which pet you are running with. Then also whether or not the warrior is undead and/or has a pvp trinket equipped. between trinket and zerkers rage they are basically immune to fear, and they will kill you before your dots will kill them if they use pummel, fear, and intercept to keep you locked down.
---
I do classify it as the same difference, yes. I leveled on a pvp server in vanilla and was ganked by high levels, and like wise ganked low levels. I expect it will happen again as well. It's not the least bit toxic behavior or "filth" as you put it. It's literally a game about waging war against the opposing faction. 
---
If you or anyone else can't enjoy the game with this feature, but still enjoy competing against other players as you you have stated you like pvp. Then roll on PVE server, where battlegrounds are a thing, where you can engage in pvp with people who aren't gray leveled to you.
