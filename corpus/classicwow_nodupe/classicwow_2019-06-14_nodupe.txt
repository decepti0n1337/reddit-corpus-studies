This rules dude. I would buy a full print of this for my house.

The timing on this gank was just too perfect.
---
8 btw
---
I loved grinding on the plague bats in EPL, the bat eyes sell well when the darkmoon faire comes to town, and their grey vendor crap sells well for coins, Whit a good chance for good drops.
---

---
Another good place was the yetis in winterspring, easy to kill, lots of them, and with skinning loads of rugged leather. 
---
Blue dragonkin caves in winterspring too. Great coin, drops and leather /scales.
---
I’m fairly certain this is incorrect based on a ton of other sources and common knowledge.  Miss resists and the target resisting your spells are two different things.
---
I love the old graphics.
---
My plan is to find a group to raid with after the wife and kid go to bed. Thats gonna be 11pm-2am probably.
---
Its just gonna be hard for me to raid. But i accept that.
---
Lol that was a brutal raid wipe.
---
Mine was 45s I think. I’d tried farming but burned out and they were going for around 200g usually on AH.
---
Moderation. Dont overdo it. Set aside 2-3 hours a night to game, period. You have your life, your family and girlfriend see u, and you have your time at night. 2-3 hours is more than enough time to get shit done.

Why doesn't blizz hire you already these maps are so delicious

You need to google how normalization works. Too busy rn to reply but 2h weapons arent treated as having the same speed as 1h weapons.

Horde get the +25 Fishing Pole from Revantusk Village in The Hinterlands. The best Alliance can do is farm crab traps for the +20 one. Unless you win the fishing tournament, that’s BIS and is +35.
---
Did it already
---
It's great cause it incentives dungeon runs beyond just for completing their related quests. I don't want more quests added to the game that'll allow people to  have decent gear and speed to 60 via quests alone. It's another reason I like the fact that there are not enough quests available to get from 50-60 by quests alone
---
I don't like most of the art that gets posted here and on r/wow but this is amazing. Really good job.
---
So you're saying it takes 18.5 days IN GAME TIME to get this? Nah don't think so.
---
Terrible or not.. this is what feral Druid pvp is in vanilla at 60.  Not a lot of mana to switch forms/heal.  Inspired my 13 y/o self to play Druid.
---
I stand corrected then. However that will change, the level 60 blue sets are way way too strong for phase 2 release.
---
Please 1.13 with vanilla design in systems. I don’t want to go back to tbc. No changes. TBC is too many changes .
---
ok
---
People always need tanks for dungeons.  Finding 5man groups should be easy.
---
I have plans for four characters.  Only one if them could tank, but it probably won't.

Im going to go with brd

Another benefit of adding additional options would be helping to account for some items (like DFT) which are BiS for pretty much everyone but casters, healers, and bears.
---
It would be cool if there was a way to get atop the southern cliff of Thousand Needles from this zone. Have a few more of the mesas accessible by bridges.
---
Throw a shaman in the caster group and have him use tranquil air totem, boom threat reduced.
---
Nice, same man!
---
Play druid, least played class and not gear dependant.
---
He’s claimed a lot of false things in vanilla and people are starting to say he never played vanilla or private servers and is just cashing in on the hype.
---
I started playing spring of 2005, I was 16, ended up raiding and experiencing a good deal of end game but there is SO much that I either missed or didn’t pay attention to...along with the nostalgia fix I’m looking forward to delving into different places, aspects, and dungeons in  the game that i spent less time with. Taking my time, following the lore more attentively. I think that player will be around for a while after the nostalgia is gone.
---
Would love to see a list of all rare pets, anyone hook me up?
---
Spirit is dog shit to a mage. That 5% int could be the difference between crit or not, sheep or not. Life and death.
---
And you don’t get to compare Perception to 5% int. It gets compared to Escape Artist where it again loses by a mile.
---
&gt;The only content they will miss out on is wpvp...
---
This made me lol pretty hard. WPvP is **Massive** in vanilla wow.......... the majority of it is also only on PvP servers too.
---
I met a girl in lfr in cata in a similar fashion. I was just doing heroics with some friends, not in coms cause we were just grinding out heroics on alts for valor or w/e, so we were chatting in party chat. I mentioned the name of the college i went to, she said she said she lived near there. I, naturally, continued to group with her long after I reached the weekly cap. We met up a few days later and continued seeing each other all summer. 
---
TLDR: LFG tool got me laid. The only good thing lfg did. #nochanges!
---
Carefully now he's a hero
---
I'll be farming for the gold for it on a tertiary alt who happens to be a paladin.  It may take a bit to get the cash
---
LOL fake hate crime 😂
---
I remember G4 doing a segment on someone who complete this grind. Somebody got on TV for doing this thing, that's how insane of a grind it is. No
---
You're _allowed_ to dislike things out of ignorance.
---
They destroyed their own games heart and soul is something I realize as I read the book. Their philosophy was just right. Appealing to casuals but with hardcore elements and time consumed and the reward being in complete symphony together. 
---
I think it’s what happens when you iterate so much for so long , you end up chiseling and tweaking so much over time — current wow is a mobile game in feel and I wonder how the original devs would feel if they knew where the game was heading in betraying its core philosophy.
---
Look at the most successful 'content' for the creators has been from the beta so far. Duelling tournaments, raid vs raid world pvp, ganking other streamers. From the beta we also know dungeon farming is a completely viable way of levelling - so being mass ganked as a streamer now isn't a concern for pvp realms. Given all that you can expect most of them to be rolling on PvP.
---
A little bit every night after work. Slowly getting to 60. The leveling to 60 is the fun part. We're in no rush. It's not like we will be playing BFA.
---
It totally depends on your guild. I’d find one now, loads recruiting, and talk with the officers. Your heavily into PvP so they’ll understand.
---
Into BWL, I’d say it’d be fine till you reach the 3 drakes. But your issue will come if others have hybrid specs too. There will come a point where you will need to respec, to progress.
---
Alliance is:
---
* Humans
---
* Humans with pointy ears
---
* Very short Humans
---
* Short and fat Humans
---
Yeah. There should.  I tested my hypothesis that nothing form p2 made it into the p2 BiS list, and I was wrong.  There is p2 gear, so a p1 list is needed
---
holy shit, theyre gonna starve this month

&gt;They've already said the world will not be layered after phase 1
---
Ion before that said that "layering" will be only in leveling zones for 2 weeks. Now it's across all level ranges for an unknown time (how long is stage 1?)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hold these developers accountable for their actions. I'm fine with layering for a starting zone or levels 1-19. Anyone who's played a private server launch will tell you it's a total clusterfuck, even with dynamic respawns. I understand why Blizzard is doing it, but to have it across all level ranges is incredibly exploitable.
---
Probably because private servers are a terrible way to represent outcomes in the retail game. Considering during vanilla, horde mostly dominated BGs.
---
With the proximity to Highperch I could see some wyverns finding their way into this zone. I can't think of anywhere else that wyvern enemies have been used.
---
Completely depends on why you play... It's a great time to meet people/run around the world, get flight paths etc...
---
i'm... not sure why this is a question. i'll just play the game. simple.
---
lol no - layers have issues, new servers don't present any of the same issues.
---
they should not repeat the expansions as we had them but instead as you are alluding too, create the game that could have been if expansions had occurred.
---
I’ve been doing some digging, on guy was chill about 100 viewers and no webcam on screen... another was swapping between his own webcam of himself with filters and the game constantly. Last one just screamed memes at his audience lmao
---
I think if you keep living like this you will have a mid life crisis early 30s
---
Frost nova example: chance to hit is rolled 1st &gt; then entire spell damage and effect is applied (with damage being reduced by gear/talents).
---
Exactly what I was thinking lmao
---
You keep pasting that paragraph like it helps you lol. We have a clear example of what's deemed harrassment/griefing from one of my previous replies.
---
All the more reason for me to play on a PvE server.
---
They’ll roll rp pvp
---
Boar fighting adventures is the real bfa
---
Pretty funny that nobody thought of just looking behind themselves.
---
Have you had any good drops ? Any blues?
---
Nope. It’s an objective fact that adding buffs that trivialize the content to a LFR / face roll level is bad for what Vanilla was. Blizzarddidn’t expect the player base to adapt and use them in this way, 
---
Now, if they wanna buff the content to the point that these buffs are needed, then sure.
---
I can assure you that the game had blood splatter on the ground when it launched.  
---
From the back of the game box: [https://imgur.com/gallery/CYTTOUZ](https://imgur.com/gallery/CYTTOUZ)  
---
And the entire reason for this post is to see if anyone have any ingame screens or similar. To my dismay they never documented it in the patch notes.
---
Nothing. Druid beats mage
---
On launch? No. 
---
A couple months in? Sure.
---
Okay so first you polymorph the sucka. Then you log off and switch to the much better way more alpha warrior. Then you cry.
---

---
I mean I kinda have no life whatsoever, so even with a full-time job, I can still find plenty of time to play.
---
LOTRO did it! It had a really good solution for "how do you make it work in an MMO?". Instanced neighborhoods. So if you want a house near Bree, you go to a small valley a bit southeast of Bree where there's an instance door. When you try to enter that door, a window pops up with a list of neighborhoods. Every neighborhood in the Bree-land location has the same layout, with 30 houses. 16 are small, 10 are large, and 4 are guild-sized. If most of the neighborhoods are getting full, the devs just open a few new ones.
---
So in this way, there's infinite space for people to buy houses, but they don't have to make every single house isolated to accomplish that. You get to actually have neighbors! You might even end up with two guilds having parties at their guild houses down the road from each other at the same time!
---
Now, the decoration system was super weak, so I don't really remember this feature being super popular when I played (before it went f2p). But I want to point out that this was implemented long before it went f2p, and you could not buy these houses with real money. Only with gold. And they cost gold upkeep per week too.
---
...And uh, since this thread is actually about the day/night cycle, I want to say that I liked LOTRO's day/night cycle better than WoW's 24-hour one. It was more like single-player open-world games, like The Elder Scrolls, in that the day was much shorter than 24 hours to match how the world was much smaller than it was realistically supposed to be. In WoW it takes about an hour to run from one end of a continent to the other, so obviously the world is supposed to be bigger in the lore. With a shorter day, you could say that it takes you most of an Azeroth day to run that distance. But the bigger benefit of LOTRO's was that it wasn't an even number. A day/night cycle in LOTRO was 3 hours and 6 minutes. Imagine someone who gets only 1 hour to play their MMO, from 8pm to 9pm. In WoW, they would never get to see what Azeroth looks like in broad daylight. But in LOTRO, because the cycle gets shifted by 6 minutes every time, someone playing from 8pm to 9pm would have a different Middle-Earth time of day every time they played.
---
if you are not sure if you have the time to raid and you love tanking, warry is the perfect choise.
---
tl:dr take warry tank and assemble your own dungeon groups when you want to amd have the time
---
lets say you play as an willing dungeon tank. you already got the most important part, the tank.
---
you log in after a days work, got about 2h time to play. you start your " lfm 3dps 1heal strat/scholo/dm" makro. while the first whispers come in and you quickly assemble your group you check your auctions,repair your gear and head to the dungeon. because your group is full and you got another 10dps whispers which you habe to decline while waiting for the Zeppelin.
---
Youdo your dungeon, have your fun and log out after 1h50
---
now if you play a dps and god forbid an dps warry you log in, look at the /2 chat, pick a lfm message and whisper only to get a whisper back with "sorry already full" "we need a cc dps sorry" "already got 2warrys sorry"
---
after 30minutes you finaly find a group willing to take you. you wait at the dungeon start to clear and realise you have to go offline in 20minues cause you wasted 1h finding a group amd travelling. everyone is anoyed and wont take you anymore cause nobody likes leavers im the middle of a dungeon.
---
I heard a leak that the first expansion will be the Burning Crusade and supposedly Illidan will be a major end boss!
---
Old Ironforge.
---
Isn't that exactly what the devs already said? Layering is just for launch and it will be removed after the initial launch period is done
---
then you're gonna be in for a big surprise.... 2 months is a VERY long time when it comes to polishing this stuff. 
---
plus i seriously seriously doubt theyre using most current version of the layering software on the beta - thats not how blizzard does things
---
Christ you are actually dense. Best of luck with your speed stuff.
---
Well... dungeons are good anyway because of the quality of gear. Not a whole lot of blues as quest rewards. In particular for gear dependent classes it is a HELL of a hamstring and if you get behind that curve you are then less effective in dungeons until you fill the gap.
---
I get you what you're saying though.
---
Did you play classic? The odds of seeing someone running around in the exact same tier set as you isn’t very likely. 
---
It was a big deal to pug a group for a 5 man and then zone into the dungeon to see them rocking one or two pieces of tier armor. It was an instant friend/bonding moment. 
---
People have forgotten the power that tier sets had on the social eco system. I hope transmog disappears forever for all versions of WoW!
---
Launch will be a shitshow.
---
For AOE grinding to work you need almost no competition for mobs.
---
At launch, there will be a ton of competition.
---
That's a good start.  I'd love it if in the future they did community driven events, like the Naxx invasion.
---
Z h i t
---
I would note that the rend math is much more favorable than that. You don't need anything like a full uptime to make it the best thing you can do. 
---
Consider level 16, one of the worst levels for rend (it's right when you upgrade heroic strike but 6 levels after your last rend upgrade).
---
Rend costs 10 rage, does 28 damage, is talented to go up to another +35%, but ignores armor.  So, rend does 37.8 average damage, through armor, in 12 seconds.
---
Heroic strike, which you probably won't have talented, but fuck it, let's just go all out, costs 12 rage, but forfeits the rage you would have gained on the autoattack, so that's going to be at least 3 and probably more like 5+, so say heroic strike costs 15 rage (which is wildly optimistic, 20 rage is far more common), does 32 damage and does not ignore armor.  Armor reduction is typically in the 25% range at this level (700 armor at level 16 is ~28% damage reduction). 
---
So heroic strike does ~22 damage for 15 rage, in the best possible scenario, which will never happen because no one is talenting heroic strike. 
---
So the damage per rage is like 3.8 vs 1.46. Meaning you need 2 ticks of rend to make it better than heroic strike, at one of it's worst possible levels.  which is 6 seconds of it's 12 second duration.
---
TLDR: if you can get HALF a rend off, it's worth applying over using a heroic strike.
---
Poly a druid?
---
Yes. You summon echeyakee with a quest item, tame it, abandon the quest. Go back to Xroads, take quest again and complete quest. Tadaaaa
---
Is this a long grind just so you can tame one of these animals? I'm not familiar so don't shoot me.
---
I mean you could make the same pointless anecdote about how layering will help you because without it you wouldn’t have been able to log in to meet your friend. Layering is fine it just needs to be super temporary, like maybe days.
---
Use the weekly thread
---
I find it weird that people find that satisfying. I honestly wouldn't want to attack someone like that unprovoked, why would someone just want to ruin someone else's enjoyment of the game like that?
---
You could just have her play Warcraft 3
---
The servers cant handle 15k people all being in one spot. That's the whole point. Layering has nothing to do with player experience. It's all about having the game be actually playable. Even with layering the starting zones will be hell. Good luck looting cactus apples when there are 200 people looting the same 12 nodes
---
So basically what they said they were going to do at Blizzcon. Then it got expanded to phase 1. Layering isn't going to ruin classic but it's sure going to make it less fun.

&gt;Lok'tar Ogar, brother!  
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.  
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal *efficiency*. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job *done*. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking *survive*, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).  
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.  
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.  
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara *and*Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.  
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.  
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! *For the Horde!*

Using /cast [harm,exist] is great! Thank you for this comment

It’s dropped for me in LFG in WoD while dungeon leveling and I didn’t get it. Worst day of my life.
---
What sort of dinosaurs did you have in mind to occupy this zone? I'm thinking it would have to be limited to pterrordaxes and raptors to keep the wow factor of seeing the really big ones when you finally do set foot in Un'goro. Also, Marshal's Refuge was put where it was because the big dinos couldn't get up there.
---
The sand troll inclusion is an interesting one. I could see them trying to tame a few pterrordaxes.

Lol pretty much nothing on the box has anything to do with the actual game. [Here's 100hours of Joana playing vanilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJaQJw1Wf2s&amp;list=PL49Ga_-r7iKkxrbckm9CkUhWzxqrOnw-n). Find me a single pool of blood from a mob he kills.

That’s a little dramatic

I had this mount on my dwarf hunter back in the day. Such a goofy combo and I loved it.
---
I forgot though..did non-NE have to get exhalted with Darnasssus before Winterspring for this mount? I feel like I did both, but it was so long ago...

If you think Blizzard would let the servers crash for the AQ event you really don't know how any of this works

Get lucky with crits, basically. A lot of crits.

Shield Slam Damage with https://classicdb.ch/?item=9458:

Did I fuck up ? I think your math is broken man.
---
Clap requires battle stance, so has the same issues as overpower in terms of having to dance. Demo shout is not good threat but it's good to use when facing multiple melee enemies.
---
Unlike healing, battle shout threat is not split among all enemies on the threat list. It gives x*y threat to each mob. Where x is the threat of battle shout (modified by def stance) and y is the number of players given the buff.
---
I did the same lol. Good times
---
It all just sounds so stressful.
---
I already barely get any time to play. I usually play early mornings on the weekends when the family is asleep. I occasionally go to schools or functions out of town for a month at a time or so and I willl usually spend all my free time on wow. I travel quite often so that’s the only upside to travel. I’d rather not and see my kids but jobs a job.

This is going to be 1.12, which nerfed hunter pets attack speed.

I can honestly say, from working in a high school, that kids are talking about actually trying it out thanks to seeing it on twitch's front page. Some of my students have even said they want to play because they remember their older siblings playing or that they've seen the south park episode (because it's a classic throwback)
---
Correct me if I am wrong but aren’t grenades an incapacitate so would hardiness even work against them?

It's not wall jump. They are jumping on structure and finding a way out. Wall jumping is technically different but gets you into the same place(off map).
---
Awesome pic of Underciry, keep up the good work!

It's like having layered servers has more repercussions beyond exploits and shows how having larger servers than in vanilla is a bad idea
---
There have been a lot of ridiculous things said on this board but this takes one takes the cake.

This. I kept the ice barbed spear that you got from finishing your first AV until I finally farmed two of those damn 1h axes from...strath?...I had T2 legs before I finally got rid of that dang thing...
---
I also share this sentiment. Beautiful times those were
---
I feel like 99% of people here don't understand the actual impact and damage of layering being abusable early on into the game. Those of you saying things like, "It's necessary and only for the first few months!" The players that hit level 60 first already have a huge advantage on taking over the market and economy of the game because they have free reign on the devilsaur skins and rich thorium / black lotus / other high end herbs.
---
Being able to abuse layering on something like Black Lotus is literally game breaking. There's only 1 per level 60 zone (Winterspring / Silithus / EPL / Burning Steppes) and once its picked it takes exactly an hour to respawn. If you can abuse multiple layers and get more than 1 per hour in a single zone, it's hugely economy breaking as Black Lotus is the single-most sought after material in the game. Rich Thorium is almost as damaging because there is a bit more of it. So you do a route through Winterspring then relayer and do the same route and find the same number of nodes potentially. It multiplies potential gathering out in the world by the number of layers its possible to switch to taking what might be 30-50g / hour and turning it into 60-100/90-150/120-200g depending on how many layers are up. That 30-50g is already an astounding amount to be able to farm in an hour in vanilla and that's only in ideal situations where there aren't many others competing with your farm. (Like when you rushed to 60 and got there early.)
---
If layering is abusable on launch there will be a 1% rich player situation that controls every auction house market on every server for the entirety of the server's life because of how far ahead they are able to get in the first few weeks alone, let alone the first few months.
---
I saw the high level Naga there a few days ago and wondered if that was accessible content.
---
Generally you'd only bet swapped into a group of priests (or other healers I guess) to drop mana tide, you wouldn't stay in the group permanently. Though this was all actually in Vanilla and only my recollection, after 15 years that's probably very primitive
---
You just cast frostbolt, juke charge (very easy to see coming). You do way more dps than them and if they cast heal you CS. You should be able to kill them through rejuvs/NS with just frostbolts before they can get through your hp + barriers. Nova/blink is all just a waste of mana. Don't be scared of their dps and try to be fancy - you have 3x their dps with just frostbolt. If they try to kite you just blink away at max range and enjoy the free ticks of food/water.
---
Could be in thelsmar or kharanos or any dwarf building for that matter lol.
---
If there's any indication from Warcraft 3: Reforced, they are at the very least re-working the Warcraft 3 cinematics - maybe this time even include the famous Arthas vs. Ilidan fight as a Cinematic.
---
Who's to say if they redo the Classic cinematic but it would be a nice touch. After all, this isn't 1.12 - it's 1.13.
---
I'll be honest - I've been thinking that we need to start a campaign to get OP noticed as a candidate for the creative team. If we bring their ideas to Blizz's attention (and classic does as good as we all hope it will) that will give them plenty of time to to mull over the idea of 1.13 and, hopefully, bring them into the team.
---
I've thought a lot about it too, especially after the implementation of garrisons in WoD. I would have loved to have seen bigger spaces to explore, less reliable forms of fast travel, and some kind of mobile housing. Not a mobile home, but camping gear, like a tent and sleeping roll. You would be able to gain rested XP by sleeping in your tent anywhere in the world, and you could upgrade it by doing quest lines or getting dungeon/raid drops, that would let you to use your camp like a crafting station, cooking station, or just gain certain buffs on login when you slept there for a certain amount of time.
---
No it's not he said poly him and log off while he is morphed.
---
Can I use this as my Twitter header?
---
I’m not sure, but do instances count as layers? You could just run inside and once everyone is inside you’re together. Just not in the open world.
---
Hehe
---
Awesome answer, Gnome it is then.
---
They're tough, but the way I approach them is to tick their health down till they get to where I think I can burst kill them. Improved silence them before a big cast so they can't insta heal. Don't go all in at the start. Imo one of the most attrition based fights for a mage.
---
add a balance druid set plx
---
I personally don't enjoy doing that, no matter how hard I try I just can't attack someone unprovoked. I do, however, refuse to play any mmo where cruelty like that isn't possible. It's just not rewarding enough. I fully support raw cruel pvp, even if I personally can't do it.
---
Best of luck with your Spirit Mage build, lawl.
---
Old school runescape. There is no pre determined expansion releases. At least under their model.
---
With layering and if you no life it to get ahead of the pack a bit it should be pretty good. If you're in the scrum and everything's contested then forget about it.
---
Yes it's fun no you won't be left out
---
You do understand that servers 14 years ago held a lot less people than servers do now?
---
So one layer of server in Classic may have the same or even more people than a full server had originally.
---
I got invited and haven’t logged in once, and probably won’t at all.  Only reason you don’t hear more about it is because all the salty cry babies downvote whoever mentions it into oblivion.  At least that’s been my experience. 
---
Why opt in?  In case I decided I wanted to check it out, or if any of my friends or family wanted to.  Was kind of surprised when none of them did.  Also didn’t think I’d actually get in.
---
The punchline from my favorite 40k-explaining story: 
---
"Catholic space nazis sound like awesome bad guys! How are they the good guys?"
---
"By comparison."
---
Yeah you couldn't be more wrong.
---
Playing the game at level 10 or playing the game at level 60 is enjoyable.
---
Classic is about the journey, not the destination. There's no rush to 60 for the average player and you will enjoy yourself at any level or state of gear.
---
Yeah if you spirit rez a few times, like this guy suggests, it will cut the time down a lot.
---
Well, sure there's an alternative. We've been over this twice. They can add a delay. Plenty of high viewer streamers delay their streams to mitigate stream sniping.
---
If they can't defend themselves, that's their problem :) besides, knowing where someone is doesn't really confer an advantage in wow like it does in a shooter. It's not hard to see someone coming.
---
Lmao threatening to go to the cesspool that is vanilla private servers because of layering. Cya mate you won’t be missed, don’t come crying when the server goes down due to some illegal scam the owners were running.
---
maybe he was just talking about the accent aigu!
---
Like i said, it was removed VERY early on and thus i wonder if anyone have any screens from when it was in.
---
Definitely not. Those cost Blizzard a minimum of $2-3 million each to make and they're penny pinching hard on Classic.
---
Fix to that is more servers, less people per server.
---
Same result as layering, just without all the possible exploits that ruin the game for others.
---
90 minutes is a speed run, how the times have changed
---
Smh
---
Did you skip the felix's tools and shit quest? Cause each of those nodes have like a 5 min timer... good luck on live!
---
I'm quite a fan of Female (Male)s, myself.
---
Unpopular opinion, Night Elf for better stealth to sneak into Horde cities and gank flagged players.
---
Honestly it really depends on your playstyle and what you want to do. For PvP Orc, undead, dwarf and gnome all have very strong "on paper" racials. Human perception can be very useful in specific instances and more overall hits. Trolls for slightly easier leveling and Ooga pride. 
---
For purely PvE humans are hard to argue with, +5 weapon skill is so strong for a sword/mace build.
---
But it's just not a viable alternative. It's an alternative just like walking is an alternative for the person commuting to work for 2 hours every day. 
---
I don't know which streamers you're talking about who do that. Maybe established pro players during tournaments?
---
Whenever I see those dungeon swirlies it makes me really curious what sort of dungeon you have in mind.
---
"Circa" means "roughly around the time of".
---
So "circa 2005" means "sometime around 2005". It's used when an exact date/time is not known.
---
Lol
---
That's gonna be a no from me dog
---
Yes. The only reason it would not be fun is if you try to compare your progress to the progress of people who play 12 hours a day. There will be different people to play with at every step of your own progress.
---
Whatttt the fuck thats so good!
---
This will cause private servers to have a course for operation still since Blizzard isn't providing the service anymore.
---
I doubt Blizzard is going to sell level boosts in Classic. I find it more likely that they will put a level squish in retail, increase the time it takes to reach max level (rewarding feeling for reaching new levels/benchmarks) and take away the free level boost with expansion purchase.
---
This is going to let them pitch retail as going back to some core values while at the same time ensuring that their little in-game transaction system produces decent revenue.
---
I think you play the time you got to play and find people who are in same boat. If you can't be the ultimate raider you can go leveling do dungeons and stuffs at your time. In opposite faction you gonna find people in same spot as you. We should accept we not gonna be the guys ahead on server. But part of it. I'm on same boat and I'm going play not thinking in the future but the present. It is having fun.
---
Some say BFA is more casual friendly I don't think one is more than the other. In retail wow every month new stuff is added to game so in the end i can't catch the hardcore players. 
---
I'm going for classic. Having fun making friends.
---
&gt; Orc for Horde, Gnome for Alliance.
---
UD rogue is better than Orc Rogue unless you plan to only ever fight other rogues.
---
PvE lists are overdone tbh. A good PvP list would be greatly appreciated at this point (difference in hit rating, spell pen etc)
---
That's something I noticed after a while playing vanilla, yeah. A shitload of buildings/architecture is copypasted across a lot of the game.
---
Just shows how tight of a time constraint they were under for getting the game ready for release.
---
No such thing as overcrowding? Like 10000 people trying to fit on one server that doesn’t have dynamic respawns (like literally every single private server has turn on). It’s literally unplayable. The stress test showed that, it was literally unplayable for melee classes to level.
---
I can’t remember what races are what, but make sure you choose a troll class that a Tauren can be otherwise you are going to have a tough time finding a class trainer.
---
Yeah, we actually had clears down to a science with 5 dps. We’d run, reset and run again 3-8 hours a day. If we couldn’t find a fifth we 4manned it. My favorite was sunken temple. We got it down to 30-45 min clears. Course solo tanking last boss of scholomance from 50% was a highlight as well. Adrenaline rush blade fury and ghostly strike/evasion were ftw
---
It's fun but you will feel overwhelmed and frustrated at times.
---
Fair enough I guess. Villains do have to exist in a world like that I suppose, and what's a better villain than that skull-marked Orc who camped you several times in Redridge Mountains? But I still just can't agree with the viewpoint that using outside sources is acceptable. I'd like at least some notion of honor, which is already lacking when some high level dude just kills you for no reason but at least that type of dishonorable action still holds to the immersion of the game, whereas blatantly using outside information just breaks that.
---
The "possible exploits" that "ruin the game" are:
---
a - They might get more ore nodes than you.
---
b - They might loot TWO chests!
---
Guess what?  I can get more ore nodes than you by playing more than you.  I can loot more chests than you by also playing more than you.  The exploitation issues are all in your mind.  
---
It doesn't actually matter if some guild world firsts faster than yours because they had more mats because they layer farmed more shit.
---
It doesn't matter.
---
I summarize off the top of my head - they were two fairly sizeable landmasses west of Stanglethorn/Westfall. Mostly they were dev playgrounds where they tested assets. If I remember correctly they were removed by release.
---
Moar servers.
---
You'll have to wait for respawns even with layering. Remember the stress test?  If not, I do. Layering didn't help at all.
---
Since you understand this stuff do you mind clarifying for me? We’re still not sure how many realms there will be, but let’s say there are 20 different realms (easy number). Now, I know cross realm tech won’t be in Classic, but with 20 different realms to choose from, 6 different starting zones, and different server locations in EU/NA, how hard is it for the server to handle that? 
---
In my non-developer brain I see a mega server which is the realm and smaller servers for each zone like one for barrens, one for Elwynn Forest, etc. Am I completely wrong?
---
The box also has a demon hunter featured on it.
---
pretty funny they're not using addons to show enemy on minimap
---
go To RETaIL
---
I’d be okay with the announce trailer being the cinematic it still hits me in the feels seeing the rewind
---
Well, it's a cave illuminated by torches and braziers. Gonna be some fire.
---
/shrug
---
You get used to it
---
It'S jUsT BeTa
---
Just in spite of you I will now always vote yes on new content for classic. Because you're so against changes that you'd rather have your house burn down around you then accept changing the batteries  in your old smoke detector that is your life.
---
Looks like Stranglethorn-esque zones that were considered in alpha that they made the outline of before deleting.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't. Even if they don't think Classic will be that big it's a very safe investment in the WoW and Blizzard brands that will be valuable on it's own while also being great marketing for Classic.
---
so you prefer 2hrs queues?
---
You have any proof to back that up?  Private servers got by just fine and prices did not skyrocket because no one has any gold when a server first launches, so what really happened was prices were usually less than the fucking vendor price because so many dumbasses were being so competitive to corner a market they were never going to corner that they ended up losing gold.
---
I wanted to play a healer. Will that cause more pain?
---
Naughty secrets!
---
By abandoning my obligations and responsibilites.
---
Lmao this is amazing, great level of projection. Let me have a turn.
---
-guy is from Austria
---
-moves to Germany
---
-interested in politics
---
You are here
---
-GUY IS LITERALLY HITLER
---
House wouldn't burn if you fucks left classic alone. It's so simple
---
&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't.
---
In other words, you'd be surprised if they did.
---
Hes been one of my best friends irl since high school so I didn't mind lol
---
If you are a gnome you wouldn't be a fellow hordie tho.
---
Arguably less. Leveling can be more challenging (depending on class) but dungeon groups are easier to find.
---
For a very long time they acted as if they knew what the players wanted more than the players did.  Go back and read some of ghostcrawlers conversations with the playerbase.  They were completely detached and filled with their own success when the original creators and game were falling away and being replaced by people who weren't in touch with the game nor community and wouldn't listen.
---
THe only team who has down well throughout is the dungeon and raid teams.  Great raidings is the only thing holding wow together so LFR is needed because what else is there for anyone?
---
for putting some words on empty spaces of the vanilla map and spelling "sithilids?" come on rofl their standards are higher than that
---
sonii is awesome.
---
If you get to say "2 hour ques" then why doesn't the other side get to say server mergers after tourists pass?
---
Well,
---
Dont forget to invest some of that money. you typically will beat the money you would have saved paying off your student loan with a 4-6% mutual fund. Since you're young go higher risk.
---
Play fire and get impact procs
---
UD is no where near Orc for PVP in vanilla. If it was TBC and arena existed, yeah UD. But no, not when Alliance are more stun-heavy rather than fear-heavy classes.
---
Fear to change is normal. Don't let your fear control you though.
---
Horde is for people who are tired of being beautiful and tame in real life, so we get a breath of fresh air by embracing a new mask that resonates with our inner nature of being savages &amp; assholes. People who want to punch their neighbor, because their kid keeps leaving shit in your yard and this is the 4th time; you look like a champion fighter today. People who used to skateboard at first ironically, but later unironically. Grown men and women who can chop wood on a Sunday. Have you ever heard a gnome die? The beautiful short symphony that is their little shocked gasp of air, as they tip over like a marshmallow and their soul is released. Do you like drums? The drums of war? Why would you want to be a human in a new magical world, you already are one. Look in the mirror. Let go of the sting-ray scooter son, learn to ride a motorcycle like your uncle and try rolling a Tauren Thunder Chad. Do you really want to be short deep inside? Do you want to be psychologically and subconsciously associated with less social power and prowess? Or do you want to be a king of the barrens.
---
Rogue vs warlock. I played rogue vanilla in a raiding guild, cleared BWL. Then we rerolled when TBC launched and I played a lock, a led a lot of Kara and other raids. 
---
Can anyone speak to the leveling experience and endgame utility to both classes? They were both so much fun, and I’m torn. I’ll play semi serious, as much as I can working full time in a great job with a family. 39 now, versus 24 then.
---
Any help would be appreciated. With locks I’m not sure how limited they are by the 16 debuffs in MC etc. And I’m just worried there will be a ton of rogues.
---
In a 40man, how many rogues vs locks do you typically take?
---
And last question, gold farming. Pros and cons to both please! Really looking forward to enjoying the community. Biggest difference is back then I started with friends, now it’s pretty much just me
---
Sorry I am retarded.
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
Very convincing
---
Grenade stuns for PvP. You’ll find yourself snared, out in the open, with no Vanish CD. A well placed grenade can give you the window you need to escape or secure the kill. 
---
In PvE, sapper charges are a popular DPS boost. Especially bosses with adds. Also, grenade stuns can come in handy on boss fights like Nef, Cthun, razorgore. On another note, the goblin XL jumper cables can be a clutch wipe-prevention tool if you can Vanish out of combat from a failed boss attempt. 
---
Lastly, the engineering teleport trinkets are amazing in Classic. Quick travel is not easy to come by.
---
Layering and phasing aren’t the exact same thing holy shit, stop spreading that bullshit. Phasing is completely different to sharding and layering, like 100% different.
---
Except for the fact you destroy all the scarlet crusade leaders in sm during level 30 :/
---
We really just gonna invent new bosses after we already killed Inquisitor Fairbanks, Scarlet Commander Mograine and High Inquisitor Whitemane?
---
Swear you classic+ players are idiots, I could literally come up with any raid idea and you’d all lose your minds over new shiny.
---
Just stop with these stupid classic+ ideas please.
---
Your not the original wow devs and you will never live up to their glory, leave the game as is.
---
I had seen a hand full of screen shot of the alpha IF but not the video. That’s awesome! I think I might have liked it even more if they had kept the alpha version.
---
Nope, you won't be healing endgame raids like Naxx but that's less than 5% of the game you'll miss out on. Questing will be a little slower (so invite a friend or make some in the game!) and when you're still brand new be sure to let groups know you're new at healing. A few dickbags here and there but who cares about them, most people will help if you ask for advice and don't pretend to know what you're doing then get everyone killed.
---
Can't forget the lava
---
I prefer 10 hour queues if it doesn’t have layering
---
I haven’t seen one game breaking bug yet so I’m not worried. We’re gamers, we’ve seen bugs in any game we’ve ever played it’s nothing new. Don’t play at launch if you don’t want to, it’s your call.
---
Uuhh, more tips from someone that's spent way too much time warrior leveling / theorycrafting. Only ever use rend against rogues. Save your rage otherwise for heroic strike and keeping up battle shout. I actually don't even train it up while leveling outside of grabbing it for PVP at some point.
---
Part of the reason is that the ability isn't very rage point / damage efficient. This is especially true if the dot doesn't stay up for its full duration. But even if it did stay up its full duration, the rest of the reason to only dump rage on heroic strike (outside of keeping up battle shout) is because of how melee hit chance works in the game. A white swing has a greater chance to miss dodge or parry than a yellow ability swing. Your Auto Attacks are the bread and butter of your damage since you're leveling with a 2 hander, and its best to think of heroic strike as an auto attack thats modified into an ability with more damage and since it's an ability it has a higher chance to land on the target. When you get to higher ranks and under stand rage management, or sometimes in multitarget situations, it can be applicable to use Rend, but for 'early' leveling it's definitely a mistake.
---
I never do stv, it's just not worth the aggravation
---
Gota find a way to place on the commute to maximize those gains. Chrome Remote Desktop might be our savior
---
Haha, yeah what am I thinking. What you've made is a lot better!
---
Any way to buy a print of this?
---
I want to, but that requires buying/building a PC. With phones, tablets and an Xbox, I’ve not had much desire to get a new PC. Oh, and prepare to be completely consumed, neglecting sleep and everything else. 
---
Back in the day, I was one of those guys who bought the other big MMO, Star Wars Galaxies. I played during the “pre-CU” days and it was such a great, diverse game to play. They say that balancing issues plagued the game, but I think that kept things fresh and always evolving. In hindsight, it even got players closer to Jedi by motivating them to change professions. 
---
When I think of the good ol’ days, that always comes to mind and it’s also sad how these once badass, reputable companies have managed to suck the fun out of a lot of thing and rank 13/10 on the abusive predator scale.
---
Look here, noob: 
---
overheal= waste of mana, meaning that you could have used a lower rank heal.
---
"Oh shit, I overhealed 1k! Next time he is missing 1000hp I will use a lower rank spell to heal 1k and to conserve mana!"
---
You’re 100% right out of context, but in the context of WoW a daily quest is a quest that is repeatable once a day. Someone might repeat a infinitely repeatable quest daily, but it’s not a ”daily”
---
This video needs to be seen by blizzard and they need to fire the moron who made this happen or made sharding non-functional. 
---
It's simple, we don't want SHARDING / LAYERING any of that crap. Fire the guy who had the idea abandon it and move on.
---
Thanks, your company will be better for it
---
This would be nice but isn't going to happen.
---
You can never ensure that the population spreads out evenly amongst all servers, there will always be hyper-popular ones and smaller ones.
---
Some Classic servers may never need layering at all. It's just impossible to tell how the growth/decline is going to turn out.
---
*IF done correctly, I don't mind layering for a short period of time, but this is a big *IF.
---
Go Arcane power + PoM + Pyro and hope they don’t have reflector.
---
I dated a girl i met in league of legends for almost year, turned out we lived like 2 hours away from eachother. Life is pretty funny sometimes, if i had not been in that exact 3v3 match at that exact time i never would have met her.
---
This is awesome
---
If they heal early and often, you'll never win.  Shape shifting does consume a fair amount of mana, if you can get them to burn through their mana, you have a chance.   Not a good chance, but a chance.
---
People need to be fired.
---
They tried an idea, it failed, move on.
---
Stun resist on Orc is pretty OP (25% i think), as is having an on-demand stun as Tauren.
---
If you plan on doing some PVE then Troll would be a decent option but since you mentioned strictly pvp I would consider one of the other two options.
---
Good point! How about a dance marathon? The winners are those that can stay in the running long enough
---
I’m gonna say I will but who knows if I’ll actually commit. Damn that’s the story of my life ..
---
&gt; What does that kind of hate stem from?
---
they empower annoying racist zoomers and spread their shitty meme nazi culture to everwyhere and also they are just generally annoying fucking people that I don't want playing with me. They deserve to face some kind of unpleasantness for making money off of these dirtbag loser incel future shoot shooters.
---
I have 6 weeks of vacation. I took a leave of absence for overseas “missionary” work. 
---
I’ll be in my basement the whole time.. I win.
---
Bro...
---
Those are beautiful!
---
Question: You've got 1 (pre-raid) and 2 (pre-raid).  What of just Phase 1?  Shouldn't there be an option to see BiS from MC/Ony only?
---
Actually, they said that the WC3 Reforged announcement cinematic was a unique case, the other in game cinematics will be HD and wide screen but thats it. Arthas vs. Illidan being a cutscene was always such a sad thing, at least it will be an awesome cutscene this time I hope
---
Private servers have dynamically respawning mobs.
---
I feel like I am missing some context as a player who is going to fully experience vanilla wow for the first time
---
No they wont
---
I would love them to release it for like one day  as an april fool to see all the people getting lost haha
---
That’s an interesting idea. Would there be any negative aspects to staying out in the open in a tent? Like potential for being attacked? Stuff like this and the fishing extravaganza are my favorite parts of these types of games, I wish those aspects got as much attention as raiding does in vanilla
---
Did in bc when it was still a pain in the ass so yes for sure
---
Going to say no. 
---
If they ever will: it won't be a for a while.
---
Exactly. In Vanilla we had cosmetic-only gear you’d wear just for standing around, it just didn’t magically have the same stats as raid gear. You literally went to the bank, pulled out your rocket helm, dress, flowers offhand, etc. and put it on your character. 
---
The only difference is people wanting to have that appearance all the time, in raids and BGs, which is where I’d draw the line.
---
I'll be either Boudicca or Zenobia/Zenobya, come at me bitch
---
Clearly, you’ve never played a vanilla rogue.
---
It’s easy. Horde as Muslims and alliance Christians. You are alive during the crusades, GO.
---
It’s a bug, report and move on
---
Gotcha.  I was getting distracted by that point.
---
I was able to tame one as Alliance one time, so maybe it’s rarer for Alliance than for horde because you have to partner up with one of them
---
Server identity is a big thing when you're on a server with no people, yeah totally good call not to merge....
---
Just let people rename themselves. They will get over it if there are people to play with
---
the question is, even if you put in all the efford, would you be satisfied if your raid just halfassed everything? would you not feel disapointed when you spent 5h farming for every 1h raid and your raid doesnt even use foodbuffs?
---
dont get me wrong, dependable reliant people who put in work are always welcome in good guilds, but that efford might be of more use in heal spec or another class.
---
just stick with the proven specs for progress/first few clears. nobody will stop you collecting offgear and let you have your fun once the content is easily cleared
---
Is this from Classic Beta? Mind telling us how you got into Old Ironforge? :) Mount glitch?
---
cool dude thanks for sharing
---
I really like this.
---
I am all for a #noChanges realm too, but I feel like this is the direction they should have gone in. 
---
And they shouldn't stop here. We should have stuff like 60-65 zones where, in order to progress, it takes amazing skill, a lot of hit rating, and a lot of defence rating, and a lot of resistance. 
---
Imagine old Hellfire, with the Hellfire Citadel raid in the middle and the mushroom trees and all of that, but being like post 60 content that's so difficult that it becomes this almost mythical place that most people can't go to, but it's got T4 in it.
---
Emerald Dream? Same thing. Except that Druid area where Druids go for their cat form and other subsequent quests.
---
Yeah I could have worded it a bit better my bad
---
Madlad
---
Damn i only see ptr
---
The goal is to get people to play WoW classic or it would die. 10h q would mean regular working people wouldn't be able to play after work as they'd be stuck in queue till bedtime.
---
I think you're just being extreme there.
---
What if, hear me out now, what if hunters, what if they, hunters, what if hunters had, if they had... nukes?
---
pservers dont nessasarily profit?
---
Speak up about getting one at launch and start recruiting, you should not take it as a guarantee as they have not guaranteed it. 
---
-
---
Remember to design your tabard accordingly
---
-You could be the "Academy of Stormwind", have different departments like bioethics, hold discussions on papers that you write on ingame paper aswell as give people certificates and disprove their theories. 
---
-You can be the "Bank of Goldshire", run auctions that you advertise some days ahead for some fine lewt. Guild leader is bank director, you can prb take it from here. 
---

Married, 1 year old son and do about 50 hours a week of work.

I’ll play for an hour every few nights and enjoy the journey to 60, I’m here for a long term project.
---
actually most of the world doesn't care about muh copyright infringement as much as the US does
---
Project all you want. It's as simple as wanting a product to be delivered as advertised. If I wanted a new game I'd play a different game. And you should too if that's what you want.
---
Yeah the box might not be 100% accurate but it's the only picture i had on hand.  
---
I'm so sure of this, but since i cant find anything i might be going insane
---
clearly you do care
---
Most mmos got ideas from wow not the other way around since wow was the first successful mmorpg
---
someone has to keep the zoomers out
---
Welcome home brother
---
Yes, you can go to any starting zone of any other race on your own faction. Tauren &lt;-&gt; will take you a bit, but if you follow the road through the Barrens not too many things will eat you.
---
Pay for Classic with BfA farming
---
Someone create a bis list for each playstyle plz. I will pay jn gametime codes
---
It's basically the drop rate of the items that you need to turn in for the quest, the drop rate is insanely low
---
There are a ton of problems with current WoW, but just because some mounts are rewarded for "logging in each day" doesn't mean there isn't still mounts that are hard to get, and show your achievement.
---
I wouldn't herb while leveling if you're trying to be quick and head of the pact.
---
It's not just that it got rare, but also the quality of what you found fell off a cliff. It became even more about unfair surprise ganking than it ever was before. Flying gives you amazing power to find targets and wait for an opportunity to gank, and it's almost impossible to catch you and force dismount you.
---
No way dude! Looks amazing.
---
Everyone that is going to play classic already knows about classic. A cinematic wouldn't do anything but get people who already know about classic more excited.
---
There is no White Raptor, they already stated that they will start with the armored variants so as not to influence people to level super fast just for a mount.
---
This is a long farm for a wintersaver for alliance players. Looks great. Never played allies so not sure how it rides.
---
Yep. I couldn't see the look on his face in that pic.
---
"Bros, I'm getting murdered out here, who's on a quiet layer atm?"
---
"Bros, there's ores out the ass on this layer!  I'm herb so idgaf but who wants to come clean this up?"
---
"Bros, we've kinda figured out how you're marked by the server so it can join you up with someone from a different layer.  We then created an addon that is, meh at best, but it can usually get us on any layer we want on using an automated invite/accept script on each client..."
---
Can't wait to park my burly ass back in the forge. Deathwing, do a better job on Stormwind this time...
---
Hahahaha how in the world did you jump that gap. 
---
"People are saying they will put account services in, but I think they won't"
---
&gt;I mean may as well commit suicide because that's literally everything in life.
---
"Exactly what I said. Yep"
---
Hey man I’m happy to hear it. The other day I was remembering Nostalrius closing down and the months after that was said. I remember going to the WoW forums and seeing people just bash on Classic WoW. 
---
“You guys are defending CRIMINALS!!!” Anytime Nostalrius was mentioned. “Blizzard said NO. Thats their answer. Get used to it.” Anytime we asked them to reconsider.
---
I never understood why people were against Classic. If they don’t like it, don’t play it. Stick to retail wow.
---
But now? Now you can’t find anyone that’s like that anymore. In my experience at least. Sure there are debates about how Classic SHOULD be but not so much that it WILL be. Actually, I’ve only met one person that’s a friend of a friend that legitimately thinks Classic will be dead in a week. A WEEK. He wasn’t joking and attacked me with “link your ahead of the curve mythic achievement. I’ve done more than you.” And I released I don’t want people like him to play Classic.
---
We were shot down over and over again and didn’t give in until we got what we wanted. People that simply loved the game changed the minds of a multi-million dollar company. It’s been an amazing experience these past few years and it’s really just starting in August.
---
I did that quest 2 days ago on Nrthdale. It was annoying.
---
I know the precise location of atleast 7 vulture spawns, but there may be 1 or 2 more.
---
1 to the west where all those scorpids spawn, 1 to the north west amidst some wrecked rocket racers, 1 to the northeast beside the crater and finish flag, 3 to the east at a kodo skeleton, and one to the south where the basalisks have taken over a village. 
---
At first I was farming them in a group of 5 over at the kodo bones to the east, 3 spawns for 5 people took a long time, but kept the horde off us.
---
I had 4/10 when the group broke up. Then I went to the ruined Tauren village to the south and grinded basalisks for mount money, the 1 culture spawns inside the little tent beside the water, I had him locked down. I stayed till I was 10/10.
---
Needs to be part of a quest chain to purify Corrupted Ashbringer.
---
I don't think it works anyhow, pretty sure that if you do that it just spirit rezzes you at the original graveyard your ghost spawned at. I'm not 100% sure but i wouldn't risk wasting all that time
---
You’ll find that classic is more tailored for the casual than retail is. It’s not always about big end game raiding.
---
[Asmongold and Tips Out](https://youtu.be/VXCnWJL3U2E) give a good explanation on it.
---
Holy shit damn this is good.
---
Druids, make 2..,and anyone that uses an invis pot. But more importantly, those are two of the classes that gank most in wpvp, so if you‘ s gotta have an advantage against someone...... Also, human&gt;dwarf in rogue 1v1. Human will get the opener nearly every time.
---
This is the cherry on top, he literally said no changes haha. It’s kind of like the flat earth cult at this point. 
---
Just read a comment about a guy complaining that layering shouldn’t exist because of ‘no changes’. He then went on to say in the same paragraph where his private server had 10k people online and felt good, completely ignoring the fact that they have CHANGED the game with dynamic respawns. Pretty ironic.
---
Is there an equivalent horde mount?
---
I'm not saying what you said, but what OP is saying. He's saying don't get it cuz they'll just make it shitty.
---
Yup
---
rebranding 101
---
Then they are playing the beta wrong.
---
For the alliance members wishing to farm the saber, I want to remind y'all:
---
It does require Tiger Riding to ride, meaning exalted with Darnassus

---
I remember it not being too bad.
---
Id frame the shit out of this. Fucking amazing man
---
I’m really drawn to caster classes, and am thinking Mage, Warlock, or Priest. 
---
Is the gnome Int bonus racial really essential? I enjoy min-maxing, but man I hate the aesthetics of gnomes. I want to be able to raid but also look decent. 
---
Sorry gnome fans.
---
They accept money to run those servers, they may not profit but they still collect money for a product that they didnt make
---
Where did you find those? I would love to just have them all alone.
---
Layering seems like a great solution in place of sharding, but there is no reason for it to persist past the first week.
---
Go Part Time LOL
---
Horde is:
---
* Green Humans
---
* Humans with pointy ears and tusks
---
* Dead Humans
---
* Furries
---
Cataclysm was too drastic IMO. I don't have much of a problem with updating zones and making them have no storylines, I did play retail a bit and really enjoyed the storyline in the human start zones and lowbie areas. But I didn't like how they changed so much of the geography of the other zones, it should have just been a change to the story, not the geography.
---
I think the idea would be the streamers would share the blacklist, so the horde streamers wouldnt let you in if you harrass and over gank an alliance streamer.. dumb idea either way and i doubt it will happen
---
Hopefully it comes out soon. They got 6 months until absolute deadline.
---
they'll miss out on ganking.
---
Where's the proof he stream sniped?
---
Dude same here. PTSD ridden from that journey
---
Doesn’t always have to be about min-maxing bud he might just wanna have fun
---
I say play whatever you want it’s a fantasy game have your fantasy man
---
Maybe the gnome will beat him on the dmg meter by a couple points but won’t mean he’s not invited to the group
---
I dont think they will, but probably should to curb the influx of chinese gold farmers
---
I mean they're not exactly long, easily can finish one every 4-5 days if your a good reader
---
Asmongold for exemple didn't want to roll pvp at the beginning because he know how much of a pain it will be. But I guess he changed idea to play with his friends.
---
So good...
---
I never knew the unstoppable force was a boars head upside down and I had that fucking thing on my warrior...
---
I fucking love that you placed Kul Tiras correctly.
---
&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't.
---
he didnt say that
---
Okay so how would you suggest they avoid dead realms after a few months without changing the entire fucking game?
---
Without layering they'll have to create loads and loads of servers to accommodate the initial rush of people. After the tourists leave every single one of those servers will be ghost towns.
---
Incredibly well done :D
---
I get why you’re concerned about a “grind fest”  because the road to level 60 is arduous and long. But if you don’t focus about getting to max level as fast as possible and instead just enjoy the ride you’ll find yourself having a wonderful casual experience. I might recommend PvE servers if you want an even more casual experience.
---
You probably can't do it at level 1 tho.
---
You'll likely ding 2 on the way from exploration XP.
---
But... armor is cool...
---
stop makeing stupid people famous
---
You can, but as the other guy said, if you are a mage, you wont only not have a mage trainer there, but you wont be able to do any of the mage class quests that happen early on, which can be fairly important.
---
Can I know how are you making theses ? On photoshop like this video ? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkgPVpM9ibY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkgPVpM9ibY) Or do you have an editor
---
Are you copy pasting parts of the world or is it fully handmade
---
They've confirmed that it won't.
---
scroll down.
---
No one wants it. But people on this board have a mentally that blizzard is unmovable.
---
A couple of friends and I have started a 1-night a week raid guild.  We know that we won't be progressing through the hardest raid content at a blazing pace, but we're excited to progress at a steady pace that will let us keep family/jobs/life as a top priority.
---
I love the Horde. I love Trolls, Tauren, Orc ladies. The raptor mounts, the wolf mounts, and the undead ponies but- I love the saber mounts more, ram AV mount is awesome, easier access to the cat and bunny small pets, the frostsaber mount, not having to deal with Paladins in PvP, and superior Druid forms. End game IF is set up as the best city for access to everything as well.  
---
I'll also avoid Barrens chat, as I don't want to see that given the current political climate. I'd fill up my block list day one.
---
3 minute mage.
---
Yes and then have no way to reset the fight. Not being able to blind people to reset is insane. Not being able to kite people insane. Dwarf/Gnome are so much better than human for pvp as a rogue.
---
Well, if you’re talking about pvp exclusively, then dwarf is the best pick. It gives you the widest latitude to vanish and reopen. In addition to what’s been mentioned, you can also clear serpent sting and devouring plague from ud s.priests (which is huge). 
---
But if you can’t stand looking at a dwarf then what does it matter? Pick what you want to play. Your race won’t hold you back or propel you to greatness,
---
the one who bounces
---
ahh, advocating for child slavery!
---
titty bounce tho
---
would be awesome
---
you could do more with a macro in 1.12 than you can with a mod in retail. 
---
You could setup logic scripts with conditions to make 1 button macros. Cant do shit like that with the modern code. 
---
I don't think they're too strong at all.
---
Be a gnome. People get SO PISSED about getting killed by one and being the tiniest race makes you seem FASTER.

I got this on my Rogue back in the day, I actually don't even remember the grind lol.

I will be getting it on Classic for sure.

I played shadow priest on an unofficial server last year and cleared all of aq 40 progression in a guild where I was allowed to use sw:p. Obviously finding a guild to do this may be tough.
---
Here's some damage results. This was in pre naxx gear. 
---
Disclaimer: logging tools for the servers were weird and other people's damage isn't correct if they were out of range.

Which is one of the reason I'm rolling Alliance for a change.

I think there’s a total of 9. You 3 that spawn on the bones to the east and a scattered 6 through out.

If his goal is to provide some usefulness how to gear he needs to include 2-3 alternatives. A pure bis list has barely any functionality for the user.

Ghostcrawler honestly wasn’t so bad. He championed cataclysms difficulty and he was forced to back off on the public doubling down of cataclysm dungeons at launch to first major patch. They were challenging and fun. I think he himself didn’t want to see the game so casualized as it has been. 
---
With that said, I think players on the forums back then thinking they knew better ultimately influenced the  games direction to mobile game casual and homogenous systems , simplified talents, and homogeneity across the board. 
---
People kept asking for things over and over for convenience and blizzard succumbed to them. I don’t think Blizz would have changed their model post vanilla with the success the game had if the playerbase demanded the core philosophy of vanilla was kept intact with expansions. Nope we kept asking for stuff and we got it. And the game is awful now. Blizz is to blame for confusing vocal minorities with what made WoW amazing in the first place. Just imo.
---
No. Macros can not have any logic in them, that's supposed to be your job as a player.
---
I played horde for years and only horde. Don’t know anything about alliance zones or cities beyond world pvp so I’m pretty excited to level a paladin in classic it’ll be like a whole new game
---
I remember the first time I walked into ironforge in 2006. I was a level 10 dwarf hunter and when I heard that music. Oh my God melted.
---
Right around the corner
---
Did they ask with out any sense of irony if we want to pay to be level boosted? Disgusting.
---
My buddy fucking sent it in bc, also has 6/8 t3. It's kind of a shame. Been playing hard since vanilla, i feel you on the nerfs and pride my friend.
---
Cool, no problem. Don't worry, you can definitely do the sort of thing you just said. A good rule of thumb is that you can be as badass as you want, as long as it doesn't close doors for players around you. Possible exceptions might be actual, unique gameplay tidbits. If your have Scarab Lord title ingame, you've earned it in RP too as long as all that questing you did is part of your character's continuing narrative.
---
Retail might be a decent place to get your feet wet, but in my experience the RP scene has seen its immersiveness fade just like the game itself has. Still, probably no better place available atm.
---
Yes, it's a fantasy game, so of all the races you could choose, you choose the one you are IRL. &gt;.&lt;
---
10 seconds or less on Beta... but whatever, same as 5 min.
---
If you're talking about koassde, they have a history of posting misinformation based on groggy memories in contradiction to video evidence and the reference client.
---
You didn't learn anything, you thought you did years ago and remember that.
---
Idk if you're trolling at this point, but the feeling of certainty doesn't make something true.
---
You have to realize the kind of awful generalizations you're making here right? I am aware of the shitty meme nazi undertone to some of Twitch's emote culture but I think you're being a bit delusional if you think that every person or even most people use those emotes for that reason.
---
None of the current MMO options interest me and I'm not alone in that boat. Time to go back to an old standard I know I'll enjoy wasting hours in.
---
You definitely should as Alliance, beautiful mount.
---
As Horde, the Raptor is pretty cool, especially if you are Tauren and have to put up with Tauren on a Kodo clipping.  It's a big raptor so it is quite aesthetically pleasing.  The grind is basically like 20ish days? of daily quests.  You don't have to do them consecutively either.  Riverdare's Charge, now that's insane.
---
Druids do to Mages, what you as a Mage do to Warriors. Have to get lucky or hope they fuck up really bad.
---
Without zoomers this game would die out real quick. Plus zoomers aren't just 12 year old Fortnite players, I myself am a zoomer but I've been playing WoW for over 10 years.

Not those leveling to 10 without killing anything for the first ~6 or 7 levels.

just practice. No amount of text on reddit is gonna win duels for you. lots of instants, force shifts, go for poly during heals, cs, just keep the pressure and spam poly any chance given to reset. if you really dont understand the strategy just go heavy on dps with instants and cs.

Blur did an amazing job with Halo 2 anniversary cut scenes. (If I remember correctly)
---
That's not an MMO. Currently the big MMOs are: FF:ARR and Retail WoW. I don't know how the FF mmo is going, but retail WoW is bleeding subs. The other MMOs out there are limping along, or closing. I know Bless is shutting down soon. That or they're private servers like for Vanilla WoW, CoH, and EQ. Lots of people still interested in older style MMOs.
---
MoD helps when fighting other rogues or druids, that's about it. There's no where you can stealth in the world with it that you can't stealth to without it.
---
Then merge them in a few months when all the tourists leave, one way to do it could be to have servers called Tarren Mill 1, Tarren Mill 2 and Tarren Mill 3 and ear mark them for merging so people know at least some way who the rest of their communities will be when mergers happen.
---
If each layer is scaled to have the population of a classic server then as more layers are open it means more players and more demand for trade goods. 3,000 players on one layer would generate X resources and have Y demand, 6,000 players across 2 layers would have 2X resources and 2Y demand. 
---
The gold value isnt as important as even having resources to get at all. How would one expect to level engineering when every copper node is tapped the instant it spawns? You could potentially get to iron zones while only ever having tapped less than a dozen copper nodes. Its basic economics that gets played out retail servers every new expansion pack launches.
---
 I dont know how they do it on private servers, but they dont have to adhere to authentic spawns rates and can make it as fast as they want like what I hear they did to spawn rates.
---
I feel like I'm high what the fuck did I just read
---
And why was there no horde version then?
---
Oh wow....this kinda makes me want to go back to Alliance after years of playing Horde. Damn good job.
---
Cute dog
---
I wouldn't be so sure. I didn't know anything about Classic until the release date announcement made the front page of Reddit. I talked to a buddy of mine about a week ago that played WoW for years and he had no idea either. Guarantee there are a lot more people to be reached that would play.
---
I knew Nost numbers went up,because Nost mirrored classic starting from a base of 0 and growing. Classic will literally start from a base of millions and millions of players. Going to set a remind me for 12 months to see whether they have started releasing new servers to cope with the demand you are predicting.
---
Haha, yeah! I didn't notice it when I first got it in vanilla. It took me probably a week before I realized it.
---
I agree, everyone should go for the the rank 10 set ASAP if they ever plan on PvPing.
---
Is that from pservers with different itemization?
---
RemindMe! 1 year
---
I’m not “trying to downplay it”, I’m just telling you how it actually played out.
---
I started as alliance, but after a while and trying out a few classes, I decided I wanted to play Horde. I never looked back! But I have to say, the alliance cities are pretty nice, and the questing is a lot easier. Would definitely recommend for that "knight of old" feeling.
---
Lol.
---
What if they keep a handful of servers for plain old classic and another handful would progress to 1.14? Would you be ok with that?
---
that's not an option though, is it?
---
Sadly, yes.

Would love to get full r10 gear again.
---
But there problem here is more of a societal issue. A lot more people want instant gratification in games than there was 15 years ago. Sure, classic is much better for the people who want the adventure but who even knows if there's enough of a constant market for that anymore. And I don't mean at launch. We all know there will be a rush, especially as streamers try to cash in on whatever's hot as they always do. I mean in a year from now. We'll see I guess
---
I don't think you are giving kids enough credit. Yes a lot of them play fortnite but the same was true 14 years ago, just that it wasn't fortnite. Not every single person played WoW back then. If the witcher 3 and any of the elder scrolls games are any indication kids still enjoy a good RPG.
---
I don't think invisibility is stealth so it doesn't do anything - it's the same as succubus invis. I guess it's ok vs druid but really if a druid is trying to get the opener vs a rogue they're kind of bad because they will instantly lose the fight if they don't get the opener.  
---
Dwarf is much stronger than human in the 1v1. Opener is a much smaller advantage compared to reliable blind/bleed removal.
---
new background thenk
---
Sure. Assuming the demand was met for that many servers. Just give me my place to play the game I signed up for, and y'all can go do your own thing.

Take an upvote, horde player checking in, all your downvotes are from alliance scum, I know I’ll be downvoted for this comment but you can’t downvote me in Azeroth your dirty alliance players.
---
F O R T H E H O R D E
---
What other sources? Can you link perhaps? The data showed in the link is correct, what doesnt seem right about it? It's common sense that talents like unbreakable will, unyielding faith and heightened senses neglects your chance to hit the target even if you have the standard 4% hit. Same thing if you're facing a target that has high spell resistance.
---
Does Blur even help with anything Blizzard related? Also yeah, the gravemind cinematics still give me chills, blur did them so good.
---
I'm looking forward to making the trek out to Mulgore for the Rake as a Dwarf

---
I'll be honest - if I could land the full blue alliance set for my warrior I'd be pretty fucking stoked. 
---
Shit is *sleek.*
---
Really?  Maybe I didn't see the same posts you did.  I was seeing tons of backlash to the simplification of the game.  Especially the talent system (because I quit before MOP so the other systems hadn't been so ruined).
---
Players were constantly complaining about AFKgrimmar too.  The LFR and LFG systems were not asked for as far as I remember and they were hated on even back then.
---
In addition to that sharding which started significantly in Cata was also really poorly received.
---
Maybe I didn't see the forums where things were being asked that were given.  I just saw the negative feedback to what was given not being wanted.
---
Ok I figured as much just had to make sure lol
---
Does listening to the soundtrack count?
---
Do I think they are? Nope.
---
Am I holding out hope they are? Absolutely.
---
Only thing it's missing is people dueling in front of the bank. Shame classic "fixed" this.
---
Beyond the loot. Guys, they sharded this arena why ?? Is this an out of season april fools joke ?
---
If you're asking whether the 3 day 18 hour mark is from a Blizzard server, it is not.
---
If you're asking whether Pserver itemization had anything to do with this mark, it did not. Besides, Classic itemization is actually better than Pservers.
---
When BC came out I decided to make a BE and switched to Horde. That Mage became my main after struggling through vanilla on a warrior. That being said - I'm going back the Alliance for classic.
---
They already confirmed no.  Its totally possible but def not for a while until the in game economy is built up and stabilized.  These are fresh servers, the economy is literally starting at 0 copper.  If they implemented tokens right away they wouldn't be worth shit.
---
That being said its going to be funny to see how many people buy gold from the Chinese farmers...
---
WHAT'S UP PARTY PEOPLE**
---
I was always secretly super jealous of the absolutely *massive* 2hand sword for rank 14. Combined with even the blue set, hands down one of the best looks in the game.
---
How are they not able to blind or kite? Stoneform  doesn’t remove blind and gnome escape is worthless vs rogue. I’m not following...?
---
You can reset the fight by pooling energy and vanishing between dot ticks,,,no biggie.
---
This is what a reasonable solution looks like!
---
I would prefer they add content to classic instead of just treading over the same ground again which ruined wow in the first place. 
---
Make it a horizontal upgrades rather than the vertical upgrades of the expansions
---
I’ll look around.  I’m basing it off of my game knowledge and what I’ve seen in the past.  Also, there is a roll to hit with a spell which is where talents like focus and spell hit gear come in, and then there is a separate roll once you have successfully hit the target for the target to resist the spell.  It’s confusing because a spell miss will still say resist but it’s two separate things. 
---
Roll to hit with spell
---
If you hit then
---
Roll for target to resist
---
&gt; Now the only problem is figuring out how to navigate around work.
---
Computer engineer here. Get a job that allows you to automate your own job, but is vague and obscure enough that nobody else knows how to do it.
---
- IT Security Team: Hey, we see a lot of traffic between your computer and us.battle.net
---
- Yeah, I'm doing stuff
---
- What kind of stuff?
---
- Ya know. Work stuff
---
- Cool. Carry on.
---
I guess I'm not a true classic fan then
---
They better remove layering after 2 weeks...
---
Bad bot.
---
It's all irrelevant imo.  When servers are fresh, you have two types of players:  One levels up a gathering profession to feed a crafting professing; the other levels two gathering professing to make gold.  The first is rarely buying resources from the AH, the other is trying to undercut the rest.  There simply is not that much demand in the beginning for crafting mats.  Even when ppl first hit 60 and start two crafting professions, the AH is flooded.  It doesn't matter how many ppl are playing, the same % are trying to sell.
---
Absolutely prefer vanilla faces.  Retail is sameface.  Just me, but I do not want updated models.  At all.
---
Absolutely this.  Exploring zones in new retail WoW just feels claustrophobic, there's quests and NPCs and gimmicks around every corner.  Sometimes I just wanna ride an unnamed horse through a desert and not see a whole lot, yknow?  Makes the world feel more real.
---
Blind is a poison in vanilla and can be removed with stoneform.
---
Such a beautiful city and painting. Really makes one yearn for a wow2 and an updated version of Azeroth.
---
This sub is not a friendly place. People tear each other apart over the slightest disagreements
---
Praying the in-game community won't be so awful but I don't have high hopes judging by what private servers are like haha
---
Thank you
---
😂😂 spat my drink out. Thanks haha
---
Oh my god I completely forgot about the crystal cave until this comment and the memories come *flooding* back.
---
PLEASE draw one for Org???
---
Haha, it's happening!
---
If that’s his fantasy man shoot for it
---
I personally am going gnome mage
---
Wow.
---
&gt;SITHILIDS
---
Stop messing with my head.
---
Good job though.
---
rex. still. lived.
---
Ahh see me and my friends never completed the Belf zones  questlines so we never knew of that orb. Everytime we wouls get to around lvl 15 we'd hike it down through the plaguelands to UC. Only long after did i discover what madness we had stumpled upon
---
Pretty easy once aq comes out and you can run AQ20 twice a week. It’s still a grind, don’t get me wrong, but it’s not terrible
---
Yeah it is. You jump on the bank vault, go to the top of it and blink through. Mage only I guess.
---
If you’re undead, the correct answer is our banshee queen looks good no matter what

EVERYTHING
---
So I never really played alliance seriously, is this city that cool? How is it compared to horse cities like orgrimmar?
---
That ring seems cool. And the mace seems ridiculous but would be funny on a boomkin

Man if they do end up doing added content and eventually make the OG Ashbribger obtainable it would be the most hyped delayed gratification in the history of games.

Wasnt communication with the opposite faction in vanilla pvp servers against TOS? I though it was at least frowned upon.
---
[Petopia's got a nice classic site now. Check it out.](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/browse.php)
---
Happy cake day friend
---
Dude are you fucking serious? This is awesome.
---
this was definitely an error im so serious
---
Technically true, but stealth levels help you stealth past things easier.  You can get past things higher level than you easier with more stealth levels.  Without it you'll be planning a lot more and using distract a lot more.
---
Awesome, thanks mate!
---
Weird, this doesn't look like Razor Hill
---
Player housing in Ultima Online was one of that game's best features (among many amazing features). The fact that people STILL subscribe over twenty years later just to keep their houses intact emphasizes how successful UO's system was.
---
I think attack speed is still there for caster push back. The damage is what was normalized (so faster attacks do less damage, slow attacks do more, all pets do the same DPS).
---
If we follow that logic through then why does anyone care about gathering nodes and layers when the economies crash hard and resources have almost no value?
---
Dwarves are the reason I main alliance from vanilla - Catalysm. While I prefer horde by a large margin, dwarves are my favorite race
---
Yeah the rewards are a bit wonky but could be fun to play with. I spent a lot of time in Silithus, farming twilight sets and I had stuff for a duke summon at least every other week before our aq40 runs. One of my favorite grinds in the game back then
---
Usually phased so that it doesn't die. This keeps the buff on people.
---
People complained and asked for things a lot. The reason Warlocks were dumbed down significantly late Wrath was because their class designer created a panel of warlock players who ultimately influenced them to make Affliction go from a 7 dot rotation to like 3-4 and no thinking involved. Per Countdown to classic episode with the Late wrath warlock designer. I remember seeing a lot a lot a lot of people always asking for this for that . Maybe Blizz interpreted their asks for balance with responding in giving every class every ability but man you Would see so much exaggerated crap that ultimately lead to the  “being the player not the class” which is what vanilla was but they completely missed the mark IMO by continuing to overkill every class with every type of move. In vanilla you and More so TBC you would prefer certain dps classes but honestly that stuff was so over talked about on forums. Most people did weird groups to clear dungeons and it was a vocal minority saying they weren’t being invited. Good players always get invited. 
---
I think if you look at wow forums back then it was lots of complaining and as recently as maybe MoP is when the audience there started commenting on the game being casualized. I have no clue I quit the game cata patch 2 because of the direction the game was headed was just not for me .
---
She has read the first two books of the Horus Heresy and I've told her she can stop after Flight of the Eisenstein, haha.
---
I don't think it is about balance, it is about attitude.
---
Enjoy the game for what it is and just play at a pace that suits your current lifestyle.  For those of us that played at launch, we have all been through this before.  There is literally nothing *'new'* to experience with regards to game content (server first bullshit doesn't mean shit on a 15 year old game), but we all have a new opportunity to connect with the communities/individuals of our respective servers. 
---
I plan to take my sweet time getting to 60 as the gear hamster wheel that is waiting there will still be there whether I get there in 6 months or 2 years.

---
Apparently it was sarcasm
---
Two rogues is ridiculous fun in wpvp, plus you can keep each other company with stealth runs for gear and gold. Not to be overlooked just as a "duplicate".
---
If you want to maximize your effectiveness you want a bunch of gear to swap in and out based on the encounter. For example, tanks balance between damage reduction and threat generation, healers balance between mana regeneration and throughput, etc.
---
A list of a single set of gear to use for all encounters and situations is really only beneficial for casual players. Your best resource for gearing is always going to be your class's classic discord.
---
Odd way to pronounce Stormwind
---
Oh I misunderstood, on mobile and missed the "to 60" part.
---
Was confused about playing clearing MC faster than Joanna levels, but clearly that's just my illiteracy acting up.
---
Always phased.
---
What’s their racial mount?
---
I am self employed and have already started putting in extra hours so that when classic drops i will hopefully only have to put in around 20 hours a week. 
---
I should be able to do enough to give myself 4 weeks like that.
---
That gives me a month to hit 60 before i go back to regular hours
---
Troll because it lets your opponent know you don’t give a fuck about stun resist or fear-breaking because you’re confident that you can still fuck ‘em up
---
ASMONGOLD said something very profound the other day.  Chat had asked him if he thought layering was good or bad to which he responded "it's neither, it's necessary."
---
It's necessary guys
---
Everyone with a brain wants layering, because the alternative is dead servers in 4 weeks or dead servers on day 1.
---
yes, 100%, don't listen to clueless people.
---
Its worth it, Even if you don't specifically aoe grind, it speeds things up cos you can kill 3-4 mobs at once even for quests. and groups and camps of mobs. 
---
Basically whenever there is an opportunity. You have a choice to do it. Also its not you unable to single target with it too. 
---
Also it super helps in instances and dungeons. where you can literally save the day kiting a large group of mobs, in case of bad pull.
---

---
most of twitch users are racist scum
---
The dwarf hunter in the opening cinematic made me roll a dwarf hunter.
---
Polymorph them until they're oom from shifting,
---
Obviously these are a proof of concept you dipshit. Given a year or two to develop it, Blizzard could easily figure out the details.
---
2 kids, wife and a 9-5 checking in. Thinking a lot about this...
---
-	I’m taking a few days off during the second week of launch (to let things cool off just a little in the starting zones)
---
-	setting expectations with the wife that the 8-11pm slot is going to be wow quite a bit for the first month or two
---
-	cooking some soups and chili and freezing it, planning on sous viding a bunch of chicken on Sunday nights for the rest of the week 
---
-	being extra good to the wife, scheduling massages etc, anything to bank some points 
---
-	and uhhh planning to install wow on my work computer....because maybe I’ll have a few minutes to check the AH... or a quest or two.....who knows
---
And I’ll still be miles behind everyone. But my friends and I will try to stay close in level, take our time, run all the good dungeons once, SM a millions times, and just soak it all in. Who knows if we’ll get to 60 this year. I’m just pumped to go back :)
---
The rams
---
The rare black lion spawned north of Booty Bay.  Then in Wrath, Blizzard gave the model to a common NPC quest target in Sholazar Basin.
---
Hunter was my fourth alt or something in Classic.  The black lion was the only rare I ever tamed, and Blizzard gave it to a fucking quest target.
---
What's that map on the top right
---
But then you'd have those levels for the rest of your character's life. If you're aiming to build a lvl 60 in any class you'd have to keep building it pure. My original pitch does not allow respeccing of class levels.
---
You'll be able to kill 8+ mobs at a time if they are all melee.
---
Tell me those ones too
---
A sheep with horns
---
I wish there were more NPCs walking around in general in every city
---
Had a full time job and was married then, so pretty much the same. A little less sleep, took a bunch of PTO for the launch, and have no intention of rushing to 60 or raiding seriously. Just wanna play the game.
---
Still waiting for it to be available to ship to Canada :(
---
I started in TBC and it's by far my favorite expansion...
---
But if we go from Classic Vanilla to Classic TBC, we're going to hit a dead end (either there or with WotLK).
---
It's better to start from Vanilla and build out into something new for the future... with new servers being opened for Classic+ and one-time transfers so that original Classic Vanilla servers will always be pure Vanilla.
---
There were plenty of times I recognized names
---
The first time you still through the gates of Stormwind and that music plays you know you’re home, fam. That’s all that needs to be said.
---
Well you see that sort of statement is wrong for similar principles that racism itself is... No, most twitch users are just people looking for entertainment, there's some edgelords in there who make offensive jokes, sure and there's probably some actual racists too (like there are on any platform unfortunately) but saying most twitch users are racist is just a wildly offensive generalization.
---
Wikipedia doesn’t mention any but it would be sick
---
Played Horde in Vanilla and Alliance in BC+ after a break. Tempted to try Alliance in Classic for the different experience. If that's the case, I want Baron Riv.'s mount on an alliance character.
---
If only IF ever looked like that. God that looks gorgeous.
---
This is me exactly. Horde for 14 years going to be switching to alliance and specifically a paladin. Looking forward to be a solid contributor in dungeons and raids.
---
Laughs in PVE.
---
Sure but your dps will suffer quite a bit.
---
Dominos existed at wotlk I remember having an hard choice between that and bartender
---
I am also tempted to do a reverse wetlands run. Haven't quite decided yet.
---
Play Warcraft 3.
---
Haste trinket + spam frostbolt.
---
I'd rather get the oozling pet
---
Don’t tell me who to dance with!
---
Anybody want it go here
---
technically you could treat it like a set of dailies... It'd just take months to finish it.
---
Unfortunately yes... there will either be chinese gold farmers camping every Black Lotus spawn in the game 24/7 or there will be tokens.  Tokens are obviously bad, especially with how gold can make characters more powerful in Vanilla... but people will either buy gold from tokens or from node-hogging gold farmers, and the former has a much lower impact on the game.
---
Going to include the family in on the experience so I wont be forsaking them while I play :)
---
I never really played on the Alliance side (definitely going to make a 60 alt this time), but the DRT was something special. I wish they'd done something similar for the Horde as well, but engineering isn't our forte.
---
Lmfao
---
Blizzard teasing us with that manual.
---
Why? Because of LotR?
---
I'm excited to get through STV without being ganked, due to finally having a PvE server.
---
Infinite growth forever, damn all other logic!
---
I'm a slow counter
---
People don't think it be like it is, but it do.
---
Almost all big streamers are going on a pvp server. Asmongold is still on the fence but likely going pvp.
---
They could also ad the Isle of Pandera and the Broken Isles, and maybe Northrend too, and Tol Barad, and the Lost Isles....
---
I played Belf pally BC-cata, had a few alts later but did most of my raiding on Paladin I know a lot of people will be changing classes but I’ve always loved pallys lore and game play
---
its purple
---
Because the other side is stupid.
---
Alliance have Dwarves.  That should really be a good enough reason to go Alliance.
---
Was the black raptor for the horde in ungoro a thing in vanilla? I remember the tiger but I dont remember when I first saw that
---
The art in BFA is spectacular. I would love an option to keep the new models (specific to my client only) :)
---
Ever watched a Classic beta stream? 50% of their content involves some form of world pvp. So obviously they prefer to play on a pvp server.
---
I totally agree. People are arguing more and more over the incredibly fine details, semantics and nuance when this should just be a NON-STARTER.
---
Walk up to a chest/node and it disappears? People just disappearing out of existence? Come on. It should 100% be a deal breaker. No further discussion. How much rationalizing has to go on to get to the point of "its ok for people and resources in an MMO to just disappear randomly" It's a bug. It's on the same level as peacebloom floating 20 feet off the ground or an enemy stuck in a tree trunk.
---
If the issue is queues, then layer the server up, but make it totally locked. No player moves a layer, ever. No exceptions.
---
If the issue is friends, make them log out and relog together in a party or something.
---
Destroying the suspension of disbelief because of a few special cases seems like some pretty poor priorities born of years of arguing the same issues and drifting to a place where you have given up or forgotten what matters.
---
I'll set a timer for myself to keep myself in check. If I don't, it'll be a downward spiral.
---
In vanilla every class has access to a stun in from of a Grenade.
---
OP, have you got a lossless version of your drawing by any chance? Someone should make a sweet live wallpaper out of yours.
---
I certainly hope it's never implemented. The only reason it works in retail is because gold is practically meaningless. The server economy and gold itself are VERY important in classic and being able to buy gold directly from Blizzard basically would destroy the economy.
---
I didn’t start playing till wrath, no wonder I never knew about it
---
I like the game Archeage where every zone had housing areas along with "secret" unmarked areas where you could fit a house or two. The finite land and unique areas allowed for very high demand real estate. Want waterfront property on the coast that you can launch a ship from? Or a beautiful view hidden deep within a forest? Or the top of a hill overlooking a beautiful landscape? Or a deserted island in the middle of the sea? You could get that with extreme persistence and a little bit of luck.
---
Eh - as handy as the DRT was you guys got Zepplyns which, frankly, were a better transport utility.
---
Neither Gillijim's Isle nor Island of Doctor Lapidis are in retail though.
---
I am almost tempted to let you play it, if only to see you suffer. Watch it destroy you. Watch it corrupt your heart and drive you mad. But I think not. I think our little Beta ends here.
---
What's is the Whelplands?
---
I'd prefer laying than 10 hour queue.
---
Have any examples? I've never seen anyone substantiate any claims again him.
---
Gimili, I loved the idea of short, thick, bearded, extra tough man 
---
Over time I become enamored with drawf lore and architecture 
---
My original main was a drawf hunter named Snow ranger
---
No one should go GM, the view from LM is what makes it the preferred choice.
---
The level spread of enemies in dungeons is too big to effectively level in them. Deadmines is something like level 16 at the start and 22 by the end. And that's before taking in to account the xp gained per elite kill is pretty low. 
---
That said, you should run dungeons to supplement your questing. They give decent xp when if you make sure to gather all the quests for them. And as a warrior/melee they ease your questing by providing you with a somewhat reliable source of weapons.
---
Contract killings
---
AV had to be reworked not once, but twice to to even the odds because horde was winning so much. Now alliance dominate BGs because they are vastly one sided. Horde still win most wsg and small BGs
---
Alliance bg win rate 
---
AV and isle are 70% winrate
---
AB 55% winrate
---
While all the others are around 40-48%
---
Alliance have advantages in large bgs but when it comes to smaller pvp fights horde tend to win
---
Mostly just a name due to its being pretty much between Onyxia's Lair and the Caverns of Time a little to the south.
---
The cloth turn-in quests exist on the beta already. They're unlikely to be gated with raid/pvp phases like that.
---
&gt; Especailly with repair bills being what they are
---
Repair bills were normalized halfway through vanilla.  It doesn't cost substantially more to repair plate.  Most of the durability loss will be from wipes, which everyone suffers equally.
---
Wait - I thought it was *spending* gold for game time. Not buying it.
---
Soooooo you're saying it will have many whelps?
---
You took pictures of the cave exteriors to use as background images? That's dedication.
---
As many whelps as a certain zone has needles. &gt;!I was picturing a large spawning grounds type area for the black dragonflight. Though honestly a centaur zone could theoretically fit there too.!&lt;
---
i was waiting for this story to turn to "One day I decided to steal everyones gold and cancel their acts and i was drowning in gold"
---
Those are my favorite shoulders in the game. The way they swing past each other while walking is perfect. 
---
Felt like such a badass back in the day with these.
---
yes stratholme was a port.
---
We plan to add significant functionality to this feature overtime. Stay tuned.
---
This is how I remember it
---
Someone will have to handle those whelps.
---
That's the idea. There's no level cap increase in the image above.
---
if it ment that 100% would go to the people working on the classic team and no to activision, i would gladly sign up for wow premium.
---
I did it on two characters in the past. I think I have the hat trick in me.
---
A server crashing and lagging and not being playable isn't comparable to LFD dude. That's a ridiculous comparison. Wanting no layering system is on par with asking them not to make the game play without 30 fps and 4:9. The game can be mechanically improved and yet you'd rather experience a faulty launch?
---
So many people on private servers are teenagers who were either babies or not even alive when retail vanilla released. A large majority of the wow playerbase has always been 20+. If anything, I think there will be more young kids playing vanilla in 2019 than in 2004/5.
---
Transmog would ruin everything. I mean literally everything.
---
Yeah I wouldn’t expect it to be another swamp of sorrows- more that the black morass/original badlands was more akin to it so maybe there’d be some features or remnants present in the transition between swamp to coast.
---
That being said the map is still excellent and you can easily hand wave it off by saying that it’s just how the land adapted since the blasted lands event
---
Did you just assume my species?
---
Then how did it happen to me when my group didn’t change? Maybe the layer got full and my group got shifted to another one? Or maybe someone joined a new guild while we were grouped up? Idk how it happened, but it happened...
---
I heal when polyed, and if you're leaving me polyed, I'm not taking damage.  Why bother shifting?
---
Even as recent as WoD which is why I can't believe people aren't remembering this. Tanaan Jungle was a laggy glitchy mess and the chain of quests and RPs made it even WORSE. That's if you could even get into the game. That was just 5 years ago!
---
I dont want to contradict you because I dont know but 2-3 millions sounds extremely exagerated. But again I don’t know what Im talking about but still
---
Nah man a lot of people think dead servers won’t happen or won’t happen until later. Even though dead servers happened in vanilla quite early despite a growing population the whole lifespan of vanilla.
---
And 10 hour queues would kill the game quicker than anything. Anyone who says they want that wouldn’t stick through the 10 hour queue.
---
There *is* a mountain range between the two.
---
I think you mean "neglect my wife and kids and broadcast screeching children to everyone on ventrilo every raid night".
---
what if they had the wintersaber in the shop, but it was $10,000. so obviously the normal person wouldnt buy it, but blizzard could still get that $?
---
/s
---
&gt; If they try to kite you just blink away at max range and enjoy the free ticks of food/water.
---
Then they stealth and wander off.  You aren't beating them by running away to get range.
---
Night Elf is better for Rogue v. Rogue. Higher stealth level means you will see them before they see you and get the opener.
---
I highly recommend NE if you want to be Alliance. Undead or Orc for Horde.
---
If you choose to work that much you are not going to have time to do anything outside of work.
---
If you have a normal job working 40 hours per week you should have plenty of time to play classic.  Sure you might not be able to get rank 14 in PvP or scarab lord but you can do pretty much everything else.
---
feedbacks great, the people saying not to have any solution and just let the chips fall where they may are doing nothing in terms of feedback though. They're advocating for leaving a problem be than to solve it.
---
Wasn´t this sub in favour of server merges as a solution for long time server health? Layering is just that only with reserved names.
---
I have a wheel of time wallpaper.
---
You are actively choosing not to block people who post annoying things like that. Your experience of the sub is completely in your control.
---
I just got out of a long marriage luckily without any kids. This was about 1.5 years a go before I heard about classic WoW lol. I have a good career in software and that’s all I need to worry about. A few times a year I work 50-60 hours a week but it’s usually 30-40. I should be able to play 25-35 hours a week. I have a girlfriend I’m trying to get into it so I hope that works out. I mainly need to drink less so I don’t sleep early.
---
My ZG tiger is still my favorite mount. I use it daily.
---
reported for reporting reporters /s
---
It would die in one AoE if not phased. You will also tell the imp to stay at a location near the tank rather than have it follow you, as your DPS position may be too far for the tank to receive the buff.
---
Wailing caverns
---
Literally not my point. Hard tohave fun when the server starts lagging or crashesand kicks players who then get stuck in long queues.
---
People who say they wouldn't be able to are insane. They raid 17 hour days on progression and spend about same time in the weeks leading up to raids in prep. They would Compete easily.
---
Or just regular money if you value your time.
---
This is the site you want to decipher what each field means. Not sure if it has Classic-only descriptions, but it should help: https://wowdev.wiki/DB/Spell
---
Gnome or Dwarf. Human is useless. Perception is only good for duels. In world pvp it’s worthless. 
---
I’d say Gnome is better than Dwarf because Escape Artist is good against every class in the game while Stoneform is only good against other Rogues really.
---
you dumb bird
---
It is, imo, a better game for casuals than any recent iteration of wow. It provides a longer and far more fulfilling difficulty and character progression arc than 'use heirlooms/xp pots to get to max level in 8 hours then do boring daily quests'.
---
MS paint
---
Actually the demon part is pretty true, so it would be just mainly undead and scarlet. As far as zone hubs, There are plenty of areas vastly more dominated by horde/alliance, Desolace does have a alliance hub area, but it's not heavily busting with quests, nore nearly as large as the two combined villages of horde. Thousand needles is literally just a flight point for alliance, Horde had most except the very left of feralas as questing, alliance really only had access to the left half of feralas. Horde are also the only quest hub area/town in Swamp of sorrows.
---
As for alliance, they have a small questing hub in winterspring north of the goblin town, with center access higher quest density but slightly less mobile area in ashenvale, only alliance has a town in western plaguelands, and blasted lands.
---
The accessibility and ease of travel both factions had greatly varied in each zone. That's why i disagree with the layout of that map. As alliance it felt good to travel to certain areas, and as horde it felt good. Later on everything felt much more "neutral" and "fair"
---
I mean the vast majority of people I played with in classic had normal jobs just like everyone else.
---
In fact in a lot of ways you need to play less in classic than modern WoW.  There is no Azerite power farming, world quest dailies or needing to run Mythic+ etc.
---
You can basically only log on for raids once you have BIS from 5-mans.
---
Or they are terrible.  (I fall in the terrible category.)
---
That’s awesome. I’m a bigger fan of the horde races but I can’t imagine not having SW and IF as my capitals.
---
UD is weak in Vanilla because there’s very few Alliance Warlocks.
---
It's not bad if you are a skinner.  You can also cook the meats and vendor them for profits as well.  It's not the best gph, but you will make some gold will grinding the mount.
---
Which ones are they?  A shaman tier set?
---
&gt; Walk up to a chest/node and it disappears?
---
[citation needed] - Stop making shit up.  Resources don't just vanish due to layering.
---
Yeah you’re clueless.
---
I am under the assumption that the mountain range was a result of the blasted lands events
---
There have never in the history of WoW been server merges. If you want connected realms like blizzard did (which you don’t) then by all means say that. 
---
It also defeats your immersion argument that the other side uses against layering. 
---
Which is more immersion breaking; someone disappearing in front of you every now and then for 2-3 months top at the start? Or adding
---
 -blackrock every time you want to message someone cause your realm “merged”?
---
Let’s talk about transfers too cause that’s the other argument to use against layering. Guess how well server transfers worked in vanilla? They didn’t. The realms getting them generally stayed low pop and the ones allowing the transfers off stayed with queues.
---
Tell me again how are these options better than layering?
---
The best thing would be for blizzard to put things in to prohibit layer shifts at will. One thing I see mentioned is locking your account to a layer and only allowing a shift when grouped. Another would be only allowing layer shifts in groups and when you are in a rested area. This means you can’t just layer shift to farm nodes/chests/rare mobs cause you’d have to travel. Well you could but you probably aren’t making it in time to get the node/chest/rare.
---
Ironforge looks like the best place to be in winter
---
There is no hurry this time!
---
I remember back in the original beta hunter pets retained their original size. I found this huge wolf rare spawn in Dun Morogh, things hair on it's back reached up to night elf's heads. Was sad when they changed pets to be one size.
---
The one reason why I want to main a female Tauren Hunter is just to tame this sucker at level 12 and ride into Azeroth with my pink homie. 
---
But love to heal and may go Druid. /cry
---
Horde design was kinda an afterthought. Look at how nicely done alliance main cities and starting a zones are. Then compare them to horse. Probably a deadline issue that never seemed to be needed to fix.
---
God bless my cousins, I had to auto-follow them every single time I went into IF for too long.
---
&gt;being able to buy gold directly from Blizzard basically would destroy the economy
---
This is kind of disingenuous. The gold still comes from a player every time, they aren't just printing it. It would theoretically have a similar type of impact to that of real money gold sellers. The severity of the impact is totally up in the air I think because of the adaptive gold price and might be a reason to be cautious, but it wouldn't suddenly ruin the economy as long as wow tokens stay tied to the realm you are on (I think on retail specifically wow tokens are totally cross-realm on the AH?).
---
Nobody mentions dwarf?
---
Perception doesn’t work on invis pots. Dwarf Rogue counters the crap out of other rogues because they can stoneform out of blind. Like I said you’re utterly clueless and shouldn’t be in here talking about a game you’ve never played.
---
Joana was 2:42 to ten. So yeah, times have changed.
---
There are quite a few Behind-the-Scenes documentaries for cinematics, even Blizzard has a few. The $15,000+ per finished second gets tossed around a lot in the AAA industry.
---
Warrior PvP
---
Level ranges by ever 5 levels roughly, from green through yellow from yellow to red to purple.
---
No
---
I'm curious about how the cooled Ironforge.
---
You mean again?
---
I agree, the warrior rank 10 champions set is my favorite looking set in the entire game to date. Include that Stone Guards tabard and boy you are looking *fire*
---
Warrior blue rank 10 pvp set
---
This is absolutely what you should do. I’m about 95% sure this is what my girlfriend 14 years ago read through after she started playing and got curious about the world she was in. She gushed about how much she loved the background, and went from *quite* *interested* to completely *hooked*. It’s a long-ish read for web pages, but nothing close to a couple of published trilogies or like 8 hours of videos.
---
You watched the video...that's why
---
&gt; Fix to that is more servers, less people per server.
---
Vanilla had 90 servers, and 100,000 players at peak on launch day.
---
So you're suggesting what... 3,000 servers at launch?
---
I mean they can but the way blizzard wants layering to work you shouldn’t shift like that.
---
THIS 💕
---
I think 2 hours a workday and 4 weekend is on the table. Anyone should have that much time for themselves.
---
you can try and insult me all you want, doesn't change the fact that you're wrong.
---
&gt; Then merge them in a few months when all the tourists leave, one way to do it could be to have servers called Tarren Mill 1, Tarren Mill 2 and Tarren Mill 3 and ear mark them for merging so people know at least some way who the rest of their communities will be when mergers happen.
---
So... layering?
---
You're describing layering.
---
That would be ideal. It would stress me the fuck out but it would be cool haha
---
no it's not hyperbole, it's the same circlejerk this sub makes in every post.
---
So many haters. GJ man!
---
I never really played alliance, played horde because I had friends there. So want to also play classic to get that wow experience
---
The downvotes don’t lie.
---
Classic is about to be HUGE. With the rise of souls games and other hardcore experiences, along side a starved rpg/mmo community at large, lays the foundation for a perfect storm of WoW Classic. Plus, I bet 25% of players will be playing simply because they can afford it now and couldn’t get a hold of a credit card when Vanilla launched. 
---
This game is going to take over.
---
The alternative is clusters. Dragontooth 1, 2, 3, 4. Shared player and guild name pool between all servers. Plan to merge them when needed. No dead servers and none of the myriad issues that sharding brings for your entire 1-60 experience.
---
fuck playing the game. the real game is spending 41% of an entire day NOT playing the game.
---
Stone talon my guy
---
Phase one is a long ass time, dude!
---
But I did. Stop pretending like your opinion dictates what other people's past experiences were.
---
I mean I’d probably just have my wife queue me up right after I left for work so I could play when I get home for a bit.
---
Sounds like you gotta fight for the alliance too
---
Im surprised! Today I learned ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
That looks like the art out of Dinotopia! Double the nostalgia!
---
TIL. Aren't those part of the AQ40 war effort?
---
Layering needs to be severely reworked. Everything I was afraid of it being seems to be coming to light in the beta...
---
They've all said multiple times they plan to roll on PvP servers because its extra content. So if you're trying to avoid streamers, your better off rolling on a PvE server.
---
Used to go there on my rogue and fish in the little pool in one of the hallways all the time. Most were friendly and waved back and let me fish in peace.
---
For Healing Priests, I think Mantle of the Scarlet Crusade is way better than Elder Wizard's Mantle. 
---
- 9 int
---
+ 11 sta
---
+ 11 spi
---
+ 9 healing
---
Not in classic. I'm not sure when it was added, but the Venomhide Ravasaur quest is similar.
---
I mean, maybe. What do you bring to the table?
---
What I don´t get is why they can´t do it in a way that makes a prompt when you pick a server and you get the option for layer 1-5. And then choose your layer with your friends and play there. No connections between layers and all is fine.
---
Experiment with rank 1 versions of spells which cast faster and/or cost less mana. You'll never be able to kill one that doesn't want to die (unless you have a PoM-pyro spec) in the world because they can always bail but you should be able to make yourself an untasty morsel.
---
Like any game worth playing.
---
Yeah a shitstorm on release is fine honestly. I know leveling and questing will be frustrating but I just don’t care. Layering is just so much worse.
---
That was in vanilla. It took him about 2 months at 8 hrs/day.
---
I would personally.
---
Maybe.  Might be a good time to look into other options as well.  Harder to change once things go live.
---
Its the only way!
---
If you haven't already, check out my spreadsheet. It's an in-depth dps analysis with dynamic stat weights to determine effectiveness of one item over another. If you feel like it's missing something, leave a suggestion/feedback! I've also got a resistance gear tab for combining various amounts of resistance. You can see what I intend to add as well in the changelog towards the bottom.

---
Dude, you may not like Swifty and that's fine, but "who cares", that's just an absurd comment.
---
This guy is professional gamer with 528k followers and over 6000 paying subscribers on Twitch. He has over 700k subscribers on YT with over 200 million views. He has on average 4500 viewers on twitch peaking at over 8k views when he streams.
---
So "who cares" about this washed up guy? A LOT of people do.
---
Thats awesome. Inside a cold mountain the fires keep everything warm
---
So the clustering idea also kills server communities, economies, and immersion once you log in with hundreds of other people that you’ve never seen or played with before.
---
I love when the viable options pitched by the anti-layering group also ruin everything the anti-layering side doesn’t want ruined by layering.
---
layer = virtual server
---
The only way something vanishes is because you have moved yourself to a different server where that item isn't actually there.  There is no accidental layer switching happening *ever* in any of these videos.  People are intentionally switching layers.  Nothing is going to vanish without you making it happen.
---
Don't want your node to vanish?  Don't go to a different server.
---
This is a complete non-issue.  EQ2 had layers and no one freaked out about it, because it didn't actually matter.  No one cared that someone was farming ore on a different layer than they were.  This is just people crying for the sake of crying.
---
This is the censored version, makes it kinda silly.
---
&gt; no, shield for prot warrior stage 6 is not a mistake, take a look at the armor and block values ;)

Eh, you don't make sense, OP.

Married + 1 Kid here, here's how overtime I've been allowed to game. (Wife hates games, she just doesn't get it, a very pragmatic woman) 
---
Wake up at 7am go to work, get home around 7 pm, hang out with my son and wife, help out with everything that needs to be done, 9:30 my kid sleeps and i stay up until 12:30am - 2am depending on the intensity of the next day. 
---
I can do this about 5 times a week ish (including weekends), but i always organize my raiding days with my wife so she knows i'm busy. As long as i plan in advance, it's cool. When i get to around 60 and it sort of slows down i raid 2 times a week and farm/play 1-2 days. 
---
It takes it's toll over time though if i'm being honest. I do Plan on taking 2 weeks off to get as close as possible to get 60 so i don't have to let my sleep suffer so much, but that's how I've been playing private servers recently.
---
I think more likely it's a question of whether or not it's a "quality of life" Pandora' s box worth opening. Waiting in queues wasn't "fun" necessarily either, but I'd trade queue-free servers for WoWs soul back a thousand times over. Over regulating the fluidity of the game/gameplay can have the unintended consequence of crushing some of the organic spontaneity, and unpredictability that make mmo's such a unique and flavorful experience...see the corrupted blood incident
---
The same % of resources should be out there, it's just now you can get some insight into whether or not they are being gathered in other layers and then join that layer to gather it before someone on that layer will.
---
I’d really recommend running
---
Ah, that's the dilemma. They don't want to propose a solution, they want to be mad.
---
x-realm bgs were a blessing for low level bgs.
---
I have experienced non voluntary layer shifts in the stress test. Lots of them mid fight. I have seen it happen myself. So don’t tell me it can’t happen.
---
Thing is it’s a “new” tech. Blizz is still ironing out the bugs. At least I hope they are. I do agree people are crying to cry. Blizz is probably loving it too cause it detracts from things that actually matter.
---
Even with layering ghost towns will probably still happen to a few servers. Also cross faction collusion. Both of these are far bigger issues than layering imo but as long as people care about layering more those won’t get talked about.
---
Layering is not necessary, starting the sub 30 zones is a better solution.
---
Tauren is the best for elemental
---
The first turn in for the day had a better reward + rep.  Repeating it multiple times is just for pure rep.  In a way, it was a daily, but with the option to grind rep as much as you want.
---
Agreed on these. Getting those bleeds, poisons, and undead priest disease off is great... But damn if you don't get rooted entirely too much.  But female dwarves look legit as rogues too.
---
Middle ground, they should theoretically be able to render a lower polygon count for her to match the old fidelity. Would still look better I think
---
Yes, this is the to go tactic for getting a different mount later as you get a massive rep boost.
---
This grind was annoying to do even in wrath.  I can't even begin to imagine how long and truly how tedious it would other people there, and taking much longer to kill enemies and such.
---
Another good way to look into this is to look at the studios doing these cinematics for companies that don't do them in-house. Blur Studios has an estimated annual revenue of $22 million and they don't do more than 10 projects a year.
---
I think that is actually an understatement.  If you were on a high pop server, you'd likely be spending way more than 5 months if all you did was spend 4 hours a day.
---
And have the coolest kick animation (make). Female human has second best kick.
---
Thats crazy! But the quality is undeniable. Worth it !
---
Pretty sure they existed long before then. Aren't all the AQ war-effort turn-ins in one city? Each faction's cloth rep quests were in their respective cities.
---
If they dont fix leeway, I might have to roll a melee class... 
---
The thought of trying to kite and getting stabbed from 15 yards away sounds miserable.
---
Your map shows the wrong zone!
---
Did it in wrath and it was still tedious and annoying.  I can't even begin to imagine this in vanilla... I am sure there was a reason I only ever saw one guy with it on my server at the time pre TBC.
---
For this particular role its best to go master demonologist/ruin [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/AAT8wZ8TBOMDTAQ](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/AAT8wZ8TBOMDTAQ)
---
Having reduced threat while imp is out will allow you to deal consistent dps similar to mages, the only draw back is that to get 10%/15% damage increase, you either need your succubus out or demonic sacrifice her. Keep imp phased near tank and be max range from imp to benefit from threat reduction and stamina.
---
&gt; I have experienced non voluntary layer shifts in the stress test. Lots of them mid fight. I have seen it happen myself. So don’t tell me it can’t happen.
---
&gt; Thing is it’s a “new” tech. Blizz is still ironing out the bugs.
---
I expect layering issues in Beta.  I expect them to make it randomly switch you to a different layer just so they can see what happens.  I expect all kinds of crazy shit with it, because that's what should happen in a beta test.
---
However, all these clips of streamers "exploiting" and "yikes!"-ing, are just people swapping layers on purpose and acting like somehow the end of the world is happening.
---
But they aren't. I have never gone to the twitch site aside from clicking on links to clips on it from reddit on my phone. 
---
I have never been to it on my PC. 
---
The streamers might stay on their own site but their fans cover gaming subreddits with their crap. 
---
How about I agree to continue never intentionally going to the twitch website and you all agree to keep the twitch content on there.  Then we can all be happy.
---
I don't think this is true. Felhunters are harder to banish than other demons
---
Wtf
---
I was wondering why I like Tauren...
---
&gt; I think on retail specifically wow tokens are totally cross-realm on the AH?
---
Correct. Blizz actually sets the price and there's one price for US/NA and one price for EU. IDK about other regions,
---
Ha. Yeah popular opinion definitely means you're right. It was of popular opinion that owning slaves was okay for a long time as well, as it turns out it is most definitely not right.
---
100% this... it took 100+ hours in wrath... you better believe vanilla stats, movement speeds, and actual player competition will drive the numbers up to extreme degrees. 
---
Not many people did this back in vanilla, and there is a reason... a vert, VERY tedious reason.  I would rather grind agility in OSRS to 99, 5 times than do this frostsaber grind in vanilla.
---
Best thing to do in those situations may be to have the spawns despawn as soon as they are looted on any layer tied to server or whatever architecture they are using.
---
Not true. It got rare when battlemasters were put in major cities.  No need to go anywhere to pvp
---
Humar the Pridelord. Had specialized pet perks before they all got nerfed to equalize the playing field. Like the rare raptor Takk the leaper that had swoop (knockdown) even tho it wasn’t a bird. 
---
I spent too much of my horde life in the damn Barrens trying to tame the 18 - 24 hour spawns
---
I doubt anyone would want to raid with players that use that list to be fair.
---
fucking omegaluls and shit nonstop
---
It's both? You can buy the tokens from Blizzard and sell them on the AH for a set amount of gold, or you can buy the tokens from the AH and use them for game time.
---
The depth of field and detail work is fucking awesome. Can you do more cities?
---
It doesn’t drop combat = u can’t trap after
---
Ughhhh do you make art which one can purchase?
---
You can't say server transfers won't work while simeotaneously pretending like layering will be temporary... Thats absolutely ridiculous.
---
This whole "tourist" meme has truth to it, but doesn't justify layering, what happens when they don't leave, notice I didn't say if.
---
The same company that produced, "You think you do..."
---
It´s bs. If anything make a leatherworking alt and send it there. there are crafting items that vendor for more than the raw leather is worth so you can even increase you profit. Or mail it further to your enchanting alt to get dust.
---
Lol I always think about this when i see these trucks. Louisville/southern Indiana area?
---
Should have done something with the night elf tower, some disturbed ruins coming to life because of the scourge would be sick.
---
Honestly you can tank in your leveling spec even if you aren't up to three levels harder. Having a tank set is far more important. You really don't get much use out of protection until close to max level.
---
It’s good imo that the streamers are doing it and bringing it to everyone’s attention. Maybe blizzard will do something to curb the abuse unlike the sharding abuse on retail that was rampant through all of WoD.
---
In the end it doesn’t make much difference. Not everyone will do it some will though. Ultimately it won’t matter cause anything gained will be used up or gone after 2 months of layering being turned off.
---
People are forgetting that blizzard doesn’t use dynamic node spawns and also don’t have the custom node spawns that pservers have.
---
“LFG DM” 
---
You mean “lfg VK?”
---
Hitting 99 mining or agility is  faster than doing this grind in vanilla.  99 agility was like 300~ hours or so right?  Mining depends on the activity, but most probably took 500ish for the average person. 
---
This frostsaber grind was known for taking 500-700 hours depending on server pop and your own gear level.
---
Who’s gonna watch someone streaming on a PvE server?
---
EverQuest has been launching classic-ish servers for years. It's the same every time. A good chunk of folks just come to check it out and bail by level 20. That's as close a comparison to the upcoming classic wow launch that you're going to find.
---
I would guess that you would hear similar things from OSRS players. But I've never played it so just guessing at that one
---
You can. But Mulgore sucks, it has the same amount of mobs, but spread over a high larger area.
---
hey noob i miss u bby.
---
Isn't that like cheating?
---
I remember playing Dark Age of Camelot, and "radaring" is a bannable offense.
---
Not true. Happened to me without a group over burning steppes.
---
This is exactly the point I'm trying to get everyone to understand:  layering doesn't matter.
---
Warriors too. Can also clean up a tough dot after a run in with an undead priest, but not likely to have only that one dot on you. Gnomes are more useful more often though. Too bad they don't look as cool as dwarf.
---
Frost Nova isn't pointless against Druids because they have to shift to break the root, and shifting costs mana, and you will beat them if they run out of mana. There are times when I was too aggressive on my Druid, tried to kill a Mage when I only had like 20% mana, got rooted, and died.
---
But yeah, aside from that situation, you won't beat them. Accept that and start running towards your nearest friendly targets if a Druid opens on you. You have a chance when it's 2v1.
---
#nochanges
---
I main'ed a holy priest and resto druid during Vanilla (yes, I like healing lol). I level'ed as shadow and feral while still healing up to 60 just fine (need healing set as feral). 
---
There is no need to level as a healing spec, you will just slow yourself down. You can switch to a full healing spec at 60 or sooner if you feel you're having a hard time healing higher level instances as a dps spec.
---
I agree with you 100%
---
I'd play the shit out if it... but realized im good
---
And it made me roll a Tauren so I can slap down Hunters and their bear pets with a log.
---
Fuck id murder for that old hunter shirt
---
Says he wants a massive change, then no changes, then says the content that would be no changes is actually too many changes.
---
RIP
---
This is incredible, job well done!!!
---
Anyone else have mild feelings that could remove some of the delight of discovery of the game? After all....not all those who wander are lost....idk, just one dude’s opinion
---
Actually history says server transfers won’t work. History is far more predictive of the future than you or I. Just cause you don’t say if, doesn’t mean no one is going to quit playing.
---
Layering will be turned off with phase 2. Hard stop. Blizzard has expressed multiple times they don’t want multiple world bosses up per server. Also explicitly said it will be turned off at phase 2 at the latest.
---
Horde gets a raptor from a questline in ungoro, right?  Or was that added later on?
---
New phone who dis
---
Green items are guaranteed in chests on pserver. Seem to have about a 25% chance on classic.
---
Do you mean 20 level gap? Dno why people keep parroting 40.
---
There's no perfecet solution. Blizzard has a choice between a 15,000-20,000+ person mega server wherein players are warping in and out of existence amongst mostly strangers...or a bunch of static 3-4K servers that will have to eventually be merged.
---
At least on the smaller servers it will feel like Vanilla felt until the merge point(s). You will see the same people. Get a chance to know them. I think a megaserver presents a similar problem that retail has with making strangers temporary, anonymous entities.
---
I mean, it really depends on how many years you intend to spend grinding this thing.  If you don't even have time to raid 1-2 days a week for a few hours each day, then I highly doubt you are going to complete this 500-700 hour grind in less than 2 years.  
---
That is assuming you still intend to do other things on that character, such as dungeon running and what have you.
---
Gonna cut that finger off you Horde scum.
---
Am also Horde.  I'm glad we can speak amicably to one another before your day of reckoning when your broken body's last word heard is KEK.
---
That being said, this city is a true marvel and nothing in many other MMOs or even in expansions quite brought upon the wonder and amazement of Ironforge.
---
Does one of them represent GM island?

But... queue says 6 hours, you're home at 6pm
---
so you queue up at noon on the dot.
---
queue goes slightly faster than normal. You pop into game at 5:44
---
You get booted at 5:59
---
Congrats on the next 6 hours of queuing AND an angry wife cause "I thought I did that, why are you doing it now?!"

You're right. The OP is totally wrong.

How the fuck is this related?

It takes way longer than 120 hours; try 500-700.  
---
No way is it possible to no life it in a week in vanilla.  Maybe if you no lifed for a full month you'd get it.
---
Fuck, just when I decided to go horde. Now im doubtful again. Amazing work!
---
Trying in vain man... it’s ok I’ll fight the fight with you.
---
I thought we did have transmogs. You can be a furblog, a ninja, a pirate, and a skeleton!
---
Just came here to say this is amazing!
---
I would rather farm mages and level dire maul.
---
I think the new players who are worth having around will be able to appreciate it, and stay for the same reasons as everyone else
---
This plus to complicate matters, certain resists are binary (like frost, which either inflicts full damage or none and if none, the effect is functionally the same as a miss).
---
Hair loss?
---
Tanks and healers arent more important.  They are just less common.  Without dual specs and cheap respecs, it's only going to widen that disparity because a lot of people won't want to be locked away from a DPS spec.
---
No one knows what the balance is going to be like in classic, but if it's anything like vanilla then healers and tanks will have absolutely no problem instantly getting a group together.
---
Man, I totally forgot about this! Brings me back.
---
Except he is wrong, it is way longer than 120 hours in vanilla.  100~ was wrath levels when we had better movement and just killed everything instantly, and there was no competition. 
---
In vanilla it took 500-700 hours easily.  It takes longer than getting 99 agi or 99 mining through normal means.

Even on the mega servers, if done right, you will see and get to know people. It’s not like seeing someone in the game world is the only way to get to know them. Hell most of the infamous people on my vanilla server, I never actually played with. You just knew them from the chats.
---
Were you involved in a server “merge” in vanilla?

Battlegroups
---
That’s almost exactly how it would go.
---
Definitely not. The standard build for the imp bitch is SM/Ruin.
---
You're going deep into Demonology for an extra 11 stamina on Blood Pact and 20% reduced threat - that's it. In exchange you're missing out on Nightfall, +10% damage, and a bunch of utility.
---
That is a straight up garbage spec for the imp bitch.
---
Have you considered live streaming as you make these?
---
&gt; not over the top like modern wow
---
Yeah I miss vanilla wow, modern wow is just ridiculous with weapon sizes and shoulder pads.  They took it too far.
---
Isn't there a mage in Thunder Bluff? Where you port in?
---
3 months is a long frickin time lol... we are way beyond first impressions for most who intend to play classic at that stage. 
---
Also, what if servers are still 3 layer capped with around 3.5k players per layer?  Wouldn't that mean the server would get insane que's like none we've ever seen before?  Or would they simply stuff 10k~ players into one server and say "screw it"?
---
There are way too many holes in what they've told us so far.
---
The bloodsail buccaneers offer the BiS hat. GG.
---
Lol my very first character that I created was a dwarf hunter
---
That's fair, exactly what I did. Just dont find yourself miserable in 20 years because you've lost site of the true priorities in life... wish you the best, life is brutal lol.
---
Go mining / engineering. Mining is good money, (Arcane Crystals) and Engineering for the Grenades - they help a lot for AOE tankjng in dungeons. Plus you get some cool trinkets form engineering.
---
Is it possible to just death run all the way to Mulgore as a ghost for the move speed increase and then spirit healer there?
---
And what defines the "beginning"?
---
They want to use this for all of phase 1.  Not the first few days.  Not the first week.  Not even the first month.  I am sure we could agree that phase 1 would at least last 3 months (I would assume more since more people might not even be 60 in 3 months).  An entire phase worth of layering, and they are assuming the game will lose players to allow them to remove it to begin with.
---
I've been playing on a private server a tiny bit and I was able to make a Tauren and start questing in the Orc/Troll area and a Gnome and start questing in the Night Elf area.
---
I'm just going to do what I did last time.
---
I'll miss my wife and kids.
---

I love pally and warlock lore. I ran a pally and deathknight in wotlk and cata so I've decided I'm maining a warlock this time around. Haven't ever leveled a caster so I am excited for the new change!
---
It was  Forgotten Circle in Vanilla with Aion in charge. We got server first Thunderfury with help from Semper and did well in raiding. Then a small spilt occurred in AQ40. Barahir took over.
---
Yea, I think the point is that having sharding in the starter zone for 2-3 weeks would be way frickin better than having 3 separate instances of the world per server, for an entire phase of content (3-5 months?).
---
The BFA model looks amazing. Now if we could just get that quality model in that bikini outfit.
---
I could see them doing a sort of ad or commercial for it but I dont think they would do it only for current players. They want to draw new ones and those that quit back in. They're really expensive.
---
TBC release was indeed a hilarious shitshow. I don’t remember it being especially buggy....maybe it was and I don’t remember but nevertheless it was certainly a memorable experience to be with nearly literally every other person on your server in hellfire peninsula grouping up and/or competing for mobs. Fun times
---
Not to mention the [Force Reactive Disk](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18168/force-reactive-disk). Yeah, Mining/Engineering is the way to go.
---
Already submitted my resignation yo!
---
&gt; Can the naysayers please suggest a better solution?
---
Clusters would be like Vanilla. You'd always log on to the same server with the same people on Dragontooth 2. You could never be on Dragontooth 1, 3, or 4 until the merge happens.  You would get to know the people on your server. Eventually, after a few weeks or a month, there would be one painful moment when a big influx of strangers joined.
---
Layering is a mega server with an incredible amount of people who will share the same continent on Monday and then not see each other again for weeks or months. Because of the state of flux of all things, it will likely create a sense of always being amongst strangers. For example, that Mage who gave you intellect yesterday is questing in Wetlands today. He:
---
* would be someone you see again and group up with to do some quests
---
or
---
* would not be someone you see again for weeks
---
I imagine patchwerk looks like a teddy bear.
---
Depends do you enjoy winning or losing  battlegrounds?
---
My priest logged out in this majestic city in 2006 and just logged back in in 2019. This painting is AMAZING.
---
It wasn't nearly as bad as Blizzard makes it out to be back when vanilla launched.
---
Vanilla's launch was terrible because they did not realize the game would be selling millions of copies within a couple weeks of release, and they did not have the server space, and they sold too many physical copies than was originally intended or wanted.  
---
So servers were crashing, que's were reset every crash, lag was rampant, and people generally sucked in every sense of the word back then. 
---
People stagger themselves based on play time and dedication.  People never quit despite vanilla's launch being the worst I've ever heard of for any game, to date.  People didn't quit TBC despite alliance AND horde being mixed in the same starting zone.  You did what you could and you moved on/waited till later.
---
The only way I can see gold costing you less time is if you sell carries for bookoo gold.
---
AB feels like it heavily favored horde to me.  I dont ever remember losing in vanilla, and even in retail I still win it way more often than not.  It's also my fav BG, so maybe its just confirmation bias.
---
Yeppers
---
You haven’t subscribed in five years so why would they ask you for feedback?
---
No, because players play at difference paces and for different amounts of time. 
---
Why didn't vanilla die back then despite having the worst launch in gaming history?  Why didn't TBC die despite mixing horde and alliance together in the same starting zone?  People DID NOT CARE.
---
I've recently been doing some 1-10ish runs in Dun Morogh on a pserver and am always a bit confused by the (at least!) 5-10 people grouping around those item spawn locations.  Just, you know, don't do the quest! The amount of time people waste on that ONE quest...  Just grind some mobs if you want to make up the XP, lol.
---
Can’t argue there.
---
To remove poly. It’s a bait and switch mechanic. 
---
They either shapeshift out of poly to break cc or you are left freecasting.
---
For the love of God do more. I loved this! Great work!
---
Left side, even side will handle it.  Just keep Crushem away from there.
---
Lol. I hate that guy. If I roll on that server I will also do this with you.
---
That looks amazing
---
LMAO, rend &gt; HS for almost all warrior content other than MT raids.
---
So sick, and I’m horde
---
Holy shot that’s badass.
---
Well there is the entire issue with layering now isn't it?  Why should they be layering in a way that increased the server's total population to begin with?
---
What if this particular server never loses enough players?  Does that server get stuck with layering forever?  The answer is absolutely yes... they wont let 10-12k players on one server at any given point, as the unmodified world cannot really handle it.
---
Amazing!
---
There are pvp vids where mages hide behind trees and such and blast opponents to pieces who don´t even know whats happening.
---
You're right, actually I think this was a feature in Vanilla...
---
In his version you wouldn't be able to switch between layers, you chose a permanent one until merge day comes. However it'll probably get weird if Classic takes off like crazy and merge day doesnt come for several years; could rename the servers though.
---
Man I used to get genuinely upset at people who shit on classic. To me it was such a clear cut better game, I think people who played pre cata saw first hand the changes to the game that robbed it of what made it unique, so our opinions to us is really obvious. Without having seen that, and starting in like mop and onwards, you don’t have the perspective of why the older game was so different and so much more fulfilling. But to have those people go out of their way to shit on a game they’ve never experienced used to anger me to no end lol. So glad we get the last laugh, they’ve all gone into hiding lmao. 
---
I bet if classic did die in like 1 week (which there’s absolutely no chance but just hypothetically), these people would all resurface “see I knew this game sucked” etc etc. so annoying
---
The second one was in-game in Wrath beta, but it never made it to live.
---
This is pretty much /thread. Also for hard AOE packs zappers are great to give you some extra aggro. Also if a healer has aggro on mobs you can nade the mobs and give yourself a few seconds to save him.
---
Its funny. Back in vanilla there was a time I made a tauren druid because I thought it would be the fastest character to collect as many flight paths as possible because of travel form. Then I went on the basis that I will level up by exploring every zone, and i will be able to fly to any zone i want so i can cut travel time whilst leveling.
---
You going to give free server transfers when half the Classic population quits in the first 90 days? 
---
Get over it, they said it is temporary.
---
Yea, except people are already showing how easy it is to abuse it even with being invited into groups.  The entire system is just one massive hole in the infrastructure of the game.  
---
It can't be fixed... they assume everyone will tolerate it for as long as they deem fit, and sadly it seems their assumption is turning out to be true.  Welcome to corporate gaming.
---
I really hope to collect the hybrid tank sets from Scholo/Stratholme.
---
Bloodmail set for an enhancement Shaman, cadaverous set for a feral druid, Deathbone for Paladins.  I don't know why, I just want the challenge of tsnking 5 mans as a hybrid.
---
Actually had the same cluster idea an hour ago. Don´t know about technical limitations on this tho.
---
Sadly, Blizzard is banking on the assumption that most players simply wont care enough about it to not play. 
---
I would say that their assumption is already turning out to be quite true based on the lack of layering beta feedback and overall negativity towards people who dislike it altogether.  
---
They know people want to play the old WoW.  They shoved loot trading in, right click/automated report/punishment in, updated shaders (defaults of many things are advanced) and increased vegetation (not always a bad thing, but not vanilla), and of course layering.
---
I actually feel Vanilla is better due to not having daily quests. Yeah, you have to reside in the fact that you won’t have as good of gear as hardcore players, but you definitely can expedite that process by going hardcore for a week or month. A couple MC runs and lucky drops and you can be geared out in T1 in a week or so.
---
I never understood the "covering up not to leave yourself exposed in battle" argument. Nothing in Warcraft is at all realistic or grounded when it comes to combat. Malfurion, Garrosh and Illidan run around shirtless and nobody mentions it then.
---
If you spirit ress at a different spirit healer than you were assigned to first, you will be teleported back to that spirit healer. This mechanic was put in place to stop players from ghost running to locations :)
---
I love how you mentioned comic book heroes. I’m fine with them looking either way. I think you just don’t even understand any of the stories. She’s just a person? Bruh. Go try to duel her when classic launches, you badass.
---
correct. the english name for echeyakke is WHITE MIST :O
---
Correct, I believe his name was Humar the pride lord iirc . He had a very long spawn time, I think it was around 27 hours? A lot of people killed him for sport so hunters wouldn't get it.
---
No way in hell. I remember a guildie doing this FOREVER. I would go down and help him every once in a while. Then again, I did go ranl 11 pvp for black mounts/other races mounts.
---
My guild is much like this. As of now we are going to attempt to raid once a week, but outside of that we all have kids, careers, wives, homes, etc...no time.
---
Is this really a painting? For real? Amazing!!!
---
There’s no way you could get this mount before 60 the rep grind alone would level you up
---
I just don't see how they can fix that issue without negatively impacting the ability to group with a friend in general.  
---
Let us say they "fix" these constant exploits we are seeing on beta.  That would likely mean we'd have to go to a city or something to get to the right layer.  So someone who might be in tanaris (just as an odd example) would have to travel somewhere else with his friend, presumably outside the zone (a city is my guess) and then join into the same layer, THEN head back to tanaris. 
---
Talk about a situation that would actually have people quit the game... People can live with 2-3 days of overpopulation in the first couple zones... people wont like needing to jump through hoops to group up properly, nor would they accept these constant exploits on the contrary.
---
Where's enhancement shaman BiS list? You act as if everyone doesn't want to bring at least 5 of them to every raid wtf
---
The black lion is a rare in Barrens. 
---
Human the Pridelord
---
I tested this theory out a few days ago and oh boy....I’m old now.
---
I wake up around 6AM everyday and after going to bed at 1AM after a night of gaming I was dead...
---
[The beer belly](https://imgur.com/yhG3YJL).
---
It’s north of Ratchet
---
The fact that it is apparent they are toying around with phasing is absolutely unacceptable to begin with.  
---
They are testing things... but they aren't things most people are going to enjoy.  Ask yourself this.  How can they possibly prevent a couple friends in 2 different layers from abusing the STV arena thing (or other similar crap)?
---
They can't without affecting the grouping experience.  Both players (or one of them at least) would need to travel somewhere to switch layers, likely a hub of some kind.  The safest of hubs where you can't just farm near by things would be a city.  Yea... I can't see that going over well when players would need to get to some hub to phase together before then heading back to the original destination they had left from.  Talk about complete lunacy.
---
This animation is specific to bleed abilities. You will mostly see this when a warrior crits and deep wound is applied. However, I have not been attentive when watching warrior streams to see if  this happens when a crit accure.
---
As far as what is in the zone up till Cata, there is nothing there, it looks just like the subpicture labeled "vanilla". Once the game started receiving updates for Cata i'm sure areas got renamed, but prior its nothing, so much so as to have that line in the sand from snow to dirt.
---
Are you joking?   Welcome to vanilla?
---
I took the day after launch off and that weekend sent my wife and baby up to visit her parents. I will be power leveling that entire first week to get to 60 because once life starts again I will never be able to play.
---
I’ll stop and smell the roses when I create an alt and have more time.

Warlock_Girl_91_ is nicer!
---
Im pretty good about not spilling near my keyboard thanks for looking out!
---
Because it is.
---
Maybe it did but fuck off with titles like that
---
Most people would, and Blizzard knows it.  
---
Did vanilla die?  Nope.  Did TBC die despite mixing alliance and horde into hellfire on day 1?  Nope.   People deal with it and continue playing.
---
There are some really cheap good monitors out there and wow isnt that intense so you shouldnt have to worry about dropped frames!
---
Yeah he's been washed up for years now, idk why people still take him seriously anymore

Which is why I hate these multi-class BIS lists, literally every single time, they have lots of glaring errors.

That makes it more fun for me.

It doesn't make sense that they both have ProcChance of 101 in the SpellAuraOptions table because we already know that they don't have a CD, they can Proc off themselves.

I have a better job which means pto. Also, I’m single with only my 3 huskies to take care of. I have a house. I already play pservers every day. I’ll be fine. Classic will be just another Tuesday for me.
---
Time to dust off the old repost:
---
Yeah, 1.12 was great, but it was only great because of the buildup. The ZG release, the war effort, world bosses, etc. Silithus went from empty to jam packed overnight when the quest hubs were released. It built community and a "history".
---
Azshara is still an underdeveloped zone in 1.12. As seen from explorers, Vanilla has areas where vertical progression can continue. Hyjal, Uldum, etc. There is unused map terrory south of Un'Goro/east of AQ. Hell, patch 1.16 could add an underground instance that could be harder than vanilla Naxx literally anywhere just by putting a portal into a rarely explored hillside or underneath Stromgarde Keep or the Thandol Span in Arathi, and it wouldn't ruin the rest of the Vanilla world. Deadwind Pass might be a good place for it too.
---
There are a lot of gameplay options for the devs. The constraint will be the lore. How you continue to develop "the game" itself without retconning all the TBC-to-present lore?**
---
You could re-create the "War Effort" by requiring the server to complete objectives first before unlocking the content. Imagine some fucking EPIC questline to restore the Thandol Span or build a tunnel out of UnGoro. It could be badass.
---
Shit. I was paralyzed, so I'm going to play 20 hours a day in a long term relationship.
---
No, you'll be at least level 2 by the time you get there due to exploring exp.
---
I take it you still live with your parents, use a CRT monitor and are going to aim for about 10 FPS then? Because thats how most of us played it back in the day.
---
The world changes in 15 years.
---
R/theydidth-
---
Some will. I think classic is so good that they will like it. They have never been able to play a game like this before. If they give it a chance they’ll be hooked by 10. The ones who can’t make it we probably don’t want anyways.
---
DM E jump runs is another option. And with herb or enchanting nets you more gold
---
I think you're referring to where I said "Deathwing's Chasm"? I had meant in the early previews of Cataclysm from Blizzard where they were showing off world changes. I remembered though it was called "Deathwing Scar" before they changed their minds.
---
But yes, prior to Cata it was empty map space. You could access it by a certain spot in the Dwarf starting zone, and some clever jumping. I explored up in that area quite a few times back in WotLK. One of the biggest excitements of Classic is being able to traverse these areas again, like Hyjal and Gilneas, as they existed pre-cata.
---
Thank you. I remembered the Chimaeras there but not the Wyverns.
---
So you're saying there's a chance..
---
That's because you're looking at the post-proc data. Of course the effects have a 100% chance of effect once you have them.
---
I agree with the above about engineering. The only other very good option is blacksmith as there is quite a few good items to make.
---
Lots of that info will be old and out-dated.  Lots is wrong too.
---
Proc stuff is very well hidden, and no one has really sused out the info to my knowledge.  The procs are all controlled with bitmask flags, and lots of info is obfusaced.
---
For example, try to find 'Weapon Swing Speed' in the data.  I cannot find it anywhere in the 1.13 files.
---
101 is more than likely = null (this common, SQL uses -1 for null/true)
---
100 = 100 (for sure)
---
But Layering's not Sharding!!1!1111!!! O.o  o.O  
---
So many white-knight dipshits support Blizzard's obvious cost-saving methods over what would make a legitimate Vanilla experience.
---
To me people with a few hundred viewers are my favorite. Entertaining or skilled enough that they attracted an audience, but small enough they can read and talk to chat
---
&gt; You need to google how normalization works. Too busy rn to reply but 2h weapons arent treated as having the same speed as 1h weapons. Its not 25% of the damage difference between the weapons, it is much more than that.
---
To my knowledge this only applies to Mortal Strike, which has a different multiplier for two-handed weapons than it does for one-handed weapons. Other instant attack abilities like Cleave and Whirlwind do not.
---
&gt;2h weapon vs 1h weapon speed is a far larger gap than 0.5 seconds man.
---
It's not. The slowest one-handed weapons are about 0.5 seconds slower than the slowest two-handed weapons.
---
Oh that is easy.
---
I am still a man with no life to speak of, therefore I continue to go on as I have in absolute stagnation, with all the time in the world to raid when I get back from work.
---
Why does the clip stop just as it’s beginning??
---
Why do rogues really want to run herbalism?
---
I haven't...other than the tips 1v1 tourney

I was always so disappointed to not see a Tauren running around with one of those logs
---

---
I could get down with that. Especially if the final boss of the scarlet raid was the necropolis moving in and nuking the place
---
Arcanite Reaper with Crusader!    
---
WoW was my first ever MMORPG and I squandered a lot of time doing silly crap and didn't really understand how to play until LVL 50-60.  So I'm gonna reroll a fresh warrior and do it right.  Pretty pumped.
---
One thing that bugs me about retail wow is that every single thing in a zone, is in service of some main theme of that zone. They don't feel like organic places with multiple things going on, and there's little to no cross pollination between them. It makes everything feel small. 
---
Especially the zones that follow a story. Like Drustvar... it tells a really cool story--but it can't stand alone. It only makes sense as part of that story. Any given location in that zone doesn't feel like a location, it just feels like a chapter of the story you played through. 
---
Instead of telling a story inside a zone, they tell a story WITH a zone, which makes everything feel unnatural, like it was only there to tell the story, rather than like it was a place you could explore, where a story took place.
---
Where have I heard this line before? OH yeah during the BFA beta
---
This is something I hadn't seen, and like it.  Personally, I don't mind them taking Classic and running with it in a different direction as though TBC never happened (or just hasn't happened yet).  
---
I'm kind of half expecting them to do something like Diablo 2 where you have ladder seasons.  Once we've had Naxx farmed to hell for so long, I wouldn't be surprised if they shard the existing characters to a non-ladder realm, and let everyone who wants to play the current season/server restart roll new characters.  
---
Either approach would probably piss off lots of people, but so would just letting everything sit stagnant with farmed out Naxx and never doing anything else.
---
You also have the ability to do DS for 15% damage if you aren't imp bitch, missing improved corruption and improved life tap for raids is trivial.
---
SM/Ruin is for PvE/PvP that can take imp bitch role but this build is most ideal for raiding and solo content.
---
I thought you just had to have a retail subscription to play? If so, couldn't you just farm it on retail, then pay for the subscription that way?
---
You make it sound like realm deaths were common back then.  Less than 5% of total realms pre wrath needed to be merged (though to be fair, some never did for whatever reason despite needing it).
---
If a server dies, then frickin merge it with another one.  It really isn't as bad as some of you think it will be.  If this ends up being a problem, then classic was not accomplishing what we all thought it would to begin with.
---
&gt; I was always of the opinion of instead of the first expansion taking place in the entirety of Outland...Blizzard should have focused on fleshing out the main continents of Azeroth and Kalimdor more.
---
*The daily repost:*
---
PTR didn't come till TBC
---
Why would you base your end-game profession choice on an herb that any level 20 can farm?
---
Vanilla has great replay value, been doing it for the last 13 years just fine. 
---
Adding any additional content to classic will take us town the same path as retail. Additional items that have higher stats than naxx will lead us to major imbalances , thus leading to a stat squish requirement. 
---
Yes games change over the years but with most console games you can play a static version. 
---
Classic is meant to be a museum piece it should remain the same untouched by time.
---
17 yards against tauren. Just wanted to be thorough.
---
I mean, potions and innervate are  a thing
---
That's what got me through on the long fights :)
---
I have completely chosen to make this decision and the act in which it was made was within full control of the action made which was in the full experience and completely in the control of the active chosen decision.
---
I remember farming winterspring
---
okay and you not having seen it doesn't make it not true, and yes I'm 100% sure about this.
---
All I know off hand was he claimed warrior dps to be the best in mc and that will of the forsaken breaks poly. I don’t know a whole lot about the situation and frankly I don’t really care if he’s lying about his experience or not. People lately just really decided to hate him and say he’s completely clueless. On classicast chat makes fun of him every time he speaks.
---
A legend for this map would be ideal, no idea what the colors I’m looking at mean..
---
No link?
---
It's really not. All they need to do is make numbered servers of the same name where it's apparent they are going to merge in the future and combine their name databases so that there are not any repeat names between the servers. Then merge them as the numbers and tourists drop off.
---
Layering is an over complicated answer to a simple problem.
---
I played Vanilla in College and raided, ran in premade bg teams, etc.  My life back then was WAY more hectic than it is now.  I did that all the way through grad school, the reason I stopped is because the game got too easy and wasn't challenging anymore.   I like the tedious nature of Vanilla and I loved how unforgiving it was at times.
---
Patch 1.10 for sure had them.
---
Even if you're just the sometimes imp bitch, this build sucks.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/AowwBMzBrkQE4wNMBA is better.
---
Don't try and reinvent the wheel. We've been at this for 15 years.
---
You'll get a heap of poison/blind mats from pickpocketing btw if that's what your worried about
---
Edited it in the post. Sorry!
---
&gt;  Later on in TBC and beyond everything felt much more "neutral" and "fair". 
---
Because it was always the alliance and horde traveling to some new area and staking a claim there. Which was cool the first couple of times...
---
In a sense, doesn't current Blizzard still do this? They scrapped an mmo, and just recently we learned they scrapped a Starcraft based FPS.
---
Dang dont remember that
---
Can't recall if it was called PTR back then, but PVP Battlegrounds were testable with premade 60s wearing T0 Sets.
---
Same boat but switch factions! I'm glad I didn't play both factions because like you said it's like a new game
---
But Vanilla had dynamic respawns...
---
Survive, adapt, overcome! If you can pass the LSAT, you can play wow, work and date!

Missing a few nice pieces: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j81TgG0p_HrYKajiUiQfYIoSUx1culzy2u_Fc4wtiS8/edit#gid=668429222
---
No idea, but even if there is, no guarantee it actually hands the required quests. Its similar on alliance, a nelf/dwarf hunter that goes to elwynn forest to level can go to stormwind to buy skills, but the trainers there dont hand out the class quests, so they need to go all the way back to darnassus/ironforge to get the quests, like learning how to tame beast.
---
TBC ruined the game. No changes means moving forward with the philosophy of Vanilla. TBC breaks all that.
---
NO CHANGES.
---
server merges
---
Nope.

Article from [June 23, 2006](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-realm-transfer-details-unveiled/1100-6153087/):    
---
&gt; With cross-realm battlegrounds, we can match players up across many realms, which means games will be starting and ending all the time. As a result, the wait to get into a battleground should be considerably less. We will, of course, test cross-realm battlegrounds on our **public test realms** for everyone to try out.
---
and you just want to circle jerk
---
Yup, old voice all day. I'm pretty sure the new voice is the same one as one of the generic undead female NPCs. The old voice was actually unique.
---
Oh nice!
---
I meant to say Phase 1 Pre-Raid. :(
---
But thank you for this link, I'll be sure to look through and include anything I did miss!
---
Wish i had known about this
---
Yeah , vendor light and medium no questions asked.  Heavy is hit or miss, thick or rugged sell on AH usually for modest profits.  People advertise often "mail me thick leather COD" and will say the price they accept which is an easy way to get rid of your stuff without the AH cut as well.
---
I also main Horde, and can concur that this is the coolest city. That being said, I recently leveled an Alliance character to 120 and I'm going back and playing through all the Alliance quests (I'm paying $15 a month for the entire game, right?). I'm digging the new-to-me content. Just don't tell Sylvanas.
---
How low spec is your definition of low spec?
---
I will be way more strict on bedtime for the same reasons. No you can’t have a drink of water; no you just went pee; your mom can snuggle with you; EtC

It's just evolution. The business practices and innovations most able to survive, reproduce.

There's a reason people don't design/produce/give away their own interweb technology/computing devices/servers, etc.
---
Everything in my link is Phase 1 pre-raid.
---
THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS
---
Glad to see we can disregard your opinion given that you don't know how the economy of this game works
---
If you're leaving towards human, do that. You'll enjoy it. That eliminates druid. Next, humans can't be hunters. So you've got rogue or mage. Mage can make the most of your rep bonus with AoE grinding (like ZG trash). Rogue is just a neat delve into the shadows. There is "allegedly" a "secret organization of rogues" that "controls the world", but is also really bad at using "air quotes" properly. But that's just a rumour.
---
I feel like you can never properly compare attack power and crit/hit chance because the two groupings of stats are multiplicative with each other for your final damage outout. I ultimately made a calculator spreadsheet to determine the DPS of auto-attacks, whirlwind, and bloodthirst all used on cooldown, and after swapping gear in and out it's ultimately really straightforward; BiS is far and away the devilsaur set with as much black dragonscale as you can after that, no contest.
---
Ah, that's makes sense.
---
Well it‘s not rly about charging gold, i res certain items and the groups are fine with it. If you get the drop you make quite a fortune 😜 ppl tip me sometimes afterwards as they mostly enjoyed the runs
---
No, because OP didn't actually make this and cross-posted it without changing the title; Accidentally or not claiming credit for the piece.
---
cringe
---
The Classic launch is not going to be anything like the Vanilla launch. Saying it didn't happen then does not mean that it won't in the current situation.
---
I was 24 and still on operational duties in Iraq when WoW launched.  I was 25 when I finally got to play it and working 12 hour day/night shift rotations.  I still managed to make time to get into progression raiding right up until AQ40 but had to scale it back for my career shortly before Naxx40 opened.
---
Time management is the key.  Sometimes you just can't spend more than two or three hours in the game.  Even now at 40 I can still make time for a couple of hours of gaming between when the kids go to bed and I go to bed.
---
It's kinda disappointing at the moment.  I'm playing a pserver right now because I want to play vanilla WoW but the community is horrible.  Assholes everywhere.  I'm going to give classic a shot but if they change too much I guess I'll just give up.
---
Troll has a bit of use in PvP too. Berserking apparently snapshots and if you're running 30/0/21 you can berserk, heal (NS if needed), then get that sweet 30% cast speed.
---
I'm so torn right now.. I want to upvote for amazing talent and beautiful art but I want to downvote because... Alliance sucks! FOR THE HORDE!

This is ironic

1. You never get to use corruption in raids

2. Elites/Bosses rarely resist curses
---
3. Improved life tap is trivial for PvE at 60
---
Come on you can be honest and just say "I follow the trend without thinking", most people do. By the way private server experience doesn't count.

it's not cheating to use the provided wow api, that's what it's there for
---
Cool

Then let them quit
---
Wrong ever heard of EverQuest?
---
that's super disappointing
---
Fun fact. Originally it was a much much larger sea with large islands. It was the original location of kul tiras and some troll tribes(amani i think). 
---
It wasnt until classic did they just totally forgrt about the giant sea between lorderon/stormgarde/southshore and the kingdom of azeroth(stormwind lands)
---
1. Yes you do.
---
2. Yes they do.
---
3. No it isn't.
---
Change the filter to last 3 months and look at the graph. Not being funny, but classic is the only reason he's getting these views atm and it's pretty obvious when you see that.
---
I'm 34 with a girlfriend and I'll have plenty of time. 8 hours a day during the week for work and the rest of the time is mostly free. Probably will use a vacation week for the release. I could never have a job that doesn't allow for my free time.
---
Can someone explain how to earn this bad boi? Also how many hours the grind takes.
---
Who are unsure why they are still there guarding the ice wall
---
Im a horde player but I Cringe everytime I see this garbage
---
I picked a career that doesn't work crazy hours. 8-12 hours a day for wow easy.
---
My statement still stands. They never said it was gonna last for all of phase 1, just that it would for sure be gone by phase 2. Ion would still prefer to have it gone in just a few weeks if possible.
---
It's not impractical. You Classic fanboys are too afraid of change and riduclue anyone who dare smakes an innovative suggestion..  There's nothing with my idea, I stand by it (proudly).. Except OK maybe since we already have pets, lets make pets better..
---
It certainly didn’t, at least not in the way you are thinking of private servers. They confirmed that the starting areas had dynamic respawns to an extent, not enough to support 10000 people on the same server though.
---
The movie was teenie bopper dog shit. If you think the Warcraft movie was good you’re probably the same type of guy that thinks a Wendy’s cheeseburger is good. May the Earthmother help you, friend.
---
I am in a similar boat, was in high school when vanilla wow was out and played as much S possible. Now I’m married and just had a baby 5 months ago so I don’t know how much time I will have but here’s my plan. I am going to take the first Friday after release is out and play as hard as I can all day and then after that just take it slow and breathe in the game and enjoy every minute I get to play after that. Maybe in some weird way it will be more enjoyable because we will appreciate our time playing more than being a no lifer but I may just be trying to convince myself of that lol
---
Remember the battle of the bastards where John is about to get run down by cavalry - and his own Calvary back him up.
---
This is WoWs version.
---
The thing about snares is that any class that uses them can easily reapply them. It's really not that useful
---
Definitely agree with OP on this, let people live their own way. OP is obviously somewhat successful and has made good life choices to get where he/she is at.
---
Were you involved in a server “merge” in vanilla? Were you on the receiving end of free transfers or migrations? Were you on the transferring end?
---
Are you aware these transfers and migrations didn’t work in vanilla?
---
You know blizzard doesn’t merge realms they connect them, so then you have to add 
---
-servername when trying to talk to half your server.
---
What are you even arguing about? 3 Month ago he was a very successful professional streamer and content creator with hundreds of thousands of followers and thousands of subscribers. Today he is EXTREMELY successful stream thanks to Classic.
---
Some people are still self conscious about people clearly content faster than them in a 24 year old game, oof.
---
This region was originally northron or something like that. The OG home of the wildhammer dwarves and their gyphons. 
---
Thr dwarves actually didnt like the ironforge and dark iron dwarves nor the humans and gnomes. They were only buddies with the elves. And didnt join the war against the horde until they did.
---
Well, it will be different this time around anyways... we will have 1.12 talents and items regardless of what content is out.
---
With that said arms will be amazing from the get go - the two handed sword from Rag (Bonereaver's Edge) is amazing.
---
It happened then. Free character migrations and transfers happened before BWL. That means dead servers were a thing 8 months into vanilla’s life with a steady population rise.
---
People need to realize this isn’t a made up issue. Blizzard has the data and they know what they want to avoid.
---
EQ2 didn't have a problem with layering ruining the economy.  I'm  not sure why you think WoW is special in that regard.
---
Hey man don’t use I if you’re cross posting someone _else’s_ post lmao
---
Stoneform is good against any class that uses DoT's, like a warlock, priest, shaman, hunter, warrior, rogue, mage. 
---
Escape artist is only good for snares and any class that uses snares can easily reapply them anyway.
---
&gt;Classic is different. Your gear is your gear. There is no PvE and PvP gear. Epics are truly epic. This partly what made Classic unique relative to the expansions.
---
There were both PvP and PvE sets. I'm not even sure what you're saying here. Not only were there the various sets that dropped during raids or were purchasable with rank from the faction honor vendors, high-end PvE gear at the time was so far beyond what was attainable from PvP that there was no way two groups of equal skill and tactics would have a competitive match if one was in BWL gear or better and the other is in their PvP rank gear; even if the team in PvP gear is all rank 14 and wearing their High Warlord / Grand Marshal shit.
---
I can remember being in my PvP group during vanilla and playing against the top raid group on our server in Warsong Gulch. Their gear was so much better than ours, and I was in rank 11 PvP gear at the time healbotting for multiple High Warlords. While they never PvP'd and a few were clearly clickers, the match lasted longer than an hour because of the gear disparity.
---
*Fuck you, Archon.*
---
Anyway, on-topic there simply wasn't transmog in vanilla, OP. Just like people had to find their own dungeon groups without the aid of a group finder. Shit was just like that.
---
If Blizzard truly aim to deliver an authentic 2005/2006 experience, you're going to have to craft/loot/buy your RP gear like everyone else was doing at the time.
---
There should be a wall of shame for this haha
---
That WoWWiki article is definitely wrong. Attack power is divided by 14 in vanilla and TBC. That must be some later expansion information.
---
Using the formula found at Wowpedia (which is in general a more credible source, I've found), the number for the Whirlwind Axe will be `128 + (3.3 * 499 / 14) = 246`. Add 85 damage for Mortal Strike and you get the 330 number I cited (ok, I said 320 but I'll chalk that up to a typo).
---
However, I think you got the block value wrong. For every 20 points of strength you should gain 1 extra block value. So in this case the shield block value would be about 30, assuming a shield with 21 Block (what an ilvl 41 blue shield would have if any existed in the game -- the closest actual existing shield would be ilvl 42 with 22 Block). So Shield Slam would be dealing `230 + 21 + 9 = 260` damage.
---
His version also ruins server community, economy, and immersion on merge point. So what’s really the issue with layering?
---
From the description I doubt he’d have gotten more than 1k total 🤣
---
Hahaha yeah? Wat'cha talking about dude, that's exactly the type of behavior that Warden picks up on and flags. You probably won't get banned the first time, as long as you and the gold seller aren't stupid enough to communicate over a Blizzard platform. But if you keep interacting with accounts that are already flagged for suspicious behavior, even a dimwit could connect the dots.
---
They gave them in vanilla so it would only be fitting.
---
I was on the fence about factions, you just cemented it, I'm  going Alliance. Thank you 👩‍🎤
---
It only takes a few days for your body to adapt to sleeping 5 hours a night but it can be done, I've done it for ten years.
---
I think this would be a good 40-45 quest area but I would omit any dungeons. It ties southern STV into the Swamp of Sorrows which would allow for a natural progression away from STV to relieve that bottle neck and improve the mid level experience.
---
It also allows for an alternate leveling rout for Horde if they wanted to start in the sos and finish at the northern area of the savage coast.
---
This zone would definitely be a hotbed of contention, I would love to see it being the home base of the Bloodsail faction, opening up an alternate town, ship rout, and rep vendor for folks who are at least friendly.
---
EQ2 had a problem with being a good dame to begin with
---
That's exactly it, yeah.  Like, think of how many individual stories take part in Tanaris in vanilla.  There are overarching plots, sure, like stuff leading to Zul'farrak or the pirates, but there's also loads of oddball stuff like the wagon train and the turtles reunited quest.  Each zone feels like a country with real people and events playing out, rather than some throwaway storytelling tool.  Like, vanilla WoW was a DnD campaign done right, where the player has the freedom to take whatever story paths they choose.  Retail WoW is the DM being super controlling and only wanting the players to explore their one storyline.
---
Bessie... Thank the gods for Bessie....and her tits.
---
Kinda fucked up you’re not correcting people thinking this is your artwork. You couldn’t change the real artist’s original title?
---
&gt; Are you aware these transfers and migrations didn’t work in vanilla?
---
That's not what a server merge is, try again.
---
&gt; You know blizzard doesn’t merge realms they connect them
---
This is why they didn't solve the dead server issue. They need to take a full measure not a half measure.
---
I won't be playing a nelf this time 'round, but if I were I'd totally do the Wetlands run legit anyway. It's a rite of passage.
---
Do you know when they changed pets?
---
I would sacrifice all of my loved ones, family and all that I've come to know in this life to be digitized and live in Ironforge. Come on, Elon.
---
They won’t take that measure. They won’t force their paying customers to change names or guild names. That’s bad business. So why don’t you try again with something that you very well know blizzard won’t do.
---
But it was there, yes pservers upped how much it happens but that doesn't change the fact that vanilla had dynamic respawns. So you shitting on the guy for saying that is just illustrating how even you don't understand how it works either.
---
It was so shitty they only released like 10 expansions...
---
Yes. it takes all of the hours
---
&gt; They won’t force their paying customers to change names or guild names.
---
They do this all the time with the rampant right click reporting, they don't care about that and it's also a minuscule issue compared to layering/sharding.
---
Now why don't you lose the attitude and we can all have an actual discussion instead of waiting for you to reply with something snarky and no solution.
---
ya i have money so im just gonna no life it up while i sip on my coffee and the world/economy screech at each other off in the distance
---
I've just resigned myself to the fact that I *won't* find any work/life balance.  It's going to be an absolute shitshow, and there's nothing I can do to prevent that from happening.  All I can do is try to get as much living in as possible before August 27th.
---
(you're right tho)
---
Its actually the reverse for msgic users. Better looks leads to more power.
---
[Yes I do](https://imgur.com/a/bmZpik7)
---
I don't remember which patch this was for.
---
I'm literally just going to go at my own pace. I won't have time to sink 4-8hour game sessions everyday but once every now and again maybe nice. It was a fun game and really I'd like to strecth my play time out a bit this time
---
I'm not arguing; I said I was curious where the numbers came from, never said he was washed up. I said he wasn't a good player and that for me he (in terms of streaming) is "dead".
---
Just because they can pump out lots of shitty expansions doesn't mean the game isn't shit.
---
Because I tank.
---
These honestly might be my favorite posts ever &lt;3
---
&gt;I’ll stop and smell the roses when I create an alt and have more time.
---
Yep, exactly.
---
Plus once you get to 60 raiding will not take that much.
---
They got a foot of muscle to protwct themselves.
---
For horde PvP orc and UD are strong, as a rogue id say the WotF has the slight edge but I could be wrong with the stun resist and offensive CD racial orc has.
---
Alliance is definitely dwarf. Gnomes look cool but the intellect doesn't help not does the spirit (other than during leveling) for humans.
---
Flex
---
Very different. Before 1.2.5 warriors were second to... paladins. No joke. Paladin could tank better, dps better, and of course heal better. Then one fix to one ability and warriors were back to being “the” tanking class.
---
I imagine warriors won’t be too shabby pre BWL this time around. Talent changes already in as well as various fixes as well as some nerfs too.
---
Lots of things that made warriors hard and traumatizing in early vanilla to level were in fact just bugs. I.e. rage used to drain from execute always, no matter what all rage gone. Was a bug that was eventually fixed.
---
I support this post, need answers!
---
Its a challenge because of their posse streamers always have protecting them
---
I’m going off memory alone which is not reliable but I think pets got reworked heavily in TBC and that’s when they evened them all out except for like the three main classes (tank, dps, 3rd variant). I mained as a shaman all my days so my hunter spec understanding wasn’t superb. I mainly used Humar and Takk in 20-29 PvP
---
Two things:    
---
 - There's no point testing on pServers, different database.    
---
 - Per both WoWHead/Classic DB it increases the radius on totems by 9: "Apply Aura: Modifies Radius (6), Value: 9"
---
Humans have higher stealth detection racial though, could potentially void your point. Maybe humans counter NE and dwarf counters human and NE counters dwarf in duels?
---
30 minutes here, an hour there. 
---
Force myself to not want to min-max. Enjoy the game for being the game again. Realize that I may have to schedule with my family when I find a group to do raids again. Realize I won't be getting the epic pvp gear due to no time (not that I did the first time, but it won't even be a "maybe I'll start that grind soon" thing like it could have been).
---
Etc...I was a senior in high school when wow dropped. Senioritis allowed me to dedicate all my spare time to leveling my first toon. I played hard pretty much most of the life of vanilla. I won't be able to this time, and that's perfectly fine.
---
I mean, that's why a bid system is a bad idea to begin with. Static costs and then everyone just internally works out who gets what first.
---
Which why I see some positives from layering...
---
That's still an option, yes. But nowadays it's just a LDB Display Panel.
---
You haven’t offered a valid solution either. Difference is I am ok with layering. Cause I understand it’s purpose and it’s flaws. It won’t end the world or ruin the game. No other solution being offered (other than modifications to layering) are anymore valid. 
---
Everything else will also ruin server communities, economies and immersion. Especially merges.
---
Also right click reporting forcing a name change is vastly different than just forcing hundreds to thousands of customers to change names/guild names. You can say they don’t care but since in their 15 year history they have actively avoided server merges it goes to show they do care.
---
None of the layer videos convince me that it will be more than the occasional "Huh that was weird" moment. Supply and demand will balance the economy well enough. Sure, if there are multiple layers then yes more nodes will be gathered but multiple layers also implies a larger player base consuming those materials. 
---
Finally, I'm an old man and I chose to not be bothered by layering. I just want to return to Azeroth, level up new characters and have a good time with friends. I'm ready.
---
Just how do you keep producing these this fast at this level of quality?
---
no kids no wife no life
---
vacation from work to hit 60 then I'll have plenty of time for fun raids with my bros
---
Engineering and mining if you're a normal human.
---
Engineering and blacksmithing (with a material-farming alt) if you're a true no-lifer.
---
I already bookmarken a 10 Hours loop of live to win
---
I wanna be apart of a guild that specifically targets streamers.
---
During the original ancestors holiday where you had to find all those ghosts and collect tokens or whatever.  I managed to solo sneak into IronForge with my warlock.  It was an impressive city.
---
I do too. I was involved in one of the first migrations/transfers and know first hand what happens and how long it takes for the community to recover. Blizzard is IMO right for feeling like that’s not a valid option.
---
Warcraft 2 bby
---
I literally just told you how it works confirmed from a blizzard dev, and it does not line up with Pservers in the slightest.
---
Layering is within a single server only and distributes players among the layers to reduce population density. Once you are inside a layer, you're stuck in it till you join a group that's in a different layer (which is exploitable). Layering is only temporary and once player populations stabilize will be permanently disabled.
---
Like they've done 15 years ago.
---
Trust me brother you’re preaching to the choir. The vast majority of redditors are too short sited and confused to understand the long term effects of layering. They still think they’ll be questing in a 49 man shard
---
Ah, okay! Thanks for the info.
---
Yes, although as others have said you'll likely hit level 2 by discovering stuff. You'll also probably die a time or two, but NE players do the wetlands run all the time so there is nothing really preventing you from doing a Barrens run, except your own willingness to ghost walk a couple times.
---
Just go rogue.  You can spend most of your time in IF as horde rogue.
---
So what are you arguing? That the starting areas are gonna be shit regardless and they should make it more shit by removing layering?
---
Yes, I used to use it to test specs for classes I had not leveled.
---
Yes, that’s the actual spelling.
---
Okay so enhance pve bis list is as follows: nightfall. 
---
And that concludes the enhance shaman pve bis list.
---
What even is this
---
Luckily in Vanilla you aren't STUCK in the city.
---
But I do agree SW and IF are just really good looking cities.  Org and TB don't even feel like cities.  Undercity is pretty legit though.
---
You might be right.  The information is all over the place it seems with people saying 50-60.
---
Taurens are actually such bros that they have Mage/Priest trainers in TB even though they can't roll those classes.  Think it's only Rogues who are out of luck in Mulgore.
---
&gt;  No other solution being offered
---
Yeah, cause no one mentioned server merges... You don't think it's valid but you also advocate for a solution that guts server communities more than merges ever could.
---
&gt; Everything else will also ruin server communities, economies and immersion. Especially merges.
---
Explain because you are literally saying to cut server communities up, allow layer hopping to exploit the economy and somehow saying people/mobs/resources etc flash in and out of existence so immersion is absolutely fucked with layering.
---
&gt; Also right click reporting forcing a name change is vastly different than just forcing hundreds to thousands of customers to change names/guild names
---
It's really no considering you just make all those servers marked for future merges have the same name databases so they can't have repeat names in the first place. Right click reporting is much more open to abuse and we have retail wow to illustrate that for us.
---
They avoid server merges for the same reason they don't report sub numbers. They're afraid of people claiming doom and gloom when the server list is halved even to the detriment of the games health.
---
Compensating ;)
---
Sounds good!
---
There's a hole for griffons to fly in.. probably some other vents.
---
8/10
---
i mean 1 minute isn't really enough to capture a giant wpvp battle. you can just press "continue watching" if you're on desktop and you'll go to the vod. dunno about mobile
---
I could deal with layering if it turned off the second you hit level 10 and step into Org for the second or third time. This happening post lvl 20 is unacceptable.
---
That's not how being employed works.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; However if you're spiking so often that the 5% health makes a different then there are probably more pressing concerns you should handle.
---
Everyone always says this but it's like, you can make that argument about any of the racials.
---
Like, "if you need 2x fear break so often that you..."no, you don't need 2x fear break and if you did you have tremor totem.
---
"If you need berserking so bad to keep ahead on threat, you have other problems."
---
"If you need +5 axe skill to keep ahead on threat, there are other problems..." Like, if your guild is so good that you need to worry THAT much about threat, you're probably holding a thunderfury *anyway*
---
The thing is the orc racial is SO much better for pvp than any other choice that it feels stupid to pick something else. they're kid of the worst for tanking but who cares...
---
Three. Months.
---
Three months of straight farming this thing back in classic. I had no life.
---
I farmed this bad boy so hard that when Thanksgiving rolled around I had been up for like 2 straight days.
---
I told my husband I was going to the store to get "mats" to make Thanksgiving dinner. I do not remember Thanksgiving that year.
---
The only thing pservers did was up how much it happens. It was still in vanilla. In vanilla servers also only held about 3k people so in volute it was pretty similar when considering pservers have around 15k at times.
---
I want to try to raid as an elemental shaman, but i fear people won't accept me in the raid.  I suffered a great deal of bigotry when TBC launched, and I transitioned from healer to dps.

I’m not arguing anything you’re the one that’s putting words in my mouth.
---
You are wrong Big-Pond. Played vanilla for a year and some.
---
Similar thing happened when OSRS launched. There WERE some people playing the game at insane xp rates in 2007. But what the top 1% were doing then is what everybody began doing at launch. The game's one of the most min/maxed games I've played and I love it.
---
Yeah other than having him at low levels it does take a lot of the fun out of taming him
---
This is awesome! so crazy, can't wait until cords get added
---
Unfortunately this is far from the truth.  There's thousands of people that enjoy these streamers.  That's how they make a living mate.
---
It is, I'm seriously considering framing this one. Original artist is Conpatshe though, y'all should check out more of his work: https://www.artstation.com/conpatshe
---
After someone has completed all of the PvE content, PvP will be their main source of enjoyment. It was like that in Vanilla, and it will be like that in Classic. The reason is that PvP is always a unique experience. Even if you played the same BG or Arena comp a thousand times, the match will always go differently. Unlike a raid, where the boss has a set of preprogrammed actions, opposing players make their own choices. That’s what keeps it fresh.
---
AV was the primary source of PvP in Vanilla, and it will be the primary source of PvP in Classic. However, if the players are given a boring, zergfest AV, like they have in retail, they won’t be interested in playing it. Just like how nobody was interested in playing the 40m BGs in retail for years. And if people aren’t interested in playing the main source of PvP, once all the raids are complete, the players will just up and leave Classic.
---
I really want to enjoy Classic. Please do not kill it before the game even comes out. Giving us 1.12 AV essentially guarantees that Classic will fail, in the long run.
---
Please give us 1.5 AV. The original Alterac Valley.
---

Breaking News: Streamer does something millions of others have done.
---
It was well written and had interesting lore. What exactly is cringe here?
---
I was going to write that "You'll achieve less in classic", but that you'd enjoy it more.
---
That's not entirely true. For a given amount of time, you'll have less levels, less gold, less months and less shinies. But the satisfaction you'll get from those you do have will be far greater than it would be on live.
---
Also, classic doesn't change as much from path to patch, so your progress will always be absolute. You can gear up over a year and a half and crush entry dungeons and world content. Compare to live where the baseline moves from patch to patch leaving casual players with no meaningful sense of power gain.

I’d love to see some additions made after a while of Classic.
---
There are a few coastlines that could easily be designed to hold some exciting quests for max level.
---
No new features - just new areas to explore with some purely story driven quest chain for max level only.

You get all my upvotes.
---
I just logged back in, I'm not always online on Reddit. The artist name is in the title, and the title clearly states it's a cross post from r/wow pointing to the actual source. No one posted it here 8 hours later, so I cross posted it here, so more people could see it.
---
I played oldschool runescape at the first hour of its launch. Thousands of people all doing the same quest at the same time. You could barely see your own character or the aggressive mobs sometimes but you're right, it was a very unique experience that i would love to have again. I actually won't be mad if it takes me an entire day of playing to only get to level 10, all the scenario's that come out of such a high pop will be funny
---
Point proven.
---
Fuck yeah!
---
This is a good point and something I may add as a checkbox or option to show caves.
---
The best suggestion I've seen is to confine layering transitions to rest areas (inn or city).
---
True, but mages and warlocks just simply don't have to rely on that as much to maintain DPS. You can absolutely make it work, but I'm talking relative to the other casters.
---
I'm more of a Horde player myself, but Ironforge layout is way more efficient than Org's. Also the soundtrack is way cooler.
---
Just going to quote Grom Hellscream about Night Elves since you clearly think they're prissy. 
---
"These women fight with unmatched savagery! I've never seen their equal. They are... perfect warriors."
---
How do you read that and think that I’m arguing something? I didn’t know reading was so hard.
---
I'm just going to make a separate thread for this instead tbh
---
They have avoided merges for years longer than they have not reported sub numbers. 
---
Now explain how layering guts communities more than merges? Cause from where I am sitting that’s not close to true.
---
With layering you can leave the community building intact by having server wide and not layer wide chats. You will then be able to build your community by constantly communicating with them. How are you building a community with server b while on server a that will eventually merge with server b? Oh right you aren’t. So any community built is then destroyed and has to be rebuilt upon merging.
---
With layering you don’t have that. Since you have constantly been building the community the whole time layering was in. Now once layering is gone you don’t have any “new” faces since you have been chatting/playing with the same people for months.
---
Immersion is gonna get fucked either way. No matter what people choose it gets fucked. Layering with server wide chats/ah is the only way to keep the community and economy intact to that server.
---
Why do it in Zones at all.  Make it just for sub lvl 20 characters in those zones.
---
It's fine if a lvl 18 doesn't see an alliance raid on Orgrimmar.  It's not fine if a 60 can't see it.
---
Layering shouldn't exist or be accessible to anyone above lvl 20.
---
Feral shoulder are wrong too.  If they are adding the slaghide gloves which are a super rare dropping from an impossible boss to get a group for, then they have no excuse not having the Atal'ai shoulders that can be solo farmed in ST.  The Atal'ai shoulders have crazy high armor and only need to be one the suffixes with stamina.
---
I don't think you can do that with the addon API. Maybe in the vanilla client, but not the new API.
---
you're confusing challenge and tedium. overcoming a challenge is fun, waiting for a mob to respawn is not
---
No not casters for stat minmaxing, but warriors have been constantly swapping between fishing rod, Ravager and WWA in combat on beta, so I was just letting OP know there's no reason that staff swapping won't work in classic.
---
Been using this and it is very complete.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview#
---
The huge issue is resources being exploited farmed.  The gurubashi arena was being looted by a single player in multiple layers as he got access to additional arena chests.
---
It needs to end at lvl 20 not at the end of an entire phase.  People will have broken the economy and other exploitable layering like the arena.
---
Nah, the problem is that server mergers are incredibly bad press.  It doesn't matter why you're doing them, or if you planned them all along.  It always makes for sensationalist headlines like "BLIZZARD TO SHUTTER HALF OF ALL CLASSIC SERVERS! WAS CLASSIC A MISTAKE?"
---
Blizzard has no problem pissing off players.
---
Opposite problem here. All my friends want to go Alliance. We all played alliance in Vanilla, but most quit in BC so I went horde. Now they’re all back for classic forcing me to roll a blue boy :(
---
Pig stick!
---
check this one out ;)
---
here you go ;)
---
I can barely afford the sub man :( I'll get up there one day
---
what you think about this one?
---
So you're saying the worst case scenario of the less people on servers is the best case scenario we have now...
---
Yeah, I know about the other ones, but the site is more graphically pleasing and I was wondering why they wouldn't include that.
---
Stoneform removes blind. All of your kiting poisons get removed and nullified for the duration of stoneform. Why are you commenting as if you are an authority of knowledge when you clearly don't understand the basic interactions between core PvP abilities.
---
Technically yes, but Mulgore has no Rogue trainers so practically you can't.
---
If you don't want to hang around in Durotar you can easily get to Tirisfal Glades though, with the free Zeppelin from Orgrimmar.
---
Exactly.  Easier to be mad and clam up than propose actual solutions.
---
Smaller servers no layering, if servers lose players you merge them into one which has the exact same effect as the phase 2 removing of layers except it doesn't ruin the game for phase 1.
---
I think Warlock is the strongest pvp class and highly doubt there will be very few warlocks. Also its good against priests
---
It's "hopefully" for a few weeks. The only thing definitive is that it ends at the end of phase 1 because it would result in multiple kazzak/azuregos spawns.
---
Layering will last as long as it is needed within those constraints.  That's the point of layering. To handle the tourist load as long as the tourist load is there.
---
Damage enchants didn't work in vanilla so if it works on beta it is a bug and will be fixed.  +15 agility is the only enchant for the warden staff or a counter weight for a mace if the enchant isn't available in phase 1.
---
And your brought nothing to this at all. thanks for reminding us you're just a raging fool.
---
wat?
---
The mafia boss
---
Technically yes, but watch out for availability of class trainers - there isn't a single Rogue trainer in the entirety of Mulgore fore example, and to get a Mage/Priest you have to go all the way up to Thunder Bluff for Mage/Priest.
---
Depending on what class you want to be, it might be best to go to the Tirisfal Glades instead, which is even easier.
---
Bad bot. Even though it is more comprehensible than last time.
---
Honestly, filling out the Azeroth vanilla map would offer so much more content than TBC... all without the baggage and powercreep of making the 60 content obsolete.
---
Asmon might not be the best to watch for PVP.
---
I tuned in for his first Arathi Basin.  He started fine, made some good calls, then ended up in a 1v1 against a rogue.  And immediately upon losing the fight got exasperated and said "unbalanced, what could I even do there!?"
---
I definitely watch his youtube content, he does have interesting opinions even when I disagree with him at least he makes me think of different points of view... But that little taste of pvp (he didn't play the fight well at all) definitely wouldn't be worth watching lol.
---
Thank you mate :)
---
No i have been to old IF with my druid but i was summoned there, so i guess a lock can get there too.
---
Should it now be called Old Old Ironforge?
---
I'm gonna farm it - again..
---
Depends a bit. If all level appropriate zones are farmed on respawn by heavy populations then dungeon farming is faster.
---
Greatest city, bah!  Greatest painting of it? Probably!
---
[Oh no](https://i.imgflip.com/1u91fb.jpg)
---
That’s why I always level as long as I can in tanaris. And of course I ride my camel the entire time
---
Rather than new content, I'd prefer if Classic+ started by rebalancing the classes to a TBC level.
---
Quest items spawn fast on  Beta, but I'm not sure I will spent time doing that quest since I still have to be lucky and be the one that get the item.  
---
And this quest has no followup anyway.
---
Exactly. I can't envision a world where if if they make a blacklist that my guild would stop me from going to raids, for playing the game. If streamers are worried about camping they can go on pve servers. And if they want to play on pvp servers because it's part of what made vanilla so great they can suck up the ganks.
---
No I mean, he was addressing the point of the guy he replied to.
---
Trust me, the less you know about WoW lore the better.
---
He is pretty clueless if you compare his vanilla content to others like madseason who clearly were there in vanilla.
---
I'm not saying he's a liar, I'm just saying his memory of vanilla isn't accurate.
---
her model in WOLTK was alot better than her legion model
---
Hand of rag proc has a small spell power coefficient, not sure if this will be on classic tho.
---
It doesn't.
---
which weapon is it?
---
I mean, I'm all for corpse camping, but say the streamer is a rogue, and you stream snipe to find where he's gone stealth. That's kind of cheating. You can say the delay thing all you want, but that sucks for the majority of streamers that like interacting with chat. End of day I line up with corpse camping is fine, but stream sniping is scummy.
---
As amazing as this picture is, it just looks like the city's on fire.
---
I haven't watched MadSeason's stream but his youtube videos are A+ if anyone wants great vanilla nostalgia or in depth explanations of the game back in 2004.
---
He's even doing this look into the pre release patches.  I played closed beta but damn I don't remember any of that stuff cause I had no idea what I was doing.  So him reminding me of that weird shit we had before the release version of the game was hilarious... memories I had lost!
---
Regardless of your professions at 60, leveling up you really should be herb and alch as a warrior. You'll grab enough herbs to turn right into pots that give nice, long buffs that make such a difference for a warrior.
---
It's a tedious grind for a tiger mount. Generally in vanilla, the only mounts you rode were of your faction because the grind to exalted of other factions was a bitch. And you can only buy your own until exalted... I.e human's rode horse's. Part of the vanilla experiance was getting a sick mount bairly anyone else had
---
Aimed shot doesnt "aim" at a target like it used to in classic. Before, if you began an aimshot while facing slightly off from target, it would face you directly at the target and "aim" at it, even if the target began moving. Cosmetic only, but its huge for me and others.
---
Pros. Easy leveling. Having a tank, dps, and healer all in 1 class. Hunters have good armor and lots of ways to disengage from combat. Warlocks have lots of health and ways to replenish it.
---
Cons. Hunter has to stockpile ammo and pet foods. Need to be good at kiting and pathing. Warlocks need soul shards. Lots. And lots. And lots. Of soul shards. Both have a very high skill cieling.
---
I worked the same life in finance for five years post college. The first two in particular sucked very bad but I'm in a great spot now 7 years out of college... and I will have plenty of time to play wow, which I haven't played since '06 =)
---
You cannot kill a druid because you cannot heal. They will be able to outheal your damage till their auto attacks kill you.
---
The fact you actually think Horde players will stop and help is hilarious.  They'll ignore and run off like they always do
---
Fighting for skins is what made it fun lol
---
Cow people.  Aka STEAK!
---
Mod helps when fighting any class
---
Not really. We have retail if new content should be added it should be there
---
I feel like I have seen this before but what book is this from?
---
What server?
---
Isn't Cdew still -20g to Payo?
---
The ratio reminds you of how Horde is the faction for butthurt players.  They use the loyalty and underdog BS, but roll it for racials.  Lore may say one thing, but the Horde playerbase says something completely different.
---
Bro you are epic cringe you literally used “comic book heroes” as some sort of qualifier for being badass.
---
&gt; They have avoided merges for years longer than they have not reported sub numbers. 
---
And? 1 has to come before the other but it's still the same reasoning as to why.
---
&gt; Now explain how layering guts communities more than merges?
---
Merges put you on a server where there are over 15k people, unlike merges where servers would be capped around 3-5k. Not to mention they would be porting in and out at random points. That makes the scenario we have in current retail where players are just in your way and you're much more likely to never see them again as they will be phased to another layer more often than not. If you think layering doesn't gut communities then you really are intentionally ignorant of the issues it causes or are just loud for something of which you have no actual understanding of.
---
With mergers there would be 1 day where suddenly your server goes from dead to thriving again. People coming over doesn't hurt server communities, not knowing the people from the start does like what happens with layering.
---
&gt; Oh right you aren’t. So any community built is then destroyed and has to be rebuilt upon merging.
---
This just isn't true. Those same communities on server b are still there when merged over to server a. It's not like everyone suddenly gets amnesia and doesn't remember who anyone is.
---
&gt; Immersion is gonna get fucked either way
---
Better to fuck immersion for all of phase 1 than to just have 1 day of immersion broken when servers are merged. Which you don't even know if that would happen since as you said Blizzard has never merged servers, you simply don't know and to act like you know is misleading and deceptive. 
---
Layering hurts the economy by making more rare nodes and spawns for people to farm as well as aoe farming by switching between shards to game world first titles.
---
If you advocate for layering you really don't understand how communities and the economy works and are willing to throw it away so you can kill boars easier.
---
Ty for the reply
---
You're not going to use EA on frostbolt/hamstring/crip poison usually no. Using it on frost nova/roots/concussive shot is huge though, it completely changes those matchups.
---
You can also get there by going to the door in magni’s chambers and having a mage polymorph you such that you clip through the door.
---
Mhmm so classic will be a second client. How do you build your UI in front of rls without beta? Can you copy private realm interface on Retail client?
---
&gt;After someone has completed all of the PvE content, PvP will be their main source of enjoyment.
---
Incorrect.
---
It was never really that, but we did kind of bully our taurean warrior about how bad he was. He hit 70 last in our group and we would lure mobs to him and watch him die in outland for fun.
---
https://www.artstation.com/artwork/A9a9Vm
---
But you could still swim far off the coast of STV and your sub-zone would change to either of the island names.
---
I don't believe they have an older version of AV.
---
&gt;Save
---
lol savage
---
&gt; blink through
---
Ahh, blinking through shit...100% vanilla.
---
Paragraphs..
---
There will be a better one soon with her head on a pike. 😉
---
There is only so much people can do PvE wise since you're doing the same thing over and over again against NPCs that are programmed to do the same thing over and over again -- Unlike PvP where every scenario and every fight has hundreds and thousands of different outcomes every single time.
---
Dude paint malfuion
---
frost nova is the only one that can be of a benefit but its also on a 20second cd. Roots and concussive shot are both easily reapplied. Either way you're not setting yourself up for that much of an advantage. It has more benefits the perception but stoneform is still much more valuable than escape artist, especially on a rogue where you can pop stoneform and then vanish to reset the fight.
---
I'm sure there are a lot fo workarounds that can be done to overcome the fact that they don't have an older version of AV backed up (which I can't wrap my head around tbh)
---
Do you do prints of that?
---
If the difference between Classic being an amazing reexperiencing of nostalgic content and a dead-on-arrival game is which version of Alterac Valley is in the game; it should probably just die.
---
That said, I don't care about AV. I barely ever played it in vanilla, it was my least preferred BG.
---
Biggest Con of both: Pets don't scale (improve) with the player's gear at 60. Meaning your pet when wearing fresh 60 greens, and your pet when wearing full T3 epics will be identical.    
---
This has no negative impact on leveling, because they scale nicely up until 60. It is only problematic at the level gap regardless of if you're gearing via PvP or PvE.    
---
There is a small selection of items like "The Black Book" that buff pets, but it is a short duration buff better suited for PvP or PvE trash, rather than raid bosses (since it improves burst, not sustained damage).
---
It's as if a million wallpapers suddenly cried out.
---
I don't think they would care as WCB on Alliance or blessings on Horde are not why that rule exists. It is to prevent Collusion, harrassment and griefing of the casual playerbase.
---
Of course I am speculating. Mind control buffing was not an issue back in the day. And I don't think they would start monitoring this based on a technicality.
---
The reality is we have Discord and PMs these days. And Blizzard knows that.
---
Well using layering / sharding and other similar systems as demonstrated in retail seems very bad business too
---
I still can't go to Booty Bay on my Shaman.
---
Weak
---
I don't care about #no-changes anymore, I want all of your shit in the game.
---
Not to discredit Blizzard for all the work that they've done so far but I and many others truly believe that 1.5 AV is the one and only "true" Alterac Valley and having the 1.2 version added instead is somewhat a joke might as well play that on current version of wow because it's the same thing.
---
I hated AV so I'm good.
---
With the level of work required, rather than attempted to re-create old AV (and likely do a poor job anyway) the time could be used to make an original PvP experience in classic's style.
---
Dude. Amazing.
---
Point proven that you're a circle jerker
---
Very interesting. I loved the Thandol Span ever since the first day I saw it and was disappointed Blizz never did anything with it aside a quest or two.
---
People are going to want to get into PvP one way or another in Classic and that's a fact though, might as well have everything perfected. Better safe than sorry.
---
bPlanning on going a Ret/Holy hybrid Paladin, is the instant crit heal talent in the Holy tree worth picking up? It’s a 2 minute CD which isn’t bad and I know it works well with the illumination talent but wondering how vital it is overall. I plan on doing fairly casual PvE and PvP so don’t know if repentance is better to take overall or not. Don’t want to be respecing for just 1 talent and my understanding is this hybrid works decent for all content just wondering which talent would be better overall.
---
How is that not vanilla?
---
Dude I can’t even play anything anymore. I do a round of OW and just log out. Hop on retail, get half way through something and just log. I stopped playing FFXIV too. 
---
Classic is the only game I’m interested in playing at all now. 
---
I wasn’t even sure I was going to play it when they announced it. Then I started remembering the experience. I’ve been complaining and taking very long breaks from retail (like 6+ months at a time) since Dragonsoul. 
---
Can’t wait for this game.
---
!remindme
---
Then don't play til they remove layering lol
---
I don't think crying on Reddit to your circle jerkers is going to accomplish anything, especially when this thread has been done a million times.
---
And you brought something to this beyond bs?
---
I truly believe that there should be polls or someway to voice to community on this matter &amp; if it's obvious that more people want the 1.5 AV then I strongly believe the level of work required would be beneficial for everyome in the long run.
---
Well he did also try to date a 12 year old when he was 16. The dude would probably be considered autistic by today's standards, but I definitely told everyone about how he called me when he was in county jail at 17 about that shit.
---
You're speaking for yourself rather than the wider casual audience.
---
!RemindMe
---
There wasn't a week that went by in vanilla where Blizzard wasn't offering free transfers off of or onto low pop servers to balance out.
---
No one's going to get over it, it's a game busting implementation that needs to be addressed before launch.
---
This is what Bungie does with Destiny/2. As a means of cutting down on p2p latency, the matchmaker will prioritize other players that are geographically near to you. So in the open world and in queued activities you can often see people with names that reference your state, city, or local sports teams.
---
That doesn't look at all like Orgrimmar.
---
Ah no i gotcha yeah i was pretty close to being homeless like 3 years ago, so i kinda feel where youre coming from. It’ll get better man, and classic will make it better for sure. See you out there brother!
---
Are you ok? What world do you live in where simply "giving a shit about another human" is noble? It is normal and you don't need God Complex to participate. 
---
Nobody is taking your gu.... I mean games or oppressing you. 
---
I am confused.

---
:handonchinemoji:
---
Ah ok. Hopefully Blizzard will clear this up. Feral is the most interesting DPS spec in PVE and learning more about how it will work in a real version of the game is awesome.
---
Anyone who has been raiding since the beginning should remember the original functionality of decursive. To me, those are the types of addons that blizzard needs to break. Automation like that is practically botting.
---
I'm speaking for myself and for many others that have high interest in having the true AV experience put into Classic rather than a "dumbed down" version that's all about rushing things.
---
Retail is tedious and boring.
---
Well my wife is Taiwanese so I already have a pretty good excuse...
---
I've never been good at languages. Learned French for 6 years and can only say a few sentences. I'm trying though, it's just slow going.
---
# FROST SHOCK
---
Bummer haha
---
Haha that's true. In 2005 I was on 56kbps but it was actually more like 19...
---
Even if it worked in EQ2, it's a completely different game with different mechanics and nuances to it's community and economy. The argument is like thinking an orange and and an apple would have the same type of juice because they are both fruit.
---
So you disagree with the vast majority of players and clearly haven't seen the exploits and problems beyond the two simple ones you listed.
---
All that tells me if you know so little of the game that your opinion isn't worth anything.
---
Is that a pserver? Or did summit also get beta access?
---
I like this map style, is there a full map?
---
haha "Game busting".. I guess we will just see.
---
How dare you misrepresent Thunder Bluff.
---
(In all honesty, fucking fantastic job. Gives me a Dark Souls vibe in a way.  ^^^Just ^^^watch ^^^yourself ^^^making ^^^ false ^^^claims, ^^^ally ^^^ scum
---
What is the difference between 1.5 AV and what makes 1.12 AV bad?
---
That would be impressive as fuck lol
---
I like how you have Naxx in its original position behind Rivendare's Slaughterhouse. Also, I never realized until now how close Ghostlands is to Stratholme.
---
It’s not like retail. Yes they may phase out but you will definitely see them again as you are still on 1 server. No getting around it. Unless of course you quit before phase 2.
---
People coming over does hurt communities. To say otherwise shows your lack of experience here. I have been involved in vanilla transfers/migrations and a connecting realm. People just being pushed together does affect communities. In the first you had the people coming from the high pop realm acting like saviors of the server. In the second you had fractured communities that took time to grow together. Mergers will probably be a combo of both.
---
While the communities of server a and b are still intact they are also now fractured since they have become server c. However you will have a divide because people will still cling to their server, causing some to mistreat others based on that alone. Again I know this to be true from experience both in vanilla and later with a real connection.
---
Wait not knowing people from the start hurts communities? Yet with layering everyone is on the same server from the start. With merges they aren’t. So which is hurting it more?
---
The economy of the server stays intact with layering, however much harm is done by layering is anyone’s guess and can’t be known or proven. However that economy will always be that economy.
---
Whereas with merges you could be merging a server with a weak or low economy with one that has a high or strong economy. Now everyone on server a gets boned as everyone on server b is able to command and set the market. Wouldn’t happen with layering as the economy is always that servers economy.
---
I’m beginning to think you don’t understand these issues nearly as well as you think you do.
---
It's about the journey. Start an alt.
---
No you are speaking only for yourself
---
Please, no. Illidan isn't a bad guy. Just guy who had to make many difficult choices.
---
Um, he replied to me.
---
This is from a 1.5 to 1.1 AV post that I found:
---
1.5:
---
• Winterax Hold
---
• Wildpaw Ridge
---
• Syndicate NPC's
---
• Mine Layers, Landmines
---
• Korrak the Bloodrager
---
• Portable Shredder Unit
---
• Tower/Bunker Guards
---
• Lots of Standing Guards
---
• Lots of Patrols
---
• Long battles
---
1.8:
---
• Winterax Hold removed
---
• Wildpaw Ridge removed
---
• Syndicate NPC's removed
---
• Mine Layers, Landmines removed
---
• Shorter battles
---
1.10:
---
• Korrak the Bloodrager removed
---
• Portable Shredder Unit removed
---
1.11:
---
• Tower/Bunker Guards removed
---
• Most Patrols removed
---
• Most Standing Guards removed
---
• Ridiculous short battle
---
Ah yes, you indeed seem very positive about what Blizzard are saying in their interviews and are not at all imagining the worst possible scenario. Big progress, son! Proud of your newfound positivity!
---
So they literally told you that they don't need a reddit account because you are their mouthpiece.....that's incredible!
---
It would be awesome to see a new cinematic. Either a remastered version of the orginal or completely new one. Blizzard has always had the best cinematic team in the business so it would be amazing.
---
I promise you that I'm not only speaking for myself and to back my claims you can simply search for anything related to alterac valley  and classic wow on any search engine that exists and you'll be bombarded with 1.5 AV posts.
---
Good one
---
That would be a nifty raid. Are there any notable scarlet crusase people from lore who dont appear in wow?
---
Is this mount not available for horde players?
---
Why's earthstrike on there?
---
That's for sure my man but that doesn't mean we should ignore the fact that the original AV is being completely abandoned and left to die in a Classic wow project
---
Ok so the days long AVs that we had back in the day would be gone pretty much?
---
Retail is a different game at this point. With a different design premise as a whole than classic. Hell even different than Vanilla, TBC, Wotlk and Cata. Really the only common goal that retail has with vanilla is to make money.
---
Maybe bad business but at this point it’s just where the game is and there is no going back. Apparently the mob tagging change in legion is liked by quite a few. While I don’t mind it, I don’t think it was a necessary change but from what I’m reading I was in the minority on that.
---
&gt;In preparation for Classic, I felt compelled to paint the greatest city in Warcraft 
---
But you decided it was beyond your abilities to accurately convey the beauty of Orgrimmar, so you painted the inside of that big cauldron city instead?
---
I'd prefer a day night cycle somewhere between 18 to 22 hours. Especially with 22 hours, it's slow enough to be barely noticeable, but it will rotate around day and night. So people that always log in late evenings aren't always seeing the game world in a night state, and vice versa.
---
damn straight, because that's what made classic wow.  A shit bg that was a never ending bore fest.   #BringbackboringAV
---
They've said it's not about server load, so why would it all of a sudden be server load? Are you just trying to make up reasons to be angry? Why would they split up layers on different servers when one server can hold all the people in probably 3 or more layers already? Seems very unnecessary.
---
!Remind me 72 days
---
If I played alliance, we'd have just become Guildies.
---
!RemindMe 72
---
1.1 AV is all about the rush, just like all the aspects of the current version of the game so you could say that 1.5 to 1.1 AV was sort of the start of this current sad state of the game that we have today.
---
Right, needing a source to prove something is highly unnecessary, just take my word for it and if you don't you're just a sheep. The realest 5Head.
---
just get arcanite reaper and you'll be pretty strong.
---
if you get bonereaver's edge or even spinal reaper early you will faceroll. BRE is gonna be retardedly strong for p1.
---
I agree. I think there should be sensible changes where leaving as is would clearly be a "please stab me moment"
---
Top 10 every time, I did fine.
---
Just have to find a guild that doesn't consist of elitist jerks that demand constant min/max
---
Beta
---
What strawman? The entire post was about 15k pop.
---
I would always hear that it would “split the community”. It’s like they were afraid that if Classic dropped, a bunch of us would just never play current WoW anymore. 
---
They’re not wrong though. Unless the next expansion is WotLK levels of amazing, there’s going to be no reason for me to leave classic. Although I think now that old school players have their classic servers, Blizzard is going to take retail in to another dimension of instanced hyper speed run fest version 3000.
---
Sounds like Ultima Online or Star Wars Galaxies housing. Cluttered up the landscape too much in my opinion, but the advantages were pretty cool. Players could make their own towns, complete with vendors.
---
Whatever, my point is he addressed your point. Is that not ok?
---
the fact that people on here think mages even struggle to kill druids points out how little they know about pvp
---
Never realized they used Outland art assets on the original box...
---
First of all you shouldn't compare yourself to streamers or hardcore players. They will be 60 in 6-7 days. They will kill raid bosses in 2-3 weeks. Just dont think about yourself as "looser", because you didn't kill boss or couldnt reach max lvl. Just enjoy your journey. It's ok to stop for a while and catch few fishes or gather few herbs.
---
I wasnt on the side of the conspiracy theorists, but their “all the streamers got into the beta” theory does keep looking more and more convincing.  Summit hasn’t had anything to do with wow in who the hell knows how long...
---
If someone doesn't have time to play AV then they're able to play another BG that's originally designed to be shorter my friend. #BringbackoriginalAV
---
Again my point and the point if the OP was use of the continents for new zones in expacs.  Please do point out where he addressed these points.  I will wait.
---
Its about the journey to get there.
---
I think you shouldn't forget that there is also a lot fun in leveling :)
---
I'll probably spend most of my time leveling some toons :)
---
That's Humar the Pridelord. I used to have him. No special abilities. Cool to look at though.
---
His solution means that layering doesn't happen in game but you will have a merge at the end of some time when the playerbase dwindles which is shame but this worst-case scenario of their being too many tourist will result in Layering, which is better than the best-case scenario of now of just having layering.
---
I'm under the impression that people that make these lists have never really played Vanilla, but either play private servers or browse forums, and rely on current Vanilla databases which are all incomplete and aren't always reliable in finding the correct items. Because if said list maker did play Vanilla, then said list maker would know that every tank that cleared Naxx carried that shield, and the math hasn't changed nor the loot tables, nor were the top guilds that cleared Naxx stupid players that couldn't figure out which shield was best.
---
I like that you made it a jungle zone, works nicely between STV and SoS and brings out just how damaging the demonic influence was around the portal (lorewise that zone used to be part of the great jungle too). The British climate worgen zone they put there in Cata always felt wrong to me.
---
Right and that's why I believe they should let people voice their opinions on this since there is clearly a demand for this, plus I don't see why the huge uproar on this if people really think no one wants 1.5 AV and that I'm only speaking for myself here then why not let Blizzard handle this and actually track real numbers on this topic?
---
&gt; Yes they may phase out but you will definitely see them again as you are still on 1 server
---
How often do you see the same people in retail? It works exactly the same, it splits the community between layers and shards. Denying it doesn't change that fact.
---
&gt; o say otherwise shows your lack of experience here. I have been involved in vanilla transfers/migrations and a connecting realm
---
Once again. not a server merge. High pop -&gt; low pop transfers and it's obvious as shit the communities would be bad in that situation considering the low pop realms had their communities gutted by having no people to play with and make those communities. It also doesn't address the fact that not everyone took advantage of those transfers so it's not even in the same ball park as merging 2 healthy but low populated servers together. Migrations and transfers were a half measure when full server merges was the actual answer. 
---
Any sharded/layered community is gutted before having to even merge servers as evidenced by retail and RP servers having sharding taken out.
---
If people cling to their server that's their prerogative you can't claim to want to build communities and then try and force how they interact with each other. Sometimes people play nice, sometimes they don't. Micro managing community interactions is just laying the pavement for a road where no one interacts with each other because Blizzard doesn't like when they do, like in retail.  
---
&gt; Wait not knowing people from the start hurts communities? Yet with layering everyone is on the same server from the start. With merges they aren’t. So which is hurting it more?
---
You're literally arguing with the logic the original wow devs had by saying servers should be massively huge. You can't form communities by running into random people all the time. With that many people you are just anonymous, unlike with a smaller server cap where people learn who you are and if you're a dick or not. With layered servers there are so many people it doesn't matter if you're a dick because there are so many people most people wouldn't even recall who you are. We can see this on pservers already even with out sharding/layering. It would only be made worse with with layering the servers off. 
---
The economy of the server is fucked with layering by exploiting layer hopping so you can farm more Black Lotus and Devilsaur Leather. Just to paint an example, there are about 8 Black Lotus nodes for the entire world active. If you layer that 3x, 5x, 10x you get that much more Black Lotus which over saturates the economy and drives the prices down or allows a certain group to monopolize the market by exploiting layer jumping.
---
In short layering hurts economies and communities far more than it helps them and to say otherwise is just being ignorant to the same problems we see in retail with this same technology. If you weren't so dead set on being right and actually wanted to listen to the problems it would be evident. There's a reason Blizzard took sharding out of RP servers and that was for community, the very thing you claim would be helped by it. It's literally absurd what you're saying.
---
Get over it. Complaining isn't going to change anything. What about the people who believe 1.12 AV is superior to the original format? Should they be discredited?
---
How do you feel about guild housing or guild halls? Complete with quests that both take the guild out of the hall, and quests they could do inside. Like literally daily or weekly raid quests for any raid in the game, ala Time walking style. Or simpler stuff like gathering X amount of quest thingies within a certain amount of time, and they are spread out all through the game. Like a big Easter egg hunt.
---
Yes, it does.
---
Why do you keep abbreviating world PvP as “AV”?
---
Is it forbidden to say the name of a private server or what
---
I think that’s the AV rep mace...unstoppable force.
---
You can buy game time with Gold in BFA and it will allow you to play Classic.
---
I've seen your name all over this thread and I know I'm not the only one to say it to you. Continue being ignorant though, you're not interested in discussing or fixing the issue nearly as much as you just want to argue about it.
---
The best suggestion came up in his chat, which was to just limit layering to low level zones and main city hubs. 
---
I really hope they don’t let this be a thing or it will be kind of a let down. I don’t think it will take a ton away from classic, but it’s still annoying.
---
But this doesn't look anything like Undercity? 
---
(Amazing work though)
---
That’s a ram to you, my good man
---
This is a discussion so I'm not complaining in a way plus people who believe 1.12 AV is superior to the original can play it and fully experience it on current version of the game on retail. Jokes aside, I do think that ultimately Blizzard won't and will never be able to satisfy everyone but I do believe that they should still let people voice their opinions in a way to allow a change to happen on this matter if needed. We need to see real numbers and not just mumble and talk.
---
I know how you feel, I learned from earlier games/xpacks not hype it up or read to much about it cause then Im tired off it before it even starts.
---
I believe there is a Mage trainer in the Pool of Visions at Thunder Bluff, Priest too. Warlock trainer seems to be missing.
---
Idk I haven’t read the sidebar rules (mobile) and general etiquette I didn’t want to post the name bc it could be seen as advertising, in a time where pservers are more acceptable then maybe it is ok to do so
---
Thanks. I glossed too quickly over your post to notice that. :)
---
How can I discuss an issue when you won't even say what it is? I'm just "supposed to know", otherwise I'm a sheep. Keep that circlejerk going buddy, I'll be enjoying Classic while you're still here whining about a couple of months (at the most) of layering.
---
no, just took a pic of settings and pictures of the ui setup for reference.
---
Yeah, but at least you’ll have a community. There’ll be no server community on a 15k layered server.
---
1.12 is literally the earliest they had data for. What you're asking for is impossible.
---
Whooosh
---
Nothing is impossible my friend it's not like Blizzard had someone else make the game for them.
---
Because armor is important in PVP. Honestly this site would be 100 times better if people who played the classes could vote on what they think BIS is at each phase. I have to agree the elemental shaman page makes 0 sense.
---
It's hard to answer that with a yes or no, because a lot of factors are involved. Depends on the server, on the players, their skills, etc. But generally if I had to answer yes or no, I'd answer yes. Horde have historically been great at world PVP and responding to PVP threats, in my experience.
---
Ain't the same without ooga in name :D
---
Blizzard doesn't make changes based on popular opinions. The staff working on Classic far outclass anyone in the Classic Community in Game Design. That being said, for all we know, they have the 1.12 data and that's it. And the only reason we are getting 'progressive item additions' is that there is a trail of when things were added/removed.
---
No, it won't.
---
Dwarf priest is best priest (fear ward racial spell).
---
They're not catering to the tourists, they're catering to the rest of us by taking steps to ensure that the tourists don't ruin every single server. 
---
Layering isn't there to make sure everyone can log in, it's there to make sure that the servers don't completely die off once all the retail players decide that the game sucks and leave in droves.
---
What worked 14 years ago won't work now because back then the population was constantly growing, this time it'll shrink.
---
Happily single after a rough relationship, classic is going to be a blast. Even with 40+ hours of work a week, I’ll still be able to easily sink 30-40 hours a week into classic.
---
No it isn't. And we're not friends.
---
We need to accept the facts as is here it'll happen one way or another I wouldn't wanna see it happen either but oh well
---
Most of the population is going to be centered in the 10-30 range for the first couple of weeks. I cant speak for alliance zones, but I've done quite a few p server launches. Only horde.
---
People are going to be camping every single mob spawn in Durotar. Tirisifal is going to be a nightmare because of collection quests, gloom/doom weed, low scarlet mob counts. Named mobs will have 4 full groups fighting over a tag with 5 minute respawns. Barrens will be packed at every single quest area, impossible to finish the collection quests. Ashenvale has similar congestion issues and dont even get me started on the Stonetalon gaia seeds. Without layering for the launch, people will drop like flies because they are waiting in a Disneyland line to do anything.
---
Do you not want people to stick around...? I'm confused. They said it was only for the beginning, I'd like to make sure people have a chance to actually play.
---
Alliance has attractive models. Horde doesn't.
---
Because up to and including Wrath the population was constantly growing, this time it'll be the opposite because of the tourists coming from retail and the finite nature of the game.
---
Stunningly beautiful. The colors are greatly chosen
---
I hail Horde, home to the Great Pride, Orgrimmar... Yet i still give consent to this being the greatest and historical city!
---
You're in clear denial my friend, if what I'm saying is so wrong then why not let Blizzard take the matter into their own hands and actually do something about this? Not like I'm the only person asking for a chance to let the original AV go through. Or am I?
---
The MMO crowd at the time thought WoW was a dumbed down easy game for babies. The grinding in EQ was batshit insane .
---
It’s funny that after this many years a game like WoW actually has WORSE systems for managing lots of people in one area. I’d rather lag than cease to exist.
---
Ok, I'm really second guessing my decision now haha.
---
Realistically how much slower will warrior levelling be, noting that I've got a priest with me at all times?
---
It's all about connections. I'm sure all he had to do was reach out and they gave him access. It's not a conspiracy theory. It's just how it works. Is it right? I don't know but he seems to love the game and his bringing it to his crowd. The more players the better.
---
What makes an RPG good is subjective. I think old wow and ffxi rise of the zilart are the best MMOs ever made. Some people think Fortnite is the best game ever made. I sound crazy to them and they sound crazy to me.
---
Classic has its niche. It’s going to last quite a while.
---
I said it as some qualifier to imply it's cringe, learn how to read.
---
&gt; I personally wouldn't ever attack someone when unprovoked
---
lol
---
pussy
---
There is no original AV anymore. What part of that don't you understand?
---
Yes, or they come up with even worse solutions like merging servers or megaservers with dynamic respawns that require Blizzard to alter the entire game and the entire experience.
---
I'm sure exceptions can be made. This is Classic sow after all isn't it? Not like I'm the only person asking for 1.5 AV to be given a chance before the game goes full release.
---
I can tell you now that TourGuide (by name) will not be. Tekkub sold it to WoW-Pro and their addon was developed from it. The guide files still use the same format though.
---
Holy Shit, this is really heavy beautifull !! This is such artwork ! My eyes can't watch away :)
---
I did. Did you read the 2nd paragraph ? Thats what i think they are testing now.
---
One free realm transfer included in your monthly payment, or just allow people who are on a dead server to migrate to better ones. 
---
There are way better solutions, they just want the one that’s still inconvenient enough that people will server xfer and give them the money.
---
I never said layering helps more than hurts just that it hurts less than merges. You haven’t shown otherwise. Instead you’ve just being going on about the issues with layering. I know the issues with layering. However those issues outweigh the issues proposed by any other method. If you disagree please provide insight as to how merges are better. 
---
So far all I’ve seen is the problems with layering but nothing pointing to a strength of merging. Just some false claims that merging doesn’t hurt communities (which is just as absurd as the claim you think I am making that layering helps more than hurts).
---
Again my claim is layering is a better alternative than the other options. The lesser of the evils of you will. Sure it sucks I don’t disagree. Sure it has issues I don’t disagree. It is better than the alternative though.
---
If you think otherwise use points that aren’t “layering does this, that, and the other thing.” Or lies that one thing doesn’t hurt.
---
I never said layering doesn’t hurt, just that it hurts less or allows things to remain intact on the server (which it does).
---
Thanks, seems everyone is saying this - no xp for completing the dungeon and mobs in dungeons don't give significantly higher xp than mobs in the world.  Plus time taken to organize groups.
---
I guess I'll do what you and others recommend, do the dungeons when I've gathered all the quests for them.  With the exception perhaps of Ragefire Cavern, which is quick and easy to get to.
---
&gt; It happened then. Free character migrations and transfers happened before BWL.
---
That was because of overpopulation, not underpopulation. They had to get people off those servers because they were buckling under the pressure.
---
Yeah, question would be whether they hand out the class quests or would you need to go all the way back to durotar.
---
On private servers the biggest annoyance is long AVs. People freak out and start to leave if the AV lasts longer than 30 minutes.
---
Agree
---
I'm glad someone else feels the same. He is not good at vanilla druid. And he talks like he is king of all druid knowledge. So much of the info he gives is just wrong.
---
It kills me when he starts going in on how bad feral is. Is it the best? No... But feral is solid and very viable, especially if you are the solo pvp type. It doesn't completely dominate any match up, but the only classes that really beat it consistently are spriest and warlock.. Everything else, feral can manage if played right... Or get out, reset, try again.
---
And then all the tourists leave and you're left with 10 times the number of servers you should've had and every single one of them are completely dead.
---
i mean those kids play fortnite all day. They are addicted. No different than playing wow nonstop
---
There's been some discussion about it on a discord that I'm on. Apparently it may be somewhat viable if you play as part of a solid group. Numbers need crunching though, there might be gaps in the levelling efficiency.
---
You're still in complete denial which is quite funny. You clearly don't seem to realize that just because someone told you that something is supposed to be in a certain way doesn't mean that it should remain that way till eternity. Blizzard made the game which means that change can happen even if some seem to think that it's impossible for some reason. What part of that don't you understand?
---
That’s what people keep saying but I think otherwise. Pservers have a community, granted not as strong as vanilla servers but those are also 24/7 active all around the world. I’d imagine with a layered server of people all from the same locale it’s be quite a bit better.
---
RemindME! August 28th, 2019
---
Did you make the pdf or can it be downloaded somewhere?
---
Looks really good from the brief look you show.
---
Is the population even going to shrink though? How can you know before we see in real time on launch? There is a LOT of hype for this game, we see it on this subreddit (136k members for a game that hasnt even lauched yet, wth?), on Twitch, on Youtube. 
---
Look at Nostalrius for example, obviously that's a private server, not that many people knew about it or were willing to play on it, ye it was growing so fast that Blizzard had to shut them down.
---
can you upload the document?
---
Imagine the shit show when everyone loses their names after the merge.
---
Side note, most of the "problem" with feral is people not gearing appropriate for it. Even in original vanilla people stacked agility thinking they were correct. Vanilla feral is all about strength and int with agility sprinkled in. Str makes the bleeds tick harder at 2:1 compared to agil, and int helps u shift forms as needed. Agil isn't bad, Str is just more efficient.
---
Blizzard isn't going to re-develop content they no longer have for a legacy game they're just bug fixing and then shipping out the door.
---
Blizzard isn't going to develop new content for a legacy game they're just bug fixing and then shipping out the door.
---
Get over it.
---
BiS is NEVER for PvP. Literally ever. BiS lists are used to determine raiding gear and parsed for best damage. I feel like you don'e understand what a BiS list is or why voting on it is irrelevant.
---
Do you have any proof to backup these claims or is this coming from someone that either: a) doesn't care about AV or what version is implemented in classic or b) wants a rushed version of AV
---
Little bit of column a little bit of column b. 
---
Definitely wasn’t just from overpopulation as it was very specific server(s) to server(s).
---
If it was just due to overpop they would’ve allowed em to anywhere that was not overpop.
---
My guild migrated two times during vanilla. The first time because the server was constantly crashing, the second time because of insane queues due to overpopulation. Not once did they offer transfers FROM dead servers, only to them.
---
Probably not much slower if at all with a priest.
---
I did it all solo pre 1.3 it was shite, but I’d do it again (except for being a NElf).
---
Your replies make it seem as if I'm desperately crying for the original AV to be added but what you don't seem to understand is this is a discussion so being rude and saying things like "Get over it" isn't gonna cut it my friend not how things work in society.
---
I remember reading 476.something total hours.  Someone did the math based on drop rates average kill times etc..  It's a long damn time.
---
Pservers with 15k have absolutely no community to speak of. They may be very fun to ply on due to all the people but that is not the same as having a server community.
---
Silvermoon, Suramar and Zuldazar are modern example of brilliantly designed cities, but Ironforge has always been the best one for me.
---
Super good artwork sir.
---
In lore Blackrock Mountain was the site of a battle between the Alliance and the First Horde. He just made a mistake due to English not being his native language. Not worthy of a facepalm.
---
Na man. When you watch monkeynews „pwning“ frostmages you watch one of the best if not the best warrior out there, most of the time insanely overgeared, killing mostly random people. That is not representative at all. On equal gear and skill level warriors get obliterated by nearly every class in the game.
---
A top player with gear can win in any matchup against a lower skilled opponent. Doesn’t mean the class itself is any better.
---
Can you name 1 class in 1on1 situations a warrior should beat consistently on equal skill and gear level?
---
I disagree but I guess that’s just in how you define community. There is obviously a community there it’s not tight nit (in the slightest) but to say there is none is absurd.
---
How can you play 18 hours a day! That does not sound good for your health.
---
I guess you haven't seen the screeching masses on the official Classic WoW forum. That's why I like this subreddit; people are far more reasonable here.
---
&gt;AV was the primary source of PvP in Vanilla
---
We must have played a different game back then.
---
I've been barking up this tree myself and you have people on both sides of the fence it seems... some loved it and some hated it.
---
I honestly felt it was a good for AV to be long as it was nice constant you could look forward to and if you wanted a quick fix you had AB or WSG.
---
World PvP was not always happening as well, Crossroads, Ashenvale and Tauran Mill were the only places you could find it happening most times, but not always... and that is where AV came in I think.
---
Thanks for the insight.
---
Vocal minority for the lose.
---
That's true World PvP would lay low for a bit and people would hit AV. Good times man.
---
Every single subscriber from BfA, you know the guys this entire subreddit is convinced will hate the game. They're probably correct and they won't like the game, but they'll definitely try it out because of the hype. That's millions of players world wide that will just vanish after a few weeks.
---
It'll look like the server is packed full when in reality it won't be in a while. Blizzard will have to create more servers because people won't like sitting in hour long queues and after a few weeks every single server that had 3000 people online 24/7 will have trouble breaking 1000.
---
Layering is a safe guard to make sure that the retail players don't ruin our servers before we've even gotten to the end game.
---
This actually sounds easier way to handle things. Great idea!
---
Classic will be a massive breath of fresh air
---
I fail to see how server merges with static, consistent communities is worse than layering that shuffles populations for weeks or months in a way that has similar impacts on community as CRZ, and then finally ends with merges anyway.
---
If mounts didn't take up a bag slot then I might bring myself to do it but also for the sake of hunting horde it kinda sticks out like a sore thumb in most terrain so probably won't.  Hats off to those that do though, good on ya.
---
Sure but your choices matter more.  So not everyone has all the same 20 collection.
---
Oh right! I had this in vanilla days. I just couldn't find info about it. Big thanks!
---
That may be an exaggeration but you get the point.
---
I did 12-18 hours a day for months on end while raiding; I'll be fine! 😁✌
---
That's enough for the epic mount!
---
My point exactly. Obviously it’s not just due to overpop but also underpop. They aren’t allowing you to any server that isn’t overpop only dead servers. Meaning overpopulation isn’t the sole reasoning for the transfers.
---
Which also proves my first point dead servers happened months into vanilla’s life.
---
Free transfers is a last resort as stated by Blizzard. If after layering servers are still having population problems they'll have to make use of free transfers but that's not what they want.
---
Ah this explains why you think stoneform is so good. It doesn't remove dots - it removes poison and bleed. So no, it doesn't do shit vs warlocks/mages/shaman and only removes some priest/hunter things. It doesn't remove magic. Stoneform is really only really good against rogue because because it removes blind/bleeds. It's handy against warrior but doesn't really change the matchup that much.
---
You will just have to experience the game differently this time. You will go slower and rarely be able to spend a day playing it. I remember often times thinking "I had fun playing wow today but it kinda sucks that I didn't do anything else today." It doesn't have to be a worse experience.
---
Every day is a great day since I'm not you.
---
Trying to judge a life cuz you got burned on the internet.  Sad.
---
Why are people awarding this repost and not the original artwork? /sad
---
Yeah they're different.
---
UD is really good at sticking to warlocks/priests, so they are a close second imo, but Orc is just the best.
---
Stun resist is good vs not only rogues but Paladins and Warriors as well. That on top of an AP cooldown is really good.
---
I'm still gonna play an UD rogue just because they have the best animations imo, but Orcs are definitely better overall.
---
I meant more from a dev perspective but yeah
---
IMO they’ll push layering to the point of ruining the game before they provide free anything.
---
I quit before this, but it seems like the problem with this is that if everything normally in town is available in your garrison, then why go to the town? The cities must look like ghost towns on retail.
---
There was mods to switch outfits fast.
---
I can see an add for classic but not anything too extravagant. I don't think we will see anything major this close to blizzcon.
---
They want there to be no underpopulated servers. Layering ensures that. So no I don't think transfers off of underpopulated servers will be a thing, not unless the loss of players are extremely high, much higher than anyone could anticipate.
---
Why read an article when the comments will tell you what to think?
---
Well yeah Pokimane got in aswell and she wasnt sure if you have to save your game before you log out.... 
---
She brings in more views than your average vanilla veteran though, and I suppose 100% newb pov isn't totally useless for testing purposes either. But yeah obviously it is all about connections with the big streamers.
---
You mean like Chromie resetting the timeline and sending us all home?
---
Ebn (ebbnflow) is great, stormx too, he doesn't stream a lot though. Ebn is focused on world PvP, stormx is likely the best flag carrier around. Both have great PvP videos as well on YouTube. They are really chill dudes it seems. 
---
I'm personally not a fan of sodapoppin, but you can't deny that he's a great druid player. 
---
Skarm and Shedo are the kings of feral tanking and feral DPS respectively, but to my knowledge only to YouTube videos, no steaming. 
---
We're pretty lucky druid content creators :)
---
The entire comment addressed not only the issue of having spread out zones but also how the game will probably continue compromising with casual players so these things aren’t so possible anymore.
---
In university atm so I'm good with free time, not as much as back then, but still a decent amount. The best part is that I have nothing going on the first two weeks of classic except my gfs birthday, but no work or courses.
---
Its a humar the pridelord, spaens under a trees north of ratchet, but have shitty spawn time.
---
Yeah transfers off underpop definitely wouldn’t be a thing. Layering does ensure that. Still possible we’ll get transfers with layering after they condense the layers if some servers end up way lower than others.
---
*"Good evening Mr. Zuckerberg. We would like to buy some information"*
---
The crossbow from av is only replaced by Rok'dolar.  That epic is epic though.
---
It's very hard to imagine how this would effect the gameplay - we already knew them all to 1% just with old calculations. I doubt going from 99% accuracy to 100% will make any difference.
---
Where are you going with this comment? It takes a whole lot more time than 18 days /played lol.
---
whould be nice if they kept the rare border.
---
bird
---
Did you know that you can actually use old models in retail version? It's in settings.
---
The Darkspear tribe isn't hated by their jungle kin for joining the Horde, they were hated by the other warring tribes before the orcs even arrived on Azeroth. They're also not the only tribe to join the Horde.
---
You are full of exaggerations.
---
That stupid alchemist in Crossroads is playing a huge practical joke.
---
Any cat will do, they have slightly less hp/armor but extra 10% dmg. Other than that raptors, owls, carrion birds are all pretty decent.
---
Classic WoW is not a democracy.
---
Yes altho keep in mind there are no mage, rogue, or priest trainers there
---
*just go play BFA AV if you want 1.12 because it's the same thing* I love this lol ;D  
---
I'm pretty convinced the entire reason they're doing AV as the test this weekend is just to shut everyone up, because once people play it all these stupid complaints will stop (except for the ideologues that would rather die than make any compromise about their vision for REEE Classic).
---
Please do elaborate.
---
Immediately my new wallpaper. Ironforge is magical in Classic WoW
---
Well I played Paladin in Classic I so hope you got friends to lvl with pallys are slow at killing mobs but hard to kill at the same time.
---
I will try out a Horde Shaman this time love a healer with shields that I can equip.
---
I want to make another reddit account just to give this another upvote, good stuff.
---
Lore-wise Sylvanas is stronger and more durable than any of them save Illidan because she's undead. She was canonically able to fall of the top of ICC and survive the fall if not for the Saronite spikes, and she can turn into an intangible Banshee. If Garrosh or Vol'jin don't need armor, she certainly doesn't.
---
Lol ground textures just run 3dmark on repeat if you want to look at something shiny
---
This is a discussion and the way you're handling it only shows how triggered you are over a simple discussion.
---
This is a joke, right? This grind took months. Some of y'all have never played Vanilla and it really shows.
---
Nah, it’s all there in what you posted.
---
&gt;Now as far as I remember in Vanilla we used an addon which would estimate the mob's HP based on the damage I dealt
---
I'm pretty sure even in good ol' days it already had a database for mobs. It's players that need hit-based estimations.
---
Sure I did almost as many hours when I was in my mid teens. But now 15 years later as an adult with a career, it's impossible. How would you fit that many hours around your job?
---
Im going hardcore the first week, I need 1 week of vacation anyway that I don’t know what to use for. Hopefully I can get ahead of the curve and reach 60 in a week of no life gaming with some friends. After that I’ll take it slow and just play and raid when the time is right. I don’t expect all my friends to be playing forever tbf and when they quit my motivation to play will likely die so it becomes a couple of hours a week thing if at all.
---
Well it certainly didn't help in WoD, but new players still have to do a lengthy questline to get the garrison, and then there's plenty of grinding to get it to that point. I just prefer using the garrison because retail is a mostly solo experience for me and sometimes I don't want to deal with players.
---
That's about how long it takes.
---
I can still see the damn Enhancment Shaman in BGs run up to me and WF prock me to death in 2 sec
---
I honestly hate the new character models and animations
---
Everything just looks so incredibly goofy, for example tauren/troll/night elf running animations, they are all over the place. Look em up in a model viewer.
---
Being an adult and I general better/more experienced with the games helps as well though. Like sure obviously playing 0-3h per say vs 5-15 is a massive difference, but I dare to say that my time management these days is much better as well. Less of running circles, sitting on rooftops etc. Many of us have spent WAY more time than we'd like to admit in the past doing nothing. When you got only 3 hours a night before you HAVE TO go to bed, you will likely be more efficient with the time as well.
---
Not saying it will be like as a kid or as a student with more free time. But I also think that now that your game time is more precious and you are more used to managing your time, setting small goals and working towards them is less likely to get yourself sidetracked as much.
---
The game was made for casuals. Character progression is slow but rewarding, and the raids were pretty simple compared to now, allowing casuals a better chance at actually doing them.
---
Owl &gt; Bat &gt; Raptor &gt; Boar &gt; Cat

---
You're the only one in this "discussion" that doesn't seem to understand 1.12 AV is the only AV you're getting.
---
It has never been confirmed but it's very often brought up in to conversation. They are really thinking how it would effect actual game, pros and cons. Iirc Ion did mention in one Q&amp;A that they are doing internal testing about how it would feel to level up with lower levels. One thing they have been worried is psychological effect on players. How they react when their 120 characters would be on level 60 again.
---
Other items I noticed have a small but noticeable spell power coefficients; dark moon maelstrom card and heart of wyrmthalic.
---
WHAT'S UP PARTY PEOPLE!!!
---
MobInfo2
---
I love that go play BFA AV if you want 1.12 quote too but it's actually quite sad.
---
I'm also pretty convinced that the entire reason they're doing AV as the test this weekend is just to test it, because once people play it they they don't wanna have to deal with issues on a 15 year old version of the game (just like they have to test out every other aspect about the game since this is beta remember?)
---
I'll probably continue to fiddle with it on a pserver while I play warlock on live :)
---
Is there a normal stage 1? I am only seeing pre-raid
---
[Giving up one world for another.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bywrm4/giving_up_one_world_for_another/)
---
Careers are overrated. 😜
---
It's still a discussion so you're gonna have to relax and stop being so negative about things just because of someone's opinion being different than yours. Again, not how it works buddy.
---
Not sure if you understand the concept of pre-bis. 
---
It's not a list where you throw all the items you like. It's **best** in slot, which means one slot, one item which will lead to the best performance. Similar and slightly worse item could and should be mentioned so that you can grab them while working on the pre-bis.
---
it is a thought indeed but considering how other pet stats arent connected to the owner either under normal circumstances i would assume the pet to either:
---
1. have a static miss/resist chance that cannot be changed
---
2. have the same miss/resist chance as npc's
---
We read the headline, was it misleading?
---
Gotta be honest, I was fine with this area just being inaccessible mountains. Kinda like that... whatever that is in the retail one.
---
I am 100% on board with layering, its not like retail where the server you on doesnt matter for 99.99% of things. It would be so awful leveling up to 60 and getting ready to raid but oops, you picked the server with 95% of players on your faction dipping after a couple months and now you have to reroll on a mpre populated server.
---
Is it actually 10 seconds?
---
So many people keep arguing against this and I swear if you people get what you want and don't have layering then have fun leveling up your class past level 3 because you can't get any tags on mobs in the starting area.
---
If that's the case then private servers would have accurate HP values. They are all over the place.
---
as someone who has played on nost since day one, yes i did have a great time
---
what amazes me is that this is the only comment about this that ive been able to find... what an entitled douche...
---
That's one hell of a painting good job.
---
So you still live at home with your folks then? Or your just lucky to have some massive inheritance.
---
You convinced me to give enchanting a go, so I will put alchemy on hold. Just store mats in the bank for alchemy later. My biggest concern is getting gold for mounts, actually having enough gold for mounts when I reach appropriate levels.
---
Fuck, I was so sure to play Horde this time around. Now, I'm not so sure anymore...
---
Just when I finally thought I settled on going Horde I have to see this. Really fantastic job looks so sick.
---
You invite a Paladin.
---
Opinions don't matter in WoW Classic. Get that through your skull.
---
1.11 if i remember correctly
---
I have been playing tauren druid since Vanilla. I personally have been fallen in love with warstomp for a very long time. It's just so handy ability to have and in Classic there won't be as many CCs as there is in retail. I would personally take ability I can choose how to use over ability that just happens.
---
But like you said in the end I would always go race that I prefer visually. I rather perform 1% worse than watch race that I don't like to play. Of course as druid player I don't have that privilege in Classic.
---
that is if we assume classic ignores the obvious flaws of black lotus.
---
lets not forget classic currently has layering...
---
lots of things will change in regard to the lotus at least, either layering stays and people relog until getting on diff layer with lotus and thus lotus  prices drop or they make them rng
---
and then they will cost 25-40g a piece early release. at least thats what they cost for 3-4 months on K3 early on.
---
I'm looking forward to it. Short BG queues for me. For the Alliance!
---
My two cents I levelled two prot palas on private servers never did endgame stuff with them. 
---
Start with 11 points into holy. I would go Divine Int, SoR, Consecration. This helps you single target damage a lot since you will nearly always be having SoR on and judging SoR. After putting up wisdom, light or crusader that is. 
---
Then start you way on the prot tree. Redoubt, precision, armor, kings, righteous fury, defense skill. You can be flexible here but most agree taking defense skill last as it provides a smaller benefit. The rest is Sanctuary, reckoning, 1h spec and holy shield.
---
For gear while leveling I would go some stamina + int gear these are mostly green items. I would invest in some level appropriate greens every few levels. This helps you stay effective vs doing something like running mail items with a little bit more stats in you 40s and 50s. Also the blue dungeon mail and plate has strenght which isn't bad but they have a high amount of armor and stamina so try to get these pieces. Find out which quests give good armor or weapons for you.
---
Thrash blade for Mara quest is really good. Also fist of stone from Mara. The one handed axe from Stalvans quest line is really overpowered for how early you could get it. Truesilver breastplate is kind of cool also enchanting it with absorption. The cloth head from gnomer gives another damage reflect. There are a lot of beneficial gear pieces. 
---
Get a shield spike on your shield, this is a lot of damage. Keep ret aura on except when you need the extra armor or resistance. 
---
Use blessing of wisdom most of the time. After you get blessing of sanctuary you will use that in big pulls while aoe grinding and in dungeons.
---
In a five man group, after having solid threat you can start to regenerate mana for the next pull. Use rank 1 consecration and rank 1 holy shield or just save your mana further by keeping seal of wisdom on. This helps with the speed of the dungeon run.
---
lol the amount of dodges from the dragon haha
---
Lol horde isn't really that popular. It just the hipster effect of something less popular becomes a lot more popular because it's seen as less popular, see also: Druids, Warlocks, RP-PVP servers.  
---
I mean it's going to be close, but Alliance will definitely be more popular overall. People talking on one forum months before the game is released are not representative of what the player population will be like.
---
I’m in a very similar position to OP, and I’m kinda accepting the fact that it’s going to take me longer than I’d like to hit 60, and I’m going to have to sacrifice some sleep in order to play haha... haa... ah well.
---
cool
---
Anything in your zone that has a good rank of bite or claw.
---
This comment teleported me back to 2005
---
That's not how Thunder Bluff looks at all
---
As Tank you watch your party's mana and health. Provided across the board they are all above 50% you move on to the next group of mobs provided your current group is nearly all dead or at least at less than 10% remaining. That keeps the momentum going. RFC is one of those instances where it's pretty easy to do this in Vanilla.
---
I really wonder when I see all those polls what people intend to play, the usual niche classes are often pretty far up. But those are always polls of long time fans of the game and probably not representative of what classis will look like after release.
---
No, it was an unpopular battleground that most players, especially PvP players, did not enjoy. But hey, don't listen to me, [listen to John Staats.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9fb2bo/john_staats_ama_author_of_the_world_of_warcraft/e5ymu7a/)
---
The very fact that Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin both went through all of vanilla with virtually zero changes whilst AV underwent major changes should be enough to show you that AV was not popular. The other battlegrounds didn't get changes because players liked them and didn't complain about them. On the other hand, the forums back in the day were full of players complaining about AV. That's why it changed.
---
Seriously! 
---
Haven't checked LFG in years.
---
You are free to do whatever you want man, that's just an alternate if you don't wanna quest.
---
That's beautiful.
---
Can we get a Thunderbluff?
---
Mad WF proccs.
---
Those that bitch about gatekeeping are those that just havent met the minimum quest requirements yet.
---
Dude, that’s sharding. Layering doesn’t work for zones. It’s an emulated server for the whole continent.
---
Someone please turn this into a 3440x1440 wallpaper.
---
I've lost interest in this conversation.
---
I've never said you are either a vanilla or retail player. I was both as well for 3 months into WoD.
---
Left monitor is the new ragnaros classic art, right monitor is OG login screen in HD
---
&gt;there are a lot of workarounds
---
to create WoW 2. But they're not doing WoW 2. If they give up 1.12 AV, people start demanding progressive itemization, maybe talents, maybe to buff raids to compensate.
---
can’t wait to finally get my (in 2018) ordered copy. 
---
not sure whats more amazing, the complexity of shipping a lot of copies of a self written&amp;published books across the globe, or the amount of effort john staats puts in it. 
---
the update mails and blogposts he regularly sends out seem like a pain in the ass.
---
Neither! There's many ways to make money in today's day and age, and it doesn't cost a whole lot to sit at home for 18 hours a day. 😊
---
Didn't they change Sylvanas in TBC or WotLK? I don't think those models would look too much out of place. I would personally prefer them to look a little more badass / unique...
---
That series worth reading? I’ve never read anything by the original author, but I do really enjoy Sanderson’s works.
---
Did I miss a blue post cause in the interviews I have watched they say phase 1 but not like all of phase 1, couple weeks is the hope, and I can't see people getting to 60 and abusing the layering enough to wreck the economy some people are losing their minds over.
---
People at the beta say the game still is 95% fun. Let blizz do their thing and be grateful to get your desired experience at latest at phase 2.
---
Actually around 20-25% proc rate.
---
20m exp at 40k exph is shorter than this grind?
---
People will stress about having to play a “monster” and not some froofy elf. This was the #1 reason I couldn’t get my friends to play Horde with me in vanilla and I ended up alliance all these years. At least I compensated by playing a human warlock.
---
&gt; The very fact that Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin both went through all of vanilla with virtually zero changes whilst AV underwent major changes should be enough to show you that AV was not popular.
---
I understand what you're trying to see here, but let's take a look at what is literally 1.1 AV on current latest wow, how's that doing then? It's completely abandoned and it's all about rushing things so all these changes that happened because people back in the day were complaining about original AV didn't end up so well did they? Humans learn from their mistakes and this is a good time to show that.
---
What I'm trying to say here is that 1.5 AV would be essentially be the true **Classic** experience since this is **Classic** wow. Plus it's not like people who are asking for the original Alterac Valley are demanding it all we want and what would be fair for everyone is some sort of survey given out to people to voice their opinions properly is all.
---
Do not judge..
---
My point was that vanilla was successful because it embraced community and any system that could fracture that could ruin it. Clearly how they currently deal with population has negatively impacted on retail so why apply a similar system to classic
---
Oh shit, I never realised this either.
---
Getting her as Alliance is the real show of commitment, though.
---
I was like "hold on why is my browser moving im not even scrolling".
---
You could try playing a private server to get back into the game a little. If not download steam and look through the library they have tons of games. Rocket league is one I've played a lot, completely different to wow, but still a brilliant game.
---
But you let your comic book fandom leak projectile all over. Hope you don’t spill any on your Dragon Ball-Z button up.
---
Horde has gotten, what, 0.5% more popular? Yeah, awful.
---
Id say on pvp servers stealth is worth it just to hide if you dont want to fight or get ganked
---
See that's where your wrong I feel like, if they gave up 1.12 AV for the original "classic" AV I'm sure it would be viewed different if Blizzard actually came out of the closet and spoke about it and introduced this change in a well organized proper way to the community. AV may have been the most hated battleground of them all back in the day (even though I don't agree with this at all and no one knows for sure) but since this is "Classic wow" I and many others believe that 1.12 AV is not Classic at all.
---
How?
---
Yeah, it's like 51/49 at the moment right?
---
Bah. I prefer that on PS4. Maybe I'll look into private servers. Just dont wanna put too much effort into them when I plan on playing classic.
---
Yes, it's shorter. This typically takes 600-700 hours. Almost all of these comments are from people who obviously didn't play Vanilla.
---
There isn’t anything *official*, but at the time, Blizzard has bound guaranteed MoP beta access to entering into a contract for a 12 month sub. 
---
They called it the “annual pass”, and it caused a huge shit storm because it was supposed to guarantee beta access when the beta opened up, but they had over a million people sign up for it and they had issues with inviting them all, to the point where some people who bought the annual pass *specifically* for the beta did not get in until much later. It was just a huge mess.
---
The idea of paid beta access just sets a bad precedent because Blizzard could charge whatever premium they wanted (and they did) for what would really amount to “early access” for a lot of people.
---
I always hated Transmog.
---
more racist twitch zoomers is not good for the commmunity
---
Very late in vanilla, might have been TBC pre-patch, they made pvp gear purchable with honor. Many people, me inclueded, got full epic gear+weapon during that time.
---
Expose Armor
---
release of the original vanilla i player alliance druid up to 42-43 and then swapped to horde never to play alliance again...
---
now however yes horde has grown too popular and i have played more or less every class &amp; role on horde
---
I am considering alliance strongly now even tho to be honest i despise the basic/boring looks of stormwind and not being able to hunt gnomes...
---
but on the other hand it would be a new experience and i could just make either troll or tauren my new primary targets... at least raiding would be a diff game with shamans swapped out for paladins...
---
I also enjoy rooting for the underdog... also alliance have shorter bg que if it follows the trend that pservs have shown.
---
Pre TBC patch (2.0.1) changed the whole system so honor was just a currency you earned from doing PvP, and anyone could rock up and buy rank 14 weapons/armour if they did it enough. You could earn enough to get a rank 14 weapon in one dedicated weekend of BG holidays. Lots of people farmed the full set by the time TBC launched (and then promptly replaced it all in the first levels in outlands).
---
The honest answer is probably because their hands are tied. The answer they’ll give is for server/population stability. I’ll take it too. I’d rather have larger servers condensed later like layering than merges of completely separate realms.
---
Either way it sucks. It’s a legitimate concern either way too. (Whether you’re concerned about layering being bad, or tons of dead servers needing merges without layering.)
---
This is wrong on so many levels. But your biggest exaggeration is that AV was the main source of PvP. For most people, they wanted to get exalted with AV Reps so they could get BiS items. 
---
Once you have played a couple dead end AV games, you don't want to keep going back. 
---
This is also another shit post about something that hasn't been released yet. Once it does on Monday, then feel free to continue shit posting.
---
Esfand?
---
As I’ve said in one of the other numerous reposts about this topic...
---
*it ain’t gonna happen*
---
Blizzard has repeatedly said so, and has the data that backed up the fact that 1.5 AV was extremely low in popularity and when they changed it, they had a substantially larger population playing it.
---
&gt;WPvP is Massive in vanilla wow
---
until BGs are out. After that it's open world bosses mostly and some ganking in the newbie zones.
---
warcraft 3
---
Nope.
---
I always have a grayisch as boring as possible wallpaper. Am I missing out?
---
The character creation countdown was encouraging (:
---
I'm going to go swords and depending kn if my rl mates can keep up ill most likely skip dungeons
---
I would guess 15k drops to 7.5k within 2 weeks. Blizzard has the data and they will adjust the server size accordingly.
---
It's a weird vanilla thing. Grenades count as a stun from an effect standpoint but grenade stuns act like an incapacitate in that any dmg breaks it. Weird but that's vanilla for you.
---
Just play upside down, problem solved.
---
Just please don't Uber camp Joana and MadSeason, everyone. They are two of the nice streamers. Sure kill them, it's PVP. But don't follow them around endlessly.
---
I play Horde, I hate gnomes with a passion, however for a melee there is no better PVP racial than escape artist.
---
Think about it next time you will be frost-novaed waiting for the frostbolt to hit you :o
---
Every other city is a turd compared to Ironforge. I am incredibly unhappy they put AH in the other cities cause Ironforge is just amazing and everyone including horde should chill there, or not cause Ironforge HOT!
---
It's especially odd in WoW since tons of WC3 units were left handed.
---
seeing how they also spam the "kangz" thing its probably referring to the "ooga booga we wuz kangz and shieet" meme
---
I want to believe !
---
&gt; End game IF is set up as the best city for access to everything as well. 
---
Not sure if srs.
---
That's cool, good to know thanks for the info!
---
Dude, I've been doing the same thing for my warrior, right down to a ranked list of names for my bank alt. I've got grind spots for each level (just in case), exact timing for quest hand-ins and scheduled stops in each city. I'm already at 20 pages and not nearly satisfied yet.
---
Yours looks great. I am definitely going to steal some of your formatting choices, looks solid!
---
The gates are wide open, I think there may be a bit of draft coming in plus it probably got vents.
---
I know it makes me sound like a sociopath but that makes it so, so much better.
---
HS is a rage dump while rend is a rage waste though (unless dotting a rogue ofc).
---
Asmongold is going to have 10-20 fans following him around at all times. I'm not sure why he is so worried about a random sniper coming after him. They'll have to bring enough help to deal with the 5 pocket healers.
---
Private server garbage
---
&gt; This is also another shit post about something that hasn't been released yet. When it does on Monday, then feel free to continue shit posting.
---
So it's considered a shit post if someone has a different opinion than yours? Right.
---
Will love every minute
---
Damn, I forgot about Honor currency. This is it, thanks for the jolt to my memory, it was driving me crazy.
---
It will be released for kindle later this month, according to the author
---
&gt; (and yes, merging layers is literally the same as merging servers, both will damage the community)
---
No, it isn't.  When you merge servers, you have multiple economies and guild structures that get combined.  With layering, you have a shared economy and guilds are pulling from the same pool of players from the start.
---
Trust me, I played on servers that got merged due to low population numbers.  It was painful before the merge and the merge changed a lot in the guild/world dynamics.
---
&gt; Good old queues, more servers, lower pop cap (they seem to be going for a cap of about 9k right now, which is too high in my opinion). You've dealt with this 15 years ago, why not now?
---
Because we haven't dealt with that since at least WoD and we have technology that makes it an obsolete inconvenience.  Ques were one of the biggest complaints in WoW until they were eliminated.  There is no way, or good reason for, Blizz to bring back one of the most hated parts of the game when they don't have to.
---
&gt; Dynamic respawns (more spawns/faster respawns = a zone can handle more people).
---
If you are talking about the Retail style dynamic respawns, that would change Classic much more than layering would.  Retail style dynamic respawns means you can increase your XP/hr by a significant amount.  This changes leveling metas, farming metas, and the incoming amount of trade materials (and how they are concentrated/spread) just as much, if not more so, than layering.
---
&gt; There's even some evidence of dynamic respawns being in original vanilla (obviously no way to know for sure)
---
Yes, and the type/amount of dynamic respawning in Classic *should* mirror what was in vanilla.
---
&gt; Why cater to "tourists", those arent the people Classic is for, they arent the people that will keep Classic alive for years down the line.
---
Sadly, the 'tourists' have always been the main driving force of WoW.  Their sub money is just as valuable as yours, even if they only "log in for 30 mins on launch day".  So catering to them, in the short term, is worth it from a financial stand point.
---
&gt; Why hurt the servers in the long term...
---
What long term effects are there?  Guilds will still be able to form, people will still be able to talk/group/raid together, and the economy will still form and equalize.  Until something changes where this will be around beyond, at worst, the entirety of phase 1, then you are over reacting and pulling a Chicken Little.  
---
The worst case scenario for long term damage is that there is an excess of crafting goods, but those will eventually be consumed by the population and it will equalize once the layers merge.
---
&gt; ...so you blindly accept layering and disregard all critique.
---
And you are blindly dismissing it because it is different.  There are many upsides to having layering in the short term, with very few down sides compared to the alternatives.  As long as it is just for the short term, I will continue to agree that it is the best course for the game.
---
That's fair, I'd still recommend having a look through steam though, see if anything catches your eye.
---
Yep, that explains everything, thanks!
---
Skarms Videos in general are great but the aoe Tank comparison was just trash. A tier 3 thunder fury warrior of course tanks everything well... 
---
If you compare it to a bis prot pally both will likely clear strat in 20 Mins.
---
Engineering helps a lot if you’re a pally tank.
---
How is that an opinion when you stated "1.12 AV WILL AID in killing Classic"? You seem so confident.
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Is it cosmetic only? I thought it prevented players from moving behind you to cancel your aimed shot but it has been a while
---
&gt; How can I discuss an issue when you won't even say what it is?
---
I've said what is is, layering is going to be around longer then Blizzard has stated it will be. Ignorance is bliss, you're not smart enough to know you're being lied to.
---
&gt;has the data that backed up the fact that 1.5 AV was extremely low in popularity and when they changed it, they had a substantially larger population playing it.
---
If that's the case then I don't see the issue with having them setup surveys to people on the beta and players that have old wow accounts then?
---
&gt; Sorry you don’t like it, see you when Classic launches.
---
For sure man I'll be there, never said AV would stop me or anyone from playing Classic wow anyway :)
---
It's only an exploit because of the new technology. If the server was a set layer we wouldn't have any respawning node issues
---
nailed it!
---
&gt; I wonder why they never added this originally when there were so many other small details they did. 
---
What other details do you have in mind? Do consider that adding this is no minor cosmetic change, it will require full duplication/testing of all combat moves and emotes + god knows what else ...
---
So definitely want to skip Expose Armor and Back-stab, you can probably also skip detect traps and disarm traps, since it has only like one use in PvE and still minor use in PvP against hunters.
---
Where I play there weren’t such people that didn’t like pally tanks. They mostly were grateful for getting a tank and therefore agreed to change their playstyle a little bit.
---
This area makes a lot of sense as a rugged mountainous area, sort of explaining the dramatic desert and jungle sides of the mountain.
---
Should also have multiple options per slot. Like "almost bis" quality gear.
---
"Horder isn't really that popular"?
---
Look at the raid progress rankings....
---
The art of Clickbait else you wouldn't be here. Jokes aside it's only a title and I did have an explanation to why that is in the post itself.
---
If you check out [The Survey Results](https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/)
---
You'll find things are basically 51/49 Alliance.  If you filter it to only PvP, it's like 52/48 Horde.  Should be pretty balanced, though individual servers will differ.
---
Are you going to rush 60? If not, just farm a bit more and you'll be golden. People seem way too worried about min/maxing gold and everything else. If you are not rushing 60, take some time to enjoy the game and the gold will follow.
---
Yeah I figured I would skip it myself for the same reason.
---
I can't remember exactly. But where do you store hunters pets in Classic back then? Was it part of the interface or was there an NPC where you can give pets to store?
---
I read about the same thing on Zelda Twilight Princess. When they made it for GameCube, Link was a leftie. When they wanted to remake the game for the Wii, using motion controls, they tried to make him right handed because most people would swing with their right hand. Apparently it was so difficult to do that they simply preferred to mirror the whole game left-to-right instead.
---
So, while I am not a game dev, I'd guess making double animations for characters would be very taxing.
---
Yes you are correct
---
Never learn Crippling Poison. 
---
I'm definitely not going to play a priest.
---
Not really rushing but I'm just concerned i wont have enough gold at 40 for a mount, but you are right
---
Very nice job, I love it. There are some discrepencies though on warriors:
---
- Pre-raid fury should have Bloodmail boots as BIS for orcs/humans aswell, not just the other races.
---
- Pre-raid Fury should have Brigam girdle as BIS for orcs/humans aswell, not just the other races.
---
- Pre-raid Prot should have dodge trinket from DM:W instead of Demon's Blood. (Defence as a stat is over-valued in the old vanilla Meta).
---
- First raid stage Prot should have T1 gloves instead of Stonegrip gauntlents
---
- First raid stage Prot should have T1 chest instead of Deathbone.
---
- Raid stage 3 and 4 should have cloak from Azuregos.
---
- Last raid stage fury should have Shroud of Dominion instead of Cloak of the scourge.
---
- Last raid stage fury should have Leather bracers from Twin Emps instead of Anubrekan plate bracers.
---
- Last raid stage fury should have Girdle of the Mentor instead of Onslaught girdle.
---
- Last raid stage fury should have Kiss of the spider instead of DFT
---
I might have forgotten a few.
---
Old AV was an AFK fest that largely contributed to requiring cross realm bgs because half the game would be afk spinning right for 10 hours straight while everyone else tdmd mid. It led to people having multiday queues
---
God that figure looks awful
---
It looks like that option was removed. :/ Thanks though, I had no idea.
---
I'm not sure how pets work these days but in Vanilla if you wanted your pet to learn new abilities such as claw, bite, prowl etc you had to tame a beast that already knew the ability, use it a handful of times until the message stating you learned it yourself shows up and then you can teach it to your pet.
---
The following site provides a load of useful info regarding pets, their attack speeds, where to get certain skills and their ranks amongst other things. 
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
I always stuck with a cat for general grinding/farming due to prowl+shadowmeld being a powerful combination. A boar is great as it is easy to maintain due to its diet (it eats anything including conjured food from mages if memory serves correctly).
---
I said it takes longer than 120 hour not less? Are you saying it takes less? Probably takes close to 300 hours played. So what are you saying? It takes months played time or months of grinding multiple hours a day? Your comment makes no sense.
---
&gt;and she wasnt sure if you have to save your game before you log out...
---
lmao. Thank you blizzard, very cool.
---
Ah the great humanoid slaying !
---
The biggest hunter crit I ever saw in a PVP video was something like 2700 damage.
---
Imagine if you have the talent you would do ... 81 more damage ... gasp !
---
In PVP I don't see the point of this talent, I'd rather take Deflection but to each his own I guess.
---
I have 3 goals in mind: 
---
- Level fast (like one of the first people to hit 60 in duo leveling with a mage) 
---
- get gear for raids and in raids comfortable
---
- 75/25 PvE/PvP
---
I’m thinking either Hunter/Shaman. 
---
Any other recommendation?
---
Replying to the thread as a whole, sorry. In Vanilla this took 5-700 hours.
---
Rogue gold farm at 60 is pretty nice...you just go around pickpocketing everything. 
---
Dungeons you can solo pickpocket farm: RFD, ZF, BRD, LBRS.
---
I personally liked RFD the most because mobs wouldn't resist your pickpocket as much. You can also kill the bosses and the rare for a little extra income. ZF was nice for a change of scenery and the mobs there drop Gutripper a fair amount from pickpocketing. I wouldn't recommend trying to farm BRD/LBRS since they resist so much, then you have to blow vanish and wait 5min or die.
---
Um what. This isn't a conspiracy theory, it's literally Blizzard's marketing plan.
---
Why would they do that? Point is it’s been stated *multiple times* that we are not getting 1.5 AV.
---
A survey doesn’t change that *nobody* wants to sit in a queue for hours on end hoping someone gets bored and leaves AV or has to log off, and besides, people like winning a BG now and again. 
---
It just isn’t gonna happen.
---
They should release it later, in phase 4 or something, as a separate queue, that you can only queue for by walking out to TM/SS and queuing there.
---
To be fair they still say that when you're level 60 if you haven't done the quest.
---
It's a shit explanation from someone who doesn't sound like they've actually played AV or Vanilla. If you did, you'd know it most definetly WAS NOT the only source of PvP. 
---
You really wanna sit in an 8 hour AV where neither side will give up to end the round? You want to sit in the same game for THREE days? 
---
You do AV once in a while when you're bored after you have grinded to exalted for Pre-BiS items. Stop with these dumb assumptions that have no base.
---
Sounds good
---
Maybe. I used to play dota 2 years ago. I've kept up with patch notes over the years but recently it just doesnt look as fun as it once was.
---
Haha
---
Agreed, but instead of transferring characters I’d have your original on the classic server and they let you copy him to classic+, that way you can play both
---
I'm almost crying right now.
---
Everyone more focused on PVE doesnt give a flying fuck about AV. They do it as a grind to get those items. If theres a AV weekend, you can knock that out in single one. These people want fast games to get the rep.
---
This is the part that i dont REALLY get. After the initial rush, why the PVP's play AV the way you claim they want to ? The hardcore PVE's arent there to rush things. You can turtle the 1.12 av so fucking easily and make it a 4 hour game if you choose to.
---
Your ACTUAL complaint is that while you claim to speak for the other pvp'ers, they dont agree with you. Or if they do, you will see the long ass AV's you claim to want.
---
Not needed at all: Backstab, Expose Armor, Feint, Mind-numbing Poison, Wound Poison, Detect Traps, Disarm Trap
---
Only Rank 1 needed: Gouge, Kick, and Ambush (if Horde)
---
Deadly Poison and Rupture can be useful for kiting some mobs and doing elite quests, but feel free to skip them too if you're that hard up for cash. I usually skip Deadly but train Rupture.
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
This is a poor way to decide.
---
I’d debate warrior is the most fun to level - as you are somewhat challenged and have to overcome those hurdles.
---
Choose whichever fantasy/play style you like.
---
Don’t try and knock it to numbers and data.
---
A 40-man raid will essentially take anyone if it is short a few people (which it will be)
---
get stat weights mod and plug in those values and never have to do em again.
---
People are thinking about this way too seriously. I've tried every class on pservers and found every class fun to play except Rogue (don't know why I don't like it). So I decided I wanna play Priest because it's the most fun. I can level as DPS and at the end I'll be a good healer.
---
Just pick whichever is the most fun to play for you. If you care about min/maxing, there's already a list on what you should play.
---
This is an incredibly beautiful painting!
---
On a side note, how much do you think it cost to have an apartment in IF? 100 gold per month?
---
Think it is just down to budget and balance reasons to be fair. Horde would be so over played it would be boring.
---
Sounds like the intro into an MLM scheme
---
+5 axe skill for orcs is basically a 5-10% increase in threat from autohits which translates to 2.5-5% increase in overall threat.
---
For orcs, axes is KING
---
Hey everything has its pros and cons I'm not saying that old AV was the greatest most perfect battleground to have ever been made, all I'm saying is this is **Classic** wow so a true **Classic** experience needs to at least give a chance to the **Classic** AV that's all.
---
Plus I'm not saying "DITCH 1.12 AV RIGHT NOW AND START WORKING ON 1.5 AV" neither am I desperately crying about the fact that 1.12 AV is going to be used instead of the original I'm being completely fair and would really like to see Blizzard take another look at the 1.15 version of this battleground.
---
Retail classes are nothing like how they are in Classic.
---
Playing retail to prepare for classic will only tell you that they both had hotbars and every class had skills or spells. The game has changed so *dramatically* since Vanilla.
---
Cheers bro
---
WOW
---
Joana especially, so many of us will be referring to those leveling guides.
---
If I remember correctly Lordaeron and Trisfal Glades were originally populated by humans until the war broke out.
---
What do you mean? Fearward is only avaiable to alliance.
---
New d2 ladder reset today?😉
---
&gt; I'm curious what you think is ruined by this? As I see it, the merge option presents one or perhaps a few painful days amongst a majority pure days.
---
The merge creates a huge upheaval in multiple ways.  The biggest is the economy.  Excessive amount of trade goods all of a sudden tanking the market, consumables being bought out and jumping in price, and BoE/crafted gear becoming much harder to acquire/buy are just a few of the issues that can arise.
---
The next point is guild dynamics.  When a guild's player pool suddenly doubles, tipples, or more, then that also changes how guilds view their members, especially if they have been hitting a wall recently.  This also creates issues where, even if the guild is willing to be loyal to their members, the members now have more options if they feel they can find greener pastures.
---
Lastly, the chat, and LFG in specific, becomes much more crowded.  You now have new people, many you haven't see/heard of before, around and you don't know if they, or their guild, have any bad reputations.  You might now have to wait for word of mouth, or a bad experience, to know if these new people are ones you want to avoid.
---
With layering, none of these problems are present since there will be a shared player pool for guilds, a shared economy for all the layers, and shared chat channels.  You will get to know your server's economy, guild structures, and who is who.
---
Is this opinion unpopular? Seems perfectly legit. Personally I am too lazy to bother but yeah if you are streaming your gameplay for the world to see that is kind of on you.
---
I thought orcs had a racial that breaks fear too but it's undead instead as no thank you on them ....
---
Nice use of triangles
---
Under SW is accessible on the beta right now...Esfand showed it the other day. I think others have gotten to IF airport in the beta too. Hyjal as well. Idk if blizz is going to leave these or fix them. But I did hear they fixed a couple spots already near Un'goro/Silithus and in Winterspring.
---
Looks alive. nice work.
---
How is this an unpopular opinion? I’ve never seen anyone say that this should be against the TOS. 
---
You guys need to stop using this trope. 
---
“You keep using that word. I do not think you it means what you think it means.”
---
Tbf the rest of the fight only lasts like 15 more seconds cause summit opens up on someone at the front and he gets focus targeted down and then insta releases.
---
&gt; Your solution to this is blizzard to change AV
---
My suggestion is that Blizzard takes another look at this and maybe get some actual real numbers that proves the 1.5 version of the game isn't wanted as some people claim
---
That is correct. When in full T3/Naxx gear and worldbuffs, a tauren will basically get about 500-700 extra HP from the racial alone.
---
That being said, I still belive weapon skill is KING for all PvE minded warrior, no matter if you're fury or protection.
---
There is undead of all types within the game.
---
The playable class undead are called forsaken which are humans that were from lordaeron. Thats why the starting area is that place
---
You did fine because you were not in a guild whose sos knew how to play. You’re not pumping up your damage with rain bow and sunshine. You’re not hacking the Gibson and finding damage when it doesn’t exist.
---
No one cares if you did top 10 in your crappy guild. 
---
Enhancement shamans are mathematically one of the worst DPS classes in vanilla wow. Stop trying to make it anything other than that.
---
claak is pretty he good he just went shadow priest and he’s going to be in the level 40 tournament. he’s also really interactive with his chat and streams just about every day.
---
Jan 2021 with my slightly pessimistic estimate of 3 hours a week..
---
wtf lol
---
Oh yes, I think I remember.
---
AV was changed like every single patch. We’re playing patch 1.12 where it was changed to its current form
---
Crossrealm bg's did the most imo. When the que dropped to zero you didnt have time to go anywhere. I used to play on scarshield legion which was pre-tbc one of those less populated realms, and sometimes you had to wait wsg for 2h.
---
So as in having 1.5 and 1.12 AV both in the game?
---
Got it, thanks for the info.
---
Swifty could crash the server back in the day because of an event he held. Then blizzard force him to give them a notice prior to the event.  Their tech has probably improved since the original aq event.
---
All I hear is that you make a bunch of assumptions and claim it for fact. Isn't there also only one scepter for the event? Wouldn't that mean people would miss the ceremony because it occured in a different layer?
---
I dont know, on any vanilla pservers ever created, alliance was the dominant side. however, it was really even, like 52:48 for ally or something
---
I would probably have picked Gnome. Not having Cloak of Shadows to getting out of pesky roots is a really good defense mechanics vs. Mage/Hunters. For WPVP those are the classes that really can be a challenge if they manage to kite you.   
---
If you play Sub-build with Prep and improved sprint, you have 2x sprint that breaks root + a racial root breaker every 1 min. That will make it extremely hard for them to kite you. Also, Gnome is more sneaky! :D
---
Layering wasn't enabled for the stress test. It has been enabled for 4 days now.
---
You've stumbled upon it unwittingly I am sure, but Chinese philosophy is actually the greatest in the world, so I appreciate it.
---
Protip: Rank 1 Frostbolt comes in handy a lot. Just gotta get a feel for using it correctly.
---
The honor system was introduced in patch 1.4. In patch 1.8 they modified the required rating for higher levels rank, allowing more people to hit the high ranks.
---
It´s like playing Warhammer Online to get better in Retail WoW :D
---
Every game of Dota could've been 20k xp
---
&gt; You haven’t shown otherwise
---
-Points to former wow Devs words on the subject of server population and healthy communities
---
-Points to years of sharding ruining in game communities
---
-Points RP servers removing sharding specifically to help their community
---
-The guy still says there is no evidence.
---
- /facepalm
---
&gt; If you disagree please provide insight as to how merges are better. 
---
That's literally all I've been doing. If you need to re read what I said please do it, because if you really stand by those words you haven't read a word I've said to you. 
---
&gt; Just some false claims that merging doesn’t hurt communities
---
How can you know it's false? You said it yourself, they have never merged servers. You advocate for a layering system that has years upon years of examples of why it hurts communities but are quick to demonize something that has never been done saying you know what will happen. I've been through server merges in other games, it's really not a big deal. Much less of a deal than destroying communities by overcrowding every server. 
---
Do you really think blacklisting ninjas will work when you're on a server cluster of over 20k people? That ninja will be able to go on and ninja in plenty of other groups because there are so many people you might as well be anonymous. In game communities work when there is a limited number of people to interact with forcing people to play nice if they want to fit in and not be blacklisted. 
---
Also before you say no proof, just look at how people started acting once the LFD tool came out. Everyone was grouped from the same server cluster but no one cared about being a dick anymore because they were grouped with so many different people it didn't matter. This is what happens with layering, and I can guarantee it will be around longer than they say. How do you think the AQ event will go down with no layering? It's coming post phase 1 I guarantee it.
---
If you want the same problems modern wow has, then yes sharding/layering is the way to go. The only con to a server merge is that your server goes from a very small community to a normal sized community and you have new groups to interact with along with your old ones. Layering causes more issues than it solves, if you really think it's better than merging after everything I have pointed to there is no point in discussing it with you because you are blind to any form of evidence.
---
On an unofficial server, on which the consensus seems to be that those mobs were harder than on the beta. I basically got to 60 with only ranking sinister strike, eviscerate and instant poison. Ofc I bought all the one off spells without ranks i.e blind, cheap shot, evasion, distract etc.
---
I’m much older and not as busy
---
No you can see it happening without changing layers. The mobs in the area when I’ve seen it happen on streams were taking an abnormally long time to spawn, then suddenly everything in the area spawned.
---
With proper planning there would be a system in place to only allow a single name per cluster.
---
Even then it should just be 2 servers, 7.5k is far too big for any server. Blizzard didn't think Classic would be as popular as it is, they may have data but I doubt it's accuracy.
---
Start making money from home now! 
---
j/k
---
&gt; Why would they do that? Point is it’s been stated multiple times that we are not getting 1.5 AV. I think you and the other minority that think 1.5 AV was the best have a very severe case of the nostalgias.
---
Oh please man, come on, we've already been through this "You think you do but you don't" and nostalgia talk B.S. cut the crap. If what me and this minority that you speak of are so wrong just because our opinions are different then let's remember how we ended up having Classic wow remade in the first place, Heck let's take a look and remember why /r/Classicwow even exists.
---
I dont think it's generally good advice to "try" to change what is otherwise a comfortable sleep schedule
---
If you want to broadcast your location to the world, that’s your fault. GM should have as little interaction as possible. Like.... name changes. That’s it.
---
Even then being able to reset and vanish against opponents is a massive boost in rogue utility. More so than a snare that's easily reapplied by any player with a brain.
---
Not really. Mirroring a model (and its animation skeleton) is a pretty trivial coding task. Wouldn't require any new design/animation work at all. It could be done entirely in client, if tampering with models wasn't bannable.
---
Let's take a look and see how this fast pace rushfest AV is performing now in it's current state then? **Not so well**
---
Do yourself a favor and playnon an insta 60 Pservers and un install retail.
---
The problem, in my opinion, with Cataclysm was that the zones all had portals to them in SW so they could have been anywhere.  They never really felt like part of the old world.
---
He still had a chance to win, just has to git gud...BfA has been training a lot of ppl for moments like these.
---
In WC3, the plague that Ner'zhul makes and then instructs Kel'Thuzad to spread only works on Humans. These are the ones that eventually broke free and became The Forsaken when Sylvanas rallied them.
---
I wish I got good pvp ranks either as a shadow priest or an enhancement shaman. But I want to do a bit of raiding too (not hardcore but not too casual either) and those class choices apparently aren't good :(
---
my m8 and i can't wait to do the "run" together aswell.
---
People still queue it plenty. The same could not be said about original AV and bgs in general. Cross realm happened because people stopped queueing for pvp
---
Everyone knows damn well that if it was happening to them they wouldn't like it. What if the streamer just decided to camp you with a group of people for hours. Would you like it? No, you would be making another thread complaining that a streamer is camping you for hours. You would want some sort of punishment for the streamer. I know you are gonna lie and say thats just the game. But everyone knows the butt hurt stream sniper would be reporting the streamer. No one likes cheaters and thats what stream snipers are.
---
The mount just looks like Night Elvs mount? I dont get it
---
Didnt need an excel for  what i desired :P
---
I feel no rush to level to 60. I'll just enjoy the game on my own pace. Sort of in the same situation as you are (28 now and a son).
---
Not sure if I’d want to ruin the experience on a character I cannot keep.
---
The wait isn’t that long tbh.
---
Download the 1.12.1 client and play on a insta60 Pservers  if you have wow or extensive mmo experience.
---
Classic WoW gonna be like nursing home simulator. Gamers dad unite.
---
It didn't need to be "popular".  It was *loved* by a specific crowd who loved that *type* of a war.  It wasn't a battleground.  It was a war.  You ware part of something **big**.  They should have left it for the crowd that loved it instead of trying to make it work for everyone.
---
if this kind of analysis works for you, rock it. i would have trouble giving consistent and honest ratings for all categories, but if they are all true for YOU, then it should work out in the end.
---
that being said, you must think mages are EXTRA fun in groups
---
For me its only a funny way to decide and of cause the points are only my decisions. 
---
I‘ve tryed the most classes on Pserver and i‘m pretty sure i‘ll Main mage. 
---
I felt warri was very hard to lvl. 
---
Don‘t take the table so seriously :)
---
The advantage as player a healer is that it's easier for you to find groups to do dungeons when you have the time to play. If you were a dps you might have to spend more time finding groups whereas if you're a healer, instant invite :)  And the healer classes are pretty strong levelers, apart from maybe paladin. Wont die but might take a bit longer to kill mobs. Druids and priests are strong and fast levelers, shamans middle of the pack and paladins at the bottom. Good luck!
---
Yeah.  Leave 1.12, make 1.5 as a bonus, for people that really wanted that type of thing.
---
Added in WOTLK iirc, sadly
---
Mobinfo3
---
I remember being drawn to Bless Online for it's graphics. Even tho it was F2P I still gave it a shot. 90mins later it was already uninstalled...and now it's shutting  down not even a year after release.
---
Draw me like your French girls
---
Their tech has improved but not fucking way it can hold everyone coming back for an event to stand in the same zone. It's an event that is basically a stress test. 
---
Think about how many people will come back just to see that event, there will be a mass swell on top of the regular player base that stayed. Not to mention tourists who just want to come see it because they missed it 14 years ago.
---
If the numbers for that event don't swell to rival that of launch I would be surprised. 
---
&gt; Wouldn't that mean people would miss the ceremony because it occured in a different layer?
---
Maybe, there was always only 1 event back in Vanilla so there's no way to know if it would just fuck it for people on a different layer or if it would allow multiple people to bang the gong per server. Another issue that layering causes in this argument.
---
These are good points. I'm not a fan of a cluster system either. I propose it because I think that a few periods of upheaval are preferable to a consistently sharded experience for months or even, possibly, the entirely of Classic. 
---
Another thought that comes to mind when reading your post is that some of the things that you say would be lost in a merge may not exist in the first place on layered servers due to the immense size of the player base. What does your reputation matter in a pool of 20,000 players? That is basically just retail sharding anyway, as you're not going to see or remember strangers. How healthy will the economy be when the, say, 20 min-maxers who would have been spread across clusters are now grouped up to more efficiently game the layering system by hopping between layers, using knowledge of spawn timers and locations to completely control all of the black lotus / devilsaur leather for 20,000 people instead of being split up or even not present on some smaller servers in clusters. 
---
The guild dynamics issue is one that I'd gladly concede. Merges definitely stir up server populations and guilds.
---
They're getting paid to play Video games. I'm sure they'll get over it.
---
Absolutely not, never did it in Vanilla and and from what I heard it's a horrible grind XD no thanks!
---
Sylvannas is trying real hard to be a 3rd faction.
---
You say AV was the primary source of pvp - not true, other two BGs are there, wsg being the premade va premade bg and wpvp
---
You say pvp will be the main source of enjoyment late game - not true, people will go to endgame raids, level alts, collect stuff
---
You say 1.12 AV is a boring zergfest - not true, me and others on my server had a very good time in 1.12 AV in late vanilla and tbc. People pvpd in the field of strife, turtled, matches could go on for a long time (hence the resource thing was implemented)
---
You say Classic will fail because of 1.12 AV, not true and at this point I am not giving detailed reasoning I hope you understand why
---
After 1 AV that’s lasts 12+ hours you will be begging for the current av.
---
Yes but at that point it's essentially just layering except you can't group with everyone on your server which kinda defeats the purpose. They would have to implement some sort of cross realm solution for Archimonde-1 and Archimonde-2 players to be able to interact with each other.
---
I love troll warriors, and I appreciate you spreading the good word. The Paladin gang appreciates all you trolls
---
No, you said they've already gone back on their word but refuse to say on what. My guess is they haven't.
---
Like I said, keep being angry over nothing, meanwhile I'll enjoy Classic and laugh when layering is indeed removed.
---
Which p server would you advise?
---
Why not Ambush if he's going combat swords? Dagger swap macro for opening with ambush?
---
I don't read comics.
---
It's bound to happen. Players won't quit the game equally across all servers. I could imagine big streamer servers losing less players for example so once layering is completely removed the server that Asmongold is on will face extreme queues.
---
Blizzard will have to open up transfers from the high pop servers to the low or medium pop ones when that happens.
---
Inb4 they do something like this and your "beta" invite becomes a stress test weekend. But hey you still got in beta at least ;)
---
This title sounds really hipster.
---
This makes me want to roll a dwarf priest so bad!
---
Why are Rep. Costs a positive? Should work the other way around
---
PSA: Putting 'Unpopular opinion' in your thread title doesn't make it an 'Unpopular Opinion'.
---
It was a bug.  BWL was quite buggy upon release.
---
At one attempt per week, no one would have ever killed him.
---
That's your opinion and you're entitled to it but the developers said that free transfers or even new servers would be a thing if realms still were overpopulated by the time layering was removed. 
---
I think the Classic development team has earned enough trust at this point for us to not doubt their word.
---
I think in terms of layout it’s the fastest to get anywhere (gryphon, trainers, battlemasters, ...) of all the major cities.
---
he literally said in one stream " Im glad i get to try this whole classic beta thing out to learn to game."
---
Their job is literally to make money dude. They are accountable to their shareholders. They have a budget. Part of their job is cutting enough corners as possible to make it cheaper, like any other job in the world.
---
What, you think Blizzard is a charitable organization that puts players above shareholders? That would literally be illegal for them to do.
---
You’re not getting long AVs.
---
Lol okay thank you.
---
Bgs are confirmed to be crossrealm in classic. There’s been dev interviews and the bgs in the beta were crossrealm with the stress test realm
---
\&gt;  You really wanna sit in an 8 hour AV where neither side will give up to end the round? You want to sit in the same game for THREE days? 
---
Again - No one's forcing anyone to sit in a 8 hour AV or sit in the same game for THREE days if you don't have the time to play AV then there are other BGs that are at your service. Classic wow once released will most likely never be updated again so let's think a bit long term here I'm sure no one here wants Classic to die and having a battleground like the old AV, something that's disgustingly time consuming yet gave you a great feeling when it all came to an end, having slain the opposing faction man nothing can describe that feeling you got when all of that happened. No other BG gave you that feeling as much as the old AV gave.
---
On the contrary having the 1.12 rush version of the battleground would only be "1 more battleground addition" to the game, it gave nowhere near the experiences you had in the 1.5 version and it will surely not help the game in any way or bring any big changes since people prefer the other BGs either way as most people say.
---
Engineering is in no way a must for "doing any pvp or pve".
---
Most people won't have engineering and you don't need it either.
---
It's obvious that you are bias for druids so just make a druid and be done with it.
---
I have made no prediction. These are data you erroneously thought would support your prediction.
---
Came here to say this. Plan on leveling a Ret pally and was disappointed it wasn't there
---
Fuck no. One of my guildies did it and it took him forever.
---
When’s it coming?
---
That could actually work if people stopped getting so triggered every time someone mentioned 1.5 AV
---
I understand that it would probably make some people salty but I think it would be better for everyone if the server progresses to the next expansion while a fresh vanilla server is released. If it becomes an optional clone like you say, then the legacy community becomes further fragmented which reduces server activity, while the naxx realms just effectively have an expiration date on them because people don't roll on fully progressed realms when there is a fresh realm available.
---
Shaman has the benefit of being able to heal in raids with their pvp spec (30/0/21) assuming you're not assigned to the caster group, in which case you'd need Mana Tide.
---
Shaman's aren't particularly fast levelers. They're definitely somewhere in the slower half. Its not bad, they are fun, but I wouldn't describe them as fast.
---
Horde hear , at some poi t i will probably do the "grind" and ruin some allies grind by ganking them
---
Yeah I remember there was a spot under some stairs where you could duel people inside IF then you went to a window I think and would poly people. The sheep would go through the window and end up in Old IF.
---
You have to realize who their boss is though... I have a ton of faith in classic and am incredibly excited, but Blizzard/ Activision has a pretty bad track record.
---
Unpopular opinion: Calling the most popular opinion and unpopular opinion for some weird reason.
---
I have some time between assignments the next day or two. What song should I try to make a «Blizzard, hire this guy» parody of?
---
My first thought was Bohemian Rhapsody, but I’ll see what else you/I come up with.
---
&gt; instead of trying to make it work for everyone
---
Exactly this, plus they didn't even do a good job trying to make it work for everyone anyway
---
Imagine a full blown Azeroth VR experience running on the hardware we’ll have in 15 years.
---
I'd probably log off and play something else for half an hour to be honest. It's not the end if the world to get ganked.
---
Oh please current AV is all rush that's all it is and I don't think we need to argue about that
---
I notice that when i scroll down the page to click on a location on the bottom of the continent maps that when it loads the zone im at the bottom of the page so I have to scroll up to see the map. Would it be possiblew to have you go to the top of the page each time you go into an area?
---
A lot of his content is super scripted.
---
Painfully so.
---
You can tell he has prepared to set up jokes throughout the stream.
---
An example would be when he drew on hair with a marker - showed it to stream and went “uh oh, it was permanent” - so painfully scripted.
---
People can tell when something is authentic - this guy is fake through and through.
---
Numbers and ranges seem random
---
They do not stack
---
I like how you give a popular opinion but make it sound edgy by saying its unpopular.
---
A lot of these seem pretty arbitrary. I mean you gave Mage a 2 in pvp and Druid a 5.
---
Stupid orc just jaelous their artistic skills only were limited to slapping wooden pikes on rocks :P
---
Hunter is the easiest class to pick up and play but one of the hardest class to play really well, and for the pay off of mid to low dps at max level. 
---
Warlock had pets aswell and you will always get invited to groups because of your ability to summon. Downside, you never get summoned anywhere, lvl 60 raid rotation is “spam shadow bolt”
---
Hunter and warlock are the fastest and easiest classes to level. Hunter is the best lvl 60 farming class. Most Healers and tanks have a hunter alt for farming gold.
---
Hunter really shit the bed when they get ganked. But most classes will have no chance when you are ganking.
---
Warlocks have no issue with pvp at all and are monsters. Mages are really the only class that beat a warlock in 1v1
---
It's a good idea and it looks good. But still needs a lot of work.
---
Holy Priest is pretty much all wrong. There is no overall full-BiS and you need a list that lists BiS for different encounters, e.g. Full T2 with ZG-Trinket for Huhuran OR full +heal for strong renews. You also need to push +heal way more generally to be able to use renew correctly and be competitive in Naxxramas. That is why you will never find someone using Full T3 and going Eye of the Dead and Warmth for Trinkets. You use Gem + Eye. Also Atiesh is easier to get than Kel Mace and is actually stronger in itself because of Spiritual Guidance.
---
You can't do it by the numbers. It's like falling in love. Just play the different classes until onr makes you stick.
---
No, I'm not. Read it again.
---
should we tell him?
---
Its not essential. In T2 Mage gear the gnome racial accounts for about 0.50% spell crit and a couple extra hundred mana.
---
Dwarf Priests are BiS for both PvP and PvE.
---
Very true, but so far they have given Classic the care it deserves in my opinion and shown that they listen to our complaints and accommodate them when they can so I'll remain positive until they prove otherwise.
---
I don't have the same faith for the BfA team on the other hand, they seem completely clueless.
---
A cluster system would spread the same, say, 20,000 players that layering will have into 5, 4000-person clusters. Their only interaction will be that they may eventually all merge together as players leave, and thus the names pool will be shared.
---
Each cluster will feel like an authentic Vanilla experience because it will be a conventional static population situation. 
---
A layering system will not feel authentic because we will be logging in to new groups of people every day. The dude you played with yesterday on Eastern Kingdoms 3 but didn't add to the friends list is on Eastern Kingdoms 2 and so you won't naturally come across him and resume your questing together. 
---
&gt;Yes but at that point it's essentially just layering except you can't group with everyone on your server which kinda defeats the purpose. 
---
It's not layering at all because you do not have to deal with the other 16,000 people in the first few weeks/months. Ever. You only get your one-server experience. The purpose is to avoid sharding an all the myriad issues it brings.
---
the alliance blue and epic plate sets are identical
---
&gt; No, you said they've already gone back on their word but refuse to say on what.
---
-At first it was only starter zones because it was still sharding tech. Then everyone was mad because they knew it wouldn't be just starting zones.
---
-Blizzard says they will shard "when it makes sense". People interpretted this vague statement in any way they wanted. Some saying only for the first few weeks, some thinking this means as long as the numbers are high. Point is it's intentionally vague.
---
-Ion says it will be out by the end of phase 1. We don't know how long phase 1 is, it will most likely be at least a few months, probably longer. This is more than enough time to cause harm to communities and the economies of the server, both of which we know has been adversely effected in modern wow. 
---
What do you think will happen if the sub numbers for Classic don't drop as much as they expect? Do you think they'll get rid of layering when there are too many people for a single layer to handle? They said "when it makes sense", so technically it wouldn't be a lie. What about the AQ event? Do you really think a single layer will be able to handle the servers load without crashing?
---
Like I said, you haven't been paying attention.
---
You can skip Ambush too as Garrote is a fine opener and much preferred in dungeons. Unless you’re Horde, you need Rank 1 Ambush if you’re Horde.
---
Um, ok?
---
*there are groups planning to clear MC before the first reset hits. That means doing a 48h shift and 20h shifts after that for 7 days.
---
Fixed that for you.
---
No, i have a solution.
---
Release a limited amount of realms. Let there be queues. When people leave after a week, a month, whatever, then the queue is gone.
---
There we go. I prefer that x100 to layering or sharding.
---
People are trying to reinvent the wheel here. MMO launches have happened so many times without any sort of fancy tech, they can do it again. I guess people are so afraid of not being able to play the first week. I don't really give a shit whether i play the first week or i have to wait a couple of weeks.
---
The whole issue is that people want Blizzard to release enough realms at launch for there to be practically no queue. For that you need some bullshit solution like layering.
---
Prepare to layer for the booty bay fishing tournament .
---
Metzen originally envisioned a “Cathedral” dungeon/raid/outdoor dungeon, in addition to the monastery in Tirisfal.
---
A Scarlett Raid/Dungeon in tirisfal would fit well.
---
You can check the vods of streamers spamming sm gy for hours at 30, theres hundreds of resets worth of data if you care enough to look through it.
---
When I was about lvl 10-12 in Vanilla (ud) we realized that defias masks dropped in Westmarch. Helmets! At lvl 12! We we're thrilled and started our long journey through Stranglethorn and after what felt like ages and a million deaths we finally arrived and proceeded to farm those bandits for like 2 hours until all three of us had a helmet without any stats. Damn were we proud.
---
Completely agreed, I just really hope Blizzard sees the difference in expectations between audiences. I don’t mind lag, I don’t mind clunky, I just want to feel like I’m a part of a world. 
---
Bfa team is what brought me to this, they had such a huge opportunity and completely screwed it.
---
Solution: work a sane amount of hours
---
So basically you never ranked up to 14 but somehow assumed that you did?
---
So if you want to level without ganking just tell the whole world where you will be leveling, then everyone who kills you is a cheater and should be punished ;-)
---
&gt;How will you (really) find work/life balance when WoW Classic drops?  
---
I won't.
---
This is the shit I want added as ongoing to vanilla. After naxz has been out for 6 months or so then release new content making sure to keep balance in check with vanilla. Don't make welfare epix just expand upon the game as it was then. And as others had said have this be a quest chain to purify the ashbringer.
---
&gt;In a 40man, how many rogues vs locks do you typically take?
---
You take more Rogues than Warlocks, but there are always more Rogues than Warlocks to choose from; Rogue is just a more popular class. I'd say you take about 4-6 Rogues and about 3-4 Warlocks.
---
Warlocks are better levelers by far and Rogues don't have any utility to speak of, but in exchange for not having utility they sit on or near the top of the DPS chart.
---
Warlocks have stones, can summon players, banish is a niche ability but super useful in some fights.
---
i agree with this. new content like this would be left off for after the last bit of vanilla content has been released.
---
Can we get a rule against low effort memes? I mean, this isn’t even good.
---
\&gt; You say AV was the primary source of pvp - not true, other two BGs are there, wsg being the premade vs premade bg and wpvp 
---
Already replied to this in another post I was writing fast and let a few words slip through so that bit is exaggerated.
---
\&gt; You say pvp will be the main source of enjoyment late game - not true, people will go to endgame raids, level alts, collect stuff 
---
And I still do believe that PvP will play a big part of enjoyment not late game, but after Classic has been out for a while and people have already done what you said "raids, level alts, collect stuff"
---
\&gt; You say 1.12 AV is a boring zergfest - not true, me and others on my server had a very good time in 1.12 AV in late vanilla and tbc. People pvpd in the field of strife, turtled, matches could go on for a long time (hence the resource thing was implemented) 
---
1.12 AV is all about rushing everything just like what this current state of the game has become sadly because Blizzard tried to make it appeal to everyone by making it "easier"
---
\&gt; You say Classic will fail because of 1.12 AV, not true and at this point I am not giving detailed reasoning I hope you understand why 
---
I never said Classic will fail because of 1.12 AV unlike some others who try to voice their opinion on this subject all I said was 1.12 AV is going to aid in killing classic in the long run.
---
For any question like this, ask yourself what is more important?  In this case:
---
A: The imp does some damage to the boss
---
B: The imp maintains the stamina buff on the tanks
---
Another one of these?
---
&gt;Unless you’re Horde, you need Rank 1 Ambush if you’re Horde.
---
Can you elaborate on this please? I played a Rogue way back in Vanilla, but can't recall this particular point or the reasoning behind it.
---
GOTTA GO FASTER
---
@ u/classicwowlive/
---
You are missing a cave! :) There is a secret cave on the most south eastern coast of the Kalimdor. Below Silithus. It has a horde structure in front of it.
---
On the contrary I’d argue this is some high quality shit. 👌👌
---
Can’t discuss it on here AFAIK.
---
That's why warlocks scale better than hunters in PvE; they can sacrifice their pets.
---
Anyone in particular you can recommend?
---
yeah no way method thinks this, lol so many of the private server guilds are very hard working people with obscene experience APE has with vanilla and so many others.
---
Tag it spoilers
---
Good tip. 😎👌
---
Sleeping 8 hours at home isnt necessary if you can sleep at your workplace
---
no consideration for threat in these tank "bis" lists for each phase, not even hit. if your dps wants to wait 5 sunders &amp; hold back dps at execute the list can work I guess
---
It's cognitive dissonance, they have made up their minds because it's the norm to hate on blizzard and they will refuse to listen to anyone who disagrees with them.
---
I’m not saying you’re wrong. Blizzard said you’re wrong. They’re the ones that said 1.5 AV was unpopular. I’m just repeating what they said.
---
To me, tbc then back to Azeroth to kill Arthas should have been the end of the game. 
---
Then Queue Warcraft 4.
---
But before going to bc, there was so much unfinished content on azeroth. Expansions worth. 
---
In universe, we should have been as relatively powerful as we were in WoD (generals of our factions’ army) when we stepped through the dark portal. Pretty much only people who had killed Kel Thuzad would have been near powerful or notable people for the leaders of the alliance and horde to know who they were. 
---
Some ragtag idiot who hadn’t ever killed Ragnaros wasn’t going to be called by Bolvar to storm the Dark Portal!
---
Obviously I don't know the specifics of your schedule but my first thought is that you ever working a 20 hour day means your work/life balance is way off already and WoW Classic isn't going to change that.
---
What if we are not prepared?
---
If you're doing strictly PvP Orcs are a no brainer. Hardiness is so good. Nearly a third of incoming stuns just flat out resist. Its broken.
---
Tauren have Warstomp which is underrated imo. Shaman don't really have any hard CC so its nice, but I still value Hardiness more.
---
Troll is probably the worst PvP choice in terms of min-max, but I personally think they look the coolest in gear. Berserking has some niche uses, but you'll get more consistent value out of Hardiness.
---
Same with the Horde. Personally, I loved the blue set more, as it had a nicer contrast, the epic one was really, really yellowish, and had no contrasts in the cloth.
---
This probably also saved my sanity, as I found the trip to 10 already long enough!
---
damn here I though it would be WoD
---
It is illegal in all of Europe at least.
---
I’m excited.
---
it’s a great way to farm karma for him
---
it raid ideas. Expanding on the huge amount of vanilla lore like this is amazing. and really shows what could still be done
---
Okay I agree with that.
---
I have wow and mmo experience, I grew up playing tons of MMOs before and after wow. UO, DAoC, CoH, Vanguard just to name a few. 
---
But having not had a computer in so long, I havent a clue how to find and download the 1.12.1 client or how to find/access private servers.
---
Honestly. Hunt down streamers. All of them except maybe one or two every eclipse ain't a total hypocritical ass. I'm thinking about asmon and soda in particular. They cry about stream snipers but it is the same as telling everyone "I am gonna go kill the trolls in stv if you bring an alliance and kill me I will be angry and sad" and then be surprised someone brings their alliance alt. It just doesn't work. They don't want the bad that comes with being a streamer. Absolutely childish behavior.
---
Troll is BiS for PvE; this is true for anyone that casts spells.
---
Ask anyone on a big streamer's chat if they agree with this opinion. I would guess they would all bandwagon-support the streamer and tell you that stream sniping is bad and should be a bannable offense.
---
Lol it’s pretty evident that you don’t know anything. So how would you know the power of escape artist.
---
Yeah it was nice that you needed to make a choice. 
---
Next to Barbarella I also had the Clutchmother (the rare, green/blue Tallstrider from Darkshore) and one of those brown armoured pigs from Razorfen. But they never got a lot of time outside, as you know, favourites...
---
At first I was so against the idea of Vanilla+, but then I saw clips of an Old developer of WoW talking about all the stuff they never got too add and didn’t have time for. And honestly, now I’m pretty hype for it!
---
The fact that this wasn't Big Blue Dress is bad and you should feel bad
---
How is this an unpopular opinion when it’s not even an issue?
---
Damn, that idea is nuts. After Naxx new content? I am in.
---
he’s cousins with the actor Benedict cucumber
---
Same for gold farm spots. Servers tend to make DM bit harder or nerf some other spots. Will be interesting to see how it develops.
---
I played at the EU release and there were no pools of blood.
---
Idk about lion heart helm but didn’t blizz specifically say that titanic leggings will not be available until later?
---
You can always raid as healer as those. Most of the gear is the same.
---
Not unpopular opinion at all however, as a twitch streamer, if you're caught streamsniping another streamer, your account can get banned.
---
Always played a mage, went into AV and bombed the zerg. Die and repeat.
---
You need to train pet skills a long the way, so you will need to stable and tame other pets from time to time, having the highest rank of pet skills for you level matters more then the pet type.
---
was a Tauren hunter back in the day, I missed out on the tier 0 breastplate and the bow/staff.  Only ever played horde.  Rolling an Alliance Mage this time ( I don't want to be poor so ports for sale)
---
&gt;No one likes cheaters and thats what stream snipers are.
---
rofl
---
The quest to unlock Poisons for Horde Rogues requires you to kill an elite that’s damn near impossible to solo if you don’t read the instructions. Using Ambush on him will take 50% of his HP and weaken him greatly. If you’re level 22 you can Ambush-&gt;Vanish-&gt;Ambush and he’ll die immediately.
---
Alliance don’t need to do this because they just need to Pick Pocket a key, Sap an elite, and then loot a box.
---
There are plenty of studies suggesting that a too small amount of sleep is bad for tour health though for several reasons.
---
Everything is amazing except Savage Coast. Can you do some zones at Kalimdor? You are amazing.
---
Or make alot of servers and once the hype dies down then you merge them. It won't affect a community when you essentially just add more people. It's the same as a group of friends making characters in the server for the first time.
---
I am excited to wear pvp Lieutenant Commander gear on my paladin, again. I want this bad boy gryphon on my shoulder again
---
Alliance have less Warlocks because Undead is a very popular race choice, so they have less value in PvP.
---
If you don't care about PvP very much, Alliance Warlocks are actually in a much better spot PvE wise; Blessing of Salvation allows them to get more DPS off. Warlocks don't have anyway to deal with threat other than just standing around.
---
man i hope his weapons drop for players
---
When Day9 started to play Dota2 he said one of the biggest appeals to him with the game was it was refeshing to play something that requires time commitment. In an era were many games are more arcade style of 15-20 minute games with almost nothing to lose Dota 2 stands out. 
---
Now, I am not saying Day9 represents today’s player but I think his point is valid: when you just queue up for 15-20 minutes in most games and don’t care if you win or lose a grindy game like classic WoW that is more about small victories (getting 1 more talent point; passing medium leather in your leatherworking; etc) might actually appeal to players who haven’t really been exposed to that kind of gameplay and tempo. So as long as classic WoW’s graphics or combat isn’t a turn off I think we might see a fair share of new WoW players who’ve never touched the game before - younger and older.
---
There’s a clear bias there. They’re a terrible example of who should be asked this question. 
---
The big streamers have an enormous cult of followers who are emotionally and financially invested in their streamers.
---
Jokes no you mate I still don't have obligations and responsibilities 15 years later
---
It’s pretty terrible to be honest. Try harder next time.
---
downvoting u
---
Ah yes, now there's a bell ringing, cheers for the clarification - that makes sense. Yes, that quest was quite awful to do at the time, I seem to recall the mobs you had to deal with on your way up the tower were also around 22-25. I was fooled into attempting the quest at level 20 (when the quest became available) and it was not the most rewarding experience. X-roads to Sludge fen is quite a distance to corpse run.
---
Honestly I think the layering experiment has failed. I was in favour of it at first, but with launch just around the corner and all these issues still present, I think it would be better to just launch with multiple instances of the same server with the intention of merging a couple months after launch.
---
They could have something like Anvilmar1, Anvilmar2, Anvilmar3, Illidan1, Illidan2, Illidan3 with connected name/guild name pools but otherwise separate, so when it all merges into just Anvilmar and Illidan there aren't any conflicts
---
This is great but excuse me, old Orgrimmar is the greatest
---
Because I've played with both.
---
I stream only started doing it for when classic was released always been a goal of mine to at least try it. I've been stream sniped playing league before it didn't bother me for the simple fact I'm the one putting myself out there. 
---
And if I get stream sniped in classic I'll have the same feeling about it. It comes with it. I've been camped for hours before and when classic comes out it'll happen again regardless if I stream or not.  I just don't understand how soda and asmond couldn't see this coming or be better about handling it. It legit blows my mind.
---
I’m not downvoting you because I’m disagree, I’m downvoting you because your title sucks.
---
What type of raid? A boss dive? A whole raid with loads of bosses?
---
I don’t mock the idea I don’t get why people react so strongly but honestly just saying “that’s raid” is barely an idea to me. 
---
Who are the bosses, how many, are there events etc etc. if I just read ZG - trolls I wouldn’t be satisfied.
---

20 man raid with loot in the (x) level comparable to MC and some better than dungeon level gear.
---
Now I know what the raid is.
---
Tauren is better if you have any interest in PvP. Warstomp is really really good.
---
I think the only advantage I'd say Night Elves have are that they have better Feral PvE results. 1% dodge is better than the extra health. Windfury does nothing for kitty DPS, it only increases the disparity between the Druid and other melee DPS. Blessings do however increase kitty DPS.
---
They also have easier access to Gnomer
---
Actually, no.
---
Well shit blizzard should just give this guy some money cause he has it all figured out lmao

How do you judge what's popular or unpopular though? If 10k people agree on a topic but someone has a 300-400k following that disagree with those 10k, is the opinion of that 10k popular or unpopular? Considering that the big following has a clear bias.

no

Wildstar had fantastic housing. Instances but you could build literally anything you wanted and plot sizes were huge. People made towns, space stations, arenas, space ship interiors, forests...
---
My aggressive bear aggro'd the entire ship my first time through deadmines after I did not dismiss the thing before jumping down to a previous level.

We wiped a shit load that day, but being so close to the end and with how long we'd been in the dungeon already, the theatrics of it all were just too much to handle.

---
Long range class that do alot of damage? And your a first timer? I guess there's only one real recommendation.. a hunter.
---
Sidenote: mages and warlocks are really nice classes although not as "easy" as hunters
---
20 hours a day? Mate! That’s crazy. Luckily I work 40 hours a week so I should be able to get a couple hours in each day and more on weekends
---
This whole discussion is utterly pointless. Neither streamers nor snipers are second class citizen. If you play on PvP, you **consent** to being ganked and farmed for 18 hours a day.
---
I did 3 MC runs with my pally, then I rerolled hunter because I felt I didn't contribute anything besides blessings. You do you, and you're definitely not the only one on this sub with the plan to roll a pally, but personally don't get where the pally-hype comes from? Maybe support just wasn't my thing idk.
---
I also have a solution.
---
Put Classic on a separate subscription to retail. Fuck the tourists. Classic isn't for them.
---
I wish I could be as vapid as you. Life would be so much simpler
---
In pvp a guy asks his friend to invite him as he is getting killed. Suddenly the guy dissapears cause of layering. Why can't you guys just accept that this shit show is what classic should be. Be creative. Form a group n farm lvl 6 boars as lvl 1 or something. Just do a quick Google search. Streamers are abusing the fuck out of this to steal the gurubashi treasure. Just no it isn't authentic. Having multiple servers and then merge as time goes on doesn't hurt a community at all.
---
This thread deserves many more downvotes than it got
---
These kind of topics should be auto-deleted.. plenty of class information available in this sub.
---
&gt; A layering system will not feel authentic because we will be logging in to new groups of people every day.
---
That's not entirely true. They will try to stick you and your guild to the same layer all the time and it's only when grouping with players from other layers that you may temporarily switch over to a different layer.
---
I don't know if that's how it works currently in the beta but that's how they want it to work by the time the game releases.
---
It's good, you just got no humor.
---
Dude, these numbers are just illustrative to show the problem. There will be a big falloff, the question is to what extent. You could see a large percentage of players not even make it out of the starting zones, let alone stick around for the slog to 60. Layering is the best solution to that problem and it will have very minimal, if any, impact after the hype dies down. Who would have better data than Blizzard?
---
If it were real life you would be re-trained to hold the weapon in your right hand and your shield in the left, as otherwise you would disrupt the formation you are fighting in.
---
Id go warlock personally
---
Why?
---
Warlock is a range class
---
Can be horde or alliance
---
High demand for pvp and pve
---
A high gear dependant class which i strongly encourage everyone's main be a gear dependant class since it will be the toon you mostly focus on playing and will be doing most of the content on.
---
Rogues and hunters are great and if thats youre callin go for it. But that dependability for gear makes a great motivator to progress your toon.
---
&gt;a hunter.
---
They said a lot of damage, not a little damage
---
If they want layering it should only be for 1 week max. Players won't reach 60 in that time unless they have absolutely no soul.
---
I feel you. I was 24 years old with a 1 year old daughter. I had been laid off with a full years pay.
---
Now I’m in financial sales, work 10+ hours a day, and have a 16 year old daughter getting ready to start visiting colleges.
---
I’m so excited to play again though. Life’s great, biggest problem is whether to roll rogue or lock, and alliance/horde. I played NE rogue in vanilla, and BElf lock in TBC. I’m super pumped. 
---
I can’t get into Fortnite, or even pubg or apex. I tried. This? I can’t wait, feels like yesterday

---
&gt; Who would have better data than Blizzard?
---
Probably no one, that doesn't make it accurate though. Hell they were never even going to do private servers if it wasn't for the backlash of closing down Nostalrius. This is the company that at every turn has underestimated how big of a thing Classic is. I don't see that trend stopping now, which is why they won't be prepared to handle the traffic without layering past what they state.
---
With layering they are opening a can of worms if they can't handle the traffic. At least if it was just server merges they could merge the low pop servers together once the hype dies down. With layering they are risking hurting the economy and community of every single server from the very start and past their initial timeline, which let's be honest Blizzard is awful with time lines.
---
Hah.. I guess that's fair
---
I heard that we won't be prepared for that when it hits.
---
You know you can set up a delay on a stream, right? Which is what poker and other streamers do without an issue.
---
I meant the models, for the horde, since rank 10 is indeed brown instead of purple. But for alliance there were differences as well, the rank 10 is more brown than yellow, and has blue sashes instead of white.
---
Who says that Classic won't just do that because retails become a subscription fremium MMO now?
---
This the kind of sly, bitter and cynical way we on this sub likes to greet new players interested in vanilla.
---
It's the only 100% speed unarmored Saber mount (Assuming we don't get the pre 1.4 unarmored Epic mounts in classic)

More very popular opinion.

In a game like wow

Stream sniping is pretty much unavoidable
---
Go to a pve sever like towelliee does hes a smart streamer
---
Oh ok I would check out r/buildapc r/buildmeapc for your new battle station. And the 1.12 client can be downloaded off of any private server website. Or torrented if you know how that works.

2. ???

3. Profit

Only time will tell, I really hope Blizzard rethinks this over since there are so many suggestions all over the place now I'm sure they can come to a proper solution that doesn't only involve completely ignoring and killing the original AV that's all.
---
Wow this just gave me the chills... I've never imagined what WoW: 2 could actually look like until now. Blizzard... You know you gotta do it...

I wouldnt waste anymore time with that idiot. Let him fail and put up inferior numbers while ruining his utility. He seems like the type to tell you that DS/Ruin is a shit tier spec.
---
Bullshit. He said he's doing it to get keybindings and stuff.  Threat, cds, gcd, etc. Yes, it's not the same but some of it carries over.
---
We'll all be getting long AVs here and there depending on the matchups even on the 1.12 version so you're kinda wrong there plus 1.5 AV isn't all about it being never ending there are other things to it.
---
Imagine an Anor Londo esque raid; a massive gothic cathedral... You fight through the chapels, halls, roofs and make your way to the main transept and altar to face off against the leader of the crusade
---
&gt;  Another thought that comes to mind when reading your post is that some of the things that you say would be lost in a merge may not exist in the first place on layered servers due to the immense size of the player base. What does your reputation matter in a pool of 20,000 players?
---
I think that the 20,000 player servers won't be a thing past launch.  *Maybe* we will have one or two that do manage that for one reason or another, but it won't be the norm in later phases by any means.  With that said, you can still get a reputation on a populated server.  I originally played on a lower population server, but had friends on a large population server.  Even there, there were guilds/people that had bad reputations that I was told to avoid when I was playing on that server.
---
While a larger population does decrease the impact a bad reputation can have, since there are more people that will be ignorant, word of mouth is a powerful thing that can segment the community away from those who have bad reputations.  However, word of mouth doesn't do well when you have different cliques, who formed on isolated servers, that don't interact very much once they merge.  This allows those with bad reputations a 'clean slate' of sorts.
---
&gt; How healthy will the economy be when the, say, 20 min-maxers who would have been spread across clusters are now grouped up to more efficiently game the layering system by hopping between layers, using knowledge of spawn timers and locations to completely control all of the black lotus / devilsaur leather for 20,000 people instead of being split up or even not present on some smaller servers in clusters.
---
This is a point that I will concede that I can be completely wrong on, but my view on it is pretty simple;  I don't think a group can control the market on multiple layers.  If they can't completely corner the market, then there will be competition that will push their extra supply down in price or they will have to horde that extra supply until after layering is done.  However, they will still need to offload that supply somewhere and the market will only bear so much.  They will have to either lower their price or they won't move their goods in the market.
---
Now, compare that to the alternative where multiple servers have had their markets cornered for an extended period of time.  They have either concentrated gold in a smaller number of people or they have excess stock that hasn't moved.  Once the merger hits, the server that had the lowest marked price now becomes the defacto 'current' price until their supply runs out, then it moves to the next lowest until it equalizes.
---
This creates a lot of turmoil in the market and can cause items that were affordable on one server to become completely unstable/unfeasible once the merge happens.  This can cause issues in guilds where an expectation of having a flask for every fight, even farm, was established, but it isn't reasonable anymore.  It also creates a rift where those who came from servers where gold was more abundant now have a huge advantage over those who came from a server where gold was a bit more scarce.
---
I experienced some of these effects when a server I was on was merged with another.  Some items skyrocketed in price while other plummeted due to over saturation.  Granted, this was in late WotLK/early Cata, but I don't see much reason to doubt that something similar would happen in Classic.
---
In fact if you happen to see someone camping Joana you should help
---
You're right. I didn't actually think of that one but the problem is caves are only accessible from the zone maps and none of them show that part of the continent. Hmm it might be a nice easter egg for the continent map.
---
The key point was there not being sharding, not that there should be 15k players on the same server.
---
Without all the shit from having a server with 20,000 people on it. He’s describing merging low pop servers. Not layering at all
---
I'd look into these:

I'm 28 and a MD on surgery residency and in a long term relationship. I am lucky because my gf made me book the vacation on the 12th of August (21 day vacay). So I'll go on a trip with her until the 27th and then booker a vacation for her and her girlfriends so I have full 7 days of self hatred and Redbull fueled grinding. I plan to get about 100h of gametime in those 7 days, no joke. After that my gametime will drastically reduce but still I'm pretty happy with my plan

To kill Joana you'd first have to be as fast as him !

Yes it is, which clearly is a mistake given this new information.

I like this idea. I can just quit whatever dungeon I'm in if it doesn't go my way and there'll be a batch of new players to play with.

Community is bred by needing each other. That's why Star Wars Galaxies is still considered the best MMO of all time.
---
I'm hard pressed to find better user experience than having your customers take a week off work at launch so they get stuck on queues or not able to progress beyond level 5 because they weren't able to get ahead of the pack in the first 30 minutes.

Perfect, most people don’t want to play with streamers anyway so it’s a win-win

The average WoW player age in 2006 was 28.

I'm torn between rogue and druid. I've always played gnome rogue. I love everything about the rogue and I'm really looking forward to questing in Dun Morogh.

But with druid I'd be able to heal, give buffs and still be able to stealth around.
---
Who said this was meme?
---
plenty of mages, rogues, druids, warlocks, priests, hunters wouldn't be participating in shield walls which I dont remember seeing a whole lot of in WoW
---
I think the best education is to play Warcraft 3 and the Frozen Throne expansion. You could play 1 and 2 if you really wanted to but I don't think it is too necessary with regard to Classic.
---
I know you mentioned reading but the original Warcraft games were the reason I got into World of Warcraft at all. The transition between playing through the world as each faction and then dropping yourself into that world as a single adventurer is a truly amazing experience.
---
If someone else has made a classic blue tracker, then put a link to that in the sidebar.

But most people watching them aren’t going to be raiding with them

If that's really your opinion you should go to a pserver and invest your time there, it's like classic has already launched for you, lucky!

27th August

&gt;will the expansions be re-released for it over time or will it just stay as classic for ever?

Classic only, for now, expansions are possible at some point.
---
Because there’s a live audience watching them get wrecked by random nobodies?
---
Thanks 😁
---
We need #nochanges to have a clean square one to build from, if we do want to do that.
---
I think the best thing to do is to "pretend" that Vanilla never finished and polish, refine, hone-in on what we know works and slowly add appropriate content (if we can achieve this somehow). 
---
Not take a 90 degree turn and replace, revolutionize and make things obsolete like TBC and other expansions did.
---
Is this a salt post or just low tier? I can't decide.
---
It's... A MMO*RPG*...
---
What’s with all these terrible memes lately? 
---
This is more like translating an old, well loved bible onto brand new pages with a new binding.

But it's still a consumable for all intents and purposes. When you use the mace it's consumed.... like a consumable. You will still need an actual "DPS weapon".

Right, but not any game with RPG in the title..

Shaman is definitely a better bet if you're looking for something between Shaman and Hunter.

You'll fill 5mans faster, you &amp; your mage duo should have almost no downtime, and your endgame is fun in both PvP &amp; PvE

NPC
---
You would have probably been wearing the weapon in your right hand as well in real life though. Not just because left-handedness was often seen as "evil", but also because knights back then (and sometimes also regular soldiers) had to train combat with both hands equally, in case their main hand or an arm would be crippled in combat, and they were forced to fight with their other hand.
---
Also you basically always want to wear the shield on the side on which your opponents weapon is (which is usually their right side), if you would wear a shield in your right hand and the weapon in your left, and your opponent would wear it the other way around, it would be much more difficult for you to block his attacks which would be coming from your left side (but the same could be said for your opponent having it harder to block yours).

Repost
---
I am absolutely not getting into a discussion about this. Sorry. I don’t care enough.
---
'Treated' by whom? If you actually believe streamers will get a personal Game Master to ban people they suspect of stream sniping, you are out of your mind.
---
If you're saying I can't ignore some dipshit corpse camping a 10 viewer streamer for hours because lulz internet fame fuck strimmers, you're out of your mind too.
---
You can't switch titles in vanilla.
---
Not really. Mechanics and play styles have changed so much in 14 years.
---
Okay, fine, I’ll add that they share the same keybinds. You got me there!
---
You bring up some good points. I'll only respond to a few, as I don't want to get into a long debate about a topic that has been discussed to death already.
---
&gt;No, it isn't.  When you merge servers, you  have multiple economies and guild structures that get combined.  With  layering, you have a shared economy and guilds are pulling from the same  pool of players from the start.
---
Arguably, layers have an even bigger impact on the economy of a server. A layer is roughly the same size of a old vanilla server, and one Classic server will presumably hold 3 layers (3k players per layer). All layers will share the same auction house, and players are able to hop between layers and trade with each others. However, each layer has it's own spawns for nodes, for mobs, etc. In the end, every Classic server is going to have x3 the (originally intended) amount of Black Lotuses, x3 the amount of Arcane Crystals, x3 the amount of Devilsaurs Leathers, x3 the amount of Broken Tooths for hunters to tame, you get the idea. And that's without even mentionning how exploitable layers are (you probably heard of layer hopping). 
---
When Classic launches, the first batch of people to hit 60 will have access to valuable ressources in abundance. They will stockpile those ressources up. And then, eventually, when Blizzard merges the layers, and those ressources become a lot rarer and expensive to obtain, you'll have a couple dozen players monopolizing the market for them, and driving the prices up. It will take a long time to stabilize. 
---
&gt; Because we haven't dealt with that since at least WoD and we have  technology that makes it an obsolete inconvenience.  Ques were one of  the biggest complaints in WoW until they were eliminated.  There is no  way, or good reason for, Blizz to bring back one of the most hated parts  of the game when they don't have to. 
---
If you don't think getting rid of layering would be a good reason to have queues, I don't know what would be. One could also argue that sharding was (still is) one of the biggest complaints about current WoW. And Blizzards want to implement a very similar tech to Classic (we've all seen the stress test streams where raids of opposite factions weren't able to fight each others because they were on different layers, ruining fun moments) 
---
&gt; Retail style dynamic respawns means you can increase your XP/hr by a significant amount.  This changes leveling metas 
---
This is true, and a valid point. We've seen this on private servers, mages can level way faster than they should be able to with AoE farming. On Classic servers, again, mages will be able to hop between layers to instantly respawn the mobs at whatever spot they're aoe farming at. Similar effect. It's harder to exploit layers that way though. 
---
&gt; Sadly, the 'tourists' have always been the main driving force of WoW.   Their sub money is just as valuable as yours, even if they only "log in  for 30 mins on launch day".  So catering to them, in the short term, is  worth it from a financial stand point. 
---
True, no arguments there. 
---
&gt; What long term effects are there? 
---
I already kind of answered that above. But I'll say something else. When Blizzard turns off layering, and there's still 9k people playing the same server, with no dynamic spawns, all competing for the same ressources, for the same quest items that take ages to respawn, when there's griefers 24/7 making it their duty to camp lowbies, to grief fresh 60s trying to obtain their prebis items (Tirion escort quest anyone?), what is Blizzard going to do? What's their solution going to be?  You take the risk of having an overpopulated server, with no way to really handle the situation, because you just disabled your solution.
---
Pre-raid BIS Weapons for Human Fury Warrior are Ironfoe + Felstriker, not Dal'rends.
---
For Alliance Furys the "Brigam Girdle" also is stronger than "Omokk's" because of Blessings.
---
Pre-Raid BIS Feet for Alliance Furys are "Bloodmail Boots"
---
Rest looks fine.
---
In vanilla I tried to camp people until they logged. Hopefully to roll on a different realm, or roll horde, or quit the game. I wanted my realm to be 100% horde, even if I knew it was impossible. Just doing my part, zug zug
---
You'll have 3-5 warlocks in a raid, probably more rogues. 
---
Warlock leveling experience is **way** better. You hit a minor power spike at 10 w/ VW and another in your early 20s, from then on you're just dot + drain farming 2+ mobs at once and can solo almost any elite quest.
---
16 debuffs matter a bit, but not a lot. In early MC you're just spamming shadowbolts while mages spam frostbolts. 
---
It's an easy spec to play in early raids, and you scale great. 
---
Haven't played a lot of rogue so nothing to chime in on there. :)
---
I dont care about balance, im 30 years old but i dont mind gaming every second of my free time in Classic.
---
That's amazing. Breathtaking as Keanu would say.

Does anyone know if that would look good on professional printed paper? I've never done it but this is absolutely beautiful and I am considering printing this to make it a nice picture to hang above my computer .
---
Imagine being a rogue and then publicly broadcasting your position
---
In all seriousness, i'm more excited if Burning Crusade servers will be announced at some point. Never played Vanilla, but started in BC, and that it obviously why BC is super nostalgic for me. Would love to relive that experience.

Lmao if u think esfand would cry about anything in game you've never watched him

Never seen someone give less shits but still have an intense passion

You should check out little Payo ofc
---
Companies pay thousands of dollars per hour for streamers to stream their game, here all it takes is a beta invite.
---
Seems like a good deal for Blizzard.
---
being on a different layer than most of your server is a surefire way of not fostering a community.
---
It really isn’t going to happen considering they don’t have a 1.5 client to revert to. They have 1.12. 
---
They’re not picking and choosing content from patches, they said that, too. It’s been discussed to death.
---
Can confirm, was adult, it took me 5 months to hit 60 in vanilla. and I was playing quite a bit in my eyes.
---
Absolutely. I played both but I’m more excited for BC returning. 😊😊
---
I remember going in the little alcove behind the front entrance as Alliance and having a little campfire there with friends, and I used to cast far sight to just people watch.
---
Thanks! Appreciate it.

In vanilla, the api for getting hp of mob target was protected. Should be in classic too imo

We may see him as the Lich King in the expansion after this.

Too bad mormon faith actually believes more than just the prophet saw them. sorry to bash your joke.
---
If I doubted Blizzard's ability to deliver a functional product as much as some of the no-layering crowd does I'd save the money, time and anguish and invest it on a private server already. Layering has bad side effects? Obviously. First weeks of vanilla would be ruined if they just launched as they did in 2004? Obviously. Now it's up to them to find a compromise that works, we're not paid to fix their game, actually, I plan to pay to play their game and have fun with friends. The hissy fit some people are having over the slightest of hiccups in classic (as if a MMO ever launched without shit that nolifers could exploit) is embarassing.
---
99% of people don't wanna sit in queues and fight for every single mob until level 40 when classic drops dude
---
🙄
---
You've got a very tanky healer, two debuff healers, and arguably the best PvP class in the game. 
---
Literally anything you play will work well with those. That said -- Mage is a strong choice (you lack magic damage) + great CC. Warlock is similarly good, with two very viable pets for debuffs/CC. Hunter would also probably do very well in this combo. 
---
Rogue could be good but I haven't played it enough to really chime in. 
---
I'd vote against Druid unless you want to go hard on WSG since you'd have an excellent support team for your flag running abilities.

tl;dr basically anything is great, I'd play Warlock because it's my fave class. After that I'd pick Mage and then Hunter.
---
As long as we can finally get the Bengal Tiger mount here :)
---
Look for Xrewz on youtube for a much better run.
---
Playing a ret pally in 1.x is reason enough tbh.
---
I'd be completely fine with it as long as it's a separate server and classic remains untouched.  I'd probably even have a few toons on each.
---
Can we take a moment to remember how long it took to get Classic remade and how long we bad to bare and take in everything Blizzard and their hoard of sheep were saying back then? Talking about the whole Classic wow files are long lost and were never backed up situation btw.
---
So I'd say it's worth a shot if you ask me
---
Couldn’t care less. As a left handed person.
---
LH for a 1x rate
---
If you love tanking, Warrior is absolutely rewarding. 
---
If you can play a warrior well you'll feel like a fucking hero in every 5man you do. 
---
Warlock is my favorite dps class, so you're not gonna go wrong there. Learning how to use Fear as a reliable CC in dungeons is great, and the leveling is **way** easier if you're playing solo.
---
&gt;Let us say they "fix" these constant exploits we are seeing on beta.  That would likely mean we'd have to go to a city or something to get to the right layer.  So someone who might be in tanaris (just as an odd example) would have to travel somewhere else with his friend, presumably outside the zone (a city is my guess) and then join into the same layer, THEN head back to tanaris.
---
Sounds like a decent solution. I mean, we're only talking about phase 1. City-only layer switching for a short time doesn't sound too bad if it combats most of the issues. Still can be exploited with warlock portals and more "complicated" setups, but better than the current one.
---
&gt; People can live with 2-3 days of overpopulation in the first couple zones...  
---
People always talk about the starting zone, but layering has only partially do with the starting zone. Yes it drastically helps the early leveling experience, but that's just a bonus. Blizzard wants to avoid server merges, and the population WILL drop. No questions asked. Tons of people will be fed up because they mistake the game for something it's not. If they have servers with a normal population, after the initial influx of players breaks up, many servers will be rather empty. Layering allows them to crank up server sizes that create one normal server after phase 1. Probably hard to get the numbers right, but that's their issue.
---
How about what they did during vanilla wow? Provide free server transfers from high pop to low pop servers
---
Considering I’m former LDS, this clearly shows how little understanding you have. 
---
Solid D- for effort.
---
I must say your Artist Rendering of Undercity looks not like I had the City in my Mind...
---
If there's that many people in all the layers and they're all low level there'll be no ore to mine anyways, also you'd just be getting behind the curve in questing.
---
Me and everyone i know prefer that to sharding or layering. Then make servers without sharding and layering and let the people who want to do that go there.
---
They share a lot more. It's like saying that if you become good at Quake none of it will carry to Counter Strike or whatever.
---
It's not really worth it, no. You're going to have a guild full of cloth-wearers that are all Alchemists. 
---
At the end of the day you do you.
---
still happy about classic but this layering shit is exactly what no one wanted 
---
i stopped playing mmos because of instancing, it started with eq1, then daoc introduced stupid ass instanced housing zones, then wow went full stupid about instancing.. 
---
instancing (IN ANY FORM) should not be in mmorpgs
---
Yeah I’m all for completing content that was originally intended but cut, I’m only against making shit up or adding xpacs. There was so much planned content like emerald dream that we still haven’t really seen
---
Nodes timers and mob respawn timers are core vanilla elements that shouldn't be touched at all.
---
If the bitch ugly dump her and play wow = profit
---
+Warlock
---
Sample size 
---
the large majority of people do not want to sit in a fucking queue to play a game bro , if you think people like watching a screen when they've been waiting for a release date for over 100 says you're either high or delusional
---
You and your friends don't have to play on layering but there's no chance blizz does what you suggested and says fuck it! Make everyone wait in the queues! 0% chance.
---
Vanilla dps hahaha viable any class imo as long as you got 40 you’ll breeze all content even without full resist gear looking back how retarded were people not knowing rotations and just going with what was said in forums
---
Has it been discussed with BC returning aswell? And if so, have they said anything regarding when and how?
---
a.) Sharding was justified in very similar ways a decade ago. I find that systems like this tend to sound much better with promises and optimism than they feel once you have to actually deal with the downsides. 
---
b.) How will you develop relationships with other players over the course of days if you are on different layers tomorrow? 
---
&gt;What if we just throw away layering?
---
I wonder if you're aware of the clustering option. This would be a cluster of servers (Dragontooth 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) which would each have a static and assigned population. Their only connection would be that player and guild names are unique and so, if/when they have to be merged, that issue would not be present. You'd play amongst the same 4,000 active players every time you log in. Never anybody else unless a merge is eventually needed. You'd be able to develop relationships with strangers because they would still be present on your server tomorrow. 
---
Best case: your server never needs merges and so you get the full, pure Vanilla experience. The initial 4,000 active (and probably 20,000 total) accounts remains stable as people leave and join at a rate that does not require a merge. 
---
Worst case: your server requires at least one merge with another troubled server and there is a period of upheaval as two server merge and players have to get used to new names, guilds, economic situations. Guilds will be especially hard hit as they recruit over players or as their players leave for better prospects.
---
&gt;Please continue trying to get Layering right, Blizz.
---
Thankfully you are here to ask them since otherwise they totally wouldn't try to get it right..
---
Mages will have no trouble finding raid slots. Assuming you play well and have decent gear you'll be just fine.
---
Not for Classic but this might interest you https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/btw-quests
---
I think a mountainous area would make more sense here and be more unique, there isn't any non-snowy mountain area in kalimdor in vanilla so that'd be nice
---
If theres 4 layers of players that need black lotus and 4 layers of black lotus respawning it seems that it'll be fine. I'd suggest trying to be that 1% rich player if you think it's that easy. Also, cliques controlling resources will happen with one or four layers. Interestingly it can even create a situation where there's fighting between the layers which sounds fun.
---
Its been more along the lines of "if the community wants it, then we'd be happy to"
---
It's partially subjective but mage is easier than hunter. You need to manage a lot more as a hunter.
---
Actual retard.
---
Posting rares will make them common tho.
---
So you can ruin dungeons for people in anvilmar 1 for months and the people from anvilmar 2 won't know you. Community.
---
Just to counter your anti-warlock thing. 
---
You can literally farm a shard every single mob you kill. If you're worried about farming shards I promise you -- it's not an issue. 
---
You can also store excess shards in your bank if you *really* hate farming pre-raid. 
---
I've mained a Warlock since classic and have literally never felt pressed to farm for shards, even when summoning 1/2 the raid to the instance.
---
Dude GET OUT OF MY HEAD
---
fr I been debating just sucking it up and hating 1-30 on horde and reaping the benefits of having responsive commrades rather than people who watch me die then also die lmaooo 
---
Alli starting zones are gorgeous and more immersive , I truly enjoy 1-30 on alliance.
---
 I hate durotar and I hate the barrens
---
I mean you just pulled 99% out of your ass so it's not like you have a larger sample, you just made it up. People wouldn't like it, sure. But it's a solution.
---
Saying it's not a solution because people don't like it is like me saying layering isn't a solution because i dont like it. I proposed an alternative that i prefer. Blizzard can easily make a handful of queued non-layered servers and everyone else can have fun phasing in and out while i sit in a queue for a week more when i've been waiting for this game for close to a decade. I got plenty of other shit to do anyways.
---
Hey, just wanna say props on these! I stared at the unfinished map for hours when I was younger, playing during Vanilla/TBC. I loved imagining what might be in store in the future. These maps are excellent! Exactly the kind of thing I’d have scribbled in my notebook in class high school when I should have been doing something more important, like sleeping. 
---
Keep it up! Still waiting on Gilneas!
---
&gt;Furries
---
 You mispelt cow
---
If you don't care about raiding: no.
---
Druid leveling is easier, and you have better AoE threat in dungeons.
---
I'm getting a divorce you fucking casuals.  Don't Re: me
---
Leave classic servers up and running and let us copy character to tbc for a fee and I'm all in. But I do not want to sell all my epic raiding gear after replacing it with green quest rewards again...
---
Practice w the other hand mane
---
Not play a gnome
---
UNPOPULAR OPINION: I like how you give a popular opinion but make it sound edgy by saying its unpopular.
---
Whether it's 1.5 or 1.12 most AV will still be zerged, now players figured out they don't have to fight in the middle, and go around each other,
---
Yes it may take longer, but long gone have the days of fightng in the middle for days.
---
And even if most did fight in the middle, there will still be a group of 5-10 capping towers.  On both sides, which will lead to the zerg then happening anyway.
---
I'd probably find it more hilarious to go with 3 beardy dwarves, with a a corresponding RP theme (obviously revolving around beer - can always add something like the Rhumsey beer consumables as part of their buffs).
---
&gt;Saying it's not a solution because people don't like it is like me saying layering isn't a solution because i dont like it.
---
Layering is a solution that makes less people upset? Sorry snowflake, that's hypocritical and discredits your entire line if reasoning.
---
https://github.com/fusionpit/ClassTrainerPlus
---
Awesome! Are you going to add dungeon maps?
---
I am the same with Orcs, every time I see their hunched back I want to put a back support brace on them it bugs me so damn much. I could never play Horde because of this. Trolls are the same.
---
Not sure what you've read but luckily there are actually 4 races per faction in Vanilla!
---
IF servers die then just let them die...... 
---
christ, everyone wants to find a solution for something that shouldn't have one since everquest introduced instancing.. 
---
only issue i see is server crashing with too much load in certain zones or something.. 
---
half the fun is pushing the server, it also causes blizzard to have to step up their servers, creating new tech for future..
---
this instancing, clustering, phasing, layering garbage is LAZY development and has been the bane of mmorpgs for the last 20 years starting with everquest.
---
Having the Epic Weapons version next to me, i can tell, this is super precise! Well done!
---
The dream!
---
I can't bring myself to play retail at this point. Every time I think about it, I remember how many flashy things will be on my screen telling me where to go or that something's on fire.
---
Warlock or Mage.
---
SPriest's will always have 1 raid slot (maybe more). 
---
Enh Shaman will also get at most 1 raid slot (totem twisting for Rogue/Warrior group). 
---
Warlock and Mage both do better dps than a spriest/shaman. 
---
1-59 grind is probably easiest as Warlock, with the added bonus of free 40 mount &amp; discounted 60 mount. 
---
None of them are bad to level. 
---
If you really want to heal as a side-gig then I'd suggest Priest. They do better 5man heals while still "raid specced"
---
I found some footage of the blood pools on the ground i'm talking about [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H\_clXVF-v4o&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_clXVF-v4o&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=68) you can clearly see some bloodstains under the dinosaur so I'm sure i didnt make this up
---
Undead hunchback fine with you though?
---
Yeah, obviously. But I'll still get grouped with other gnomes
---
Literally anything based on your post lol.
---
If you want to melee DPS go Warrior (since you also like tanking).
---
No because my entire point is that it isn't a problem. That's what i just said. Or at least that the problem is preferable to the 'solution'.
---
You're just saying layering makes fewer people upset, you don't actually know that. In the long term i think layering will make more people upset.
---
IIRC it was the column to the right of the entrance of the bank.
---
I remember playing on a pserver and watching a nelf hunter shadowmeld and wait for me to die to an undead rogue. He then tried to steal baghthera while I was dead. I came back to see him dead so I can only assume the rogue got him too.
---
Right. I’ve had beta since it opened and I’m only level 18. I was absolutely thrilled when classic was announced then reality hit and I realized I’m not a teen anymore. With working a lot and raising a family I’m lucky to play a couple hours a week.
---
And do you really want to wait 2-3 hours to loot a quest mob?
---
I did read till the end.
---
Saying "I'm not attacking you" change nothing of your attitude. I can call you arrogant pr\*ck but if "I mean no offence" nothing happened right?
---
 "you were probably the person it was directed at so maybe you should pay attention". Now I can tell you are an arrogant pr\*ick, no offence.
---
There's a difference between sharding and layering, but I know you want something to get angry over so let's just ignore that.
---
They've definitively said layering will be removed before phase 2, that is not vague at all.
---
This is a beta. I'm going to contain my /r/classicwow outrage until I see the finished product. I know it's difficult, but treating a beta like a beta will make your life a lot easier.
---
Yes, I do. They know how detrimental it is and they've said a thousand times it won't be there for AQ or anything passed phase 1. They haven't said "when it makes sense" since doing the beta interviews. You're constructing a narrative where you can be pissed off and wear your tinfoil hat with pride. I'm looking forward to seeing layering removed and all you tinfoil hats be utterly humiliated.
---
With this you could never know which hand a dual-wielding opponent is carrying its MH. It wouldn't be a major thing but it can be an important pvp aspect for some people.
---
Even as a Hordie, I must admit Ironforge is the best!
---
There are none... except someone with a Key. back in 2005 i went there as a level 56 Rogue for the first time, we cleared everything and i got Serverfirst Felstriker! :D
---
The Dungeon is Pisseasy for todays Standarts
---
if it's that much of a problem google 'wow modding models', and change gnomes to something else. It's technically against ToS but they never banned anyone in vanilla for it (afaik). Though I wouldn't risk it by changing the files to get an advantage (like seeing from further, bigger mining nodes etc.).
---
I was a very dominant right hand, until I started heavily practicing guitar. I'm ambidextrous now to a certain degree. In other words, I think its possible to strengthen your weak hand and brain hemosphere
---
If she doesn't mind beach novel grade reading then the War of the Ancients trilogy was pretty enjoyable for me.
---
Go Horde so you can kill them and feed your carnage
---
It's slight so it doesn't bug me THAT much and at least they look cool with bony parts showing and rotten flesh.
---
But yeah, I cannot stand most of the Horde aesthetically.
---
I think most of the community would agree to classic expansions of Azeroth filling the blank areas if the new content did not offer any new items or loot-tables for current high-end items.
---
Upvoted for structure, despite not coming to the same conclusions. Now:
---
I heavily disagree with your assessment that layering will help with overcrowded zones, or that this is the primary reason it is implemented. Since layers are supposed to hold populations comparable to a vanilla server (let's just say, 3k concurrent players max), starting zones will be just as overrun as they would be on a regular server with a regular population cap.
---
What layers allow, however, is an internal redistribution of players. So when in reality concurrent player numbers drop from, say, 30k -&gt; 8k over the first six weeks, while playing it will seem like a constant population of around 5k (6 layers at launch, 2 layers after six weeks).
---
Now, they could change layer limits for the starting weeks to cover overcrowding also. Make a layer only hold 500 players before opening a new one. I hope we can agree that this would only be a crappy way to implement sharding, and opens up MASSIVE abuse potential with possibly 20+ layers existing for the first week.
---
Personally, I would prefer regular servers with regular population caps, with server merges during the first weeks to counter population drop-off. If servers are pooled from the start, naming conflicts can be entirely avoided while not restricting naming possibilities more than a multi-layer server would. If merges happen early, negative community effects are low, since you'll be seeing new people and new guilds all the time, anyway. On the other hand, there is always the possibility to not merge, if the populations turn out to be more stable than expected. I very much doubt Blizzard would attempt to SPLIT a multi-layered server that turned out too big to remove layering after p1.
---
Humans are best for later pve due to higher spirit. Dwarf fear ward is great but also a bit overhyped, a raid odd only gonna need a couple. More doesn't hurt, but also human spirit..
---
Just realized how stupid most hordes look, although the troll hunch doesn’t bother me it’s part of their.... charm.
---
Good thing I’m rolling Tauren Druid.
---
You did seem to care enough up until this point, coward response from your side here.
---
See a therapist.
---
It really just boils down to what you actually want to be doing in the game. 
---
In raids as a Druid you are a healer, so if thats not cool for you, maybe not Druid.
---
Druids in PvP don't play anything like a Rogue, except for maybe a stealth opener. Druids just don't have the burst damage that rogues have.  They have versatility, but basically all the really cool shit Warriors and Rogues have, Druids don't.
---
Basically I'm just saying Druids don't play anything like a Rogue, despite having similar abilities. They're fun, I like them. But there are tons of people who get a Druid to around 30 and find themselves disappointed.
---
Thanks man
---
Since either way you're rolling against other clothies: ignore that con.
---
Since you like healing -- Priest sounds like a good fit. 
---
Since you dislike respeccing -- Warlock sounds like a good fit. 
---
If you're leveling with a buddy (esp a Warrior) I'd go Priest -- you'll instantly fill out dungeon groups, you'll crush in wPvP &amp; bg PvP. 
---
If you're more on the DPS end of things -- warlocks start off "good" and become great later on. Soul shards don't matter idk why everyone is so hung up on that thing. 
---
If you get the chance / have the time, I'd suggest leveling a warlock to ~25 or 30 on a private server. Since you're experienced as a priest it might give you a better understanding of the class and help shift you one way or another. 
---
I'd personally tell you to play Warlock but I'm a guy who leveled 2 locks to 60 (Alliance &amp; Horde) before playing anything else on Classic, and continued to main one into BFA. 
---
GL with the choice! Both classes are awesome.
---
Absolutely stunning 😱
---
As a future gnome warlock, I hope to God we meet on the same server.
---
No layering.   Either do clusters (seperate layers that you are stuck on that get merged at phase 2) or only layer the starting areas.
---
That was my plan at first but my friends are going Alliance. Tough choice
---
6 months? lol. On private realms, fairly common to see people waiting 1-3 years for new content. For instance, 1+ year farming nothing but BWL while waiting for AQ.
---
Mormons know less FACTS about their religion than most people outside the church.
---
Boars are pretty decent, as they will eat literally anything and that charge is quite useful ability. Unless we talk about unnerfed Lupos, most pets are going to perform so close to each other that its NOT worth it running far away just to tame a lets say OWL. Just pick whats available, since you need to get new skills and pets later on anyways.
---
Looking to blow off steam: Mage is by far an easier thing to do after a long day. You've got a few buttons to press every fight and you also make food &amp; water for your buddies. 
---
Rogue is a bit more attention-focused, but once you get down your rotations/combos it's similarly easy to play in PvE content.
---
Holy shit
---
Let’s discuss another item you brought up: threat. 
---
Paladins in retail have a taunt and a ranged pull. Paladins in Classic have neither. Retail will not prepare him for this. 
---
Another, Sunder Armor. Warriors in retail no longer have this ability, which is one of the most important Protection Warrior abilities for Classic. 
---
Your logic works in the extreme general. What you’ve learned in Quake carries over to Counter-Strike in that in both games you use a keyboard and mouse to point your gun at your opponent and kill them. If you’re going to go that *general*, then sure, retail prepares him for how an mmo would work.
---
But if you’re going to fo specific, as I did, regarding class development over 14 years, then no, retail won’t really help him.
---
I made a thread about modding since I'm curious how acceptable it is today.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0hol8/how_likely_is_one_to_get_banned_for_changing_the/
---
Nope. Too much of a grind.
---
Do you have a PvE or PvP focus?
---
Seriously forget about thunderfury. Can't overstate this enough. It's not expansions, where everyone gets their share. This weapon is not going to be easy to get. And it's not down to luck whatsoever. Before your luck is tested for drops, you need 40 people supporting your goal.
---
I despise troll hunters, I still play horde. I have a /spit macro just for them that I can use when I see one. Makes me feel better.
---
Truth. 
---
I even stayed arms all the way up to Twin Emps, where I specced fury.
---
Once again, my world turned upside down.
---
I got rekt i pvp though after the respecc, so it didn't last that long, heh.
---
conspiracy theory? They invited streamer to the beta to promote classic, that's basic marketing.
---
40-man Prince, *shudders*
---
Tried that, didn't help
---
What's wrong with troll hunters though?
---
Yeh, it wont prepare you for the exact same spells but it will prepare you about the concept of threat.
---
I mained a priest first then switched to hunter. Do you think none of my priest experience carried over because the spells were completely different?
---
Don't level holy. 
---
Shadow spec just makes you do more damage without really sacrificing any survival. 
---
Shadow just helps you level faster. You can still heal perfectly fine in any dungeon up to the first raids in Classic.
---
Roleplay your character's hatred for gnomes. You'll be server famous.
---
Why would I have to spend much time with searching groups? Shouldn't that be the easiest part since tanks are much more uncommon than dps builds ?
---
Sorry to break your dream but you would probably be lvl 2 by the time you get into mulgore
---
Classic Vanilla.
---
yes I know that this is hard to accomplish but I reckon that it would be way easier to get the 40 people supporting me if I am main tank on that guild than if I am just a random rogue of many
---
Thanks for the info!
---
There's already a pinned thread about class choice but I'd say go mage.
---
 I love how you agree with me and then tell me I’m wrong in the same reply. Have a good night.
---
Thank you all for answering! :)
---
Some other random useless information:
---
- His armory profile is also available https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/chromaggus/crushim
---
- He seems to have not played BFA but was still playing in Legion
---
- Since the guild transferred to Boulderfist, it would seem the 50 DKP Minus was too much for him to up sticks and follow the guild
---
I'll do that for sure. Wouldn't even be roleplaying lol
---
Why does blizzard have to PROOF to you anything ? You are getting 1.12 AV, accept it or just choose not to play.
---
Aoe grinding with layering, here I come
---
Paladins suck and Alliance leveling is way better lore wise
---
No clue. It’s a risk I don’t think is worth it. 
---
But it’s your account, not mine.
---
Because
---
Where do you even see the word wrong, I thought we were just clarifying HOW much carries over. Not everyone is out to get you..
---
Isn't this exactly how layering is supposed to work? If you group up, you go to the same layer. We've know that since they announced layering. Why are we freaking out now?
---
Or I can not accept it and choose to play Classic anyway because 1.12 AV is going to stop me from enjoying the game, or is that not possible then? I'm only voicing my opinion here and I'm not trying to trigger anyone that's not my intention.
---
Thanks, you found this legend.
---
How does that work? You only spend time with your wife/kids on the weekend? I can understand working till 6 and then gaming from 7 to 1-2 at night - I've done that for almost 10 years. But when you add a family to that equation - I just can't picture it. I don't have a kid, and my gf is planning on playing with me - and still I think I'll be limited to 2-3 hours on workdays.
---
It's okay. Thanks for replying. \^.\^
---
You should be happy your dirty, sinister leftism is sanctioned in society at all, you're little better than a ginger!
---
Back in the early days of my playing career. I was doing my warlock quest in durotar. I was killing the burning blade orcs with ease when I got a random invite from a troll hunter. I accepted and said the quest is this way, the troll hunter said no this way... so I obliged and began clearing the bottom part of the cave. 
---
We were chain pulling mobs and I grabbed a few extra because we were making short work of them. It was then I noticed the hunter wasn’t doing anything and in fact he had left the group and was beelining straight to a chest that had just spawned. He left me to die in that cave after stealing the chest. What’s more the back spawns camped me for 30 minutes as I tried to escape that blasted cave. 
---
It was on that day in 2005 I swore an oath... To /spit on any troll hunter I seen. I am a man of my word.
---
A lot of things are a risk. if the risk is about as high as the risk of getting hit by a car, I'd take it. If the risk is about as high as getting ganked then I wouldn't.
---
I remember seeing that guild around :)
---
added it to the guild list
---
I wonder if that's because they don't get deleted.
---
I'm not joining this subs anti layering circle jerk, That's all.  Y'all motherfuckers are acting like layering is a permanent thing
---
I’m cool with the vanilla model as long as they fix her doing the nelf bouncy idle anim. Always threw me off
---
Minus 50 DKP to you!
---
Warlock is v good in PvP.
---
Druids who want to offtank will gain capital as the phases occur. And they're fantastic in 5mans (as a dps I prefer a druid tank in a 5man -- as a healer I prefer a warrior). 
---
If you're looking to consistently raid as either a Warlock or a Druid Tank -- odds are you'll have better luck as a warlock. That said, if you can find a guild that's committed to a druid off-tank then you'll get there, but you'll need a group that understands the value of gearing an offtank druid from the get-go. :)

**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed Naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
**Raiding plans**: For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We are running two competitive raid teams both lead by experienced leadership and tanked by experienced main tanks.  
---
**Loot System**:  We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient).  The loot council is focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We expect competence and literacy with computers, google spread sheets, balancing individual schedules, and team communication.  We expect effort during, before, and after raids.  We expect serious practice on a guild hosted test server.  
---
We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
**In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.**
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  
---
We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops and early nights where possible. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**Current Activity**:  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We use the test raids for providing feedback, polishing raid skills, and determining and bolstering roster weakness.  
---
Currently, a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  We also have guild jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up my assistant GM on **discord:  XvK#7740**
---
The less social can also fill out an application on our Website [https://www.epochofthought.com](https://www.epochofthought.com)  
---
You can also jump on our discord at [https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT](https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT

This is like some weird and kind of silly mini-study on how racist attitudes form.
---
Play a warlock and drop an inferno in Coldridge Valley every now and then. That should kick the urge for a small while. That or play a priest and 'conveniently' duel Gnomes exclusively near cliffs and other large falls. Trade Gnomes and put 1000G in the trade window. Then say you have a phone call and go afk. See how long they wait before they realise they're getting trolled. Summon Gnomes in the middle of the Deeprun Tram.  
---
I dunno, man. Gnomish racism aside, there's plenty you can do to your allies worse than ganking. Can't promise you'll be popular, though.
---
Farming soul shards isn't as big of a deal as anyone in any thread on classicwow has made it out to be.
---
I don't get it
---
Tanking dungeons for randoms is always a solid choice, you meet new ppl and also have the chance to recruit some for your guild when they had fun! 
---
Well common start life with randoms is you get the first orb as tank
---
Crossroads?
---
Yes! I tried in vanilla but gave up cuz i started too late and TBC was shadowing in the horizon.
---
Now i have all the time in the world.
---
I barely played BC and I played a lot of vanilla but BC is so much more balanced and improved that I'd still prefer it.
---
I totally disagree with all the hate on retail and i think you can actually prepare a bit. Obviously its not the same, different spells, quests etc but its still the same game. If you're shit at retail you'll be shit at classic anyway. And if you're good at classic you may still be shit at retail, thats probably the main difference. Retail is a way faster game. Raid mechanics are complicated and hard and there is a lot of personal responsibility in mythic raids.  Classic is mostly about patience. Carelessly pull 3 mobs and you're usually dead. The gameplay is different but the core is still wow.
---
Yeah a rogue would never get a TF before a Main/Offtank.
---
Tank (and tryhard) if you wanna get TF. 
---
Rogue if you wanna dps all the bois and don't have a dedicated healer for PvP (Paladin or Priest buddy would make life awesome there).
---
Damn, that's brutal. I can see why you have a hatred for troll hunters now haha. This trauma hasn't left you after 15 years
---
This here is someone who doesn't remember that getting the bindings could take you years.
---
Because people in a cult are good at critical thinking and fact checking, lol.
---
Yep. Would much rather prefer this.
---
you're right, [i](https://itemization.info/item/12554)t seems some database have wrong values, i updated the website with The face of Death, thank you !
---
Play a gnome warrior?
---
Play Warrior. 
---
Your group will murder anything, and you can tank dungeons.
---
&gt; I heavily disagree with your assessment that layering will help with overcrowded zones, or that this is the primary reason it is implemented. Since layers are supposed to hold populations comparable to a vanilla server (let's just say, 5k concurrent players max), starting zones will be just as overrun as they would be on a regular server with a regular population cap.
---
&gt; Now, they could change layer limits for the starting weeks to cover overcrowding also. Make a layer only hold 500 players before opening a new one. I hope we can agree that this would only be a crappy way to implement sharding, and opens up MASSIVE abuse potential with possibly 20+ layers existing for the first week.
---
Yes, it depends on the exact implementation chosen.
---
I don't think their intention is to create smaller layers for the initial day or two, but you could still have a mitigation of start zones with full-server layering.
---
First of all, if you did standard traditional servers, you'd probably want to let their populations be 5000-6000 to attempt *some* mitigation of tourists leaving. But with full-server layering you could stick with 3000-3500, and so get a ~40% reduction in starting zone population without technically making changes.
---
Additionally, if you were feeling fancy with your implementation, you could still do full-server layers, but load-balance the starter zones. So a layer would still be ~3500 total, but if you make a human and the human zone is crazily packed you get put on layer 2 before layer 1 has ~3500 people on it.
---
So the demographics on the layers are different to the true demographics of races created, but the starter zones are mitigated.
---
Poly is S+ tier in dungeons. 
---
You'll never have a hard time finding a group as a mage.
---
Play on TP realm and refuse grouping with them, kick them from your groups and when you pass one of them do /spit
---
Yes that's what they'll do if servers are still overpopulated after layering is removed. 
---
Layering is there to make sure servers don't become UNDERpopulated. We don't want 500 servers with 300 people online each if we can have 50 servers with 3000 people online each.
---
*The numbers provided in this post are examples and are not intended to reflect any kind of real situation.*
---
I'm pretty sure the move speed increase was added in TBC or later. So I don't think it should be there in classic (I mean, I woludn't mind it but I don't think they'll include it if it wasn't there in vanilla?).
---
Roll a human female priest. Acquire robes of insight and black mageweave pants. Swallow your disgust and group with multiple gnomes. Become friendly. Foster virtual relationships. Have a broken mic. Acquire gold for epic mount. Arrange to meet IRL. Don't show up.
---
When confronted, come clean with the truth about your feelings for filthy dirty gnomes and the deviants who play them.
---
Really your only option.
---
Wow that fantastic. Great job!! I play alliance, gnomes and dwarves. While I do my leveling in Elwynn forest/Sentinel Hill/Redridge areas my hearth is always set in IF 😊😊😊
---
Thanks, those are actually some very useful tips. This should make playing on Alliance a little more bearable. Wouldn't you get banned for summoning an infernal in Coldridge though?
---
OP: How do I beat druid as mage?  
---
You: WAH WAH WAH THIS SUB SUCKS FUCKING IDIOTS!  
---
I feel like you may be projecting a wee bit. Stop going on this sub, dude. If not for us, for yourself.
---
Deactivate cheat mode than, also known as stop streaming. No? Then deslo with it.
---
Play Priest. You'll be in high demand for PvE, your leveling isn't bad, endgame you'll be in massive demand. If you're playing with buddies they'll love you.
---
Still looking for a guild? Think you might be a great fit for our newly formed guild - DM me
---
I’m pretty sure modifying models and textures hasn’t worked for awhile in retail WoW, and since Classic is built on the BfA engine I’d imagine you won’t be able to there as well.
---
Regardless, a GM would definitely be able to detect modified game files so I’d highly advise against it. As to whether or not you’d be banned, nobody but Blizzard could give you the answer.
---
I don't think anyone wants every single server to be dead. That would be the worst thing that could happen to the game, people would just go back to private servers.
---
interesting point, i guess we will have to see how it work on beta and see if it's correcly fixed before the launch
---
I think that is my favourite part about Classic. I actually like retail enough, but I have limited time compared to when I played Vanilla, and everything feels like catching up, and then there's a new patch/expansion. In Classic I know I can take all the time I want. Don't really care if it takes me 8 months to hit 60. just taking the time and enjoying the game :)
---
Play a gnome, knowing just how angry you're making every horde every time you kill them
---
I wonder which race they would add to alliance
---
I actually have no idea. Only one way to find out!
---
Did it come with a [Z-shirt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80oHMSruQFs)?
---
Why don’t you roll a Dwarf?
---
Entire vanilla was about crap looking gear which was also the best item for you to use.
---
Example, this is the BiS weapon for tanking druids:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=943
---
Just look at that basic staff lol
---
How about layering the starting and the following zones only? You can't exploit it anymore as soon as you leave the Barrens and by then, the pack should have been spread a quite a bit
---
it's something that people have already asked and it will be possible only if i add a way to show alternative BiS for each slot, but i note the request !
---
Best rare was Takk the Leaper the black raptor that could run at full mount speed until he was nerfed :(
---
Still looking for a guild? Think you might be a great fit for our guild - hit me up on discord @ Arrexis#1397
---
Are we talking walking on the high way or standing in the Arizona desert? And again are we talking questing in Stanglethorn on a PvP realm or sitting in a sanctuary?
---
I think people expect that they will be to be ret paladins since there are a handful of streamers doing it.. I feel bad for them because if you weren't healing you were either the ooc rez or just spamming pally power half the time
---
Jokes on you im a 26 year old loser. After jamba juice im playing wow adios!
---
Man it would be way cooler if this wasn't the 5th time this was posted.
---
Bird up.
---
Gnome.
---
I honestly couldn’t tell you. It comes down to how often Blizzard checks for altered assets. I doubt anyone could definitively tell you. I would not be surprised at all if it were not public knowledge, deliberately.
---
A tropical beach / djungle kinda zone at the southern end of EK with a neutral goblin town, containing trolls, naga, pirates, wild beasts and venture co enemies. This does sound familiar.   
---
In all seriousness, one of the reasons WoW zones are cool is because they have so many different themes. Even the similar themes (e.g. Elwynn, Ungoro, Ashenvale, Felwood) all have their unique identities. There are some exceptions of course, most notably the Plaguelands. But those should stay exceptions.
---
I like your attitude!
---
What is this heresy
---
Geez, coming in here dropping them thruthbombs on the poor kid
---
So how much better is dual than 2h?
---
Pretty much this, it happened without streams, it will happen with streams. Streamers shouldn't role on PvP servers if they have no desire in participating in PvP.
---
Ok so I read up on the bug and it doesn't work at all in wsg, or if your pet is attacking.
---
My mind was on "Gnome Eaters", but yeah I'll definitely do this
---
&gt;adding alternatives to BiS items (huge amont of work to do this one, but this is the most asked feature by far)
---
it's on my todo list :  adding alternatives to BiS items (huge amont of work to do this one, but this is the most asked feature by far)
---
What an a achievement! Congrats
---
&gt; How will you develop relationships with other players over the course of days if you log into different dimensions tomorrow?
---
Add them as a friend.
---
Or, depending on implementation, if you play at similar times and level at a similar pace, statistically you'd have a high chance of being on the same layer all the time.
---
&gt; I wonder if you're aware of the Cluster option. This would be a cluster of servers (Dragontooth 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) which would each have a static and assigned population. Their only connection would be that player and guild names are unique and so, if/when they have to be merged, name issues would not be present. You'd play amongst the same 4,000 active players every time you log in. Never anybody else unless a merge is eventually needed. You'd be able to develop relationships with strangers because they would still be present on your server tomorrow.
---
&gt; Best case: your server never needs merges and so you get the full, pure Vanilla experience. The initial 4,000 active (and probably 20,000 total) accounts remains stable as people leave and join at a rate that does not require a merge.
---
&gt; Worst case: your server requires at least one merge with another troubled server and there is a period of upheaval as two server merge and players have to get used to new names, guilds, economic situations. Some guilds will be hit as they recruit over players or as their players leave for better prospects.
---
Yes this is another option, but I'd argue it's a kind of clunky halfway-house.
---
It's trying to emulate some of the concepts of layering without doing it, and has +'s and -'s as a result.
---
There's still the aspect of FOMO if you're not on "server name-1", and the potential weirdness/clunkyness of when the different parts of the cluster get merged, and in what order.
---
2 and 4 could get merged, to form "A", and then later 1 and 3 get merged to form "B". And then it could be a year before "A" and "B" are merged, if ever.
---
Perhaps it could be the better overall option if it was guaranteed to merge them all at phase 2, and so you just made your choice based on your friends/guild (because remember layering will be removed at phase 2).
---
And then this essentially becomes the same as layering, if the layers were completely immovable.
---
Thanks. If it's completely impossible in retail then they likely crack down on it. I was hoping for e.g. people posting if they've done it in recent years and whether they got banned or not but if it's not even doable anymore..
---
Warlock.
---
Scales excellently in PvE. 
---
Great in PvP. 
---
Excellent flavor. 
---
Summons make doing dungeons 12-60 so much fucking better. 
---
Death Coil is literally the best spell in the game and you learn it at 42.
---
Man I loved Cataclysm launch heroics. I ran dozens before half my guild even got to level 85.
---
I mean, it happens in retail.
---
This is the only reasonable solution, thank you
---
Seconded! I want this map!
---
You can train yourself to the point it only matters when using full strength.
---
I’m about 80-90% competent with my left hand now and can play table tennis, throw, use a mouse etc just fine. 
---
I did train it when I was a young teenager though, don’t know how much effort an adult has to do
---
Just take your upvote and leave
---
I'll still be playing with gnomes mate
---
Did you even wait 24 hours before reposting this?
---
If they are using Manual Crowd Pummelers they won't gain anything. If they are not using Manual Crowd Pummelers then yes it'll be a big upgrade.
---
Probably one of the best legendaries in the games history for sure. 
---
Would also hopefully open the door for a raid where you can obtain Doomhammer
---
That would make sense, undeads don't really fit in original horde orcs+taurens+trolls
---
🤣🤣
---
It's a reference to another highly discussed post titled "Please don't do layering, Blizz."
---
This is 10.000 times more exciting than going forward into Burning Crusade! Would love if they went this rout instead.
---
Very likely.
---
I always think of doing the same but then i remember gnomes, night elfs and dwarves exist... just the thought of regularly looking at them in disgust is enough to stop me playing alliance
---
You're right that more discussion is needed. 
---
For me the number one factor which will determine the success of vanilla is the extent to which it can foster meaningful relationships. Layering presents a threat to this goal in a number of ways. For that reason I'm opposed to it in favor of pre announced clusters.
---
I'll still get grouped with them m8
---
Correct on GMT/UTC +2 (SAST/CAT)
---
Hey, I was that guy! Fuck you!
---
Why are your graphics setting that low?
---
so you would need a healer in PvP and wPvP if you want to go warri and dont die all the time? phew thats rough. 
---
Yeah I might have to flip a coin when the game releases, I technically like tanking in retail and back in wotlk, but I havent played classic ever (started tbc) so dunno how the tanking is there
---
Warlock PvE spec will absolutely work in PvP and is viable basically forever.  (note: maybe not optimal, but competitive).   
---
Mages will need to respec for PvP
---
&gt; And there's probably a not insignificant chance that Blizzard doesn't want Classic to be too successful and displace retail. Something like that could potentially do that.
---
Nice tinfoilhat
---
The main issue with layering is that it breaks immersion and the social aspect of wow.   If there is a point on the map, a person should be able to go there and occupy that space.   That makes it a real area of the world.   When there are multiple different versions of that same area on a server, it no longer feels like a real place.
---
As far as the social aspect, the reason why layering is a problem is that seeing the same people out in the world over and over develops a server community.   You begin to know players on your server just by seeing them all the time and you form an opinion on them.   These relationships can be positive or negative - just the fact that they exist makes the game feel like it matters more and your actions feel more fun.   If you need proof of this, you can look at the beta and see how you start to know some of the people just due to the small server and no cross realm or layering.
---
Anyways, with layering you will lose those things I mentioned or they will be watered down.   I believe steps should be taken to look for alternatives that do not damage the health of the game as much.   So far suggestions I've heard are - clusters(fixed layers that merge after phase 1, no cross layer chat/jumping), layering only till level 20, open more servers, server merges, and just letting people sit in queue.
---
Obviously not all solutions would be popular, but it would be in the best interest of the game to take one of the solutions and try to find a good middle ground to minimize layering's impact as much as possible.
---
As someone who played on PVE servers this statement holds no weight what so ever. Yet it gets parroted by everyone who thinks PvP servers and players are the only one in the gane
---
This is one of the best things I have ever seen on the internet.
---
You are forgetting that in most cases ps players can't choose what type of server to play on. A huge chunk of Alliance players will end up on PVE and RP servers.
---
you are right about the shield, it's fixed !
---
About the CTS, it is only for human because of weapon skill racial
---
For all the others points, i need look a bit more before i can say
---
Just level Enhancement so you don't lose your mind.
---
Thank you for understanding the technology and why it's there. That being said, you'll probably get down voted into oblivion because a large portion of the community don't want to understand, they just want private server type megaservers.
---
Layering is more #nochanges than megaservers since layering will at least be removed after a while and don't require them do redesign the entire world to accommodate 5 times the intended population.
---
No, it was about him saying if pservers can handle 15k pop then Blizzard should be able to aswell.
---
&gt; I heavily disagree with your assessment that layering will help with overcrowded zones, or that this is the primary reason it is implemented.
---
No the primary reason is to prevent every single server being completely dead after the tourists leave.
---
Aq bug family boots?
---
Yeah I know they have stuns in bear but not reliable stuns and interupts in cat like a rogue has. I'm actually thinking of leaving more towards rogue the more I think about it and look up their abilities. So much more utility with druids in general but rogues have so much more combat utility.
---
In terms of gear (apart from weapons) I'm gessing a feral druid and a rogue with the exact same items, the rogue would have higher dps? Combine that with more combat utility and seems like a no brainer to go rogue if I'm only going to be doing pvp
---
there is not new raid between phase 1 and 2, so it was easier this way, for most class they would have very few changes between raid phase 1 and raid phase 2 BiS
---
Mage.
---
Probably naga or pandaren - Alliance needs a "beast" race. High elves would be cool though
---
Oh sure, next you'll say we can play as Death Knights that come with their own mounts and runeblades.
---
People mainly don't use garrisons for much anymore because they're kinda remote and not really useful for much. It was a real problem in WoD as they were bound up in the economy in a big way but that was as much to do with WoD having a bit of a dearth of anything interesting to do at max level outside of raid logging once a week.
---
Legion threw most of it out and stuck your 'player housing' equivalent be something you share with your whole class which honestly felt pretty good.
---
it's fixed :)
---
That's odd? I dont remember thunderbluff looking like that?
---
I like this solution a lot better.
---
yeah, adding a TPS version is on the todo list
---
They would compete in BWL and onwards with enough practice but Molten Core world first is going to come from a guild putting in multiple 24 hour+ sessions with people who have practiced speedleveling to 60 many times. Of course, the main thing stopping Method from doing this is that they don't have anywhere close to 20 people who want to raid classic hardcore, let alone 40.
---
Ferals will suck in phase 1, and they'll suck in phase 5.
---
People who say otherwise are full of wishful thinking and confirmation bias.
---
Play as a gnome.. feed off that hatred and become an unstoppable force
---
The synergy with Warlock &amp; Warrior is that if you add a Priest or Paladin to that duo they become a murder-trio. 
---
Other than that, not much, but Warlock+Warrior+Priest is paving a highway to murder.
---
Friends don't make their friends play Alliance.
---
Troll post. You called them "Bliz" twice.
---
pingaan just added all those specs on his spreadsheets, i'll wait a bit and add them too when they are ready
---
Thank you. the amount of "soul shard farming is a negative for me" posts in this sub is ridiculous lol
---
Did not know about the Ancient Egg, will be doing that at the same time, thanks!
---
Not sure I see your point here? You'll still be with the same people you started with, there will just be new people as well. Your reputation isn't going to vanish just because your server population went up.
---
Retail, obviously.
---
Your spec is kinda good for duels. For Allround pvp &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 0-31-20
---
Crowed pummeler is BIS for feral dps
---
soon :)
---
Fuuuuuuuuck that, I loved that mount but I can’t even imagine justifying that grind.
---
Reeeeeeeee
---
post
---
This is a repost mate.
---
I’d say it’s more of a reflection upon my anecdotal evidence to suggest they type of person who plays troll hunter is more likely to perform unscrupulous deeds in order to secure a tangible gain within the game world, than say my inclination to dislike a particular race based solely on my own sense of my race’s superiority.
---
It’s obvious the former is correct considering I made no mention of the race as a whole and only mentioned the troll hunter. I have no problem with troll Mages, priests, rouges, shamans warriors or even troll axe throwers, sure their methods of combat are primitive, there is no denying their effectiveness in the second war, not to mention Zul’Jin is quite a colourful character and represented the troll race quite well while he was alive. 
---
No my problems lay with troll hunters only, this is not bigotry.
---
Now I want it
---
It's the Streisand effect too - the more they bitch about being sniped the more it will happen.
---
\-\_-
---
Nothing to stop people chatting on Discord
---
This is the type of content I wouldn't mind being added to the game.
---
Not necessarily, but a dedicated healer to a warrior in bg-PvP basically turns both players into murderbots. 
---
If a normal warrior's power level is a 7/10 in BGs, when paired with a skilled healer they turn into a 12/10.
---
You got bamboozled.
---
I will carry this dishonour always. If you decide to play alliance on the 27th be sure to slay many troll hunters, you will have my pledge that I will return this favour 10 fold with the withered husks of gnomes.
---
You will be prepared. I need to start preparing for release as well.
---
Exactly why I brought it here for u guys 😎🤘
---
Game of Thrones reference
---
Ahhh yes, sweet gloves.
---
"Vanilla, no, we will not let you go!"
---
A large number of people on this board seem to inaccurately think that layering will make the starting zones leveling easier for them. It will only make it harder though because each layer needs to be fully maxed out before another is made, not only that, it is continent wide so you are still going to have thousands and thousands of people jammed into those zones with or without layering.
---
So, we are reposting on a day to day basis now?
---
Are we THAT bored on this sub?
---
yeah they are from aq ... !? ;)
---
thanks, i will discuss this and update
---
I am excited to get a transmog system so I don't look like a clown.
---
Oh, wait, there won't be transmog for no reason at all.
---
Your memories of battlegrounds are inaccurate.
---
9 out of 10 BG matches are not played by people who are excited to be there. They're filled with people who are "honor farming." Which mostly means trying to move from one game to the next, as fast as possible. They don't really care about winning or losing, they care about honor. 
---
Sometimes that means players AFKing at a base you already control.  Sometimes it means racing the other side in AV because you'd rather lose in 11 minutes than win in 40. Eventually, a lot of the players feel they *have* to be there for their honor grind.  None of this makes for "fun" game play.
---
What's that stuff at the bottom
---
I honestly wish they eliminated the proc effect from underleveled weapons once you’re outside the level range. It’s absolutely insane that the a Druid would have to farm *bags* full of a level 30 weapon. 
---
It’s why I’m not going to stay feral once I hit 60. I don’t care that much about topping DPS charts to farm a gray boss over and over and over for a drop with 3 charges before it’s garbage.
---
Done with my rant.

We wish we will, but we won't
---
I prefer playing rocket league on pc with my ps4 controller, runs much smoother.
---
I'm mostly interested in the PvP perspective. 1 Druid is mandatory for Warsong Gulch and arguably Arathi was well, and non-ferals or hybrid specs also profit from FAP.
---
Well yeah I mean if we are talking about how vanilla played out, most people picked their race based off of looks alone and only priests really considered racials. Just because people made poor choices in 2004 doesn’t mean they will in 2019
---
the dwarf /lol is by far the best one, it's so satisfyingly cheeky
---
Consider it done. I will slay many troll hunters in your name, and when I'm done slaughtering them I will piss your initials on their mangled remains.
---
The same people that don't want to fight over Mobs will leave Vanilla after 2 Weeks.
---
Hopefully not in PvP. I did really well with the blue rank 10 PvP set and The Unstoppable Force, even against T2+ opponents. I wonder how powerful my feral would have been with a FAP weapon and the epic set.
---
The people who are mentioning the currency version aren't mentioning that said change removed ranks. So that can't be the version you're talking about unless you are conflating memory of owning the gear with memory of owning the rank.
---
If you weren't of the top players on your faction, you quite simply did not get rank 14. You need to get at least 12000RP (even in patch 1.12) to offset the decay from rank 13-14. Which means you had to be bracket 1. The only way you got that with four hours a day would be if you had the least populated and most PvP lazy faction in vanilla history.
---
Once you have "enough" stam it becomes a nearly useless stat, and raids are not balanced around all tanks having the tauren racial. Damage is always damage.

Thanks for your reply.
---
So S3 weapons, it's CTS for humans, Crul'Shorukh for others. I still don't quite understand why it's the axe for non-orcs instead of Spineshatter, when in all the other itemization it is Defense over anything else. Fur humans, weapon skill applies to CTS and Spineshatter both, so that point still stands.
---
Thanks! I thought about leveling as resto/ele as we want to get ahead of the pack and aoe-level (maybe abuse layering). 
---
When raiding I wanted to go enhancement (Nightfall) which I know isn't the best DPS but being one of the first lvl 60s we want to farm devilsaur leather and become rich so we can just relax the first couple of months. As enhancement shaman I also do not need raidsets and can save my DKP for trinkets, rings etc. :D
---
It could still help, depending on implementation.
---
See [my other comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0hh1r/please_continue_trying_to_get_layering_right_blizz/er4opss/).
---
Cats &amp; Raptors do the most DPS (+10%).  A raptor also has more Armor (+3%). 
---
If your Alliance, the earliest you can get a raptor is the wetlands at lvl 22, or run to Durotar and you can get them from level 2-3.  But you can get Cats easily. 
---
A Boar is good, as it does Charge, and stuns the target for 1sec, and gets extra attack power on next attack.  
---
Owls are brilliant for Screech, but you can only get them in Teldrassil early, or not till Felwood at level 48-50.
---
I was in college when Vanilla hit, and started playing in early 2007 right after BC. I had no idea what I was doing, and it took me 7 months to reach 70. Now, I’m a better player with a better idea of how the game is played so I can be more efficient, so I think it will even out.
---
I wasn’t going to bother replying, but you just couldn’t help yourself and had to edit your post to be even more insulting. Makes it easier to report you for 1. Posting a religious themed meme (a pretty terrible one at that), and then 2. A further terrible attempt at insulting me.
---
Bravo.
---
Right! That will show them!
---
&gt; Layering is more #nochanges than megaservers since layering will at least be removed after a while and don't require them do redesign the entire world to accommodate 5 times the intended population.
---
Yes, this is an important note.
---
Though, to be fair, I'm not seeing much (any?) calls for megaservers.
---
So far the most popular suggested alternative seems to be clusters. Which is kind of like if you did layering but with completely fixed/immovable layers.
---
&gt;It allows for less severs (by name)
---
Yeah I don't like severs.
---
What I took from this post:

Found time to be in one of the Top 2 Raiding Guilds from P-Server N -&gt; LH getting Server Firsts and still go out to eat with Friends on a Saturday night.
---
The Trick is: Hardcore-Guilds use up way less of your Time! MC+BWL were cleared in 50 mins for both before that you did AQ40 for 2 hours and that was a wrap for the Week up to Naxx. With preparation like getting Worldbuffs and Consums i'd say 5 hours for Raiding + prep per Week.
---
Of course at Launch it consums way more time, thats why i took 2 Weeks of to get the lvling and Pre-BIS'ing out of the way.
---
 Archivist Cape is 20% droprate from what i see, i agree that it would be hard to get the shadow wrath version. From my point of view it's different to have an item that have a decent droprate but random stats that a very rare item (like ironfoe), but again, i made a choice
---
I’m completely entitled to make a comment without inviting further discussion. It was just that. A comment. 
---
I simply didn’t have the time or patience to get into it. *shrug*
---
Shorter than the average question in the "what should I play" thread.
---
Teach us master.
---
Good stuff, I'm doing this with Teldrassil and am about 95minutes. It isn't possible though if there are other players. Even one player will mess up the rotation, so under life circumstances it will be much , much more.
---
Seems that way, unlikly that somebody would be top .3% of their server in RP earned for like 12 weeks straight and totally forget about it.
---
You won't be hitting things. In WSG, you'll be running for your life 24/7. Your damage is about as important as the color of your bears ass. 
---
In AB, I'd assign you to stealth-protect stables/farm. In that role, you would basically be concerned solely about surviability and stalling for help.
---
and about the Kazzak pants, it's because to get the 3 part T2 bonus, i use the T2 pants until bloodvine (if you look shadow priest, the pants is used)
---
Oh, i liked this one a lot. Where you extended STV.
---
I did not like the one with the Tram, between SW and Ironforge. Didnt appeal to me for some reason.
---
Doesn't sound like a fact, any sources? Did blizzard say they didn't expect the players to use the buffs they implemented into raid content?
---
There are more clowns in BFA as a result of wonky rainbow Transmogs. 
---
Transmogrification is cool on paper but in practice it'a bad for MMOs because it takes away the visual queue that someone is really poweful and it is reflected in their gear.
---
You start running if you see a High Warlord Orc Warrior coming your way. 
---
With transmog you wouldn't know how dangerous that Orc is until your head is rolling on the floor essentially.
---
Its just made up sh1t and its styleish to hate gnomes.
---
just saw the talent "surefooted". Will it stack with the orcs stun resist? That would be heavy.
---
I mean...I get that people like you are shortsighted...but there were a gazillion threads about WHY layering kinda have to be in Classic, at least for launch period.
---
Didn't you understood, by now, that any other option will be much more detrimental to the game? Or you simply cannot see this?
---
&gt;  I'd much rather have instability or lag rather 
---
Well, that pretty much settles it . I was right. You are shortsighted, if you can only see server instability and lag. What you FAIL to see is dead realms, if there is no layering. Because without layering, almost all realms, bar streamer ones will be dead without layering. 
---
Maybe, instead of whining, you propose an alternative solution to layering. How about this for a change?
---
Yes you can but it will be hard to learn skills since there's no paladin trainer there.
---
Is 1.12 AV, where they introduced Resources which when hit 0 game was over?
---
&gt; The main issue with layering is that it breaks immersion and the social aspect of wow. If there is a point on the map, a person should be able to go there and occupy that space. That makes it a real area of the world. When there are multiple different versions of that same area on a server, it no longer feels like a real place.
---
It will within your continuous layer though.
---
The tradeoff is about population health, and of course remember it's supposed to be a very short-lived thing.
---
&gt; As far as the social aspect, the reason why layering is a problem is that seeing the same people out in the world over and over develops a server community. You begin to know players on your server just by seeing them all the time and you form an opinion on them. These relationships can be positive or negative - just the fact that they exist makes the game feel like it matters more and your actions feel more fun. If you need proof of this, you can look at the beta and see how you start to know some of the people just due to the small server and no cross realm or layering.
---
&gt; With layering you will lose those things I mentioned or they will be watered down. I believe steps should be taken to look for alternatives that do not damage the health of the game as much. So far suggestions I've heard are - clusters(fixed layers that merge after phase 1, no cross layer chat/jumping), layering only till level 20, open more servers, server merges, and just letting people sit in queue.
---
&gt; Obviously not all solutions would be popular, but it would be in the best interest of the game to take one of the alternatives and try to find a good middle ground to minimize layering's impact as much as possible.
---
Yes, it's all +'s and -'s. Though I think some options are clearly worse than others.
---
I originally expected/wanted layering only in the first couple of zones (i.e. up to level 20 or so, as you say). And I think this would be among the best solutions. But since they haven't mentioned it at all, I assume it's not possible for some reason.
---
From the discussion here so far, I think perhaps clusters which are guaranteed to merge by phase 2 could be the best overall realistic option.
---
As this is essentially the same as layering, but with fixed/immovable layers for as long as they're needed, and avoids all of the potential exploit-ability of layering. Obviously along with a couple of other +'s and -'s.
---
yeah I've been looking at some suggestions, this was only a first draft I threw together in an hour, if I were taking it more seriously I defo would have implemented a demon influence and created a "thick jungle on top of the hills" and "thick swamp on the lowland"
---
Shinier!
---
Yes you can
---
I think it should be a completely separate server and everyone should have to level from 1. Leave all the expansions silo'd off from each other.
---
Oh snap. That was quick! Where would the nearest pally station be?
---
i really do hope Blizzard fully rides the re-release waves  
---
Don't like the new? Play the old! Don't like the old? Play the new! Hotel? Trivago!
---
&gt;1.12 AV is all about rushing everything just like what this current state of the game has become sadly because Blizzard tried to make it appeal to everyone by making it "easier"
---
I'm fairly sure [pserver I can't mention because of the rules] had a non-1.12 AV and everyone still just rushed the whole thing. The issue is less to do with the difficulty (unless you make it impossible to rush) and more to do with all the leiutenants, captains and towers giving bonus honor. So you get massive honour even on a loss and you are in turn incentivised to just ignore the other faction because fighting them literally slows your honor/hr.
---
I think you'll be in a small minority there.
---
Sharding is one of the main things (if not ***the*** main thing) which killed off the community aspect of Retail.
---
Big if true
---
I would say warlock also.
---
No need positioning that much, just send in minion dot+dot+fear+ wand or whatever.
---
It’s not Humar, I’m pretty sure you mean the Rake somewhere in the Mulgore area. I remember rerolling on a new realm as a dwarf hunter and joining some random guild and an officer being nice enough to escort me grabbing one. I think we saw the pink ostrich too and he kept asking if I was sure I didn’t want to tame it instead.
---
I killed plenty of people as flag carry in WSG. Feral Charge -&gt; Maul -&gt; Shift -&gt; Humanoid Auto Attack for instance can easily do enough damage to finish off a wounded mage. Also won plenty of 1v1 or 1v2 on stables; fights that would presumably have been over more quickly with a FAP weapon...
---
Mate if you like playing computer games, fucking play them. I'm sure your wife enjoys trashy reality TV shows etc.
---
just put a delay on your stream of like 20-30 seconds and you dont have to deal with it
---
if you stay on one spot for more than 20-30 seconds, you are considered a camper anyways
---
there is a stage description on the website :)
---
Phase 2 pre-raid is every dungeons (including dire maul) but without any raid drop (or world boss drop)
---
Humar is like level ~24. Rake was the fastest if I’m not mistaken, and level 10.

ZG was put onto the PTR after BWL wasn't and the devs hated how buggy it was. All raids after that were PTR tested.
---
it's not for PvP, it's for PvE so we don't care about not wearing mail.
---
&gt; Let there be queues 
---
Oh, no, no, no. You aren't go away with this that easy. HOW LONG would those queues be? 5 minutes? or 5 hours?
---
You do understand the difference between 5 min and 5 hours...right?
---
So...how many realms should Blizzard release to have what is considered today and acceptable queue, which should be under 10 minutes ? 
---
&gt;  When people leave after a week, a month, whatever, 
---
Well, have you ever estimated in your lil' brain HOW many people will leave in a week? Or a month? Or is is easier to just say "whatever" and avoid the actual issue?
---
&gt; There we go. I prefer that x100 to layering or sharding. 
---
You are in a very small minority. Problem is that you see Classic as being designed for YOU, instead for MILLIONS. Problem is that people like you don't THINK. Problem is that people like you put their personal interest before game's sustainability long term.
---
You just want your toy, fuck everyone else...right?
---
For paladins yes, the warrior sets are different in colour.
---
titanic leggings will not be out until ph 5; lionheart will be out as soon as the recipe drops on your server from ragnaros, onyxia, or a world boss :)
---
Obligatory TBC hate comment coming through
---
Reminder that TBC
---
- Started the cycle of making all previous content obsolete every expansion (and to a degree, every patch)
---
- Added flying mounts
---
- Introduced esports PvP with a focus on MOBA-like instanced combat with separate gear and balance for PvP
---
- Added daily quests
---
- Ruined professions by making high-end profession items BoP and making them require the profession to use, as well as adding the first personal profession buffs/enchants (ring enchants)
---
- Removed attunements (yes, it had them at launch, but they were mostly removed in literally the first patch with only the T6 attunement remaining)
---
- Added welfare epics and badge systems
---
- Started the trend of putting all high-level characters in their own hubworld full of convenient permanent portals, separate from the players who haven't reached expansion content yet
---
- Started the endless vertical gear power creep where your character grows proportionally more powerful in the last 10 levels than it did in the 40 levels preceding those
---
Releasing Classic TBC servers will do nothing but splinter the Classic community while ensuring that the movement never becomes anything more than a short-term nostalgia trip, because TBC permanently set WoW on the path of no return that turned it into what it is today.
---
I think that's fair, layering can help to mitigate overcrowding at launch, especially if layers are designed to be in the 2k corner of the spectrum, rather than 5-6k.
---
By biggest concern is what will happen when the time comes to turn off layering, and a handful of servers still hold a huge population. I imagine servers of guilds like &lt;Method&gt; won't experience the population drop-off that layering is designed for, since many people will reroll there as soon as spots open up, as people did in the past.
---
So if that server starts at 30k and ends at 20k instead of 6k, what will happen? Again, I don't think Blizzard would forcibly split a server, ever.
---
Pretty much the same as before  a little less since i have a girlfriend with whom i live with. Work is not a problem. I have a full time job but thats not really that different from scholl. Working 20h a day tho? There is not enough money in the world to make me do that, maybe if it was like once every year.
---
Never played with Alliance, but I bet it's in Ironforge and Stormwind only.
---
Yeah just as soon as we get demon hunters lol I mean that's clearly a rogue one the box cover.
---
You definitely can play only PvP, or PvE for a few weeks and then PvP only.
---
If you dont care about gearing fast a fun thing to do is to gear out while leveling and play a lot at level 49 to get some PvP items - you'll be one of the strongest so even if the grind is longer you'll be having more fun PvP. Then once you farm rank 10 you can level to 60 and have gear already.
---
Pugs will clear mc/zg/ony in about 1-2 hours here and there, not all 3 obviously in 2 hours but you can raid in vanilla as a casual, its not 2005 where people think 2 mechanics is hard.
---
Thanks for that info. I knew it was a good idea to ask. Maybe I'll level up to darkshore then make my way back reluctantly 😂
---
Its illegal
---
People pugged everything up to c’thun daily on private servers
---
I think they did it right before tbc because tbc’s BM would’ve been all over the place with the old unique system.
---
I am sorry for offending you with a funny meme and facts about reality.
---
Stick to BFA.
---
Yes, I remember waiting in the wue for the PTR for hours.
---
I was very young then, and my paladin was 50ish. Played a Hunter on PTR i think they had the 0.5 set? Well fell in love, never startet to lbl one, because it took me ages to even hit 50 with my paladin.
---
Well when classic hits, im gonna lvl the sht out of a Hunter. Can't wait.
---
I'm in if someone figures out the logistics.
---
How is honor ranking below 60?
---
I saw this live from the other perspective yesterday.
---
It was amazing to see how these coordinated world PvP stream vs stream things were happening.
---
Just keybind the separate ranks and use your brain to heal, makes the game more fun.
---
Then we feel the hatred of 10000 years :)
---
Can you a solution that Blizzard will actually accept it?
---
These "solutions" are dumb.
---
I give you an example of such a "solution".
---
Fire the entire Classic team, rehire the team that designed Vanilla, and give us proper Vanilla-like Classic.
---
I am SURE that this would be WONDERFUL, right?
---
Thing is...it's not going to be possible.
---
So, how about a REAL SOLUTION, one that Blizzard will actually implement?
---
You seem to be indifferent towards whether this is a good or bad thing. However, I don't see your point because we are talking about a game feature you never really experienced and which was lost during vanilla. That would be similar to having pve content in the game which was suddenly removed e.g. raids. I don't think you even understand how big thing world pvp was, and how that suddenly became nonexistent with TBC.
---
Pvp isn't just one type of player encounter, and even when all those experiences weren't necessarily fun, they gave a contrast to the game world. Certain areas like Tarren Mill or Stranglethorn vale invoke a lot more emotions if you have played on a pvp realms compared to pve.
---
Thats the whole point of the article
---
Also even if a tank has 70% hp you might want to precast a big heal if you know he is about to get hit hard in the next 2~ seconds for example
---
This - but I reckon one solution could be to have one or two servers without layering, and all the people who doesn't want layering and the cancer of competing for all quest-items can have that.
---
&gt; So if that server starts at 30k and ends at 20k instead of 6k, what will happen? Again, I don't think Blizzard would forcibly split a server, ever.
---
This is a potential concern, but I think there is some wiggle-room there.
---
Firstly the servers with hold onto a massive population by the planned time of phase 2 would in theory be a high-% dedicated players. And these players probably wouldn't mind queues too much.
---
Secondly, particularly if there were a number of servers like this, they could delay their planned launch of phase 2 by a small amount, say 2-3 weeks. Just to let a touch more natural precipitation occur, and make the queues a bit more bearable.
---
And we haven't been given hard dates, so we wouldn't even know this decision was made in the background.
---
It is a real solution. One that gets Blizzard money from the people who actually want Classic. It also benefits from not shitting up the servers by having to cater to retail tourists who are gonna fuck off before they ever get a mount.
---
Love the guy yelling "TRACK HUMANOID AND HIDDEN BOIS".
---
Regarding the "track herb, track mineral" debate on where the icon should be placed. The icon should, in this version, be placed at the minimap and not as a buff.  
---
Proven by the patch 0.11 patchnotes:  
---
" Icon that indicates what you are tracking (Herbs, Minerals, Undead, etc) is now part of the mini-map. "
---
Nah thanks, think my i5 750 will be fine.
---
Why would you want an addon that takes away your ability to apply your own skill and judgement to healing situations?????
---
Im not sure if i want to play priest or hunter, please convince me to play hunter
---
I turned 10 in 2004. I had a bed time, i had home work, i had sport, i had extra circular activities, i had to share a computer with my family and i had a certain amount of time i was allowed to play the game.
---
My wow/life balance is much for favourable than it was as a kid. You can imagine how my heart broke that when i finally got control of my life and the current expansion was cataclysm.
---
The article is not saying that addons are too strong, it says the opposite.
---
Should consider adding Drop locations :)
---
You don't need the [exist] conditional there and depending on how the rest of your macro is written, this might still skip Charge and cast Enrage if you have a target that is dead, this is why you were advised to use [nodead]
---
As soon as my 2 year old goes to sleep, i’ll go to Azeroth. Hopefully he will be able to join me by the time blizzard releases TBC again.
---
None of the players in wow are soldiers tho, all lone adventurers
---
Heavily restrict hops. Players can commit. I can play on the layer that has my friends. Perhaps allow swaps like once a day.
---
If we can’t see or speak with people from other layers, we will not have a reason to group with them.
---
It only applies to friends that you half-asses coordinating to play on the same server with.
---
If Blizz does it right, then being on each other’s friends list should mean you get on the same layer automatically. The same way guildies should be on the same layer.
---
It sounds like that is not possible, but if done initially then you will not join a guild from another layer or add people from another layer because you never interacted with them.
---
Not to derail this too hard, but why the fuck would anyone thank No Man Sky?  Didn't they have the worst launch in video game history?  I remember thinking that guy was going to jail for false advertising or something.
---
Anyway sounds cool.
---
I think you may be. Layering is worse than sharding.
---
Personally I'm going to be playing a little bit of private server, and a lot of f1 2018/19 as soon as I get my desk set up
---
no because you can enchant 2x +15 agi with dalrends swords
---
it is on the todo list
---
Retail classic will allow addons like questie. They're just being remade to be able to use the API.
---
react.js, first time i use it (it was like a fun training for me at first), the website is pretty easy to build, the hard part is having the correct data that make everyone agree !
---
Hmm, well minor upgrade. I guess all these bis lists going to make all hunters and theyr mothers Rolling on swords before warr and rogues
---
this guy leatherworks
---
Classic is a social game and it will not feel Grundy. Fortnite is a completly different genre
---
This is the first I've heard this specific idea, and I find it extremely interesting. I love the BC's content itself (class balance and the attunement system especially), but I'd love for it to be implemented without making the original 2 continents obsolete. Your idea not only does that, but also offers a new method of playing. Shame it's so buried in the comments - probably deserves its own topic.
---
I'm going to be playing a gnome mage. Your going to really hate me. But what's really great, is the fact it will make Zero fucking difference. So who gives a fuck. Just play the game if you want to.
---
Haven't seen this joke posted before /s
---
This is a great vid. Shows how quickly folk can get to level 10. 
---
My plan on release is to get my main to level 10, then get an alt to level 5 and ran to Org as a bank alt/DEer of greens.  Should be able to do both on the 1st night.
---
Really it went that far? Jail for jebaiting people?
---
Eyyyyyyy sea shanty
---
What's your rationale?
---
This shit makes me want to do something I’ve never done in 12 odd years of playing WoW on and off... start a dwarf character
---
This makes for a completely different experience than the "original" TBC experience - the vast majority of the playerbase didn't reroll on a fresh server in TBC, they took their vanilla characters to Outland.
---
Personally the thing I'm most excited for with official Blizzard "classic" servers is that the godawful private server fresh meme will finally die.
---
&gt;Shroud of Dominion
---
good point
---
Such lies, what race class were u. Prove it
---
Layering is the entire server being seperated.
---
Sharding is zones being seperated.
---
Layering is a global form of sharding.
---
You're the one who wrote a huge post about this shit.
---
I think the easiest solution is just 1-20 layering and nothing else.   I also agree clusters WOULD work and be fine, they just would be a bit awkward in practice but would functionally produce a vanilla experience.  If I had my own choice, I'd just make huge servers and let everyone on it.  I've experienced it before and it can be pretty painful but also very fun.  Population could drop and still be fine - just lower the cap after phase 1.
---
The reason I'm against layering is mostly that phase 1 is a long time.   If the entire world is layered, for months, it can really kill the hype a lot.   The most fun classic will ever be will be at launch.  If layering is removed after the excitement is gone it kind of sucks.
---
No because the headline is a questionto which the answer can be yes or no.
---
Wow what a bunch of dweebs
---
I disagree. Compare the WoW models of Thrall and Sylvanas with their WC3 models. Sylvanas doesn't look a lot like her WC3 frozen throne appearance, while Thrall is very consistent with it.
---
Imagine farming frost saber or getting baron mount and getting banned for something so pointless.  Wouldn't even consider it.
---
They're going to crack down on people making herbs bright pink or super large and whatever game advantage edits people will try to get away with.  Would suck to be bundled in with those clowns.
---
have fun!
---
Nope, this karma whore needs to be judged ASAP.
---
Classic Ironforge - with Original Taste!
---
At 40-49 you get 57% of CP from bgs  compared to 60 but you'll win more so probably something like 30 to 40% slower to grind. Yo are capped to rank 9 on 49 so I guess you can grind rank 9 on 49, grind a bit more to rank 10 on 59 and basically never PvP while being one of the weaker characters at the cost of it taking longer.

We can literally stock up on more than a thousand Black Lotuses in that time if Blizzard allows us to swap layers at will.
---
To put that into perspective, a thousand Black Lotuses cover 40 flasks for 25 raids.
---
I’m in the exact same boat!!! Maybe we can discuss.
---
Hunter pros: Great at pvp, awesome solo levellers, high skill cap, only a few needed in raids which can feel like “the chosen one”, you use all tier sets, good gold farming
---
Priest pros: Always needed in raids, pvp is fun for gimmecky things like MC,also uses most tier sets, benediction, raid healing is awesome.
---
Can someone help me with a list of cons, I’m only looking at the good sides
---
Addons cannot decide which spell to cast.
---
The only way a single button can cast different spells given different scenarios is with the (relatively) limited macro conditionals.
---
You have cute pet and can solo the game, also dwarf hunter is in the cinematic
---
Because for some people having 80% success rate is better than having 75% for a bit then getting better and pushing it to 95%
---
(Numbers pulled out of my ass to illustrate a point)
---
Well if we also want real truth, you wouldn't use a shield with plate armor because plate was really immune to everything but black powder. 
---
The elite soldiers were clad in plate wielding halberds. Maille was used with shields and weapons, though.
---
Hence why we die so much.
---
Surprised that you don't mind Troll males. I sometimes wonder if they are about to run on all fours or not. :3
---
I have never played vanilla and I am picking Hunter. I want to heal, but I am just not sure if I will be able to reach level 60 as a priest.
---
Healbot and addons like it will not work in classic. Blizzard has changed the api to prevent it.
---
A more complex question: Will ranged/meele-weaving be a possible thing in Vanilla?
---
Is there any existing Data on that from Pservers/the beta?
---
No. Let him dream.
---
Also awesome starting zone!
---
Sure, I will stick to something that is boring after two weeks because I dislike how ugly most classic items are. Makes sense.
---
Fuckin hell who gives plebbit gold to an effortless cross post lmao
---
You need to keep in mind that Blizzard need to see a return of ivestement or else they'll just gut The project
---
I love wow, it's the only game I've been playing for the last 15yrs but I'm willing to let them try something especially at launch.
---
Sure you can always pre-queue, but still isn't practical for most of us.
---
no
---
Blizzard just banned a bunch of people for doing this a few months ago, I wouldn't attempt it.
---
I really want to roll a hunter, they're the most fun class in the open world and pvp for me. The only thing that worries me is how difficult it will be getting groups at 60.
---
Delirious
---
Halberds didn't really become the main fighting weapon until almost the reneissance.
---
I'd recommend looking up what skills you will learn at what level and only ever going back if you deem it worth it.
---
Another thing to consider: AFAIK you have to do your class quest in the starting area if your race, so make sure to come back to elwynn to learn how to resurrect.
---
Nah...
---
There're classes that aren't *very* gear-dependant, and can outplay raid geared chars, especially if there's some skill gap. Me think hunter and maybe druid and shadow priest.
---
Also, with 2 hours a day you'll have some okay-ish rank pieces.
---
What items are you going to transmog your ugly classic items into, when your source of transmog is literally other classic items. You are pretty mad about playing dress up mate.
---
And end up with massive faction imbalance? And a total mess up of the community? And the public image that "Classic is dead"?
---
Have you also considered HOW LONG time will pass until free transfers would be a solution? Those low pop servers won't be low pop overnight. What will those player do in those months? Unsub? Stay in Org and waiting 12 hours for a tank? 
---
Seriously, stop coming with dumb solutions that were in Vanilla. Do you even KNOW when free transfers were implemented in Vanilla?   It was in patch 1.11 for god sake ! 
---
If YOU are on one of those dead realms...tell me, would you WAIT for a year for a free transfer? Nope, YOU WILL not. You will not realize that your realm is dead for MONTHS ! You will already be lvl 60 and invested in your realm.
---
Seriously people...THINK before coming up with "solutions".
---
Hunter cons:
---
A lot of fiddly management with ammo, pet happiness and aspect changing. Effectively have 1 bag less than everyone else ( bar warlocks). 
---
Priest cons:
---
Can be expensive if you need to respec a lot at 60 between raid and grinding (easier if you go hybrid spec and don't get caught :) ), high priest population, struggles with multiple mobs
---
Why? Every class takes a long time. Eventually you will reach it, it just takes time
---
So just nerf feral tryhards is what you're suggesting?
---
If you know how to pull and trap, hunters are highly desirable
---
"Jebaiting" or how it's called in the real world: "Fraud".
---
Yeah they just did a huge ban wave of people who were doing just that.  It was just a couple months ago in April.  They banned thousands of players including some streamers.  Most were simply modifying there characters appearances that only they could see from their computer.  Harmless.  But it only takes a few to ruin it for everyone.  For example some were changing the textures of the nodes to glow bright or make them really big so they can spot them easier.
---
I am probably the minority. But I actually don't want this.. 
---
Personally I hope it stays vanilla. I don't mind special servers for TBC later, I just don't want to be on one. 
---
I would actually much rather have them create new content by finishing unused zones, like Hyjal.  Perhaps even karazhan, but I fear blizzard is very likely to take the easy route. 
---
I just really don't want flying in the game. The initial implementation of flying was to alleviate some technical issues with fly paths.
---
But this is Activision Blizzard, so.. easy money.. TBC will happen, gg. I am honestly happy for those who want that, but I am not gonna be playing by that time I think.
---
I have read about "layering up to level 20" a few times now, but never really understood what it means or how it would work. In what way would it be different from sharding the low-level zones only?
---
I pretty much love everything about priest and that both classes have a really high skill Cap
---
But what makes me want to play hunter is that its generally easier for most stuff that is solo and i dont have a ton of time to invest into the game this time around, also i have never played hunter in wow ever and i kind of want to try
---
i'd like to understand that, i only using react.js, maybe something to do with this
---
&gt; I honestly wish they eliminated the proc effect from underleveled weapons once you’re outside the level range
---
They do this in retail and it is a universally despised feature. 
---
"Super item that does X. Must be below level 82." 
---
Nobody likes it.
---
Improved aspect of the hawk improves attack speed by 30%.
---
My understanding is that it also affect Aimed Shot.
---
With that  being said, what is the optimal range for weapon speed so you get as little clipping as possible ?
---
Example: 3.3 Autoshot -&gt; becomes 2.19 for autoshot
---
3.0 Aimed Shot -&gt; becomes 1.98 which makes your rotation something like this:
---
0.5 Autoshot , Start Aimed
---
2.48 Finish Aimed, 
---
4.87 Autoshot 
---
7.05 Autoshot 
---
9.24 Autoshot 
---
9.50 Aimed ready
---
which leaves you with 0.26 sec of clipped Autoshot, or is my math completely wrong ?
---
Fair enough. Misinterpreted your comment.
---
I wish the horde looked better in gear. Can't stand troll feet, tauren hooves, undead bones..
---
I don't know the details that's why I ask :p
---
Can someone convince me to play hunter over mage?
---
I’ll only be doing PvP and somewhat casual raiding.
---
It just seems mages have a lot of tools like blink, ice block, etc to get out of situations like hunters do, but mages seem to do a lot more dps and have things like portals, drinks + food and don’t need to have the ammo or anything
---
"Dress up" is actually a pretty important part in most MMOs since at least Ultima Online, tho. Just because you don't care about it doesn't mean it is useless.
---
Also, obviously one can do stuff like "transmog" that ugly AQ40 item into that good looking T1/2 one so it fits together with the set. Or when you are playing a "non standard" build and thus require non set items you can transmog them into something that would actually fit together.
---
Hi Freddy,  
---
I will play Druud.
---
Remorselessx#2380  Battle.net  
---
**MelvinFtw**\#3950 Discord
---
&gt; You're the one who wrote a huge post about this shit.
---
Yes, but I wanted to hear why you thought one was better than the other. I know the technical difference.
---
So it seems like you're completely focused on individual zones being disaster-zones of players, but then ignoring the continuity of the world and the players around you.
---
A very important part of Classic is the community, and seeing your peers around you.
---
Sharding would be better for gameplay within the starting zones, but catastrophic for the community aspect.
---
And, as such, I think sharding is not the acceptable solution. And this is the majority opinion.
---
It was only two months ago [they said](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/update-to-recent-suspensions/161149):
---
&gt;Any future use of software that bypasses the security of the game client, regardless of intention or gameplay advantage, will be detected and sanctioned with increased penalties.
---
So not only do they have things in place to check if you're modifying those files, they have checks in place to detect if you're messing with the checks of those files, and they're not going to let you off with a warning.
---
Seems like a bad idea.
---
I'm just gonna chill and enjoy it. I can't no-life it pvping for 7 hours and raiding for 3-4 hours every day like I used to. Even if I could I wouldn't want to. 
---
We cleared 2 wings of Naxx back in the day so there's very little endgame content I feel like I missed out on. I can totally live with being a casual now.
---
So.. you repost it?
---
Doesn't matter what spec, no paladins in the melee group
---
The game was advertised that it’ll have certain features, and have certain things that it just didint have at all in the game which is fraud and false advertising. Now if the game did HAVE the features that were advertised but were worse, they still have the features but he advertised things in the game that just were not true.
---
The game has really turned around actually. They've had so massive updates and brought it to what they intended it to be and there's some other big update coming soon as well. It's really interesting and worth a look into if your genuinely curious. Also that guy didn't go to jail.
---
Yeah, I was considering rolling Hunter in classic but have changed my mind due to hunters subpar dps later in raids, however, for 5-20 man I think they will be fine due to how useful freezeing trap is, not to mention their insane cc capabilities with readiness and wyvern sting if you really want to bring effective cc to your group.
---
Serious question. How is classic gonna work? Are they just gonna be releasing classic and thats it? They releasing all the rest of the expansions afterwards? Is classic gonna stay classic for evah?
---
Just read the credits : "Please note that the stats on this spreadsheet are all pre patch 1.4+ so the likely will be inaccurate for most 1.12.1 realms."
---
While I like the old sets, its going to be painful to look the same for so long.
---
I'm on book 4 right now. It has managed to capture my attention, and I'm not very big on reading books, at least not lately.
---
Here's the thing - sharding is basically layering.   I understand it is not ACTUALLY the same, but functionally it's similar.  Whether you call it sharding or layering is irrelevant - the main thing is that you could make essentially 5 different "realms" of elwynn forest on one server, but once you get to duskwood everyone would be in one zone.   You could also do it gradually where there are 5 elwynns, 2 duskwood, but then everything after 30 is single zone.   i think this is a better solution than just making multiple layers of the entire continent.
---
&gt; If I had my own choice, I'd just make huge servers and let everyone on it. I've experienced it before and it can be pretty painful but also very fun. Population could drop and still be fine - just lower the cap after phase 1.
---
There'd still be some reasonable limit to this though, so you'd still need queues at some point.
---
And, the more important point, is this would actually be a very big change to Vanilla. Plus the game not being designed with this many players in mind.
---
So I don't think this would rank among the best solutions.
---
&gt; The reason I'm against layering is mostly that phase 1 is a long time. If the entire world is layered, for months, it can really kill the hype a lot. The most fun classic will ever be will be at launch. If layering is removed after the excitement is gone it kind of sucks.
---
Yes, I did reference in my post that the length of time layering is active for is a very important point, regardless of the technical implementation of it.
---
They did reference they'd like it to be on the order of weeks, not months (and definitely by the end of phase 1). But they haven't given hard timelines.
---
If layering were to be active for multiple months, I would sway very hard in the direction of clusters being the preferable option.
---
Fair enough. Thanks.
---
Wishfull thinking.
---
If they ever did that, what's next ? Pandas ?
---
Get real dude, this is a serious game.
---
Trying to explain people simple basic logic and math won't work. They are SET on anti-layering, and BLIND to the consequences of other so-called solutions.
---
They just don't give a fuck on dead realms...because they are assuming that they won't be on one of those realms.
---
But they will be....and one year from now, they will come here and be all like : "Classic is dead", "My realm is dead"...and ofc : "BLIZZARD SUCKS !".
---
These people just don't use their brains.
---
Priest is mid-high tier leveler. Absolutely no issues leveling the one I did on Nost. Shadow/wand spec, heal any dungeon etc.
---
If you want to heal, pick a healer.
---
Play nelf if you're alliance and get a stealth pet. Shadowmeld + stealth is really really good for eating/drinking, hiding from enemies or getting the jump on someone. 
---
Great tip if you're a beastmaster, stay hidden and send in your pet. It'll likely die but they'll use up a fair amount of mana/health killing it. That's when you quick res your pet and finish the job. World pvp as a hunter is easy mode.
---
How do you feel about real life midgets?
---
Hmm, I think you're right. Maybe I'll roll druid as an alt.
---
Oh I never said you hurt my feelings. I said it was a hamfisted attempt at doing so, and you violated the rules by bringing religion into it. Hence having your comment and post deleted.
---
You could add /played times to the guide. Or maybe how much time a segment should take, so you could plan your RL better.
---
are you me?
---
I know the research disagrees with me but I believe handedness is mostly an acquired behaviour. From early childhood you focus on using one hand, and the muscle memory you build just reinforces that choice further and further. Most people being inclined to use their right hand could be partially explained by cultural influence.
---
Personally I also consider myself ambidextrous (or perhaps *cross-dominant*). I can't write for shit with my left hand, and my mouse accuracy in video games etc. is substantially worse on it too, but when I was first learning to write or play FPS games I was shit at those on my right hand, too. I had to spend literally thousands of hours practicing the muscle memory of my right hand to get where I am with those tasks, so I can't see why it wouldn't be the same for my left hand.
---
1. The fact that the world was open and more sandbox-y than nowadays ( kind of ironic, since WoW was considered heavy on the themepark side back in the day). Eg you decide where to go in strat/scholo/ brd,etc. instead of following the streanlined tunnel that leads you from boss to boss.
---
2. Obviously the social aspect. You had to talk to people and travel the world instead of clicking magic buttons that teleport you anyway ( aside from bgs, which got their queue-npcs added to main cities - damn the magic-teleport-buttons actually started in vanilla)
---
3. Class design. things like lockpicking, portal service, druidtown( aka moonglade) added fluff that gave classes identity
---
Why not ? There was a detailed post a few weeks ago of someone claiming having done it in Vanilla.
---
 Hunters are the Kings of soloing open world, kiting in PvP, even solo running dungeon for gold farming. Leveling is much faster than with any other class. Downtime is short, you can eat drink while your pet pulls  the next mob. Easy to play on BM spec and it is recommended while not geared well. Gearing up is easier, you can equip both leather and mail items. Talented aspect of cheetah is only slightly slower than the level 40 mount. And so on.. I could write a lot more reasons to be a hunter over a priest. 
---
Dwarfs can RP well if you are into it. They are allowed to be drunk IRL while grouped.
---
Tell me about your playstyle, goals, even with these benefits something might be better for you.
---
Yes I played on a low pop server in vanilla, and there was a free transfer to my server from a high pop one..... Still not seeing the issue, it sounds like you believe classic will die matter what, which means they would need to keep layering forever.
---
Absolutely terrible idea...
---
Open the vanilla part of the servers early maybe if people want to start fresh but not bringing over your classic character is just a bad idea. Character history matters, all the stuff you've accomplished adds up, having to leave that all behind would be terrible itd also destroy the community on your server because no one would know who anyone was anymore.
---
you are right, it's fixed !
---
Tank Warrior S4 ring:
---
* [Naglering](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11669) 10 Stamina, 5 Defense, 50 armor, (3 Thorns)
---
* [Overlord's Crimson Band](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19873) 10 Stamina, 7 Defense, 8 Agility (9 Strength)
---
So 50 armor over +2 Def, +8 Agility, +9 Strength. Seems like another case of armor being valued really high.
---
Just look on youtube for “stress test layering“ ,  i think youve missed something
---
Vanilla has an incredible attrition rate because it's so difficult. All they have to do is monitor server pops and do transfers to and from realms as players progress and leave servers. That and so new fresh starts once in a while like every 18 months or so.
---
No. ABSOLUTELY NO !
---
Have you been one one of those realms? Because I was. It is a DISASTER. I am not a TBC supporter in any way, but THANK GOD that TBC came fast enough after my realm got merged, and reseted the community.
---
It was a DEAD split between the guilds from "my" realm and the "other" realm. The previous "acceptable" Horde-Alliance balance vanished overnight. Horde just went from 40% to 80%. 
---
It WAS A TOTAL MESS !
---
&gt;and you violated the rules by bringing religion into it
---
You have just made a claim that it's against the rules to bring in religion. Do you have evidence to support your claim?
---
I know this concept can be a bit alien to you. But do your best.
---
I want to kick them in the stomach.
---
They’ve said they’ll release expansions as the community are ready for them, but no details as to how. 😊
---
Ammo isn't much of an issue, really. You have a bag for it and just buy it. It's not farming like with soulstones.
---
Mage makes sense if you are super hardcore and getting NAXX gear cuz they scale better at the very end but hunters are as or more viable from early gear. Also you have A TON of utility as a hunter. Traps, aspects, pets, dodging polys with Feign Death (as well as so many other shenanigans), eye of the beast, tranq shot etc. etc.
---
Which race and why?
---
I feel you OP. I am in a simillar boat and to be frank if I rack up few hours, subscription doesn’t seem to pay off.
---
Yet here it is, the opportunity of the lifetime to enact the South Park episode of Warcraft. :(
---
Wow, your Google fu is truly terrible then.
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Classic+wow+release%3F
---
Awesome thanks
---
If you want to play a gnome that's fine. Just know that I'll never invite you to my group or guild and I'll continually /spit on you so long as you're in my presence.
---
Not totally true, we had fresh servers for TBC release. (Maybe it was just in EU) It was really fun having a fresh server and discovering outland at the same.
---
The server kinda died after six months but eh, leveling was fun at least
---
What about graveyards?
---
Get off my farming spot!
---
The leveling is quite boring and repetitive compared to hunter IMO.
---
Being allowed to be drunk fits me well since i dont play the game to be Good, esports games are for that. However i want outplay potential in pvp. Also i dont have a lot of Free time this time around and thats why consider hunter to begin with. However i love pretty much everything about priest, except that they arent Easy going solo
---
It is NOT a similar system. Do you even know what similar means?
---
A shard with 50 people would be similar with a layer of 100 people...BUT not similar with a layer of 3,000 people.
---
IT IS NOT SIMILAR.
---
Also, sharding is working on retail WITH connected realms...there won't be connected realms in Classic.
---
Layering is NOT similar with sharding.
---
I was strongly against gnomes when they were announced back in the day. Over time I've grown to like the little buggers and will most likely make a warrior alt as a gnome.
---
I find it odd to see so many of these posts. If you can't remember mailboxes and passwords, get a paper notebook.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
It was supposed to be that way, then Blizzard said it would be continent wide and last all of phase 1 instead of just the first few weeks. Basically we don't know how long it will really be there. I'm praying Blizz doesn't come up with an excuse to keep it past phase 1. Even the whole first phase is too long imo.
---
Phase 1 : 2% (head) + 2% (shoulder) + 2% (devilsaur bonus) + 1% (blackstone ring) + 1% (crossbow) = 8%
---
Phase 2 : 2% (head) + 2% (shoulder) + 2% (devilsaur bonus) + 2% (2x ring) + 1% (bow) = 9%
---
i don't see the 11% even with the helmet ?? didnt you read a bit fast and mixed % crit and % hit ?
---
Bold if true
---
This really depends on the raid you want to be in. There will be all kinds of groups from more casual to pretty hardcore. Don't expect to get picked for a guild trying for server firsts with a lower attendance, but if that isn't your goal and you play well in a team, you should have no problem getting in a raid group.
---
100% made up
---
Shadow priest is one of the best PvP classes in the game and most raids will always take one shadow priest.
---
I am noticing a pattern here. I remember one guy at my school who had amazing time management skills.
---
He calculated his daily dose of WoW playing as a dwarf warrior. He would first play 4-6 hours of WoW. Then spend the remaining time studying.
---
Not only did he have a lvl 80 warrior, he had better grades than me.
---
And played instrument with me in a band.
---
Absolute unit.
---
No, nothing is written about 1.12 in the Internet. Just ask someone here, we all have perfect memory.
---
I wouldn't try to argue for or debate for a megaserver - mostly just stating that if I had my own choice, I'd do high population servers and lower the cap after phase 1.  I do not think blizzard would do this as some people would get frustrated and quit.  I am not trying to argue this position - just wanted to mention that if I could do whatever I wanted outside of limitations, that's what I would want.
---
As far as the second point, the reason why I feel it's a dangerous topic is because we have no guarantee that blizzard will remove layering after a few weeks.   Blizzard will do whatever they feel makes them more money.   If they feel layering keeps more subs than it loses, layering will stay no matter what the community says.   That is why it is important in my opinion to draw a line in the sand on it.
---
your orcs name means "kitchen electricity" in swedish. thats... not aweful!
---
I don't think Illidan will be the Lich King. It will probably be Arthas.
---
No because the feral tank and dps BiS weapon is in the game since the beginning
---
That's so bullshit. Part of the experience is definitely taking some of your crazy vanilla items into TBC raids. Like Thunderfury is apparently a damn good tanking weapon still in Karazhan since it's great for generating AoE threat.
---
nope because i don't know what is Svelte  ?
---
Yeah, right. Just after they give us human hunters.
---
I hope the first expansion is about Pandas rather than this shit. They could let us play as the Pandas from WC3.
---
Taking two weeks of paid vacation to no life it to 60. Then I will try my best to balance raiding and work. No kids yet but I do have a wife.
---
I'm working a ton of overtime here in July but in between work I'm trying to get all the repairs and maintenance done around the house. Gutters need fixed and cleaned, Garage door needs fixing, lawn needs taking care of ... etc.
---
So you’re of the opinion that private servers are correct, or?
---
It's that saying - "when everyone is special, noone is". Make everyone a killing machine, decked out in legendary items, riding flaming wolves or floating tigers etc, and it will become the norm. Meaning it's not special. Meaning it doesn't mean a goddamn thing.
---
It's *because* there was a grind involved that it became special. You had to put in the hours to get something. And everyone knew it took effort to get &lt;item&gt; and recognized you because you went through that grind.
---
I could never do it, I simply didn't care enough, but it was always nice to see someone rush by on one of those things.
---
Of course, a more cynical person will recognize the "grind" as a way to keep a player paying the subscription fee, but hey, the game was insanely popular anyway, they could afford to make these gambles.
---
That’s what classic is all about. Don’t like it, don’t play it.
---
We have our druid.
---
i take no offence by this visual bis site use the data from the most famous BiS excel sheets, it's just a better way to show them (my thinking)
---
The Vanilla Horde PvP sets have always been my favourite. I will be playing a Horde Shadow Priest and I can't wait to get the Rank 10 set.
---
Because Shadow Priest gear is so scarce, it's pretty much the best armor you can get (besides Rank 13, obviously) well into BWL. Doesn't really get replaced until AQ, but I'm not even sure I will be raiding that much.
---
I will try and make it last as long as I possibly can, go for neck/back/wrist/belts/rings/trinkets first in raids.
---
He’s trolling. He posted it a little while ago and had it removed and he decided he’d be a smart little cookie and post it again.
---
You can claim it's the majorities opinion, but unfortunately you don't have the data to back that up.
---
So you think splitting up the entire server into channels is better than splitting the lowbies up into "channels" and then everyone being on the same channel after level 20 or so?
---
How exactly is that better? A few weeks down the line a bunch of people at 60 I've never seen before pop into existence. I don't know who these people are, I never played with them.
---
Your logic is completely flawed.
---
You can still get 3p T2 with Kazzak pants by substituting in Nemesis chest/shoulders. The comparison:
---
Nemesis Chest+Fel Infused Leggings: 96 sp, 16 int, 1 crit
---
Nemesis Leggings+Robe of Volatile Power: 62 sp, 31 int, 2 crit
---
Or with shoulders:
---
Nemesis Shoulders+Fel Infused Leggings: 87 sp, 13 int
---
Nemesis Leggings+Mantle of the Blackwing Cabal: 73 sp, 32 int
---
If you really value crit maybe you don't want the first (I don't think the crit is worth 34 sp, though) but the second one is definitely better no matter how you slice it.
---
Best.Comparison.Ever
---
I just want to clarify that this is not a religious meme. It's just a silly man doing some fact checking in a hat. Obviously this can't be based on a real religion because that just makes no sense.
---
Just change your computer's timezone and test it..
---
Look at the system.present back in the Demo
---
Then see what changed till now. Im not saying all those bugs make it to release. But currently you see a few fixes every week. While all claas / mechanical and litteraly game breaking bigs stay untouched.
---
I hope they push release back so the game is atleast not worse then private servers.
---
This WILL happen. Give it few years and I AM totally fine with that. Eventually the monthly subscription model will just not cut it and things like these will have to happen. Supporting devs, server costs and so forth is fine. Blizzard has done well not increasing sub-fees for the past 15 years...  
---
If you live in a delusional state of mind, then you will deny this but hate to break it to you it will happen as the p2p model is not futureproof when subscription numbers fall below a certain point.
---
I thought BRD aswell, fun game
---
Mate its not cause he wants to. Its because in law firm often times the whole mess with papers, reading them and putting up coherent sentence turns from 30min job to a 4 hour grind.
---
There’s a big reason, it wasn’t in the game at that time. Classic is all about recreating the vanilla experience the best the developers can, they’ve said this. 
---
Seeing someone’s gear and knowing what they accomplished and how strong their character is at a glance is an important part of the game many people miss and we’re finally getting it back. 
---
Looks like you just have to deal with it bud.

Good points. I think I’m decided on Warlock too tbh. So much utility for the group and great synergy with a shadow priest I can’t go wrong. Rogue seems a bit too selfish since I’m looking to offer some help to the group as well.
---
And here I am going into it with only the info on my class, race and professions figured out. The rest I'll figure out on the go.
---
I'm 32 and work for a bank, I was 18 when WoW was originally released so it was perfect for me. I'll be taking my annual leave for release, hit 60 in those 2 weeks, then prioritise gearing up over other games for the first few months. I've been single since Christmas so it helps I don't have to go abroad with my partner this year. I'll be hitting the gym on my work lunch break so I don't have to do that on an evening.  I don't have kids so I'm good really. I should be able to work from home one day a week and I'll make sure that day is pretty clear work wise.
---
Post NA/EU..
---
Also resto shamans rather than ele/resto?
---
You really cannot help yourself, can you?
---
If limited free time plays a huge or biggest role, go hunter. If you have somebody to play with and grouping up for a dungeon which can take long, depending on the others, isn't an issue then choose the priest. If you leave due to rl things as a priest, that sucks for the grp. As a hunter u r easily replaceable.
---
However, both classes are fun. Just play whatever role fits You better. You will get good anyway.  Hunter has more outplay potential.
---
Considering we are lawyers...
---
Human Paladin.
---
See ya.
---
It's all superfluous no matter how you look at it. "one server" isn't really one server anymore with Wow's infrastructure, it's entire clusters of servers pretending to be individual servers and simply only showing relevant players to your home "server". You can see it in action in the beta right now, occasionally it will glitch out and show us alpha players on the beta realms running by in their 50s. 
---
We'd be better off with mergers down the road in the same vain as servers like Deathwing got with Kalegos, etc, where you are effectively on the same server -- mail, guilds, etc, but you simply have the server name affixed to your name... 
---
Spares us this dirty layering crap that can be abused no matter how much Blizzard tries to make it difficult.
---
Top tier [cherry](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gl0ZFkgZ-xg/Tp8pVxUihOI/AAAAAAAAAKM/voD0Puinbzc/s1600/T2_Judgement_v2.jpg) [picking](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/small/57753.jpg) [mate](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5emruGkeEgc/ToNH8oQSXlI/AAAAAAAAAII/jYNpF2ZkaAU/s1600/Warrior.jpg), the occasional unfortunate clown suit beats the slutmogs and ridiculousness introduced with transmog. Feels good when you can finally replace a really unfortunate looking piece too. 
---
And the complaint of everyone looking the same is funny to me when you tend to see all the same tier sets transmogged with slight variants in retail.
---
A lot better on Alliance, usually better on Horde (cf. Windfury).
---
I completely agree with you. When you first start learning the guitar as a right-handed, the toughest part is generally the left hand, as you interact with the strings directly with your fingers. You lack strength, coordination and you suffer from a feeling of general 'drowsiness' in your left hand. When you practice, you can improve these aspects to such a degree, that your left hand becomes your dominant hand when you are playing. It's makes sense, because the left hand has the most direct impact on how your playing sounds, and it needs most of your attention and focus.
---
&gt; So you think splitting up the entire server into channels is better than splitting the lowbies up into "channels" and then everyone being on the same channel after level 20 or so?
---
&gt; How exactly is that better? A few weeks down the line a bunch of people at 60 I've never seen before pop into existence. I don't know who these people are, I never played with them.
---
&gt; Your logic is completely flawed.
---
Ah well, this is different.
---
You didn't elaborate, or talk about how aggressive the sharding would be, and/or a different implementation to Retail.
---
This implementation of Sharding/Layering you're talking about indeed has the potential to be better. But, again, is highly dependent on exact implementation.
---
Having a hard-stop as early as possible, e.g. only 1 version of zones after Westfall would be better than Layering, IMO.
---
As well as this implementation allowing you to make the starter zones non-horrific, as you many 10s of versions of the very first area, and then drop off the max 'channels' of each zone as aggressively as practical.
---
If this is what you're talking about, then yes this has the potential to be "the best" solution overall. But I wouldn't just slap "sharding" on this solution, this is not the same implementation as Retail.
---
Yeah but time is the most valuable thing in Vanilla.
---
That’s sharding. Just stop these fucking nonsense posts. Jeeeez
---
Oh yeah, the im going to complain, but ill play anyways option. I think you are in the majority in that one. :)
---
But to your original topic. I would claim that if we had 40 hour AV's when it launches, it would cause just that no L60 (remember AV is coming in like phase 4 or something, a LONG time after launch) PVE'ers would play it more than few times. Shorter AV's give out a leveling progress (pretty nice xp quests, blue quest rewards for L51's), PVE'ers will do their 50+ hours of AV and it might be a good way to do ranking, boosting the usage even further.
---
So if you actually like AV, the shorter AV is that gives you lesser queues, more AVs actually played because you have ppl to play against to. So ask yourself, do you want 40h AVs for few weeks or 20-60min AV's for a rest of the game history ?
---
You are using words incorrectly, it did not imply that, you "inferred" incorrectly.
---
Rewriting the first one.  
---

---
It’s discussed a million times now and your either on the one or the other team. What you will get is layering... deal with it!
---
The biggest factor might just be that i havent played hunter before, no ide about gearing and class quests and that Good stuff and i want to experience being a noob again. I Think im gonna play hunter on a private server to get a feel för it
---
Same ! It was a rollercoster of an email...
---
This is all just so... inaccurate... 4/10 on the effort though
---
That's a bullshit statement and your friend is an idiot. Tell him that.
---
&lt;3
---
Paladin is probably one of the most awkward classes to do this with. No trainer will be a pain in the ass, so look up what levels you need to learn something important and make the trip back to IF. It's not that far once you have the flight paths. Also to your Role Play question, I'd say I was a Paladin Missionary sent to Darnasus to study the Elven religion and Elune, but got caught up helping in Darkshore.
---
Old Outland, a fun place to explore. Shame it's not possible to get there anymore.
---
Why layering isn't necessary:
---
&gt;Massive queues. It's clear from media engagement that Classic will be very popular at launch. And queues are not fun, encourage unwanted/poor behaviour (people playing extremely extensive sessions, or 'exploiting' the afk system and staying logged in constantly), and split up friends/guilds/etc. As well as just not being great for anyone with a proper schedule, as you have little control over when you can play
---
This can easily be mitigated by launching with an appropriate number of servers. Even if there's a 30-60 minute queue, that's preferable to having layering active, negatively impacting the game once you actually get in.
---
There's a lot of things you can do to mitigate the pain of queueing, such as getting in line before you leave home from work. There's no way to get around the impacts of layering.
---
&gt;Regardless of populations/queues, a system with no kind of layering/phasing of any description is going to be a total unmitigated disaster for some time right at the beginning. The starter zones will be completely unplayable, unfun, and may even cause the servers to crash
---
Again, this can be mitigated by launching with an appropriate number of servers. I'm also curious why people think the Classic WoW experience will be so much different from a private server launch, for example Nostalrius which had no dynamic spawns or layering when it released. That server wasn't unplayable, it wasn't unfun, and the only crashes were related to problems with the coding, not population. No one has been able to adequately explain why Classic will be so much different to require layering.
---
&gt;Completely at the mercy of luck with demographics. What the %-split is between "tourists" and long-term players. And other factors such as streamers altering the demographics and/or quitting. No mitigation in place for this
---
And layering doesn't help help with this so I'm not sure why it's mentioned. If you don't want to play on Asmongold's server then don't play on Asmongold's server. Layering isn't permanent so you're going to face those problems eventually anyways.
---
&gt;The chance of losing your name and identity in the community in the result of dead servers (dead servers being guaranteed to happen) which require merges or transfers
---
This whole "dead server" thing has been blown completely out of proportion. Do you guys really think that Classic is going to crash and burn at such a magnificent rate? I don't. Private servers have only grown over the years.
---
So how many people do you think are going to quit within the first few weeks, when layering is active? Even if you think it's 50%, (which is completely ludicrous to me) and servers launch with about 6k players (which has been proven to be fine for the release of a new server), then you end up with 3k players on a server. Does that constitute a "dead server?"
---
&gt;Well, by definition, an 'ideal' implementation wouldn't have any exploits. There are many potential possibilities, and current issues within the beta, which is why it's important to have the beta and important that people report everything.
---
You can't "fix" or "beta test" the problems with layering. If you move the ability to jump between layers, then you're essentially eliminating layering, or the player's ability to join groups and friends outside of their own layer, which Blizzard would never allow.
---
The problems with layering are big. Even if they're temporary, the Classic WoW launch will only happen once and I want it to be as enjoyable as possible. I wouldn't be so anti-layering if the tradeoff was worth it. But it's not. The positives of layering simply do not outweigh the negatives.
---
The entire point of layering is to "save" the players who would become frustrated and quit after having to search more than a minute for a boar, and are unable to think outside of the box and do things like grouping up to spread out and grind higher level mobs. These are the extremely casual players, who are the most likely to get frustrated with another element of Classic WoW and quit at a later point. Is it really worth sacrificing so much of Classic's first few weeks (possibly couple of months) just to potentially make the leveling process slightly easier for these players?
---
&gt; there won't be transmog for no reason at all
---
The reason is that it's Classic WoW, a remake of the version of WoW that didn't have transmogrification yet.

Competed in Q3A, RA3, OSP CA-mode. I can tell you for sure playing Q3 does not prepare you for CS.
---
&gt; Trying to explain people simple basic logic and math won't work.
---
I've noticed that over the last two years. Lots of morons with strong uninformed opinions.
---
Sorry for the noobish question, but all this info is on the server, can it be datamined anyhow? Why did elitistjerks had to test it if they could datamine?
---
Still, thanking the devs to deliver what they promised after three years with a billboard? Seems very much over the top for me.
---
Yes. Because you know specifically what stats are tied to those pieces of gear.
---
Droprate is quite high, should be very doable!
---
The servers would only merge when the population is low enough that people think of them as dead realms, so it would save them from being abandoned.
---
I intend to make a lvl 1 character, set hs to darnassus or even starting town of night elves and go walk to arena master. I want that thing as early as I can get it...
---
&gt;Now, for people trusting that Blizz will remove layering in a few weeks. You are completely delusional and your blind obedience to this company is sickening.
---
Ok, I bet you $50 that by the time phase 2 arrives no 30+ zone will have layering. If you are sure they wont remove it, message me here to arrange it.
---

Thanks very much :)
---
I don't understand how it is different. 20% is not the number you use here- if you get a cape but it has the wrong stats, it might as well have not dropped at all.
---
As far as I'm aware it can drop a LOT of different suffixes. 4 resists, +healing, +int, eagle/owl, frost/fire/nature/holy/shadow wrath. Some suffixes might be excluded (+of defense?) but there's probably at least 10 of them. So rather than 20%- it's more like 2%, or less, depending on how many suffixes are possible.
---
There's no functional difference between an item with a 2% drop rate and fixed stats and an item with a 20% drop rate but a 90% chance to have useless stats.
---
Now for archivist cape in particular- that's the one I'd argue you could actually realistically obtain despite the rarity, because live strat is a dungeon in high demand. But the sunken temple pieces? Good luck finding 50 groups to clear sunken temple for gear that is only a little better than a [quest reward](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11904).
---
"Only sharding the first few zones" turned into "layering the whole game instead"
---
They never said this was the plan, ever, never promised, nothing.
---
no u
---
No you both
---
Beat me to it.
---
y
---
I think the guy replying to you is pretty rude, but his point is valid - sharding and layering are almost the same.  Sharding is basically setting a cap on each zone and placing you in a new shard once you go over that cap(or something similar).  Layering is basically just doing a global shard of the whole server.   Everything about sharding that killed retail applies to layering - I can't see any way that layering, as implemented, preserves anything that sharding took away.   You can easily jump layers any time you want to.
---
Hey, nice idea. A small suggestion:
---
People seem to get heated about the actual selection of the items. Would it make sense to provide the option to submit a custom-made list of items to the website? That way people could simply upload what they think is best and the website would then show the average - which would be result of a data-driven process by the community.
---
For me it was Stormping, I had to look down on the street or else I could not move, it lagged so much...
---
Ok so you are telling me I will have to tell myself.. oh right this zone is still layered thats why im seeing people pop in and out of existence. Yes my immersion experience is complete thank you.
---
I wouldn’t say “tend,” it various drastically depending on the grind. You can “grind” CoX which requires constant attention. Tell Curtis his 6k kc ely wasn’t active or interactive
---
What, you are telling me that a pro Quake player wont beat an above average CS player after like 1 day of playing CS?
---
Because I have a team of close friends (admitedly not myself, so I take your word for it if you are sure) that switched from Q3A to CS and were already winning (local) tournaments less than a month later.
---
This. I'm afraid we'll have to play the game ourselves this time around instead of having addons do it for us.
---
What's the name of the auto attack cooldown addon used in the video?
---
&gt;Server transfers (and yes, merging layers is literally the same as merging servers, both will damage the community)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Good old queues, more servers, lower pop cap (they seem to be going for a cap of about 9k right now, which is too high in my opinion). You've dealt with this 15 years ago, why not now?  
---
&gt;Dynamic respawns (more spawns/faster respawns = a zone can handle more people). There's even some evidence of dynamic respawns being in original vanilla (obviously no way to know for sure)
---
So, first point is out of the question, since it's the same (server transfers are actually way worse, because the positive effect will be felt in months - removing layering will be felt instantly).
---
The second point is OUT OF THE QUESTION for the vast majority of players AND Blizzard. Or did you forgot that Blizzard is also in the equation?
---
9k cap is too high? Ah...in YOUR opinion. Well, in Vanilla, most realms had 10-11k players. I think you are CONFUSING the CONCURRENT player cap with TOTAL player cap.
---
Dynamic respwans? So...the ALREADY fast leveling classes (Mages, Locks, Hunters) will level EVEN FASTER. How about the ECONOMY? Talk about rich AoE farming Mages? Imagine those Mages farming WITH dynamic respawns. 
---
&gt; There's even some evidence of dynamic respawns being in original vanilla (obviously no way to know for sure) 
---
There were no dynamic respwans in Vanilla.
---
Everyone would fucking love it
---
Imagine
---
When it comes to PVP mages are a total glass cannon. Even with their utility if you get multiple enemies on you you'll most likely get ripped apart before you can blow more than a cooldown. Hunters just have a ton more survivability while still maintaining high ranged dps with the added bonu of a ranged or melee distracting your enemies. But hunter isn't really valuable in raids compared to a mage. So depends what you really want to do more of IMO
---
Your friend is an idiot. Classic is using the current WoW API so technically any addon we have now "could" be adapted to work on Classic.
---
What Blizz has said is that they will break any addon that goes against the "spirit" of Classic.
---
Someone already mentioned it, but [willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com) is continually being updated with addons that will be supported in Classic.
---
For whatever reason people seem to forget there were actually a lot of addons available during Vanilla.
---
Nice
---
Daily reminder, you're an idiot
---
I'm glad we sorted that out. And that is why I do not support layering.
---
What I am saying is that the game are fundamentally different. Being able to aim and shoot is obviously the same shit. But tactics, in-depth baits and dumbass mechanics abuse is not gonna be the same. Just like how pvping/pveing on retail wont compare to classic.
---
There is a very good reason. Classic is an RPG, whereas retail WoW is a gambling/transmog &amp; mount vanity collection game. You cannot blur the two together.
---
Transmog removed much of the motivation to strive to progress in raids and collect the best gear. 
---
The meta in current WoW is who has the rarest mounts and the coolest looking transmog. Raid progress and PvP rating has not mattered since Cataclysm.
---
That’s the one I use too.
---
Hilarious.. A waste of money guys... Lets not make it big
---
must be a legion baby
---
You're not in the loop. He has 2 awards for video game development because of that game
---
May I suggest Sanderson's Mistborn series and his Stormlight series? Both are quite interesting if you are a fan of high fantasy.
---
Would be so awesome to have all those unfinished/unused zones and made into something more.
---
It would've been cool but it's so low on the prio list, they have so much else they need to focus on in this last stretch before launch. The old cinematic still works well.
---
Yeh for sure, but the point is that if you want to prepare for one and all you have is the other it'll definitely help a decent amount.
---
Hm, where did you get this info from? I heard about focus but not about healbot. What's so special about it anyway, isn't it just a good raidframe that allows for click/mouseover heals?
---
Yes, we ended up getting to the bottom of what they meant by sharding.
---
A different implementation to Retail, and probably the better solution vs whole-server layering. Basically what people have been referring to since the beginning, of "layering only in the first couple of zones".
---
Until you understand the real reason why layering exists I don't think you have any right to be freaked.
---
I agree with you, agree-with-you.
---
After a bit of time you will have the possibility to very casually clear MC in no time. That will provide all the gear you need to pvp. It’s sufficient
---
What zone is that top right square?
---
&gt;Is there some idea that they are going to scale/develop classic past wotlk and do it better? 
---
If you can point me to anything that indicates Blizzard has any inclination to progress Classic past 1.12 content that'd be nice.
---
&gt;Or Bliz could snapshot my gear at every level and let me go back in my own timeline.
---
This would be my preference, though I think this is the least common of the post-Naxx content hypotheses, those being (I think):
---
1. New L60 Content  
---
2. #NoChanges  
---
3. Alternative Timeline  
---
4. Expansion snapshots
---
Just layer the starter zones and the first zones after if they are going to leave it in the game. So Elwynn and westfall, dun morogh and loch modan, tirisfal glades and silverpine forest, etc....
---
Leave all other zones alone. If it has to be in the game, it should be limited to first zones after starting areas period. Anything after level 16-17 or so should be untouched.
---
Yes attack my fallacious arguements and ignore the parts where im right like
---
You think you do but you don't" turned into "Classic announced"
---
What is classic+, is it official?
---
Defiler's tabard with that set also looks badass
---
Majority of players will still be playing by nostalgia, but streamers have a lot of influence on kids today. I think that a combination of massive streamer hype+their potential parent’s influence might be the catalyst for a lot of kids coming to classic, with even more players coming in afterwards through word of mouth. We’ll see at launch but it might be shocking, and it’ll be even more fun if the community welcomes them with open arms.
---
All I'm telling you is that layering is unlikely to exist where it can break gameplay, and you seem to agree.
---
The entire 1.12 API has been removed and replaced by the 8.x version which has had 14 years of work put in to it to prevent exploits. The function CastSpellByName which is crucial for rotationbots or healbots to work has been protected since TBC.
---
Eh, its subjective I guess. I personally found the updated epic mounts to be very extra and like the winterspring frost saber because of it's minimalism.
---
You're forgetting that other franchises have gone the 'new content' route with great success. Why would Activision risk re-cycling their content and lose players (or god forbid, reset the servers with seasons) like they did the first time around, when they could sprinkle new content into classic and grow the playerbase as proven from other franchises?
---
If the wow team has taught us anything it is that release day is often just as bad as beta.
---
I don’t need to even look at the rest of you argument because one false statement which proves your unfamiliarity with the subject immediately calls into question anything else you have to say on the matter.
---
 It would be nice to have a mountain you can legitimately ascend like that Legion zone. I mean you can't go up around IF legitimately and you can't climb BRM either
---
Seem to recall ‘starting zones’ and ‘time limited’ being the direction established. 
---
But yeh, I don’t entirely agree with OP.
---
Pickpocket runs got a massive nerf. I heard rogue diaries only sell for 2 silver in the classic beta instead of the, I think, 48 silver we know from private servers.
---
Take a week off work in advance get ahead of the curve then play casually
---
What metrics are you using to base that opinion on? Survey's? If so they're usually filled by the hardcore/devoted player base. When the game launches thousands more will join that don't even know about this forum let alone survey's and those will be the players to pad out alliance numbers.
---
Your friend doesn't know what he's talking about. I'm already using 30+ addons in the beta, a lot of them I've adopted myself my making minor changes to their BfA counterparts.
---
It's BiS until like 40 so of course
---
Everyone hates it because it isn’t accurate to source material and kinda threw in plot points from Warcraft 2 and 3, in addition to almost requiring you to know Warcraft lore beforehand to know anything about what the fuck is going on.
---
It sure is, some of my best vanilla memories involve windfury and that mace on my enhance shammy.
---
So wrong. Mage is the most difficult class to beat on vanilla. Mage eats hunters for breakfast.
---
Hunter can only kill classes that can be kited
---
Looks like Badlands.
---
I think you can disenchant everything on a level 5 character
---
Behold, the Great Realm and dwarf city of Ironforge!
---
Stay with mage dont be silly
---
I'm in but I think it should be thanking the whole classic team. What Omar did was absolutely amazing but it would be insulting to ignore everyone else that has worked tirelessly on the project
---
How incorrect of me to "infer" "you all" from "you've all."
---
Clearly I missed the mark so much because of how defensive he got when I pointed out how much he thinks people want to see his maps judging by how he pumped like half a dozen out in a few hours and was rapid-fire posting them on multiple subreddits.
---
Addons cannot cast spells for you. You'll have to keybind every heal you want to cast and make the decision yourself which heal to cast, like it should be.
---
You guys are really pathetic.
---
Far from it. It's just a (mostly player-) discussed concept for a third server type Blizzard could do after Naxx that'd act as an alt-timeline that'd add Classic-style content to Classic. IIRC, some Blizzard dev said they're open to it if Classic does well, as well as TBC and WotLK servers.
---
Or just buy a Ryzen 2600 (or better) for next to nothing now when the price drops.
---
You didn't answer my question but I think I understand, thanks :)
---
Dps wise there is not much that can compete with hunter burst damage in pvp. Don’t confuse bad dps scaling for hunters in pve in later parts of the game with bad dps in pvp because that’s just not the case.
---
Apart from that mage and hunters are amazing pvp Allrounders meaning they are good to very good in every aspect of pvp.. duels, casual big, premade bg, wpvp you Name it.
---
Hunter has a very high skill ceiling even compared to mages and if you are bad you will be horrible whereas mage is more forgiving. As a very good hunter you WILL stand out in pvp
---
Especially since he said (not hardcore) raiding. It's only the min maxers that won't.
---
Removed as low-effort meme. Memes must be obviously related and specific to Classic without need of reading the post title.
---
Then don’t use it if you don’t want to. Somebody else using it has no impact on your game play.
---
I know it eats boar meat for sure so that's great
---
We won't, already confirmed.
---
There is nothing that suggests this won't happen with layering. Layering will not help the realms that risk dying, it helps the ones that get massively overpopulated and are in no risk of dying. Let this fallacious argument rest already.
---
Sharding is not equal layering
---
Please go to r/wowservers to discuss which private server to play.
---
The good thing about this blacklist, is you have list of people you know are good at their class and probably fun to play with.  Win!
---
Yeah Rake sounds right.

Technically it will be removed after the launch traffic has settled. Layering is a temporary measure to ensure a smooth launch.
---
Please use r/wowservers for private server discussion.
---
This should not be implementing sharding.
---
- the world server should crash
---
- and there should be 45 minute login queue times
---
- just as vanilla intended
---
Except this time we won't get free play time as credit - because this time we demand it.
---
Layering is a specifically configured form of sharding, lol
---
What?
---
&gt; til I got on the perfect spot on the bank that didn’t Afro the guards  
---
&gt;Orcs need Afro as a hairstyle option
---
&gt; This whole "dead server" thing has been blown completely out of proportion. Do you guys really think that Classic is going to crash and burn on such a magnificent level? I don't. Private servers have only grown over the years.
---
The difference is that it won't just be Classic enthusiasts playing the game. Classic shares a subscription with BfA so possibly millions of players will play it just to see what it's like and after 20 or so levels decide that it's not for them and quit the game.
---
Layering is absolutely crucial to make sure that the retail WoW players don't fuck Classic up completely by leaving servers empty after they leave.
---
Can anybody with access to beta please confirm how many stable slots we get? Only 2 or maybe more? Thanks.
---
I am pretty sure they said that the epic recipes like lion helm and titanic leggings wont be available at phase 1.
---
Get your BiS proffs for your main raider and make a Hunter or a Mage for gold farming with Herbalism, Skinning, Cooking and Fishing.
---
Then make 8 L35s with Alchemy and Tailoring to make Arcanite Bars and Mooncloth.
---
Hunter is a great dps choice all the way up until AQ.
---
Yes if your a hardcore raider in AQ and Naxx there are fewer hunters per raid which also means less competition for gear
---
Whilst I don’t hate Esfand, he doesn’t really bring anything to the table. Just keeps saying “oh shit I was reading chat” when he fucks up, doesn’t seem particularly capable or knowledgable and isn’t that entertaining. 5/10.
---
What they actually said is that’s what they would like to do ideally, but they would look at how things developed and go from there. 
---
It is still time limited, though.
---
And then you're complaining once you hit 60 because only 5% or less have made it to the level cap on your server and there's no one to raid with.
---
We played perfectly well in Vanilla without layering nor sharding, why would we need it in Classic?
---
server transfers had 6 month cd when they were added in vanilla.
---
Yeah thats what I'm thinking too but not entirely sure.
---
Considering they're re-building the mechanical infrastructure to re-create classic, it wouldn't be hard to build on top of that; which is the whole point of why you would do it that way. The graphical assets and sounds are already in the game, all they would need to do is script new quests, items, and value tweaks.
---
Even major things like Molten Core was built in a week, using pre-existing assets and essentially scripting the whole thing over night. Adding new content would be done in the exact same way. It's how games are built. The hard part is building the engine (which they are literally doing for classic), the content itself is simple to add/adjust/tweak/re-use.
---
Wondering if a similar time is doable as warrior or shaman.
---
&gt; Look at Nostalrius for example, obviously that was a private server 
---
You should have stopped after "obviously that was a private server". Whatever worked (actually it didn't) for Nost or any other private server WILL NOT work with BLIZZARD'S Classic WoW.
---
When you have A SINGLE PRIVATE SERVER, and hundreds of thousands of people...OFC IT WILL FUCKING GROW.
---
What the hell do you want, in the end? MEGA SERVERS, with dynamic respwans??? NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, because Blizzard is a GOD DAMN "AAA" COMPANY, and not some dudes in Russia !!!!
---
There are at least 6-7 million people out there waiting for Classic, and only a fraction of them played on private servers, the vast majority REFUSED TO.
---
There is no way in hell that Blizzard will destroy their OWN game with mega servers and dynamic respwans, and free world buffs, and 3 times less parry, and wrong pathing, and other crap that private servers have.
---
Nostalrius PROVED that there is a solid market share of Vanilla players...they DID NOT PROVED, not even in the slightest, that they can recreate Vanilla as close as it was. Nostalrius actually proved that IN SPITE of butchering Vanilla (dynamic respwans, undertunned , yes, UNDERTUNNED raid bosses, no world buffs CD, 5 times the Vanilla population, messed up economy, etc. etc.) people were willing to put up, and play whatever was resembling Vanilla.
---
Blizzard will have a MASSIVE SUCCESS with Classic, more than anyone can even believe...but there will STILL BE a truckload of tourists, and the LEAST BAD SOLUTION to deal with tourists spike and dropout IS LAYERING.
---
Unless Jimmy is a priest and doesn't have fear ward to use on healers during KT.
---
they had this in TBC aswell and it was some of the best fun i had in game.

---
Prioritise, if you want to play WoW you should make time to do it (within reason).  
---
Being selfless and burning yourself out at work or in your relationship will always end badly one way or the other. I learned that the hard way. You are not a machine.  
---
Make time for yourself or regret it when your mental health suffers, or you begin to view your relationship as a chore rather than a joy.
---
What huge number? The only people I know who wants what you want are on this sub, and this sub is a small fraction of the classic community. Everyone else I've talked with, including streamers like 
---
Asmon and Tipsout, would prefer to see new content if possible.
---
It's how people have been doing it on those private servers that brought you classic to begin with. It's been 4 years of different large scale servers launching and lots of people playing on release and it all worked out in the end. These are the servers that were so popular that they convinced blizzard that yes, we do want this, we don't just think we do, we actually do.  Layering has never been a part of that, it is a change that goes against the entire philosophy of the game and how it is played.
---
Same
---
the most disappointing thing re-rolling horde after playing alliance for a bit was the realization that no, actually the horde players are just prone to being unhelpful, dumb and annoying as the alliance
---
I'd be more freaked out if this "Beta" was 2 weeks before launch like we've seen from EA.
---
Classic is months.
---
If they can't get it sorted, then they chose the wrong team for the job and if that's the case we have bigger shit to worry about than layering.
---
No, once you get to 307 wepskill you have 3% more hit and INCREASES THE DAMAGE GLANCING BLOWS DEAL. Since in vanilla you glance alot of attacks this is a non-negligible PVE racial for sword rogues and warriors.
---
once you have the flight paths is not hard to fly every 5-10lvls to get the skills
---
I will likely take some holiday off work for the launch just because I think it will be an awesome event and I want to rush a bit with friends and live the hype. After that I will settle and play more casually to 60 I think.
---
First character i made was a dwarf paladin...nostalgia
---
Just bought mine (2600) 54% off :)
---
Yeah swg crafting was insane, the ability of crafters to rise to the top and produce items of higher quality compared to the rest was unique.
---
I realised yesterday that the classic beta is similar to swg; the lack of end game content forces players to create their own content and narratives e.g. The Ooga gang
---
*leaving comment to wait for the answer*
---
Yep. I was originally looking at this. But it's not maintained well. The images lag the system to hell.
---
Play horde, all of our races are glorious!
---
Aspect of the Hawk increases ranged attack power and nothing more. There is no haste.
---
No you INFERED that the 'you all" applied to all humans on earth when it only applied to a select few. Op has no responsibility to make that distinction, you should ask about that distinction before you go on a tirade. 
---
&gt; Clearly I missed the mark so much because of how defensive he got 
---
You mean him correcting you in a much more calm way than your opening comment?
---

---
Thats a sweet painting of Thunder Bluff
---
Layering isn't being implemented to relieve starting zones or make the leveling/questing process less frustrating for everyone; in fact people complained about this because it was "not vanilla".
---
Layering is being implemented to prevent dead servers. Its a far simpler solution to partition one big server into 3 normal sized population servers, rather than have 3 extra servers; some of which will die/low pop. Then you have to figure out how to merge servers or offer transfers to low pop servers, its a nightmare.
---
This way they can just merge the three partitions after during Phase 1 and guarantee that every server has a booming bustling population. 
---
Its a smart idea.
---
My friend and me have made an excel sheet with our entire levelling route planned out.      
---
Dungeon-quests and where to find them (including questchains)      
---
Preraid BiS lists and alternatives.     
---
Profession grind locations
---
Only on private server
---
No, only for Paladin.
---
Careful mate, at this rate you're gonna be hired to do new content officially.
---
Even on Nostalrius, 55% of people quit within two months, and another 15% over the following 6 months (as detailed in the Nostalrius post-mortem document). Keep in mind, those were players going out of their way to play on a vanilla server.
---
So planning with anything less than 70% drop-off within six weeks seems absolutely ludicrous to me. But this just underlines why trying to predict this is really difficult, and why, to me, layering seems pretty susceptible in that regard.
---
There’s kitty dps though lol
---
&gt;Transmog removed much of the motivation to strive to progress in raids and collect the best gear. 
---
How? That makes no sense at all.
---
What faction are you playing?
---
the first year i played wow we used to call it laggforge, because everyone came there to use the auction house and our potatoes could not handle it.
---
I am not talking about stats, tho. They look ridiculous.
---
Horde
---
The modifier for distance checks when moving was changed when "dead zone" requirements were removed in patch 2.3 starting with Hunters. It's actually a post-Vanilla change.
---
If there's an issue with range checks while moving it's because of the new engine and not because someone didn't play Vanilla. 
---
The range check could be miscalculating while moving thinking a dead zone doesn't exist using the new client - only while moving.
---
A fine tooth comb was definitely not used to port the game, as we've been seeing.
---
My man. Dwarves are absolutely the best &lt;3 Period. I’d play horde if it weren’t for dwarves on retail.
---
There is none, it would be a great talent for raiding if it wasn't for the fact that it doesn't include shadow bolt which is the only damage spell you use in raiding.
---
Yes, I am aware of that. And I am still of the opinion that a "enhanced" version of classic could have been so much better.
---
Y tho
---
It's the Badlands, the digsite just south of Uldaman
---
&gt;Top tier cherry picking mate, the occasional unfortunate clown suit beats the slutmogs and ridiculousness introduced with transmog. Feels good when you can finally replace a really unfortunate looking piece too. 
---
"Occasional"? I take it, you never raided.
---
Atalai shoulder have less than 1% to drop and then you have to be lucky to get the good stats.
---
Wasted about 10h solofarming these without even seeing one drop, dont make the same mistake than me
---
&gt;There’s a big reason, it wasn’t in the game at that time. Classic is all about recreating the vanilla experience the best the developers can, they’ve said this. 
---
It is actually funny that you believe it wasn't in at classic on purpose.
---
I wouldn't do that. There is an erotic RP mod that changed the models and Blizzard banned everyone doing this. They quickly unbanned them all, as the community felt it was a gross overreaction but they were firm in saying that anyone doing this in the future would be banned.
---
If she's a prolific reader and you're internet/tech savvy you may wish to get a pdf with all the books on it but in no particular order, the Last Guardian, The Rise of the Horde, The Lord of the Clans, Tides of Darkness, Beyond the Dark Portal, Of Blood and Honor, Cycle of Hatred.
---
Phase 1 Gear for Ferals has most of the preBis stuff unlocked, add MCP to that and you'll reach decent/top dps. It's been done.
---
They do up until the point where everyone has good enough gear to global each other.
---
Classic is about looking like a clown?
---
You can join a vanilla 1.12 private server and get the in-game footage you need.
---
They would like it even less if the game became all about super-items from earlier xpacs that are now trivially easy to obtain.
---
Mages when they are good at using their control are very difficult to beat, a lot of mages are terrible at managing their control abilities though and blow the load at once, at which point mages are awful.
---
I'm going to document my route to level 30ish. After that I could attempt another class :)
---
No its not, having fun is the most valuable thing in Vanilla
---
How are people making these maps?
---
No you didn't.
---
Oh is it!? That makes me feel much better! I was worried because I had a bunch of sources from concept art to in game shots and they all looked a bit different.
---
Mobinfo 4
---
I want to play a Shaman again, but I'm rolling Alliance cause fml. Paladin isn't the same, Druid just feels like I'm shitty at everything. Shaman is the alpha hybrid.
---
Healbot still works fine on live
---
Self-hatred - self-loathing, it's very real
---
why are y'all gilding his post and not the og post
---
Hunters are really popular on alliance and they are really oppressive while leveling up. As a mage they are going to be really hard to beat because most if the time you won't have full mana when the fight starts and will probably run out before you can get the kill. Once hunters hit 40 and have viper sting and beast wrath it gets even worse.
---
This one in particular is the [Story of Classic WoW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFZuhtcjRDQ)
---
I've been doing the grind in modern WoW, amusingly.
---
I play when I want lol. All this how do you find the time post are sad. Just play the game when you can or don’t.
---
I remember all the low level hunter twinks using boars as pets, that charge stun is godly in pvp.
---
Thanks, knew it looked familiar.
---
I am buying a asus prime b450m-a board with a ryzen 2200 or 2600 depending on price, it's more expensive in australia, on pcpartpicker it says these are compatible without the bios update, is that wrong? Will I still need a bios upgrade before using the cpu?
---
Almost nobody is going to not play the class they want on the faction that they want just because of a 3 minute racial that the other faction has. WoW is an RPG, being the race and faction that people want is going to be extremely important. Warlocks are an extremely sought after raid class, strong levellers, and good pvp’ers, people won’t NOT play a warlock if they’re going alliance just cuz an undead can resist their fears for 5 seconds.
---
You're delusional if you think Layering won't be removed by Phase 2. What a lot of people forget is that Classic isn't being developed by just any Blizzard staff, it's being developed and run by OG Vanilla devs/designers. Plus, have they done anything so far for us not to trust them? Have they said anything concrete and gone back on it? 
---
Get a grip. We need to compromise and Layering really isn't that bad. 3 weeks of people exploiting it will mean nothing after a couple of weeks.
---
You can put the ret on the side of the boss, not an issue unless you have alot if ret.
---
I would worry about what you think will be fun to play overall, the amount of time and effort you will have put into a character by the time aq comes out will be incredible. If you make it that far chances are people won't mind your sub par ish dps since you made it through the trenches. Most people quit loong before the 6 month mark.
---
I hope to skin some Devilsaurs. I am not going to lvl up leatherworking for nothing. Probably going to become one of main leatherworkers for my guild.
---
Healbot will still work fine. Addons that auto-script actions like targeting lowest health player, choosing spell rank, etc. will not.
---
Not only that they have a lot of tools to really excel, they also have the potential to go horribly wrong in groups. Tab targeting and aggroing mobs on a different level training the whole instance towards the group, pulling aggro and mobs towards the healer and then feign deathing to offload that roaming mob in the ranged camp, pet handling to just name a few.
---
It does but it can't make decisions for you.
---
Yes
---
Awesome!

1. Is there an article on threat mechanics? Specifically interested in growl (and if it is affected by boar charge), screech, furious howl, thunder stomp, etc. 
---
2. How does a carrion bird (+5% armor) w/ screech compare to a turtle (+14% armor) when getting hit by a physical attack?
---
3. Are there any bosses in strat or scholo that might potentially be soloable by a hunter? Looking for alternatives to Mara / DM, thinking a carrion bird w/ screech or a turtle could be great tanks against a boss with mostly physical attacks
---
I plan to buy ryzen 3 when it gets released. Will it work on 2nd gen ryzen motherboards?
---
I said it before I'll say it again... what part of orgrimmar is that?
---
There used to be PvE pserver as well. But its a good point, we will see
---
Cons for priest:
---
Most of your levelling is done via wand damage. This is a very real time investment people need to be aware of, for some it's a bonus though. Pop SW:P and PW:S then auto attack with wand ando move on while watching a podcast or such
---
&gt; super-items from earlier xpacs
---
You mean keeping old content relevant?
---
It's a simple calculation
---
**How much time does your partner (or other people in your circle) spend watching TV**
---
Convert those hours into WoW time - you'll realise you have plenty of time to play WoW
---
I love vanilla but BRM looks so funny on pservers, it's just the normal ground texture stretched out a bunch of times into the sky lol.
---
&gt; Layering will not help the realms that risk dying
---
Of course it does. Every realm is at risk of dying without it. With layering they can essentially put 15k people onto each realm instead of 3k, if 12k of those players leave the realm is still healthy once the layers are removed. You don't understand the problem and therefore can't understand the solution.
---
&gt; So planning with anything less than 70% drop-off within six weeks seems absolutely ludicrous to me.
---
You just said that people were joining Nostalrius at a faster rate than leaving? So again I ask, what is so different about Classic that's going to drive away so many players? These statements are completely unfounded. Classic is not going to just crash and burn within the first month or two.
---
You didn't ask the question to me, I just elbowed myself into the conversation :)
---
HAH classic! The joke's on you!
---
In vanilla I was a nerd in highschool. Obviously single, smarter than average so didnt have to study hard and no social life to speak of. That left me with lots of time for WoW. 
---
Today I'm 29 years old, work in IT, also single and not much of a social life. That leaves me with lots of time for WoW.
---
This always bugged me actually, tauren are my favorite race I wish there was a quest that gave a reward for a 2h log/big totem (mace) with a requirement for tauren only. I mean they were in wc3 I think they were the only thing they used, but I mean it had been a few years and it makes sense that they dont use the logs anymore with their allies there teaching metal crafts. I honestly think that the tauren had absolutely 0 armor or weapons made from metals until the orcs, same with trolls actually. Pretty cool in that sense that the tauren have gone from their nomadic tribe lifestyle to a more permanent one since wc3, all because of thrall and cairne. Still would like 2h mace log totem.
---
Being a lefty my self I’ve never thought about this until now and now wish it was an option......thanks a lot 😅
---
We're a sub of thousands, these images have been viewed by 100's .. we're a very small minority, who knows if the wider playerbase wants anything like this, most might want to go straight for tbc. I'd love some extra content for vanilla myself though.
---
On launch Westfall will be so packed with Ally all trying to do the same kill/collect item quest and will be extremely bored and frustrated. And since its an Alliance zone Horde will be pvp flagged even if on a pve server. You might need an army if you want to get that mask.
---
Jesus you’re a tool
---
We won't even have the Old School Ride mounts in Classic, - which is a shame - so it's kinda pointless to rush. You can get all the mounts you want later anyway.
---
Mostly looking for answers about PvP in general, how the system is going to work, if it's based on Honor or not, and maybe get some info on how many likely it is for me to do enough PvP per week with a 40 hour work schedule to at least get the blue set. Also how hard it is to grind rep from AV for the UF.
---
I'm also interested in this. Thinking about taming a turtle just for the dungeon soloing aspect.
---
* I'm torn between Hunter/Warlock/Mage for a SECOND character that I mostly will be using for farming.
---
* I don't intend to raid or do many dungeons on it.
---
* My question is whether a "low-geared" Hunter is good at lvl 60 or whether another class would be better as a "low-effort" second character.
---
Amen to that. People today are conditioned to the instant gratification injections to the cerebral cortex.
---
Did they say they plan to extend it for the full duration of Phase1?
---
depends on which one. it can wildly vary from CPU to CPU, and from mainboard to mainboard. when in doubt, directly contact either your dealer or the MB manufacturer.
---
either way, a BIOS update will likely be necessary.
---
Go mage if farming is your goal
---
Why though
---
Well I mean that's roughly when plate rose to prominence. It really didn't have a long lifespan. Blackpowder became popular only about 100, maybe 200 years later.
---
The original vanilla only lasted 2 years.
---
It's safe to say that after 8 years there'll be people who will want a way to return to Burning Crusade.
---
So it seems to me:
---
- they would let you do a character copy
---
- of your vanilla server character 
---
- to a burning crusade server 
---
This way players who want to continue to only play classic, or players who want to have the option of switching between burning crusade and classic can still do so by choosing which server they login to.
---
And continue
---
------
---
And they'll introduce Wrath classic. you can choose to make a new character on a rat server, or copy an existing character from vanilla or bc.
---
-----
---
It already  felt wrong to me that you could out level old continents. I realize that Elwynn Forest is not populated with the most dangerous creatures on Azeroth. On the other hand Ragnaros is a demigod, created by the old gods to sow chaos on Azeroth. He simply shouldn't be that trivial.
---
And the demon invasions in the broken isles didn't become trivial simply because we found a new place to go visit. They're still waves of demons.
---
THEREFORE I DEMAND THAT BLIZZARD TAILOR THEIR SERVERS TO THE DEMANDS OF A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEIR PLAYERBASE
---
Holy Shock is terrible dps-wise. Plus its 30s on cooldown. It can work of course but there are better options. If you want to dish out crazy damage while being holy, go for reckoning with Seal of Righteousness. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVEu0xoZxGk0ezx
---
You'd gouge or kidney them before running so they can't reapply a snare. You'd do the same thing with stoneform before vanishing if you're able.
---
Escape artist can also be used 3 times as often, so what youre really comparing is one use of stoneform vs THREE escape artist uses.
---
It's good, but its not escape artist good.
---
Well it sounds as if you have a pretty well laid plan and are comfortable with those super busy days on top of doing some charity work you enjoy.    
---
I am not hating on lawyer but I just think it is silly to boast doing 20 hours even though I understand it is temporary. People have fought and die so that their working conditions were not synonyms to an early grave and no time for themselves to enjoy their family and some leisure time, sure for many it was also because their work was physically tedious and harmful but sleep deprivation is on par with that. It just seems ridiculous to want to alienate yourself to 19th century kind of system when wealth is increasing with rising inequalities but that is just my opinion.   
---
No hating on you, just curious to hear how and why that would be a recurrent occurrence for a white collar job with, supposedly, some freedom as to how to manage his working time and usually a better dollars per hour than most.
---
get a life ;)
---
Y’all are trying SO hard to make bad shit in Vanilla work, listen if you do all the dumb bullshit with power shifting and farming a million MCP you will still lose to almost every other dps in the game. The only fights you do decently well on are fights that last 60 seconds or vael. You will always lose to decent fury warriors. Everyday I get on this sub reddit it’s talking about “new ret meta” and I’ve even seen shit about melee hunter. If you want to be competitive or desirable to a guild at all stop trying to make this meme shit happen.

Thank them by playing the game

Ironforge
---
He made a good point
---
Why lie about this lol? Plenty of us did it and it's such a huge time sink that it's remembered in detail.
---
You couldn't start before 58, at which point you get 1 quest that takes an average of 30 kills to finish (10 meat, 30%ish drop rate).
---
You'd need to do that 840 times, or a minimum of 25200 kills of mobs your level or higher. It takes 16k kills of equal level to do 1-60 and a little over 1k for 58-60. 
---
Quite literally impossible.
---
Did it maybe occur to you that they didn't have it because they didn't realize they'd need it?
---
Classic didn't have a lot of things that would have made it better. It was far from perfect, regardless of what some people here believe.

Now everyone is taking off work, which I might have done in years past but I’m married now and need vacations for mountains and beaches.

It's a right of passage as a new human player to try and make it to IF by running through high level zones.

You have no idea, what you are talking here. 3 weeks of farming will make you beyond rich even on 1 layer. If you are farming 3-4 layers in a row, well thats some advantage for nolifers right here

Crushim, man, how could you get feared into da fuking whelp cave.

- Dere is nowai dat you could get feared

---
It's not even remotely imaginable.
---
Sounds like an opportunity for an epic PvP montage if you ask me.
---
It still has terrible impact on game economy. They must change it
---
Yes. And then what? If they used it all on themselves, it's just one person never paying for flasks. So what? That's hardly long-term damage to the economy. 
---
If they use them for their guild - just one guild among several or a dozen - then they have 25 weeks before they have to buy their flasks like everyone else. Hardly long-term damage to a server's economy.
---
If they sell them? So the price of black lotus goes down for a while and someone gets more gold then they can spend. Something anyone with any business sense can do in vanilla. So what? 
---
The only real threat to classic's economy is the gold inflation that naturally builds up as you can grind out more gold into existence than NPCs can vacuum up.
---
So one of these dudes got real real mad about layering and stopped doing the troll roleplay in world chat
---
Turned into a Trump apologist, and when a FEEEEEEMALE had the audacity to say the word “hubby” in world chat he had to spout “hubby is the worst word in the english language” 
---
Shame.  The magic is gone.
---
I'm in the exact same boat. What are you going with?
---
Smart idea, terrible design so far.
---
I leveled mostly holy and I was fine, but it was pretty slow at higher levels. Shadow starts to shine later in the leveling process, at the beginning without shadowform etc. you are still wanding most of your time. It works great though if you are in a group or at least have a warrior pet :)
---
What I would get, no matter where you want to put points in later, is get the wand damage increase and spirit tap as soon as possible and keep your wand updated. Then shield up (if the mobs hurt enough), mind blast, shadow word pain and wand while your mana regen kicks in. Very little downtime and with a solid wand ok damage. Just don't try to be a mage and nuke stuff down, you will be oom constantly and buying drinks is expensive.
---
That's really great, however I've no idea how we would host it, or even if we could. We'd need a bot to run it (which needs to be hosted, costing money I expect), and then for that bot to automatically update either the sidebar (which again takes up more space than I think we can afford) or a wikipage. 
---
I'll pass it on, and see if we can do anything with it.
---
WeaponSwingTimer?
---
1. Free to play 2. Available on mobile and iPad (boosts numbers vs pc only games so not fair comparison in player count) 3. Panders to kids via bright colours and general art direction 4. Simplifies gun mechanics vs something like pubg where guns are hard as fuck to shoot (more realism) 5. Incorporates minecraft elements ie building, pickaxe material collecting, once again appealing to a young audience. 6. Extremely simplistic inventory system. 
---
The game is huge because of these reasons, if you can bring in the kids you hit the big bucks. Couple that with free and on multiple platforms. That’s why it’s huge, does not mean it’s a good game. It’s good at appealing to a young audience whilst still having some depth in gameplay. But it’s a kids game at the end of the day. If you don’t like building shit for every single firefight you won’t like this game. League is huge, but imo complete trash when you compare it to something like dota which has way more unique heroes, depth and in game mechanics to master. Numbers don’t mean shit.
---
I think a good way to ease into the 40k universe is: the Eisenhorn books. They have a sort of murder/mystery vibe (at least at first) and are legitimately decent books. But are still very 40k.
---
Hmm, did you ever imagine that maybe I remembered it wrong?  Dam dude it's been over a decade...
---
I get your point  (although the Orc looks totally pimp), but I think you're missing mine. There are amazing looking sets in Classic, Judgement set for example. Managing to get the whole set and looking good is an accomplishment and reward in itself, ontop of the stats.
---
I think is very good for damage/heal outputs. But, you don't have damage mitigation. Wise decisions in the right timing should be your main focus in BG PvP context.
---
Your build is something I could consider to do for the same purpose (BH PvP).
---
Things!
---
I've never seen someone phonetically recreate that dude's accent so well.
---
Ehm, regarding soloing dungeons I have a flashback of  Hunter vs World in Vanilla.  Maybe it's still around on the Internet. I think a NE hunter was soloing Scholomance. Can't remember exactly.
---
Dont think this is true, you cant gets flagged on a PVE server in zones unless you toggle the flag themselves.  Going into opposing cities, its automatic, but not on contested zones.
---
Healbot is basically a raid frame with mouse over capabilities.  I think many of you are remembering the original healbot that basically did your healing for you.  That's been not allowed since the early patches of vanilla.
---
It's all modern MMORPGs now. Everywhere you look it's a carefully crafted diorama.
---
Got one on a pserver, its a good boost both from tps and dps pov. Not as good as mcp off course but you dont use mcp everytime and also might not want to farm it.
---
Anything you don't find helpful from description I guess? If you go for swords, you don't need backstab for example.
---
Yes. And the mobs that drop the mask are also the mobs Ally need for quests. 
---
Theres going to be a serious war. The War of the Mask. A large group of Horde Rogues stealthing around and an entire zone of Ally trying to find them. All while everybody is trying ro snipe the same mobs. Chaoticly Wonderful.
---
I would absolutely love the opportunity to play the full fledged, completed vision of Vanilla that the devs had then. New areas/content? with vanilla design vision? Yes please.
---
By playing a little bit when I have time? Like every normal being on earth does with their hobbies.
---
It it takes me 240 hours of ingame time to hit lvl 60, just spread it out over 120 days if I play 2 hours a day. 4 months is not that much.
---
Once again, whats the issue, there is no rush to hit lvl 60
---
No idea about the first 2 but 3, definitely!
---

---
This should give you an idea. Strat might be more difficult because of the density of trash mobs.
---
Happy hunting!
---
Yup, I'm assuming the OP is asking about the broken version that existed during vanilla and on private servers where you just spam one button or click on the unit frame and the addon does all the calculations for you and casts the most mana efficient heal.
---
It does to a certain extent. There's probably a significant amount of people that raid for the rewards that drop and not necessarily because they enjoy the challenge of progressing in a raid. So why raid if you can just solo Firelands for equally epic looking gear and transmog it onto your character?
---
Only 2.
---
Definitely! Take a look and see if you're happy with what's included, if not suggest what you'd add to it.
---
It's a Diglett
---
What am I excited to get?
---
The community.
---
Everything else comes to a far second.
---
But, if you mean gear, well, T3.
---
I absolutely agree with you here, however I personally really like playing whatever puts out the best numbers as well as want to never having to worry about having a good tank around, but my advice for anyone pondering about whether to pick one class or another that might perform better would be to just follow your heart, you will find a place in raids anyway, no worries.
---
Any reason why is 
---
Dwarven Hand Cannon - 34.9 dps - 2.90 speed 
---
listed  as Pre-Raid Over
---
Bloodseeker - Crossbow - 32.3 dps - 3.30 speed - 7 agil / 8 str
---
Blackcrow - Crossbow - 30.3 dps - 3.20 speed - 3 agil / 1% hit
---
Which is way easier to get and is slower, thus won't be clipping auto-shots while using Aimed-Shot.... I guess you could add more options to the sheet.
---
You are missing the attack speed form quiver or ammo pouch I think and no aimed shot dose not benefit from that attack speed. But does benefit form rapidfire if I remember correctly. 3.45 is the ideal attack speed for best rotation with a 15% quiver.
---
Is it worth it? What is the exact benefit?
---
Shame the legion legendaries went yo shit in bfa.  With that and artifact weapon removal and skill pruning I'm honestly not sure if they could have pissed off the player base more if they had tried .
---
Let's face it, Ironforge is a better Orgrimmar and I'm horde
---
Warrior pvp set.
---
Warlock with SL, too. SL alone makes you a decent damage sponge in some blues and greens. Not amazing, but definitely doable at the start of PvP.
---
Y not?
---
Quit your job they'll understand.
---
IIRC there were several "caves" in Silithus, they were essentially hives similar to AQ but out in the open world.
---
I used to grind the bugs there since no one else did thinking there was some secret no one discovered yet. (Spoiler alert, there wasn't).
---
They seem to be missing from the map as well. Overall the Atlas is amazing OP, great work!
---
I think I’m going to stick with Alliance for now, but once I’ve established my character and guild I’ll probably roll a horse to see what I’ve missed out on all these years.
---
Delete this thread immediately.
---
Hunters have been polling low on recent class selection polls.. I’d like to see it remain that way -_-
---
It might be a daunting task, but would it be possible to map out inside the caves where there are cliffs and or ramps that lead up/down? so far great job tho!
---
Westfall is not a Contested zone. Its Ally zone. Horde will be pvp flagged when going into an enemy zone.
---
The toggle PVP thing only applies if your in a friendly or contested zone. 
---
Zones like Redridge, Ashenvale, Hillsbrad, and Wetlands are Contested zones where pvp is optional on a pve server. Though if a Horde were to walk into Westfall or an Ally walk into Barrens they will be pvp flagged.
---
does anyone have some good hunter pvp videos that arent aimed shot crit compilations ?
---
Yes. Yes I am.
---
Doesn't hurt to have some fun with it.  I'm sure if progression is an issue more tried and true specs will be used.
---
I'd imagine it'll be totally similar. The main issue with these runs are the zones are empty. None of us really know how good or bad the leveling will appear on launch day. I hope to get to level 10-12 in the 1st evening or playing (3-4hrs).
---
&gt; We all know deep down that Classic will dwarf Retail numbers well into a few months.
---
No it won't. Retail is the way it is because people in general are lazy. Mobile games exist because people want to game casually and not be bothered with grinds and "hard stuff". Retail is losing numbers, but classic has no chance. The crowd willing to play it for a long time is definitely not that big.
---
&gt; What's keeping Blizz from going from "Remove layering in a few weeks" to "Sadly we have to keep it until phase 2, 3, 4 , 5, 6... 
---
Because it can't work. Allowing to farm nodes/devilsaur/... is already an issue. But phase 2 introduces world bosses, and Blizzard clearly stated that layering HAS to be gone by then. They're right. Just in case you forgot it, world bosses had insane respawn times. Duplicating them would be insanely absurd and cause an uproar that's way bigger than anything happening so far.
---
I want to downvote this comment for poorly world choosing...but I want to upvoted because it's true.
---
So, i'll just move along.
---
It sounds more like you just don't want to deal with the dynamic decision making involved in the cluster approach. Layering/sharding is the laziest fix to this situation, lets be honest.
---
Layering was implemented because it will save money and is easy.  The only argument against clustering is it is more expensive in the long run because you can't have a plan set in stone. The decision to merge servers will have to be made on a case by case basis.
---
Right now, layering is the only thing preventing classic wow from truely being classic wow. Anyone who played ESO at launch knows how layering will go over.
---
Wasn't Perception an active in vanilla?
---
I do hope, you get the chance to test this out more. I don't know whether mcp + sor is the style of play I like, but something like AP/SP hybrid with heavy on hit scaling spelldmg effects (think sulfuras or corrupted ashbringer + lifestealing + shadow oil) is defintely something I could get behind. But, if that playstyle is crap, it's not worth it.
---
I wonder, can't on hit effects like the above also proc of SoC procs?
---
Yeah, the waradin you describe is never soemthing I got behind. Even in vanilla, where I pretty much played only ret in pvp, I preferred the avenger set and the hybrid itemization to get a decent amount of spellpwoer laong with the AP. I was always annoyed by the Grand Crusader items in Naxx, as two of them overlap with the t2.5 and wouldn't provide any upgrade because of that.
---
Apart from kiting in general, in what specific pve fights are hunters expected to kite? I’ve dabbled in hunter throughout retail but never really mained it, and would like a general idea of how many end game instances or raid bosses in classic I’d be expected to kite for. I don’t mind the idea, but hope to find some videos.
---
I’m playing WoW for the first time ever this August. I can’t stay off this subreddit for more than a few hours, I’m so pumped!
---
The majority of raids are a stones throw from IF. It's pretty convenient and is definitely something you'll notice or miss if you've switched factions.
---
I think it should be a starting item almost. It’s a basic log. Just a tree without too many branches - exactly what I could see a Native American style people with insane physical strength would equip young new warriors with. Learn the log, then you get to use weapons it takes time to craft, so you know not to just hulk smash shit the fuck up. 
---
One can hope for classic+

Lol why you gotta add stipulations? It's 100% removed or isn't. There is no "oh it's still gonna be available, only in starter zones though"
---
Remove it entirely and let streamer severs have 10 hour queues, with streamers getting queue priority.
---
Create a warrior gnome. Since you hate it, you may not be the only one. Players on Horde too could hate gnomes as much as you. Enjoy their agony if you kill them in WPvP or in BGs.
---
I can't find any confirmation that ranged attack speed affects Aimed Shot's cast time.
---
I want to roll Alliance so badly for a new experiencez but after testing other classes nothing compared to Shaman. I finally got used to the Alliance races, killing Horde, new city layouts, etc. But I'm not sure I can main something that isnt shaman
---
I wasn’t commenting on the content of your comments, more so on the delivery.
---
Yeah it honestly doesn’t matter that much what spec you play it’s still piss easy vanilla content I’m just warning people that if they want to go into it min maxing and being the best dps they can be to avoid this stuff. You can kill any boss in the game with feral druids and ret paladins in your raid, in a loot council guild just don’t expect loot over others and everything will be fine.
---
The gear as chosen by Pingaan on his spreadsheets looks to be rock solid for Ret.  It doesn't have a bunch of spell damage and +int shitty gear which noobs think is really good for Ret.  It focuses on +Str, +AP and of course +hit/+crit.  It's a seriously good guide.
---
I like how no one is answering your question lol, yeah those weapons are huge for PvP. Even with 0/30/21 you'll be doing good damage in PvP. You also forgot a 5th one, **Mace of Unending Life** from AQ 20 which is probably the easiest to get if you just do your weekly AQ 20 for a month or two. But I wouldn't call them broken, it's just a nice damage boost maybe 10-15% increase from unstoppable force
---
If you freak out like this over a video game I can’t imagine how you act with anything in life of real importance. 
---
Relax dude, there is nothing here anyone needs to be freaking out over.
---
Aimed shot first or rush to bestial wrath?
---
Aimed shot seems overrated given most leveling bows have fast attacks.

I am now 33 and will have to settle for playing in the evenings 2-3 days a week after my daughter is asleep.
---
If I’m lucky my gf will want to play too and I can crank those numbers up to 4-5 evenings a week and the occasional Saturday.
---
Do you not see that your bullet points are just what I said? “Layering does this, that and the other thing.” That’s not a benefit of merges over layering that is only the problems with layering. There is a difference if you don’t think so you have the issue not me.
---
Did I say blacklisting will work on servers with layering? Fear mongering guaranteeing that layering will be in at AQ opening... good tactic won’t work. Layering will be removed before the end of phase 1. That’s not the only con to merges.  What about the economies? Or the “blacklists” those ninja’s now have a whole new group of people to ninja from. 
---
You haven’t pointed to any benefit of merges only the cons of layering. Which again I know the cons of layering.
---
Refer to this.

This seems to imply that a druid with suitable talents allocated can be almost as good at healing as a priest can. Can a druid with suitable talents allocated be almost as good at healing as a priest?
---
What I like doing is to heal and then escape when the enemies are being too dangerous. That is how I avoid dying at all in Heroes Of The Storm by playing as Brightwing and healing and then escaping when enemies are being too dangerous. Can a druid adopt that strategy? A druid seems fast, because it can shapeshift into travel form and escape when the enemies are being too dangerous. A priest seems too slow. One can not mount in combat.
---
Which class is best for herbalism? Obviously, Tauren is the best race for herbalism because of the racial Cultivation. Only a class which can wear leather can wear the item Herbalist's Gloves. So that leaves Tauren Druid and Tauren Hunter and Tauren Shaman and Tauren Warrior. It seems that Tauren Druid is the best for herbalism, because it is the fastest in water by the ability aquatic form, which is useful for gathering in water.
---
Is the racial of Drawf Find Treasure useful for one who gathers? It seems that one can take treasure without the ability Find Treasure.
---
Dwarves and Undead imo.
---
Stone form changes enough match ups to be BiS pvp wise.
---
Personally if I'm ganking I find Fear to be more troublesome than stuns. If we're taking into account BGs and group wPvP, Orc is better
---
But if I were min-maxxing a Rogue for 1v1 surprise ganks, I'd go Undead everytime
---
Being main tank of a competitive horde guild so Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker is actually something i will get.
---
Hm. Mind pointing out what exactly was wrong with it? I am still learning the language and I have sometimes trouble because I come across differently than what I intended.
---
That's a strange way to say Exodar
---
More for us
---
I thought spell dmg was a solid choice for ret? But since itemization is weak for the hybrids during vanillia maybe it means giving up too many other stats. I would think a good mix of strength and spell dmg would be optimal but might not be possible
---
Well, the question is why you'd want to force people into raids if they don't enjoy them in the first place.
---
Not to mention, insignia for Rogues removes fear but not stuns
---
There is still plenty of beta to go. They are going to work out the kinks with layering. I havn't heard an alternate solution that doesn't suck yet so unless you have a better idea I don't think you are going to get much support around here.
---
Giddy up!
---
Empty server.
---
That reminds me of the time I was using my uncle's computer when I was about 10, I clicked shut down and then sat there in terror.  
---
In big orange lettering in the centre of a black screen it just said "It's not safe to turn off your computer".  
---
After I finally worked up the courage to tell him, [he must have been amused.](https://i.imgtc.com/LApJ5Pa.jpg)
---
That’s not an issue with layering though. So what’s the issue with layering if you’re ok with ruining server communities, economies and immersion anyways?
---
Yes, but the way transmog in retail works would only make it possible for you to use that set if you got it already. Which means you can still afk pose in Orgrimmar.
---
(Tho, getting your hands on anything that is not Naxx might be quite easy this time.)
---
Thank god those times are gone and handism is no more.
---
I’m planning to heal I really enjoyed it back in the day
---
Ancient IF?
---
Hi planning to heal i really enjoyed it back in the day, I'm dad.
---
First of all, this will affect, what, 5% of the population? The majority of the players base will still be leveling up. 
---
Secondly, why are you assuming there will be that many layers? Each layer can handle around 3000 players. If the server cap is 6000 (random number) the most there will be is 2 layers.
---
How complex/tough is Hunter to play at a decently high level in PvP? I plan to focus mainly PvP. I don’t think I’m going to be in the top 1% of PvPers but I want to try and get into the top 10% at least. How tough is the Hunter micromanage? I’ve also toyed with Mage/Warlock/Priest as well. How tough are these by comparison?
---
Anybody can sign up for any segment that they wish. The early problems with massive queues shouldn't be significant in the long term. After the population decline begins, it will look like Vanilla: some servers (segments in this case) will be more popular and have queues. Some segments will not. 
---
In terms of balancing population totals I think the pragmatic approach would be to aggressively merge the first pair or trio of segments but not the entire cluster all at once. DT3 and DT5 might each be down to ~2,000 active so merge them into a segment with 4,000 active players.
---
Because most of us only worry if it breaks the game. If it's temporary and only in starter zones, it fixes more than it breaks.  To quote op's biggest concern:
---
&gt;"oh well anyway you dumbasses will keep playing so we'll just keep layering on forever"
---
Also, it isn't just about queues. A bigger problems is mostly empty servers 6 months t.
---
+1
---
Sadly it is working as intended. My whole point is that it should not be in Classic. This mechanic is game breaking for Classic. Most WoW players might not think its a big deal because we have dealt with phasing and sharding crap since the end of WOTLK. But this is just one of the many reasons we have wanted Classic for so long. Because being invisible on the same server and then magically reappearing on the same server is terrible for the MMORPG and its community.
---
You'll be able to get gear in pvp, all depends on if if you can play more than 10 hours a week.
---
If not, you can still play, but will be undergeared.
---
Still playable, just don't 1v1.

Tell me what now?
---
Do you enjoy kiting? How do you deal with mobs around the world while kiting?
---
It could last for months. “Gone by the end of Phase 1”
---
Server merges are fucking shitty for everyone involved and more importantly it seriously fucks with the whole community building aspect that takes place when a server is created.
---
&gt; Tell Curtis his 6k kc ely wasn’t active or interactive  
---
You're not really being fair here. You're comparing one of the *most* involved activities in one game to one of the *least* involved activities in another. A better example of average Runescape grinding is leveling a skill to 99 which can range from literally afk your way there ala fishing and woodcutting to deargodwhy while trying to level agility.
---
No it does not. The vast majority of these posts are chicken little posts. Far too little understanding of how layering works. 
---
You will not be able to find an empty layer with untouched nodes. If you’re layered it’s because the one you were in was full and they moved people into the next one. Empty layers don’t just exist waiting to be a found and plundered. 
---
Layers are created and removed *as needed*, and each layer will be the size of one continent’s population. 
---
So much handwringing and not enough people taking the time to understand what layering actually is and how it works. 
---
*Furthermore*, layering will be completely removed by the end of phase one *if not before*.
---
If I wanted to play BfA, I’d go play BfA.

I like the idea of having a "vannila uncut" server

I had unstoppable force in vanilla and played feral. I cant remember though, did the stun proc happen in cat form?
---
Lol great post...
---
Eye for an Eye isn't mitigation it's reflected damage, like a very op thorns
---
Experience pvp wise. I played both, up till rank 10 or 11  on horde. Both scales well with your skill. if you factor in  racial skills, alliance has good use of the dwarf and ne while imho no real value for the mage races. Horde has valuables for both classes. 
---
To sum it up, hunter is more versatile and more rewarding as you get better and less predictable. Mage is more forgiving for mistakes and scales better with gear but having less utility to survive.
---
I loved the last more, liked the risk factor. :)
---
Not great, not terrible
---
Garrisons are worthless now and we're not an equivalent to housing at all.

***trolls***
---
Lol go alliance then.
---
Mob speed and aggro radius vary between types of mobs. From what I have heard beasts have smaller radius, but run faster.
---
I don't believe so.  A believe 'movement impairing' effects are only those that either reduce movement speed (hamstring, crip poison) or perhaps immobolize too (frost nova, counterattack).
---
Beta access here. Pretty sure this is a bug and it's related to the bug we have been seeing recently with people getting kicked off of the mount mid flight path. It's a layering thing.
---
Alot of us have reported it, I'm sure it's getting looked at.

Dude it's going to be the most Hella litty thing ever, it's like a remastered song from 15 years ago

Even if you don't min/max, decent Feral DPS can and will outdps your avrg rogue/warri easily.

No king rules forever my son.
---
&gt; Anyone who played ESO at launch knows how layering will go over.
---
I played SWTOR and I've seen it. It is bad for WoW Classic. Layering is functional system mechanically and has advantages for convenience but is devastating to the social climate and immersion.
---
This is the best thing I've seen since sliced bread. exactly what we needed.
---
Rush to bestial wrath man.
---
Yes bro this was a big moment in my preteen years. I loved this server, decked out in T0 and sick epics for all the other slots. I would watch every pvp video of a class and then replicate rotations on the PTR. I was straight rolling scrubs with every class. I remember loving to zap ppl with ele sham, destroying as a conflag lock and even killing people in a HoJ as a shockadin. THOSE WERE THE DAYS MAN

Yeah...I did an hour 58 mins on Nighthaven. Plenty of people in the way. I’ll take that as a good time
---
Can't do - it's 2019 and blizzard caters to players with $ not players with interest.
---
You won’t find an empty, untouched layer. If you’re put into the second layer on a server (because as posted already, we’re talking Blizzlike caps of ~3k, you’ll only see two layers), there will be just as many players there competing for the same nodes you are.
---
you will auto attack while leveling expecting it to get better later, just to autoattack until eternity then respec holy and use flash of light until forever, refreshing 15minute buffs  
---
paladin is very VERY boring to play, even with all the gear in the world you just rely on stars to align and everything critting
---
Why do you need to have be level 5?
---
Sure thing, if you plan on leveling 1 week after launch and not launch day :)
---
I don't understand why we can't have fun. It's a game :)
---

---
Time to become a full time steamer ;)
---
Haha I’ll be day 1. Going for sub 3 hours with how crowded it’ll be
---
Remember the 6 gorillion.
---
\^ This.   
---
If we look at unending life and give it a dps value due to stats, and look at unending life, (the one with the lowest feral ap value) it will double the DPS gained from equipping this stat stick.
---
You got a better solution do you?

They're only slightly more popular. There are also a ton of people that have come to this reddit and probably not voted. What's super important is the balance of A:H on each Server though. Overall we're talking 53:47.
---
Imagine being so retarded that you defend layering in classic.
---
Then why did you say you painted it
---
I have no evidence, but I believe unlooted corpses tend to hang around longer than looted ones.
---
Yeah OP is dumb for that one, it won't only be in starter zones though - that's why everyone is "freaking out" about the exploitation of it.
---
I feel like they'll 100% have layering out by phase 2 but might push that back a little when they realize populations aren't down 80% like they expect.
---
That Paladins in Classic are one of the worst gameplay of the game lol
---
I started to watch wc3 tft cutscenes.
---
Let's say I forgot tons of stuff about the story, so it's quite entertaining.
---
Alliance is the new Horde.
---
That has nothing to do with server load.
---
I thought Brigam Girdle was getting delayed due to progressive itemisation
---
It was one of the catchup items added very late to UBRS
---
That's pretty cool. It looks like the exactly opposite now of 52.4% Horde and the rest Alliance. This is only a sample from Classic Reddit though as far as I'm aware.
---
Yes, but it's not fair when just 1 guy loot/kill the rare of all 3 other layers
---
someone has to sit in back, out of combat, to rez all the suckers who stand in fire   
---
Nice! Twice the length of the video.
---
Cane here to say this exact same thing.
---
I've been told it's about the same as a chest x-ray.
---
If you plan on going pvp server and soloing- get your butthole ready for phase 2.
---
I used to kite the last boss in UBRS into the beasts room whilst the group killed the adds.
---
In BWL it was a common strategy to use hunters to kite dragonkins on the first boss. From memory up to 12 could spawn and the other people doing kiting were so bad I used to sometimes kite all of them.
---
The MC bow quest makes kiting more or less mandatory, there are a few strategies but the ones I used involved kiting on all the demons. You can technically get another hunter to do the quest for you, but that's naughty and the other hunter will end up kiting instead :)
---
Furthest raid progression I achieved was 3rd boss in BWL, so cannot really comment on encounters past that.
---
I'd recommend getting the hang of only using Aspect of the Cheetah when absolutely necessary as you will just daze yourself otherwise. 
---
Basically use it when you need to extend the gap between you and a mob rather than always, very useful on first boss in BWL where there are cleaves from mobs you aren't kiting that you will pass throughout the first phase.
---
Rush to bestial wrath and let your pet do the dirty work.
---
That's one of the reasons why hunters level so fast 'n' easy.
---
Sulfuras of course!! Ret prio!
---
Can layering even be disabled by zone?  My understanding of it is that a layer is an entire virtual world.
---
I'm thinking of it like virtual machines.  The server is the hardware.  Each layer is a VM.  You can turn a whole VM off, or add a separate one.  You cannot have half of a VM.
---
Not allowed here, hope your post stays up if the mods are sleeping!

The rank 10 pvp gear is usually comparable to mc/bwl gear. Rank 10 isn't too hard to reach might take a couple weeks at the end where you push a bit more.
---
Ah, the braveness of Horde in all its majesty I see.
---
A better leader would account for the fact that sometimes druids can and will need to takedown/finish targets on their own.
---
Lmao that’s just completely untrue and you’re spreading bullshit. Good luck playing feral in a decent guild come Classic.
---
I got my old account back a month ago, my orc rogue still has that mask.

It's a must have. When I twink my old rogue I'm sure going to make the long journey to get the mask back.

They broke Tmorph for a while on retail, but some people got it working again. There was a controversy recently with people model editing that resulted in some stiff pentalties that were ultimately reverted to warnings. 
---
I'd imagine if you have never received a warning for non-exploitative model editing you will at least get warned first if you are caught.
---
I've done model editing on and off for a long time and I've never been banned or warned. 
---

Worked like that in AV -
---
This launch day “every mob is camped and I have to wait in line for respawns” only lasts like 2-3 days in my experience, the 10-30 zones might still be crowded but it’s nothing like launch valley of trials / durotar.
---
I don’t see a need for layering past the first week with regards to player pops, unless we just admit layering isn’t to fix pops but to protect against server deaths
---
Shaman is faster because they see zero downtime between 1-10.  With rockbiter weapon they melee like a truck so they don’t need to spend their mana except to keep that up every 5 minutes and to pull from a distance if wanted.  Outside that they can use it to heal.  They don’t need to drink or eat and can out damage a warrior at that level easily.  Accidentally pull two mobs?  Not a problem.  They’re literal beasts inside the first 10 levels.
---
I only remember 2 times hunters "had to" kite that was the final Boss in UBRS to give the grp Time to kill the adds First and the 2.Time The first Boss in bwl (i never got Into naxx and dont remember kiting in aq)
---
I don't know how they've implemented it but almost definitely yes, given that separate zones and especially continents seem to (usually) be in separate layers.
---
https://youtu.be/RKf8w7DDIMc
---
No - it will be like vanilla.
---
It was just one: Soda.
---
Your list has items from Onyxia, Azuregos and Magmadar. 
---
Some items also don't have the proper 1.12 itemization.
---
I find it odd that you find it odd that other people can be more or less organised than you in different parts of life and that you feel the need to assume this is a general problem OP has and not a once off issue of losing a logon for a 10 year old game. Odd . Very odd.
---
You may prefer it, but I don't. I have limited play time and I'd rather have layering and the associated downsides than staring at a queue for hours on end. I've seen what the lots of servers, queues, and merges solution looks like in retail and it isn't pretty. 
---
In 2005, my brother, after a couple months of trying, convinced me to play WoW. The first time we tried to log in, we met a multi-hour queue. I was completely shocked that this game I was paying a subscription for was unplayable. We tried multiple realms until we found a new one with no queue. Eventually that realm got merged. The merge destroyed the realm and us and damn near everyone else transferred off.
---
Fuck that. I'll take no lifers exploiting layering for a few months over not playing and watching my server community melt any day.
---
Are you uniformed or deliberately holding back key information?
---
Pally healer bis is mostly cloth with some leather.
---
Blacksmithing will be fine for some gold making.
---
Yeah, but spellcasters will think twice before to trigger a critical cast on you.
---
It's like an audit, audit doesn't prevent people to commit an accounting crime. But the fear to get caught by the audit prevent people to commit an accounting crime.
---
me too thanks
---
I don’t think that’s true. There’s a “professional” exception for people like lawyers.
---
Thanks. This is really useful and exactly what I was looking for.
---
And people thought the game would be what they remembered, this is what you get when you mix hope and hype.
---
Hah
---
1. There's a stable system where you can store your inactive pets. There's a pet tab where you can see your current pet's stats. Loyalty, happiness, etc.
---
2. I can't remember this one, sorry.
---
3. Yep, you're right.
---
4. Your tiger will eat most meats and you don't need to cook for your pet. It'll eat raw meat. Mostly from beasts. Wolves, birds, turtles, etc. Turtles are good for hearty meat.
---
Classic will have the original pet system in it which is a lot more complex than the current system. There's addons like PetFeeder and SmartPet, etc. The icon is always visible on screen so it shouldn't be hard to spot if you just learn to keep an eye on it. Much like rogues with combo points and locks with soul shards.
---
Everquest currently has a very similar feature in place.  Switching layers is handled manually by the players instead of it being an automated system that the game handles itself.  
---
Essentially, once enough players are in a specific zone, a new layer is created.  Players can manually pick their layer by typing /pick.  There is a cool down associated with it to prevent abuse. The cool down is also triggered by combat, etc.
---
I think a similar arrangement would work in WoW, just altered a bit to fit the game.  Make it so players are randomly assigned to their layer when they login, and then they have to manually switch to a different layer in a rested zone area if they want to switch.  Things like combat, looting, harvesting, etc. should put a CD in place to prevent potential abuse. 
---
Ideally, the only reason somebody should be switching layers is if they want to group with players in a different layer.  This system would allow for that while heavily mitigating many of the negative aspects of the system that have become a big topic as of late. Things like abusing the system for specific drops, nodes, mobs, etc.
---
Honestly I’d prefer the whole system was just turned off, but I don’t think that’s going to happen.  Hoping a better system can be developed before launch, and that its only needed for a very small period of time before its turned off...
---
in hindsight one of those should have been demons
---
also maybe demon trolls? joined the legion maybe?
---
The biggest difference will be threat meters.  IIRC, threatmeters didn't come out til Naxx near the end of Vanilla.
---
Other than that, the ability for addons to choose targets and/or abilities for the player was removed around the time AQ came out I believe.  That functionality will not be there in classic.  So basically addons will have about the same affect.  Healers and decursers will have to play the game from the start and everyone will have easier time with threat management.
---
I want to do this, but I'm torn on which class to main of my three main choices and don't want to do this much work for all of them lol
---
Yep. Any targetable mobs, stealthed or not are subject to a cleave. If you're fighting a warrior and a stealthed rogue is in cleave range, they will be hit and taken out of stealth.
---
As far as I can tell it's true.
---
This so much. I only played UO on a private RPG server but man having your own house felt amazing. It was always one of the first goals I had for my characters.... UO man, those wee the days.
---
Great reply, thanks. I agree that it is clunky. I've always held that this is a messy situation that requires the least-bad messy solution and, with my prior experience with sharding in a few MMORPGs, I and every cell in my body agree that sharding/layering is about the worst possible thing to do from a player perspective. Because we expect 80% of the players to try it and dip out the only question that I'm concerned with is: what is the experience like for the remaining 20% of the players. And, from that perspective, having to be anonymous on a sharded (layered) server is the worst way to do this. 
---
&gt;Add them as a friend.
---
I think that's a good plan but let me tell you about Jaquays the Mage and the guild I ended up in for 1 1/2 years. I was questing in Northern STV in 2005 on my Mage and saw a fellow doing some dynamic Magery that I'd not yet seen / imagined possible. We grouped up and had a good time together knocking out some quests but he had to go to work. We didn't quite make enough of a connection that we friended up. 
---
That evening when I got back from classes we came across one-another again and grouped up. I asked him to show me how this kiting thing he was doing with his frosts spec works and we bonded over shared knowledge and questing. Friended. 
---
After he logged off I leveled past him and soon moved on to Un'Goro Crater. There I came across a trio of people in a guild who were killing Devilsaurs. I told them to "watch this" and soloed one with the kiting tactics that Jaquays tought me a few days prior. They were impressed and invited me to their group and, later that day, their guild. 
---
Fast forward a few months and I'm an officer in that guild, many of my questing buddies had been recruited by me, we'd grown from a 10-man UBRS guild to server first Hakkar to a 40-man presence, getting server thirds in BWL. I see Jaquays has left his guild and tell him to get the hell into my guild and hurt NPCs with us. He joins and we reunite and become better buddies. 
---
If it were layered would I have seen Jaquays that second time? Would I have learned to kite and impress the dudes from the guild that ended up meaning a lot to me? I don't think so. I think he and I would have zoned into a different layer later that day and we'd not have had that instructive evening together. 
---
That's the value of one world to me. I've seen in ESO, retail, and SWTOR how people become nebulous presences with these sharding systems and I pray that the Classic fan base pressures Blizzard not to make this mistake.
---
There already is a fix for everything, it's called queues :(
---
Fuck layering
---
Thanks, what a pitty, so many cool pets, so few space :(
---
Don't get me wrong, spell damage is nice, but it's not nice on *most* plate gear.  For example, every piece of Judgment armor has a better non-set alternative.  The spreadsheet I linked shows this well.  The first spell power items you see used come from Avengers set in AQ40, which makes sense because those pieces also have heavy +Str with +Agi and +crit as well.  Even then I'm sure he was very close to using non-set alternatives for phase 6 BiS gear.
---
The flippant response of a single developer does not dictate the long-term goals of a company.
---
You are using that as your leading argument. Really? I wonder why no one is taking you seriously.
---
30+ zones? Ion said layering will be gone entirely before phase 2. If they keep it around in any zone, they fucked us.
---
for the first build: why do you need 5% melee crit, with healing weapons and gear, your physical hits are wet noodle damage. Rather move it into judgement+crusader/vindication
---
SoC - seal of command or crusader? Also you probably meant holy shock, holy fire is priest
---
I hate to admit it but...you’re absolutely right.
---
Well yes it is but your body will still adapt quite a lot if you force it.
---
Well, you might just need practice. The whole core thing I initially replied to was:
---
&gt;Everything my level can kill me before I kill it if I can’t kite it.
---
I replied because I hear so many people say hunters suck pre-10, but it doesn't make sense. Other classes are not doing better - hunter kill speed, even pre-10, is pretty high. And on top of that you generally eat way less than melee while using way less mana than casters. They are also one of the best at sniping mobs, which will come in handy at a busy launch.
---
I think people just look at how faceroll hunter is with a pet and think "well, then they suck before", but that is not a fair comparison. You need to compare pre-10 hunter with *the other classes* pre-10. And for this hunters are in a sweet spot.
---
But are there any items for paladin in blacksmithing? I don‘t remember them tbh
---
&gt; Edit. I think the very starting areas can be racist (might be wrong) so I'd go over at 10+.
---
Only one small inconsequential quest chain and your class quest (if you’re not a Pally) are blocked off.  He’d be ok.
---
Phase 1 could last months. It could last longer than the entire beta.
---
Imo, even without precision MKB mechanics you can be a force to be reckoned with in BG's especially. Hunters who have good situational awareness and use the terrain to their advantage will do great in PvP. I say this because back in my vanilla days I was a keyboard turning clicker and I still regularly found ways to top HK and damage charts in BG's.
---
So of you can learn to keybind intelligently, mouse turn and jump kite in the year 2019, I think you'll have a blast as a hunter in PvP.
---
For sure, but on the other hand it will make the few you have feel all the more special! :D
---
Anything, this game is neither hard nor designed for hardcore players. Any class you pick will get you to lvl 60. 
---
There is hardly any raid in vanilla that becomes irrelevent, because of specific items that are always sought after. It's a great game to play casually.
---
Just awareness and being able to flick your camera around and back fast while strafing to see what's in the direction you're kiting.
---
If you kill everything in your path there won't be any mobs behind you  :)
---
Man they really need to fix the gnome size. It's bugging Tf out of me
---
I assume they'll remove it completely but it won't be a problem for me if they have to leave it on for starter zones for one more phase as it wont give people an unfair advantage.

Because we "thank" them by paying for a subscription. We don't need to thank businesses. It's a transaction. Blizzard aren't making Classic for the love of the game. They're making it because people like me and many others will resub to play it.
---
I would strong recommend not playing hunter if you want to do competitive DPS past MC.
---
The classes that start pulling ahead of you, even early on in BWL are quite often not having to pay attention to their rotation either.
---
They are fun to play and I found the shot timing engaging and you can prevent wipes if you understand your CC well.
---
However you have to put a lot more effort into your rotation than most classes and face constant the near constant huntard stigma, despite all classes being riddled with shit players.
---
Daily reminder, you’re a sheep
---
I don’t really feel as though I was “boasting” about my hours.  I’m not sure you interpreted by original post the right way.
---
I’m also sort of failing to see how this disapproval of yours wouldn’t equally apply to playing WoW 12 hours a day. 
---
If you want to know more about this kind of industry, you can Google “big law.”  That’s all I’ve got for you.
---
Yeah you’ll be fine with the rank 10 blue set (it’s good in BGs) but try to get a mc/zg pug for a decent weapon.
---
You will be a little bit behind for the first while. It will get worse the longer the game goes on. There are options for people who would just like to play PvP at 60 in equal gear, if you're interested I would have to PM you.
---
Love tauren, love shaman, but dislike all other horde races, to include the cities and zones beside tb.

Since I'm not sure how much I'll be able to raid, both Dal'rends and Truestrike shoulders will be spicy enough for me.

The overpopulated servers aren't the problem, it's the ones getting one or two layers that are in risk of dying.

Is it fair when 1 guy loots the rare in 1 layer?

---
&gt;Remember they remade the crash bandicoot and spyro games? Exact same art style (same art in almost every level/enemy) but its just...... beautiful compared to the originals.
---
See, this is my point - it is fine that you think so, but not everyone share your opinion. Personally I *hate* the Crash Bandicoot new art.
---
&gt;WoW can keep its art style but still jump from 1999 to 2019
---
And you are kind of bending the truth to make your opinion seem more "right". We never had 1999 graphics in WoW. We had 2004 graphics. Vanilla did not look 1999 *at all*. It looked 2004. And modern WoW is like a whole different game in terms of graphics, it looks *way* better.
---
Not only are you saying WoW looks like 1999 which it didn't even do at *release*, you completely ignore how much it has improved. It's fine you don't like it, but don't diminish it that much just to try and win an argument.

So hyped
---
Because some people feel threatened. They'll look bad when there's a feral coming into the raid, that beats them on DPS.
---
Once BWL hits you start to handicap yourself, some decent items in there.
---
Once AQ hits you are refused invites for not having AQ items due to how gamebreaking they are.
---
Once Naxx hits you can uninstall the game and have a larger impact on a bg than being in pvp gear.

Most definitely.  Anyone who's done the DM:E farm or any other repetetive AOE farming can attest that if you miss a corpse in the 'loot pile' if you go back a bit later the looted one's disappear and the ones with loot remain.

looks badass, this makes me want to play warrior.

I bought this as well, for something like 4-5g, though I preferred the Disgusting Oozeling that I spent something like 22 hours farming for. Looking green was the best.

I also got the Green Whelpling while levelling my first character, I didn't even know it was a companion pet until later, just saved it in my bank.

---
I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
The combo is great, maybe not the fastest leveling but almost unstoppable.
---
You'll both need to work as a team though, so as the priest don't open up with mind blast while your warrior friend is charging in, because the mob will turn towards you and it is no fun as a warrior chasing mobs all the time. And the warrior needs to keep a look out for adds  or hit each mob in a group at least once, otherwise you'll tank them all after just a small hot or heal. Stuff like that, it is not complicated and you'll easily learn which will also help in dungeon groups etc.
---
But if you do work together, there is not a lot that you can't do. You'll get dungeon groups almost immediately if you play healer/tank, you can probably duo most elite quests and survive even bad pulls or respawns. And you will have very little downtime if you play smart.
---
shill, just get rid of layering.
---
IF THERE ARE NO UNARMORED MOUNTS AVAILABLE I WILL HAVE TO CAPS LOCK INTENTIONAL
---
Aye, so no point even bothering spending time on the game when I'm just gonna fall more and more behind due to the fact that I can't raid. I just wanted to play PVP 2h-3h every other day and still get decent geared so I don't get shit by people in pvp just due to the gear difference.

Guess I'll have to stick to a dead Battlerite game in order to get some nice pvp, lol'd

Spent a couple of weeks camping for Broken Tooth on my 39 hunter twink. Had a Bow of Searing Arrows and I'd frequently oneshot people in WSG with Aimed Shot. Those were the days.
---
Transmog would be bad in classic but I am surprised they have never introduced dyeing ... similar to UO for example. That would make a huge impact on customisation of your char while not breaking the immersion at all.. hell it could be added in as an extra profession...
---
Think about all the cow puns you can pull off if you choose horde.
---
That's probably why Blizzard is giving relevance to twitch streamers, their audience is typically young, if they get hooked it can spark the birth of a new generation of wow players.
---
Are you wanting to play daggers? Or are you wanting to play swords? Because human is the best for min/max if you are going to play swords the extra 5 weapon skill is amazing for swords and pve. Stoneform is huge vs warriors, hunters or rogues. Because you can clear the dots that they apply and then vanish via it's use. Gnome is also really good due to the fact that you get escape artist to break you out or roots. Such as imp hamstring, imp wingclip or Frost nova. So as alliance it is really just preference on what you want an advantage fighting in pvp. Or how you look. Like Nelf doesn't bring anything to the table aside from highest base Agility and one level of increased stealth. So the choice really comes down to what you feel like looking like or playing. If you want to be truly unique, play a female dwarf rogue. You will probably be one of maybe 3 on the whole server.
---
Face it. You're a filthy casual now.
---
I highly doubt Phase 1 will last much longer than a month. Even so, layering isn't necessarily going to be in the game for the entirety of Phase 1, they just said that Phase 2 is the Hard Stop of layering, no matter what. Who's to say that they won't remove it sooner.  
---
Also, we don't know how layering is going to work once the game is actually launched. People are freaking out about how it is functioning in Beta. If you payed attention to the Stress Tests, this was the thing that they were focusing on the most. They were actually forcing layering randomly just to see how it was functioning. 
---
Layering is a new concept, of course there are going to be bugs. Doesn't mean they won't iron it out.
---
Yeah this isn’t working as intended. This melee leeway mechanic is not vanilla like.
---
Thanks.  I was thinking of it too much in terms of old wow.  Since they can do sharding then they can definitely do what you're suggesting.
---
I'm OCE mate. we will be lucky to get 3 servers. stick your high horse attitude somewhere where people care.
---
tfw wow turns you into a hard working citizen.
---
Vanilla def had PTR I made a ton of cool memories on them. I loved the full nemesis Orc warlock they would give you. So fun to succubus+soul fire
---
Firstly what level are you? Because you can always go outside of Thunderbluff and get yourself The Rake. Cat with 1.2 Attack speed. He is pretty good for leveling all the way through.
---
&gt;I dont think you understand the term "ceiling". It implies it's harder to master.
---
Eh, *you* seem to not understand it. A skill ceiling does not imply harder to master. A skill ceiling is basically how much you can improve from skill. A mage also have a skill ceiling in PvE, it is just ridiculously low.
---
&gt;Now I should have said "extremely high compared to mage" but the sentiment remains.
---
But you didn't. Those two things are vastly different. Being harder than a mage that spams frostbolt does not mean a rogue is hard. This is so important because you give advice as if rogues are hard to play. Just because they are more complex than literally spamming one key does not mean they are even remotely hard to play for anyone older than 5 years.
---
My biggest issue with the folks who are blindly onboard with layering without any concern, is that most of them repeat “it’ll be gone in two weeks, who cares.”
---
Ion Hazzikostas said it will be gone before Phase 2. Phase 1 could last months. It could last longer than the entire beta. 
---
Also keep in mind that that same guy, Ion Hazzikostas, is the reason WoW sucks balls today. He has ran this game into the ground with more and more sharding/phasing/layering. The PvP toggle in BfA is a prime example. 
---
I am much more acceptable to sharding the starting zones for three weeks, than sharding the entire game for 3+ months.
---
They already sent a beta survey asking if people would pay for level boosts.
---
Where do I sign up?
---
Free money for posting stuff? Deal.
---
At least for police, military, hospitals.   
---
Still in Germany we have mandatory breaks between shifts in every sector. Of course as a nurse you work longer shifts, no surprise.   
---
Many companies here push their employees to their limits in terms of working hours. That applies also to lawyers.  
---
Our Arbeitsschutzgesetz (Work Law?) manages this stuff pretty good
---
A cat with fast AS for PvP and a wolf for raiding, ...  dunno whether I will have a special feeling or not.
---
Maybe the real issue is: today we know them all, all these rare cool pets.
---
Yeah, but do keep in mind that with resto gear you get from raids and maybe just a few other pieces you can play quite well as ele in PvP. So playing resto means you get gear for two specs. No, it won't be absolutely optimal ele gear, but good enough.
---
What is the best pet to use to mind control and grief lowbie zones with?
---
This is me too but as an Alliance player and going for a Tauren Shaman haha.
---
I'm gonna go ahead and assume you're referring to Shedo. First of all he was an officer in the guild he was in so he was able to take Band of Accuria, DFT, Prestors Talisman  amongst other BIS items that fury warriors/rogues would want. He lost in DPS to those same classes on every single fight he shows in the video &amp; in the same video it's nitpicked boss fights that last 60 seconds tops. 
---
Good luck on getting all that gear and still losing to the same classes you're robbing. But hey your flamegor/ebonroc dps will be HUGE.
---
Threat meters were definitely a thing before AQ. Likely not as refined, but I remember having to download threat meters very early on in raiding.
---
yea who cares about not topping epeen dmg meters
---
raiding, esp with old ass vanilla content, is a means to an end
---
and that end is getting sikkk purples and flexing on noobs in the open world
---
It makes it despawn faster, but despawning doesn't affect spawn rates.
---
Primary source of PvP is Wsg or AB premates, wsg especially.
---
AV will always be a PvE rush it's a terrible BG.
---
That’s what I’m saying! 
---
Look at venruki, cdew and all those top level players destroy their opponents.
---
Being good at retail = being good at classic.
---
Game sense, awareness etc... can be much better learned in retail than in classic IMO.
---
But only if you are willing to break the hand-holding mold.
---
I don't see how it could ruin server communities or economies, as layering in and of itself is basically just multiple realms merged together with the whole world being one larger instance. The only functional difference between layering and this method is that you wouldn't be able to jump between layers (or realms). But the individual realms (or layers) are ready to be merged ***as needed*** as population dwindles. The individual realms (call them layers if you want) could potentially remain separate for years if their population is strong or be merged within a year if their population shrinks rapidly, but it offers that flexibility.
---
What on earth did I even just read?
---
Yeah I'm aware of implementations like this. It's actually very common in Eastern MMOs, and usually called "Channels".
---
I'm not sure how challenging that would be to implement though, whether it'd be an easy "addon" to their sharding/layering system or if it'd require a substantial rewrite.
---
But since they haven't discussed anything along those lines, I don't know if it's on the table.
---
I disagree. I remember clearly you only get flagged on a PVE server in enemy capitals.
---
Layering will have a negative impact on what is arguably the most important part of classic wow, the social dynamics.
---
I actually do
---
Generally aggro range seems low, if you compare to private servers. Same could be said on elite damage. Doesnt make either of those things wrong tho...
---
Other MMOs do that, there are sub servers and players can select on which one to play. There is also a cooldown when you switch them so you cannot "realm hop"
---
The game was designed for casual players, leveling itself is fun.
---
Raiding could be hard since you need to farm some consumables for it but the difficulty is not the hardest so you should be able to visit some raids here and there.
---
And that was a bad thing? That just proves that Blizz can do awesome decisions. Go Blizz!!!

Anybody who doesn't care much is going to read your post and immediately feel a bit more well-inclined TOWARD layering because of your tone. Check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXjH3duyLKc&amp;list=PLLoHDco6st8zQ1gQjYRDzrKW_C9MOoUYr&amp;index=46&amp;t=99s if you're curious to see how to make a fair and compelling point. 
---
Whether you do or don't, know that you will *never* shame someone into agreeing with you. You're making it harder for those of us opposed to layering. It's important that we logically and calmly explain the reasons why layering is such a bad idea and invite the community to have rational opposition to it. Blizzard will pay attention to that.
---
I think it was made by the same people, but it wasn't Roflmao. It was actually like an episode of a series. With similar characters.
---
I’m no expert but dps is dps.  If you have rage and empty gcds then why not
---
Launch nightmares only last 1-3 days then the zerg moves on, layering is pointless and most people would not even "benefit" from the intended benefits.
---
As long as you can switch layers through grouping up or relogging, as it is nowadays, it will have terrible impact on game economy.
---
Lucky crits.
---
Id say it only affects the corpse despawn, shouldnt make any difference in reSPAWN timers tho.
---
Just got this from amazon last night, already 30 pages in. Amazing read so far.
---
Haha wow! I think it is (can't wear headphones atmo, but it looks like the stuff i remember)! Thanks for the help!
---
A famous copy pasta
---
Well on the Beta Client we see Ally being forced flagged while being in Tirisfal Glades to go to SM.
---
Not for the one viable spec.
---
Go engineering.
---
I immediately heard the Ironforge theme in my head while looking at this.
---
Cat for high damage, speed and stealth
---
The well cleansing chain is also race locked (starting with Poison Water)
---
I just don't think it's good game/server design to have a lottery of 'good' and 'bad' servers.
---
As I mentioned, clustering could be one of the best solutions, but I'd have the proviso that the clusters would definitely merge together at phase 2, queues or no.
---
This would be a compromise between making sure you're with all your friends, and also getting a 'good' server.
---
I believe it's still a thing if you have Windfury there.
---
You should be okay, but bear in mind the well cleansing chain quest is locked to Tauren only. If you're using a leveling guide, you'll have to adjust.
---
Yeah omen was around for ages that guys chatting shit.
---
That's not what hes asking.
---
I love Holy/Reck, but a few minor changes I would suggest
---
Dump Improved Sor, and go into divine STR instead.  Improved SoR does a very minor increase to the seal damage itself because (at least on pservers) it doesn't take sp scaling into effect, so it only does +15% on the BASE damage of the spell instead of taking your +sp into account.  So the talent only boosts each hit on a 3.5 speed weap by like.. 1 damage per talent point.  The judgment damage is boosted by slightly more but maybe like.. 4 or 5 damage per point instead.  Underwhelming!  Will be very curious to see if it scales cumulatively in Vanilla. 
---
Forget about improved Devo aura- redoubt can at least play that handy sound when you are crit, letting you know you have a reck stack. 
---
Forget 5/5 anticipation and put it into toughness instead.  Armor will reduce more damage in PVP settings than the +def will. 
---
Put 2/3 improved Conc aura, and then only 4/5 spiritual focus achieves the same effect (100% damage-proof heals with conc aura) + 10% silence resist to you and group allies.   You have the two points leftover as well, one from holy tree and one from the 1/5 toughness. 
---
Here's my take on holy/reck, with a pure PVP focus so I'm dropping BoSanc and the improved BOW.  Very fun spec!
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#syLuMxooVGp0cbx
---
I’d love to know how you think this is going to have a huge impact on the economy.
---
It’s not like you’re hopping into a fresh instance here - you’re moving into a layer with people farming just like your old layer lol.
---
This. The corpses will stay longer if you don't loot them, but it doesn't affect spawning rate. At least on private it is.
---
&gt;I personally wouldn't ever attack someone when unprovoked.
---
Neither would I.  Picking Horde is enough to provoke my daggers into your back though.
---
I think people just sold their well geared accounts and are not retreiving them. Most if these posts anyway.
---
I'm sorry but your question is on the complete wrong end. You can clear a raid in 2 hours easily, but you won't  get a good enough pvp rank with 2 hours of play to get anywhere near to relevancy. PvP doesn't make you money aswell.
---
Probably rolling pve instead of pvp.
---
Your going to have to feed your pet, it won't be cheap.
---
You can only have 3 pets, 2 are perm, 3rd is dispencible pet, throw away.
---
Stable only has 3 so lots
---
So for me I run [https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tYt8t9t\_t.t\~ufuguhuivet-uaubucu2u3u4uquwyUuuuvu.uxuIuJuKuLuMuPuSuTuQuRu9uDuEuFuGuHyVyWyXy\_u8y.ujtmtwtv](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tYt8t9t_t.t~ufuguhuivet-uaubucu2u3u4uquwyUuuuvu.uxuIuJuKuLuMuPuSuTuQuRu9uDuEuFuGuHyVyWyXy_u8y.ujtmtwtv) The following spec, if you scroll to the bottom it shows you the build order i go. But i run hemo so that it is a lower cost for training and you still hit hard. This build is great for leveling and for world pvp. Only level up SS until you get hemo and only learn rank 1 and two of back stab because you are going for non daggers if possible. Front stabbing was not working for me on classic so daggers aren't really viable for leveling with unless in a party. But with that once you get to 30 it should save you a decent amount of gold leveling up.
---
Yes good catch on the quiver, but i'm reading conflicting sources if IAotH works on Aimed shot.
---
Can anyone confirm ?
---
My daggers will be ready to liberate any Alliance corpse you camp.
---
Right
---
Wow. Can you imagine a raid with huge cathedrals? Notre Dame of Scarlet Crusade...
---
It was really weird. A lot of experiments.  I might not have had Rez sickness. But I know I ran as a ghost for a long Time and spoke to the spirit healer at razor hill
---
Technically you have quite a few more „undead races“: they came in WOTLK and are called Death Knights... ;)
---
There will be 3-4 layers per server Im pretty sure
---
Daggers are the size of 1h swords, 1h swords are the same size as 2handers and 2handers are a bad immitation of final fantasy.
---
Because some dude randomly posting on the forums certainly wouldn't lie.. right?
---
The bans were reduced to warnings. So I'll ask again, were you uninformed or deliberately misleading?
---
That would be bad ass
---
Pretty sure all of us know exactly how it’s going to be on launch day, and it’s never anything like these videos where it’s deserted.
---
thanks
---
Yeah. Naturally I don’t know anything about EU or specific European countries’ laws. I did spend some time in our Italy office and they worked similar hours to what mine are in the US. We have two offices in Germany and they also work about as much. Can’t really speak to how it works in compliance with EU law or specifically German law, but rest assured it does. These kinds of jobs are generally known to be rough the way they are. They pay well and look good on a resume. Most people don’t stay more than 3-5 years, and some leave sooner. It’s sort of like paying your dues to get competitive jobs after this one.
---
Great thanks, I hadn't thought to check as I heard they had been shut down, but it makes perfect sense that there would be many others popping up :).
---
As long as you farm it and bring like a dozen a day 😫
---
I bought a new home with an extra room for me and wife got another cat. Im golden. 😄
---
What makes you think it wont last more than a month? Have checked the dates of the [original patch releases](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x) . I would assume they’d want to pace it the same as it was in 2004-2006. Phase 2 is Dire Maul. The DM patch came out four months after WoW released. The Phases will last months not weeks. This isn’t high speed BfA. 
---
Layering is not a new concept. Its exactly like sharding and we’ve had sharding forever. And most of us hate it. Only difference is the entire continent is sharded.
---
Eeh, min-max tends to take out the magic from most things imo. Who knows maybe there's some far-fetched pet we've overlooked? Unlikely, but one can dream.
---
The addon that wont work are things like Decursive. Which automatically targeted players and dispelled for you.
---
be Warrior
---
find \[Red Defias Mask\]
---
"i'Ll NeVeR bE aBlE tO eQuIp ThAt"
---
I am curious. What are the specs?
---
I don´t think this is true. Like i get your logic, but the times a caster has control over criting you or not, multiplied with the times he actively decides not to, because the enemy *may* have skilled eye for an eye and it may be a better choice not to do extra damage in this situation, is close to zero. Like literally one in 1000 duels, if at all.
---
Truth. There is a sad irony that the very thing many of hope to see restored to MMORPGs, the social climate, is being threatened by a sharding system *in the restoration of the original game* AND that the reason the outcry isn't significant is that people have forgotten the importance of the social climate. 
---
Catch 22. Can't restore the social climate with the layering system. Can't get enough people to oppose the layering system until they appreciate the social climate.
---
I dont think it will be capped at 6k. They clearly said, they will make less but bigger servers. I would guess it can go up to 12-15k. Now as long as it affect 1 person per server, its fcked up.
---
 Its cheating. Justify it however you want but at the end of the day you're no better than a child looking at your friends character in a split screen game so he doesn't sneak up on you.
---
its funny how they have to re-write all those systems again, just because they ported a 8.x version of the client, so that they can save time with b-net integration and so on, while this sounds ok at start, there are so many mechanics which were changed and now I bet they have a 1TB excel file with all the systems which needs to be rewritten/backported.
---
What is full r10 gear?  It is extremely unlikely I'll get beyond r10 with IRL stuff haranguing me, but I'm wondering what that really gets me.  I saw an epic helm but that was it.
---
Quickly ran through the video. Nice work! I’m looking to level a Druid as well, so this is helpful in terms of speed at their slowest point. 
---
One quick question - how did you find completing that dwarf quest for the picks (or ores, I forget)? I noticed you completed it, but many speed levellers avoid the quest altogether.
---
With your comment you are informing other people that there aren't that many hunters so you are actually increasing hunter numbers
---
Blizzard must hire you. This is one of the best art i ever seen in my hole life, this is amazin ( ́ ◕◞ε◟◕`)
---
People 'discovered' Nost over a longer period of time, via word-of-mouth. People playing on other servers only slowly switched over, stuff like that. That is somewhat similar to how the original vanilla grew, and it's the perfect way to create a natural, healthy population.
---
For Classic WoW, pretty much everyone who might be interested already knows about the game, knows the release date, planned out how to use their vacation days etc. The overwhelming majority of accounts will be created on launch week, and I expect very, very few new people to join after two months or so. Like, the whole playerbase will be there from day one, and it's only downhill from there.
---
So as I said, Nostalrius could pick up speed over time. Classic will be launched at top speed already. 
---
Replicating a growing population would be amazing for Classic and would remove any need for layering and similar stuff. But could you IMAGINE the outcry if Classic gradually unlocked to people, over several weeks or months?
---
Start the pirate raid patch with 1.14 after the 1.13 scarlet crusade raid... Emerald dream. So many things they could do
---
does not take that long to farm crowd pummelers. Just think of it like another consumable.
---
No question, horde baby :D
---
It was a thing quite long actually. Sure, it was gone by naxx, but those "autoheal" addons were a thing quite a while.
---
I dont think removing these has any real effect to most healers lives. Not sure if you can still do a "emergency" raid ui frame type thingy, that shows ui elements of ppl that are the lowest HP or something. What would essentially be same thing (well not auto selecting rank, but still kinda auto targeting). Mostly a alliance thing since they dont have shaman chain heal that includes smart targeting healing in itself.
---
But removing DECURSE addon will mean much, much more.
---
The only good item that comes to mind is [Dawnbringer Shoulders](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12625/dawnbringer-shoulders).
---
Why does this subreddit focus on just Omar? Yes he is the lead but there is a whole team behind him making this all possible. Can we crowd fund to put one up to thank the Classic Development team instead? I feel people are too stuck on how he made this possible. It was the private server communities, and the Nost team that made this dream a reality and now it is being completed by the wonderful Classic Wow Dev team.
---
It's one of those weird things, but I honestly remember those spawns being faster on retail vanilla. Particularly the Bingle's tools quests. I remember doing that one as a group, we'd go from tool spawn to tool spawn together, all quickly loot the tools as it spawned, then be done.
---
I get the feeling that the private servers just threw a blanket 5minute spawn time on quest items and ran with it, where actual vanilla had a much wider variety of spawn times depending on the quest.
---
Many people in the comments said it will not exist............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. Did not know the only thing I could write down here in the comments was a dirct answer.
---
No, you are not moving into a fresh instance, but it also doesnt guarantee, that the resources wont be there. Do you really think, that every zone, every node, every rare spawn, every chest, every herb will be cleared at the same time, so changing layers wont actually gives you an opportunity for double/triple loot? Now imagine, there will be players, who hit 60 in a week. Whole WSP,ESP, Silithus, Burning Steppes, Winterspring is for them to clear. Already a huge advantage. Now multiply it by 2/3/4 depends on how many layers it will be
---
In my (pserver) experience, paladins are really strong through level 10. Nothing 1v1 comes close to killing me, I always have moves I can use, et cetera. Warrior by comparison blows; no rage, auto-attack only, and Rend is legitimately worthless.
---
That said, I agree that hunters are still better in a lot of areas. Priests and mages have to drink for what feels like 50% of their playtime, at least until they get a wand. Warlocks too, probably. 
---
I'd argue that rogues do decent damage at low levels and feel fairly strong--not as good as a paladin but close. So far in my pre-10 adventures I'd rate them something like:
---
Paladin &gt; Rogue &gt; Hunter &gt; Everyone Else
---
After 10 this balance shifts to favor Hunter and I'm not so sure about the rest. I'll have to keep playing around to see what feels better after that. I'm pretty sure paladin falls off quickly, but seriously pre-10 pally feels incredibly strong!
---
I don't think hunters suck \*more than\* other classes pre-10 (except maybe compared to pally; their ability to 1v3 things at level 5-7 just makes them in-arguably stronger). 
---
I just felt like it was painful to kill most of the things my level or one level higher, but as it turns out, it was probably at least half my bad luck with dodge/parry/miss going on, plus unluckily getting crit twice in a row. :( I had it happen a bit more last night, but I played around with kiting and was able to successfully kite things 4 levels lower than me (I was level 9). When I hit 10 I did my hunter pet quests and wandered over to try and find Duskstalker (not even sure if he spawns tbh), and in the process practiced kiting some more. I did okay; I wasn't letting my first autoshot go off completely, so that extra bit of damage helped. I think a swing timer will be important come Classic for me; I play with a bit of a physical handicap as well as adhd and the combination means I rely a LOT on visual and/or audio cues. I used HearKitty for\*ever\* for combo points and holy power in retail because it was the only thing that helped me track it...even though it drove everyone who knew me insane. I think I used the swing timer more than I realized I did!
---
Curious about your opinion re: launch: I was doing the hunter taming quests last night... Do you think those will be a nightmare to complete at launch? I don't think the nightsaber and owl ones will be too bad, but I'm guessing the spider one might be pretty rough; if there are too many people playing, not sure how we'll be able to tame anything without someone trying to snipe it from us... Or does taming not work that way in Classic?
---
Sorry for the ramble; I think I'm procrastinating at work.
---
Holy shock isn't about DPS, it's about on demand burst damage. With T2 you can be quite tanky and hit very hard with your spellpower while still being a very effective healer.
---
Your original post goes along the line of : how can I play wow when I sometimes have to work 20hours and have a family life. Well obviously those days you cannot as you already cannot give yourself enough sleep to not be deprived in that week. So I wonder what is the purpose of asking a question with a self evident answer unless you want to put emphasis on your current situation.    
---
I also never said or justified that wow is a 12h /day activity but it shows it is your point of view. If you already see it this way then what kind of solution do you expect to be provided you. Wow was famous for its nolifers. For activities like high pvp ranking you will not be able to compete unless playing is your job, you can work remotely with flexible and limited hours, you are unemployed or spending the every breath of your spare time playing to the detriment of your social and work life.   
---
But I will give you some solution, a self evident one, play efficiently, with a reasonable goal and focusing on activities that are limited in time, play in a guild of older players which will have a big roaster to compensate for the many times a lot of them will have obligations that prevent them from playing.   
---
If you want to level up efficiently while enjoying the journey, a purpose in itself, try vanilla-questing.me, if your desire is to aim for 60 asap then you will have to do more research on your own in order to follow optimized routes of speel levelers (Joana for horde, hydramist for alliance or lesharq or others).
---
You sound like a classy guy/girl. Good luck in your future endeavours. I hope you learn to love all the creatures of the world.
---
Dual Freezing Band for mages as BiS, for P1 and P2 is nearly impossible. I mean technically you are right, but in the world how many can get them? 10-15 ppl? 
---
Some other alternative would be great.
---
wow i didnt know that. thats fucked up
---
Owl&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Otter pets
---
Amen
---
2-3h per day pvp only is not enough to get decently geared with pvp, either.
---
Hehe, you did the right thing.  I was trying to be funny.  Obviously no one else thought so, lol!
---
Okay, you got me there. But there are not the wow stereotypical undead we know and love.
---
First one is perfect.
---
Second one is really strange. Improved Wisdom does close to nothing on this level while concecration is always nice to have. The Holy/Ret mix is a little bit weird on this level, because you don´t have any burst without holy shock anyway and the few points in the Ret tree don´t give you that much damage. It´s not bad tho.
---
Third one is kinda bad in my opinion. If you want to burst from time to time, you´ll need holy shock. Sanctity aura is nice for DPS, but without vengeance, you won´t do that much damage anyways.
---
Trick question, the LK model.
---
It's stories like THIS one that make Classic as good as it was.  No one cared that they died that many times, they got a sweet helmet with NO stats , and it was completely worth it.
---
Looks good if you will be pvping along the way, thanks man ill save this
---
Hey! I haven't checked out any guides, as I find enjoyment in discovering things myself. I simply integrated that dwarf quest into the route, as its next to the harpy spot and on the way to TB for my heartstone anyway! (Heartstone is later used when getting bear form. So Macro wise it might be smart to just do the dwarven tools?)
---
Theres a quick compressed vid on my channel as well explaning the route in detail!
---
I'd be against them solely because of things like the AQ opening event and fights over world boss spawns. There's a chance with better hardware now that these events might actually be playable, but that all goes away if you try and throw too many polygons and particle effects at the screen.
---
Would be hilarious if the mods deleted this post

The thing is, due to me having a family I can't play 2 hours straight, sometimes I have to take a 20 min break in the middle and I don't want to go with a raid and just ditch them. That sucks for both sides. That's why I just want to play PVP and do my thing (as well as farming mats/gold etc which also can be interrupted at any time).
---
I never was a fan of PVE, I do how ever love PVPing.
---
I have a wife a corvette and a $5,000 guitar, I absolutely do not know about 4chan memes.  That's incel territory.
---
Nice! I saw some good vids about Gnome speedrunners on this sub as well. For now i'll stick with the horde haha ;)
---
Apparently I was uninformed, but no need to be a dick about it.
---
Also, sorry for my vaguely harsh initial reply to you. I think the practice helped; it made me zoom in to see if I wasn't letting a shot go off, and that's exactly what was happening right at the start of the pull. I'm pretty sure I'm used to what retail became after a while, which was the autoshot following up after other moves almost instantly, vs. a long moment later. The knowledge might not help me kill things my level or higher any easier if my attacks miss, but it should help a lot in the majority of situations, so thank you!
---
(I think I need to accept that my body is a junk heap and I need all the help I can get to suck less.)
---
Yes, if the layer acted like separated servers he would only be able to loot/kill one of these guys per X hours, not to mentions its competitions
---
Blizzard will kill you if you try and use addons.
---
You're still receiving a formal training at a class master, who presumably would enforce the shield in left weapon in right principle.
---
Going forward this will STILL save a ton of time. Because they will update bnet in the future. Dont have to test it against two totally different clients. They will do TBC on the latest retail client in 2-3 years.
---
everyone got r14 gear at the end of vanilla.
---
Yup, launch day will be way way more competitive for mobs, and the time will be drastically slower. However this is a good test run. On launch day I will not only have a mental map of my route, but now also in video format :)
---
so kind of like retail but with farms instead of a lake and a field
---
You heard about that thing called mana, right?
---
They seem to be open to changing their minds on some things like this.
---
The chances of getting only Armored Epic Mounts would be around 95% in my estimation, there is a slim chance we could get the unarmored ones.
---
My spec is meant for T2/R14 specifically so I agree
---
What did you predict buddy?
---
You already listed some of them, but what are all the mechanical skills I need to develop to excel as a hunter? I’d love a video or resource for this if anyone has one.
---
FOR THE HORDE  
---
so no ...
---
Yeah. What I'd really like them to add though is Kul Tiras as it was back then. I mean they flat out said the only reason they didn't add it and didn't add it to the map was because they forgot about it until it was too late to add it.
---
wind serpents are pretty great against high armor targets and look sweet too
---
My pleasure it is also my pickpocket farming spec.
---
I never said I’m going to do it, but you can’t both publicly broadcast your session and expect privacy. They are mutually exclusive. It’s not cheating, it’s one party voluntarily offering up their position to the entire world. They could easily not stream if they are trying to be sneaky, or delay their stream if they are concerned about it. 
---
It’s not like there is nothing the streamer can do about it, they just don’t want to do anything about it.
---
1-2 months after launch there will be people raid leading MC/BWL/ONY on weekends with few items reserved. These are runs where anyone can show up and they should be something you could have time for. You can get gear this way easily and its also nice to see all the raid content. You are usually required to bring consumables but flasks depend from the raid leader. 
---
I used to run these things on weekends when there was nothing else to do on my alts since my main cleared them in 1 night.. So I highly recommend these! 
---
You can find them from the WoW classic blizzard forums in general/LFG/raiding part. That is where I bet they will be at since that's how it used to be..I might be there even. Hope your vanilla experience is nice with your available time! Remember to use it wisely and ALWAYS logout in a city/inn to get maximum rested xp while leveling. 8 hours of logging out = 5% lvl,10 days = 1.5 levels
---
Have a nice summer while waiting for the awesomest and most nostalgic experience of your life. :)
---
Since Hunters are mostly in raid for enrage dispel, is a BM hunter acceptable in raid if there is already an MM hunter to give Trueshot buff? How much difference in DPS is a BM Hunter from MM? And if you eventually change to MM for raid, how good is for solo farm compared to BM?
---
Of course, I didn’t state it very well in my reply but I agree that those are the areas your only  be able to switch
---
Which isn't in the spirit of how the system worked.  I'm so up in the air on whether NOT having the original script system in favor of a more modern macro system is an improvement.  There is something about that that just bugs me.  Part of the bleeding edge was working out how to abuse that system and it hurts me that we won't get stuff like auto-multidot and rank choice.....how.yiu supposed to have every rank of every spell on your bar?  There are not enough buttons for that, ergo you either MUST play with your book open or miss maximal efficacy.
---
Yes, I appreciate the critical importance of the community aspect, and is why I started this post.
---
From all the discussion I'm now leaning into 2 solutions being better than the current situation, and candidates for "the best" overall solutions.
---
--------
---
**A.** "Graduated Layering" (basically a form of temporary, by zone, sharding).
---
Where you layer only the first couple of zones, and have a hard point (say duskwood) where there is only 1 version of the zone going forward. And you aggressively reduce the number of possible versions of the zone as the levels increase.
---
So maybe there's 50 possible versions of the very small initial area you're in at level 1, 10 possible versions of Elwynn, 2 possible versions of Westfall. Then 1 always after that.
---
This would keep all the intended benefits of layering, in practical terms, also add more granular choice to deal with the very first zone for each race, and then immediately remove layering once the levels/community really starts to matter a lot.
---
As well as prevent any exploits that truly matter, because I don't believe there's any way you could really do anything problematic by being able to hop between multiple versions of the first couple of zones?
---
-----------
---
**B.** Automatically Merged Clusters
---
So have Defias Brotherhood 1-4, with the guarantee that these would all be merged by Phase 2.
---
This would also meet most of the design goals of layering, prevent all exploits, and be very low on the controversy scale.
---
Maybe the most notable consideration here is how many clusters to have per server, and how high the population should be on each.
---
This would be a tradeoff of queues at launch vs queues at Phase 2 (merge), and be somewhat based on the expected % of players to leave.
---
e.g. if 80% of players are expected to leave, then maybe 4 clusters of 5000 concurrent players would be a good balance.
---
The overall goal trying to balance queues, community, and lottery of 'good' vs 'bad' servers months after launch.
---
No Pet tab at all... Shift+P or whatever is not working. I removed all addons and checked the key binding list: there are even no key like "Character" "Spells" at all. It's an ordinary 1.12.1 client. Maybe we speak of another version?  
---
Beasts don't drop much at the moment, at least in my starting locations...Tiger start to give me strange looks..I'm scared
---
'will it have an affect on raiding' was the question
---
I've always mained a Shaman since vanilla but IF is almost making me want to play a dwarf to spend hours AFK there.
---
we're doomed.
---
Exploration is the only way, I would imagine anyways.
---
This is why banning all addons wouldn't change anything
---
Great work!
---
Aimed shot is trash with lvl gear. You need ap and crit
---
For real? D:
---
Right, ....there is a ghost saber cat in nothern Darkshore, ... when I managed to get the Winterspring mount ofc I would like to have a cat with the same color, an owl is perfekt for leveling due to "screetch"... Maybe I have to roll 2-3 hunters :D
---
... play bfa.
---
Or a different class.
---
Classic is for those that want to play Vanilla, it's not meant to be an attraction to those that never played Vanilla or just want to "try it out"
---
How does commenting about omen apply to the affects of healbot? 
---
Not close to what he was asking about, so weird your so fine being a hypocrit lol.
---
No!  You must be shamed!
---
Don't do this.
---
Do the opposite and get a healthy diet going before spending hundreds of hours sitting and not blinking.
---
Day 1 V Empty server 🤷‍♂️
---
I love this thing so much i just hate how fast it breaks!
---
Yes I first played while going to school and working 3-4 days after school.
---
He obiously knows that

It's more likely to be general because it's not only game acc but also a lost mailbox. 
---
But yea guess OP just sold it indeed.
---
Don’t waste time trying to stay alive!
---
Ah yes, the oldest trick in the book:
---
"We are going to be totally casual, just join us for 2 max 3 raid nights p/ week!"
---
You’re confusing people because FAP as an acronym is already commonly used for Free Action Potion.
---
So which one was Vanilla actually like? Are private servers tuned up in difficulty or is the official Classic server tuned down?
---
Yeah I managed to get Knight-Lieutenant, whatever rank that is, and my Warrior has the r14set
---
Hi, /u/Grindelflaps
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0jptc/i_started_playing_during_wotlk_and_my_main_was_an/). 
---
There are pretty much only two items.  
---
[Whitesoul Helm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12633/whitesoul-helm) Which is BIS.
---
[Dawnbringer Shoulders](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12625/dawnbringer-shoulders) Which you can argue is BIS but there are other options like Shroud of the Nathrezim (cloth) and Living Shoulders (leather) which are easier and cheaper to get.  
---
So for a holy paladin, blacksmithing is mediocre. Much better to go herbalism/alchemy or XX/Enchanting, gives you way more options, not to mention any of those three will give you more cash than blacksmithing
---
Except Omen wasn't a thing til later.  The earliest threat meter was KTM :/
---
Looking around most people say that KTM first came out after AQ launch so I was off on the timing so I'm guessing Omen came around Naxx.  (TBF I stopped play around AQ launch to focus on college)
---
Thanks Gaben
---
Regarding BM vs MM in raids:
---
Depends on your raid group if they take you or not. 
---
The thing is pet's have a tendency to die in raids, very easily. So you'd be sinking points into a spec that wouldn't increase your raid dps at all on certain bosses. Maybe you could bribe a healer to toss heals on your pet. Possibly.
---
Also Trueshot buff is party only, meaning your 2nd melee group would miss out on the aura.
---
If they ever add onto Vanilla, this is **exactly** what I've always envisioned.  It would build on top of the vanilla experience without nullifying what came before it.
---
Oh man I hope they do this one day.  I've loved all of these.
---
Decursive and addons like that will most likely not work in classic. In original vanilla they removed that before naxx was released. Private servers have this wrong.
---
The problem is also ion the core concept of wow. Having a tank whoi lose constantly 30% of his HP per hit means that you have to heal him constantly, and in a limited mana environnement, you have to output as much DPS as possible to shorten the fight, and preserve everybody's mana.  
---
Some MMOs tried to shift the meta in their PVE, by lower the damage taken by the tank, make all heal situationnal and with cooldown. This give much more room to hybrid builds and individual skill rather than just pure big numbers.
---
Yeah just skinning for gathering if you going for a fast time
---
Also great for prowling and killing off pvp-flagged duelers outside of Capitol cities.
---
Rank 10 PvP gear :)
---
Nope, not talking about Shedo. I've done it myself in Nost. Avrg DPS in MC before BWL release was around 600 DPS. Thats without MCP / Acuria.   
---
With MCP, 700 avrg is easily obtainable. Oh guess what, warrior/rogue DPS is around 600-700 on avrg in MC as well before BWL release.. Dun dun duuuuuuuun  
---
But then again arguing with a sheeple like you, is moot anyway.
---
“Mana is your head” - quote from a rogue I was playing with while the tank pulled and me, as a Druid heal, with 10% mana was starting to drink
---
If only this was OSRS
---
Impressive work i will be using this 100% for Classic
---
Go into lowbie zone without a pet. Tame one of the animals in the zone and use that. When I played alliance, I used the plainstriders in the Barrens right outside of Crossroads. Toggled walk and just RP'd as one for a minute.
---
Private servers get overtunned.  Classic = Vanilla numbers wise, it’s just people have gotten so much better at games which is why it seems easier.
---
Sort of but better use of the map. Like take your changes and then use ALL of the empty space. In retail they made the mountain region much larger which limited the amount of free space to use. Your use of space is way better than retail :)
---
I'm not against, old graphics, handmade texture maps, nice bald tiled lawns with rare tree polygons, I really admire the legendary hardcore questing - but this particular pet part kinda looks TBD, so why not merge later improvements into this functionality
---
you must have seen my comment right below yours?
---
sure, but layering/sharding "should" help? Who knows? I cant wait to get started nonetheless :D
---
pretty sure you needed to be level 5 to get a profession, so would need to be level 5 to get enchanting, to be able to DE the greens I get.
---
There will be a ton of hunters since its The easiest class
---
Don't forget to say goodbye to your families!
---
Not sure what TBD stands for, but if the changes were any part of Vanillas lifespan they could make that change.
---
If it was not in Vanilla, it doesn't belong :)
---
Yep you’re right. Misread, apologies.
---
Man, I'm in the exact same boat...26 year-old attorney with not enough spare time on my hands. But all I want is to relive the journey. 
---
I've pretty much given up any hope of hitting 60 this time around. Although as others have said, its about the journey and I'm looking forward to running some dungeons and hopefully finding a chill casual guild with the same time constraints.
---
If you stick with it, the reputation rewards from PVP are good (comparable to MC/BWL). But they require gold. So you are going to have to do some gold farming to aquire them. But like others have said once AQ and Naxx comes out don't expect it to be a fair fight. But honestly I believe you are in the same boat as many others( and myself) this time around so we will just have to wait and see how it all shapes out. I plan on playing a support class to support the highly geared players just so I feel like I contributed.
---
They may need more to bug test layering
---
Yeah I think so to - I'm pretty sure Blizz are making it as close as possible to Vanilla and not trying to stealth in any easy mechanics. I think Private Servers did their best to replicate but couldn't get it spot on.
---
Yeah, not playing a game sounds like so much fun.  You're so smart and witty.
---
They could have brought back Garrisons.
---
That ghost saber is sweet for sure. 
---
Also a thing to keep in mind is that we are not getting exactly the same client as in back in the day. Granted the developers are aiming to get everything as true to the original as they can, but some things are bound the be a bit different.
---
He was neither misleading nor uninformed, they **DID** ban, and then after backlash reduced to warnings. It's literally in the article you posted.
---
There's absolutely no reason to assume they wouldn't ban you if you repeated this action or did it going forward.
---
Idk man I played PvE and clearly remember getting my ass handed to me otw to Sam
---
I recently tried it and contrary to popular belief, I think Aimed first is better. The first 10 points in BM don't really do much, your pet is pretty tanky as is and it gains no damage. In MM on the other hand, you have Aimed and 5% Crit waiting to be picked as early as level 20. Aimed Shot impacts every fight, whereas Bestial Wrath comes into play every couple of minutes. I've tried both variants and aimed first seems vastly superior - but maybe that's just personal preference.
---
This. I think this is really the main thing they've been testing.
---
Why would it be a mistake to test endgame content?  It’s not exactly new.
---
Ya, lure the shaman in with a DPS spot but everyone knows he'll be made to heal
---
A lot of the private servers will outright admit they’re overturning or are using data from another server that was previously overtunned
---
You forgot the Mace of Unending Life  
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21407/mace-of-unending-life](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21407/mace-of-unending-life)   
---
From AQ20 so also phase5
---
This is the absolute best original Classic content coming out right now, and you've immediately become the highlight of this sub.  This is awesome stuff and I really appreciate it.
---
I really enjoyed it in BC when I started playing, is it that different?
---
Still more damage than arcane shot that literally does the same damage regardless of gear
---
Release dates aren't purely governed by bug testing.
---
I love how someone's frantically pinging the minimap but no one seems to notice.
---
Having everything handed to you sounds so smart and witty. 
---
.o/ cata
---
Damn WITHOUT MCP? Looks like you cracked the code and figured out how to really play feral druid better than anyone else. Imagine lying to yourself so much that you believe it. Again good luck man you'll need it.
---
&gt; your weekly AQ 20 for a month or two.
---
IIRC ZG and AQ20 are on a 3day reset cycle.
---
Shadowpriests level pretty fast. Spirit tap talent gives you boost to your mana regen, and once you hit Mindflay you just melt faces.
---
You dont flag ever on a contested zone on a PVE realm, unless you toggle it on/off yourself, or unless you attack opposing NPCs. Even going to Goldshire as Horde (for the vanilla Darkmoon Faire), you didnt flag.  Sometimes, you could aggro the goldshire guards if you got too close, but that was it.
---
in vanilla paladins do not have an instant attack, you autoattack, proc, and can judge for some damage  
---
in BC they got Crusader Strike as their 41point talent
---
Yeah, 5 stable slots would be nice...
---
I'm not sure that's the first thing people think of when they read FAP
---
Engi for all the nice stuff and mining for jump runs. 
---
Tho an alt with herbing and alchy
---
Well the Beta Clients must have been a PVP client.
---
He said himself he was uninformed. Why are you white knighting somebody who obviously responded and didn't have all the information?
---
&gt; and then after backlash reduced to warnings.
---
You don't think that's key information that was omitted in the original response?
---
We can agree on that
---
But he's still getting something you're not, surely that's unfair as well? The point I'm trying to make is that this isn't something that only a handful of people could do. Everybody can do it, even you. There'll be huge competition though.
---
Hmm, that’s interesting about blind. It looks like they removed that in 2.3. I guess I must have forgotten.
---
Dwarf or night elf hunter? Mostly thinking class identity and aestetic
---
doesnt matter either way. They've announced the release date, and thats what everyone is working with. If they somehow changed it and pulled it in, folk with holidays booked would be majorly inconvenienced. That'll never happen now.
---
I think it’s NA or EU sub, or can pay for both.
---
I’m looking at doing this the opposite way you are. I’ve heard anything from 100-300 ms lag.
---
&gt;so that they can save time with b-net integration 
---
This time of comment from people who have absolutely no fucking clue about programming. God I hate you.
---
Nice job, thats a nice trick with dwarwen forge in thunder bluff, i didn't know it. 
---
Watching it, i honestly didn't see much difference from private servers at least in the starting are. If anything drop rate of quest items are higher and more abudant, not lower, and mobs seem to have slighly less aggro range.
---
So, insane mazzaranache luck, is it like that every run? on private server it takes forever to do, sometimes i barely get all regs to level 10 after dozens of kills of each type of mob.
---
If you want some critique and improvements, 
---
- The well quest where you pick up wellstones - it doesnt make sense to do alone, you come to this well to cleanse it later, so you can do these two quests together. it'd save time.
---
- i definitely would buy a white staff from level 6, in bloodhoof village you use it all the time, it'd be a nice boost of damage and overall speed. usually you just have  enough silver for it at 6 (ir even if slightly after it worth it).
---
so skinning in my opinion is not worth a time on a classes like druid. travel form is basically a minimount. real mount is only slighly faster, (if you ever ran in travel form side by side with 60% mount, you know it). So if you get mount not exactly at 40 its not a big deal at all for a druid. you basically don't lose any significant amount of time on it, but you lose time on skinning. Especially at these early levels when you need to get ahead of the pack.
---
and skinning eats  a decent amount of time and bagspace. 
---
Obviously you free to play, as you want, just my opinion. and from my experience.
---
- also you can use hs early, and then it will be off cd already, when you hs later. your run is 1h48, and you use hs once. thats suboptimal.
---
Personally i use hs first time to hs at level 3 from the cats area.
---
adn then its already off cd, when i need to use it later. i usually hs off the cave.
---
They are Downloading more ram for the servers
---
I think this might be the right answer, because I simply would not know why else players are trying to force their way of playing upon other players.
---
I guess you haven't seen the issues with layering the past couple days.
---
&gt; The bugs that are left seem relatively minor.
---
You are so wrong. Have you seen the [spreadsheet of known bugs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmeFqag7dzkvibcbvcenWtY3XJLihmvmPNtlnqqsEEo/edit#gid=0)? There's a lot of game breaking bugs in the beta that needs to be addressed before they can launch the game, and there is probably more to come once the level cap increases.
---
If you half ass it. If you want to get consumes and world buffs you're looking at 2h of out-of-raid work for every raid, at the very least. Vanilla is very time consuming.
---
From /r/wowservers/ - here are more differences:  (The video is only from the stress test, the following is from a beta tester)
---
----
---
And all of the stuff its missing is the stuff (strangely) where the beta is much harder. Not making accusations but:
---
How did you miss that the money/economy is drastically different on classic because chest itemization on Private Servers ensures 1 green item per chest massively boosting the amount of money pumped into the economy?
---
Also, chests on private servers spawn in fixed 2 hrs spawns and spawn at every possible spawn spot, where as on Classic they share areas in the same way you mentioned Ore does in the cave in Elwynn. Opening a level 40+ chest in WPL on private servers gives you a Green item level 40+ to vendor, some coin and pots usually, while on a Classic the same chest yields no green items, a few Alterac swiss, and a mana pot. Its a massive difference. And the number of chests are so much higher on PServers that it completely changes how rare green items are having a drastic effect on things like enchanting leveling etc.
---
Also Mob moving BAF radius works on Classic and doesn't exist at all on PServers. Lt. Fangore in Redrige has a pulsing BAF radius around him of about 30 yards, meaning if you try to solo pull him its impossible as he continues to aggro any mongrels he comes within a 30yd radius of as he chases you. Meanwhile on private servers you pull him with a throwing knife and run back until his friends "leash" trivializing the fight. In fact no mobs on PServers exhibit this pulsing AoE BAF at all.
---
Mob abilities are often times nonexistent on PServers. The Undead soldiers in Darkshire GY area dont use their elemental immunity on PServers at all. PServers have the diseased bears around Auberdine spam/use their disease at an extremely higher rate. The scripting on the Furbolg quests near Auberdine are completely non-existent on PServers, as you loot the berries and the other items before placing the bowl, there should be 2 adds each that spawn and BAF making this quest significantly harder to solo; All of this happens in classic.
---
The number and location of the Mathystra Relics (Quest from Onu) are hysterically lower and with a much longer respawn time in classic which is going to massively bottleneck people. (I had the entire area to myself and it took me around 30m to get them all).
---
The absolutely massive number of mob patrols that remove almost all of the "safe areas to sit and eat/drink" that infest nearly every camp in the game. The much much lower reputation thats given for many of the quests that makes getting exalted with a faction impossible even if you walk over to their starting zone at level 1 and do ALL of that factions quests at the proper levels.
---
The missing dynamic spawns on all of the quests in the game, like the 2 elites that are supposed to spawn when examining the body for the quest 'Thandol Span' that don't exist on Private servers, or the way Balgaras the Foul is supposed to have a randomized spawn location that can include being on the bottom floor of the buildings at Dun Modr (instead of always spawning outside at the tents where he is easily killed on Private Servers) making the quest an absolute gauntlet of mass killing elite dwarves before they respawn and trap you and kill your whole group.. And thats AFTER you figure out which building he is in.
---
What about the misplaced world and quest items, like the items that start the Syndicate questlines being in the absolute wrong camp on Private Servers, or the drop rate on Dirty Knucklebones being 3x higher on Private Servers than Classic, or
---
I mean, oh god. Man there's so much. Its hard to just not drone on and on. Some stuff is easier, but on the whole, outside of elite damage (in the low level dungeons, things are VERY different in Zul Farrak from what my group learned yesterday)
---
I think he went understated intentionally.  That's sort of a remote part of the Eastern Kingdoms, and that coast in particular is supposed to be wild and untamed - hence, Savage Coast.  A bunch of big quest hubs and towns would have devalued that mystique.
---
Share a google doc please friend!
---
One of the hardest grinds in WoW. Not due to complexity but due to loss in sanity half way through honored.
---
It seems to be a german client. IKEA is something big here. 😂😉
---
Wait. Were the mounts in vanilla character specific? If I grind wintersaber on human mage, can a balance druid on the same server use this as well?
---
The Who ride ?

Only difference from my personal Alliance BiS here was Rogue went form Night Elf to Human.

Full disclosure: I did have Human marked as BiS for Priest but I made this list a few months ago and have since learned Dwarf is the way to go so I'm not counting that.
---
It's pretty clearly cheating if you're not being disingenuous. If you were a kid you'd also be saying how it's perfectly legitimate to look at your friends screen, he could just get another TV or play singleplayer. Find a definition for cheating that doesn't encompass this, I'd be real surprised to see it.
---
100-300 ms lag would be acceptable right? doesnt seem like a big problem for a game like wow
---
I didn’t see other comments addressing this but, if pvp is your plan, I’d wait a bit because battlegrounds and the like don’t launch until phase 3.
---
&gt; its not 2005 where people think 2 mechanics is hard.
---
Not it's 2019 where you need mythic AOTC before the raid appear, 4K+ mythic score and 40+ ilvl ahead of the raid one.
---
I hear you. I was 15 when I started playing and now I'm 30-year-old married engineer. 
---
The way I think about it is, yes, I had more time back then to play, but I was horribly inefficient in how I chose to use my time in-game. I made a ton of mistakes because it was my first experience in an MMO, but also because I was a kid without any real experience in life. I had little understanding of important adult concepts like setting goals, developing strategies and tracking progress.

My plan for classic is to have a plan and execute it. There are endless decisions to be made in Classic. What class should I play? Which faction? Which spec? Which race? Do I want to raid? Do I want to PvP? What kind of guild do I want to join? And on and on. All of those decisions are time consuming and are usually made at the time that they matter to you in-game. However, since we have more than two months until release and nearly every aspect of the game has been documented and analyzed, then we can go ahead and make every important decision for our character(s) now. The effect will be that less time is needed in game to accomplish the same goals. 
---
Another thing is that I plan to form my own guild that only raids two nights a week, but has high standards for performance. That's how I plan to find the people with similar life situations and attitudes about the game.
---
The most famous copy pasta I would say!

&gt; KEEP MAKING NOISE, BLIZZ IS BETA TESTING, AND LISTENING TO THE PLAYERBASE! 
---
Go make noise on the official forums ...
---
This daily layering qq is getting rather old.
---
&gt; We all know deep down that Classic will dwarf Retail numbers well into a few months. 
---
Lets hope. But realistically, looking at the whole gaming industry - instant gratification is everywhere. People are not used to put in tons of hours to achieve something anymore. So for a large part of the gaming community, Classic will be HARD! Not due to the actual difficulty, but rather progression speed and the time it takes to achieve goals in-game.
---
I’m just sucking around on a pserver with a little over 100 and it’s no biggie. 
---
Correct, wow isn’t some FPS.
---
That gives me plenty of time to get to level 60 before it launches though, which is good. Haha :D
---
Considering how many issues people run in to with layering on a daily basis, yes they do.
---
Imagine not having a second TV in a different room for your friend to play on so that he cant look at your screen when playing.

There's alot of people who try to mislead others on this subject. I'm just making sure the OP and anyone else looking at this thread sees accurate information and that people who like to mislead for because they feel the need to push their own personal ideology on others are exposed. 
---
If that wasn't your intention, sorry. TBH though you should really make sure you are giving people accurate information before responding.
---
doesnt matter what you choose to do, pve only, pvp only or both. your gear is going to suck ass regardless with that kind of game time. but thats fine, just pick a class you like and have fun in wpvp or bgs.
---
MadSeason mentioned he’ll make a private character so that he can play without all that comes with streaming
---
TBD stands for To Be Done in this context. I disagree though, there was nothing wrong with the pet system back in Vanilla. Addons could help potentially though, but I don't think they should add outside of vanilla updates into classic....I wouldn't like that.
---
That’s one benefit.  We don’t know the exact timeline just yet but people anticipate phases will last at least a few months each.
---
Saline drip and feeding tube through nose, standard classic waiting for a group stuff.

If they plan on doing Ret in PvP, then Sulfuras is a good thing to have BSing for too.
---
Yeah, thanks for the clarification re blind. I either forgot or didn’t realize it cleared blind. It seems to have removed in 2.3. It’s been awhile lol. As far as my authority goes, it just comes from experience playing a human rogue and repeatedly beating the other top rogue on our battle group who was a dwarf, who in turn dominated any other race of rogue in rvr. Most of which had to do with being able to guarantee the opener,
---
Especially with classic having vanilla spell batching in. 400ms batches help mitigate latency differences.
---
Warrior T2 is one of my favorites coincidentally.
---
Your gear basically shows how big your dick is (time investment), and that is how it should remain.
---
My Pally hype comes from my love for healing.  I was a Resto Shaman in Vanilla and always had "bubble envy".  So this time around, I'm going with The Light!
---
Kill spiders, the legs that can be cooked are feed-able to pets early on, even if you don't cook them (at least they were on p-servers, hopefully its the same on the beta).  And your pet interface should be a tab in your character page, if not right click on your pet's portrait and there should be a menu for it.
---
It’s more appropriate in bfa because there’s a decade worth of cool raid sets that you can’t really use anymore from past expansions. It makes sense to be able to show off those looks but that’s not a factor in classic. Also stamina is a different formula so judging someone off their health is much less reliable in classic.
---
Nah, it won't be that much.  Been there, done that.
---
I will be going with night elf. I like their jumping better and you can shadow meld for annoyance :)
---
Aye true I suppose, I just want to be able to fight people on the BG without feeling "Fuck, I deal no damage to him. It doesn't matter what I do he just outperforms me due to the gear difference).
---
TLDR: I want to be able to outplay people without struggling because it feels like my gear is 1000 miles behind in the BGs due to playing less.
---
Fishing Stonescale Eels, these boys are gold bars :D

So, two things here. First, I'm still relatively new to his streams but I think he sometimes acts a bit hyperbolic simply to keep the stream interesting and entertaining- I think this is partially why he's so popular, because he's very animated. Does he actually think that way? Maybe, but based on the way he acts in other situations, I personally think its just a bit exaggerated for comedic/entertainment effect. Secondly, yeah, I definitely don't think people watch him because he's "the best" or because he's very skilled- I think people a) think he's funny/entertaining and b) when he's not doing the hyperbolic exaggerated stuff, he can actually come off very honest and real. I at least get a sense that he really, really loves WoW and would be playing this much every day even if he wasn't streaming. Just my two cents though. Like I said, I'm pretty new to watching his streams so I could be wrong.
---
Ive been playing the Beta for a month now and the aggro radius does not seem low at all. The amount of times that I have had mobs chaining on me is very high. This definitely feels like it did back in the day.   
---
Fall damage seems normal to me.   
---
Mob chase speed seems pretty accurate for me. You used to be able to get away from mobs as long as you didn't get dazed. Being dazed was the killer.
---
My warrior looked very similar to yours, OP. Orc war with unstoppable force, managed to get to rank 11 lieutenant general. Those were the days, man.
---
3h per day of BG grind must be enough to get the pvp gear abtainable throught pvp though? :)
---
Right? Mulgore is beautiful. I'd rather stay even longer than usual there.
---
Haha, next you'll have people crying Hunter OP and asking for buffs to their Frostbolts, Searing Totems and Execute's. It's a slippery slope even with minor, seemingly insignificant changes like that. 
---
Our best bet regarding stable slots is probably the Classic+/OSRS route, but then many don't want that either.
---
Yes, most of the workers in the private sector face this problem and that's a problem. On paper we have maximum 10 hour shifts (in most jobs) and 5 days per week (the normal 9-5 job).   
---
One example from me: in my apperenticeship as a surveyor I worked in a tiny company. Construction sites are booming out of nowhere and tons of work for me. My boss didn't care for our working hours and I did so much overtime.   
---
First, the 10 hour rule applied to my job which was completely ignored by my boss, second, as an apperentice I am allowed to have a few to none overtime hours.  
---
And that is straight illegal.   
---
But I see your point though. Sometimes you are forced to work more just to stay in your current job.
---
Correct me if I am wrong because I don’t know much about spell batching. 
---
But I take it to mean that it’s almost like data packets where a group gets packaged and processed while the next is being built?
---
Sorry I probably butchered that.

...do shaman ever heal in the cinematics?

You mean keeping the loot relevant but not the content?

I understand having profession items that are boe that you can buy and use I.e. felcloth shoulders but it's dumb to have green lens as bis which requires engineering... Should have alternative that doesnt require a profession to use
---
The same people that decided back then purely on looks are the same people that do so today. The guides and forums were a thing back then to.
---
Blue gear yes, epic set depends on the people on the server. Usually no.
---
Yeah that's what I thought. It would be great to have spell dmg but it not really possible cause there isnt much
---
Yeah, it'll help, but there will still be a lot of competition.
---
I see various threads and videos on best hunter pets.  But just for fun, what is the *worst* pet a hunter can tame?
---
Isn't the blue gear decent enough to be able to outplay people in the BG and do well ? :\\
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
I would love to set this as my desktop wallpaper.
---
1.11 PTR, 40 full t2 geared randoms wiping to the first trash mobs in naxx. I member.

You do understand that all their customer support and payment systems are on b-net so they would have to integrate it anyway cause they sure as hell won't split their customer support staff or create new payment system for classic. Also the backend contains 15 years of security and vulnerability updates and patches. 15 YEARS! They way they implemented is the only feasible solution.
---
But understandable. Like some other "known disease", to be left handed must be cured. Sadly. Maybe in twenty years, Flander's (Left hand shop) won't be necessary. 😉
---
Barrens chat in classic won't be the same as Barrens chat in pserver. Any racism/slurs will get you muted at best and banned at worst.
---
That doesn't sound healthy
---
Lul it took years for them to decide to do it.
---
Why would you want too? just wondering as an American btw
---
Like being able to play the game?
---
I'm pretty sure you can use ElvUI and change the UI scale slider.
---
This is so annoying 😣. They have to fix this it's so ridiculously off yet I haven't seen a post from them (Blizzard) saying it's wrong or that it still needs to be fixed. Does anyone know if they have and I'm just missing it??

---
True, but I think it might satisfy some viewers' nostalgia to experience it vicariously through streamers.
---
For the players that haven't played since vanilla or haven't tried at all, it will be "new".
---
That and now we have machines that run WoW at 60fps and internet connections with ping in the tens of milliseconds.
---
Very wise.
---
I want to play on EU just to avoid the racist political Barrens chat, if that’s possible.
---
Math Magician. Which mage spec is this, again? Sounds OP
---
Lol what is even your point? Part of playing the game is not being able to play?
---
Like Embriel said, once you installed PFUI you can change the scale of everything, and then move everything into position (assuming things aren't completely off screen).
---
Or check out bongos/bartender if you want just an actionbar replacement since PFUI skins your whole UI, but I personally use PFUI and love it
---
Sure, but I think most people agree that launching the game the week school begins for many people is not ideal.
---
You simply can't beat dwarf on aesthetic.  Also if you are playing male the male night elves have the worst model in the game.

Easiest class (to level) *
---
I started in December 2004 at 14 years old. You don't have to race to 60. Just enjoy the ride, man. Also, maybe consider not working 20 hour days? That just seems unhealthy.
---
Hmm ok. I guess I didn’t see that option in the setting. There’s a hella of a lot of settings. Thanks!
---
Is there a hunter theory craft discord?
---
This is true, but on live you can get from level one to raid ready in a couple of weeks even without going hardcore, to get to the point you’re talking about in classic is gonna take months
---
Don't shit or piss either.
---
Turn all that into energy.
---
Thanks for linking that.  It answered a couple of questions I've been wondering about.
---
play healer
---
Alliance has the better racials and paladins &gt; shamans, though. The one racial that's not completely trash is WotF, and it's honestly not a game breaker compared to stoneform, perception, fear ward and escape artist.
---
Id rather lose a few kilos so i can eat quick easy food thats suboptimal for health very efficient for gaming
---
Live to win!
---
I wasn't involved at all!
---
The only reason I put points in BM first is to rush Pathfinding so you can be even faster in cheeta form, so you can level faster. Also the talents that improves the pet ress.
---
But I think I'll be leveling as MM this time around to have better wPvP experience. Aimed Shots are so fun. And as someone already said before, the pet is tanky enought as it is.
---
Suppose I should keep a few in my bank for when I get to Gadgetzan and put them on the X Faction Auction house
---
More like 400 chest xrays.
---
Worthy goal 👍
---
Yeah I’m gonna be taking this advice for sure, in the past I would let time slip away from me while playing and end up playing practically an entire day
---
add mailboxes to piss off asmongold
---
Thank you for a timely response. 
---
I did the same quest but with a group just to farm it quicker. It also helped when the casters were healing. I also noticed you were able to avoid their heal. Did you time when to dps to avoid their heals?
---
As long as layering and spell batching are in-game, yes, they need more time
---
Of course, but I don't think it'll take long to iterate on the foundation that's already in place.
---
That's not true at all.
---
You can totally stack spell power/arcane damage gear to get arcane power to do more damage.
---
&gt;&gt;_&gt;
---
I agree that paladins are quite strong at pre-10. At such low levels there isn't really a big gap between melee in terms of abilities, having the majority of damage from AA evens the field. Being able to heal (and unlike caster healers not need the mana for DPS as much) makes them really strong. The thing is, I never die on my hunter either, so the extra survivability doesn't matter to me. Being able to take on 3 targets doens't allow me to level faster, and pre-10 I hardly ever need to actually pull more than *one* target. This is why I'd say the main strength of paladin pre-10 is kind of useless. For less experienced players it will be extremely useful, though.
---
I recently (as in within a few months) leveled both a rogue and hunter through 1-10 and I personally found it much easier as a hunter, but it should be noted that I'm a leveling addict. I think a key difference is, at least in the levels closer to 10, is how hunters never have to eat or drink if played properly. Rogues will need to eat. It might be I push a bit too hard as a rogue, but I generally do faster leveling on hunter from 1-10 (and obviously after that as well). In the 1-5 rogues will never have to eat, so it's a non issue there and I'd say they are equal to hunters. A fun thing to see is how regen seems to have been lower on most pservers, which is a big buff to melee in Classic compared to pservers, but won't help hunters much.
---
&gt;Curious about your opinion re: launch: I was doing the hunter taming quests last night... Do you think those will be a nightmare to complete at launch?
---
I have generally the same opinion as you. Owl and Saber will not be too bad, but Spiders will be harder mostly due to the quest around them and the poor droprate. I have seen servers with different droprates, so I guess it also depends on what Classic will have for the Webwood Spider Silk. Still, I honestly don't think it will be that big of a problem, but I guess it does somewhat depend on where on the curve you are. From previous pserver launches I always play hunter for the initial launch and tend to be ahead of the curve (but not absolutely leading or anything). Of course there are usually dynamic respawn, but it seems like ahead of the curve on the first day will help, if you are in the middle it will be harder. Then again, if you are behind the curve it becomes easier again, but there will be quite a while from the "middle of the curve" reaches level 10 until it slows down, I could easily see those levels being populated a lot for over 24 hours.
---
I personally plan to get ahead of the curve again this time around and rush for my pet, then once in Darkshore I will slow down and chill a bit more.
---
Go back to facebook.
---
I wonder if that will make batching more noticeable
---
I agree, but it’s not that simple really, especially if the game is question is WoW where even though it’s not necessary to spend huge amounts of time on it, it’s very tempting to

Like waking up from a nightmare.
---
Orcs cast left handed.
---
Thank you for a timely response.
---
I did the same quest but with a group just to farm it quicker. It also helped grouping due to the casters healing. Did you have any issues with this?
---
How does it feel for mana efficiency and threat control?
---
Sounds like you gotta go ally, because Me and the boys is the most important thing in wow. Just RP as a racist against gnomes.
---
Should've just stole all the private server code and ran their own servers
---
Please elaborate.
---
Maybe coming next: map of dungeons ?
---
I had not seen that list; thank you for linking it.  While there are some important bugs on there, the list is not large at all.  Besides, many games launch with hundreds or thousands of bugs that are not deemed important enough to fix (or worse, are too difficult to fix).
---
Have no idea on pvp, but pve must have ofc!
---
I believe you can start at lvl 58
---
Both of those alternatives seem preferable. 
---
My thoughts:
---
a.) I'd imagine this is what Blizzard initially planned until someone said, "But what if the population doesn't actually decline enough?" They didn't want to have player leaving their mini lowbie shards and entering a single, huge megaserver situation with 10,000 or more active players. So they probably then thought of layering. Unfortunately I don't think they properly considered  the side effects of layering and perhaps still haven't. 
---
b.) my preference. Give me a nasty cut and a nasty bandaid rip that comprise a few moments of pain over a month instead of a constant, miserable head cold all day,  all night, all week, all month long. My other thought is that you could theoretically just leave the healthy segments of the Cluster alone. If Defias Brotherhood 3 and 4 need to be merged but 1 is thriving then perhaps you just end up letting the situation develop organically and never merge 1 with anybody else.
---
I'm saddened by the amount of "it's only until phase 2" comments that I see. That's literally the entire community development stage of vanilla/classic... I mean that's why you're playing.
---
I'd gladly wait in a 2 hour que after working all day knowing that I wasn't in some kind of parellel universe situation. I feel like the people that are pro layering aren't even original vanilla players, how could you be stupid enough to fall for the same "sounds good on paper" bullshit AGAIN.
---
Oh nice, hunter for me it is then!
---
Oh well that‘s kind of a vanilla and tbc thing, i like that alot as it brings a certain charm to the game
---
They are doing 10 levels every few weeks. They have remaining: So 51-50, 51-59, and then 60/60+. If anything they are cutting it a little close.
---
Seriously, go paladin heals. You will be relevant in BGs even in shit gear.
---
Mage the most difficult ? Not by a long shot! Any decently geared hunter that gets first shot on a mage, will tear him a new one in 2-3 CD's not mentioning the pet hassleing you. A lock/SP on the other hand are God's when geared porperly. The hunter though will be king of the HK's in any BG.
---
My suggestions for resolving the complaints with Layering, if possible and based on my understanding of the process.
---
_World-wide Behavior_
---
World buffs, chat channels, auction houses, and fishing competitions are realm-wide and transcend Layers. Vendor stocks could be Layer dependent or not. Nodes are Layer specific but use different seeds for original spawn placement and random spawn timers.
---
_Layer-wide Behavior_
---
-Layer 1 fills to Threshold C (buffer remains for party transfers in), then Layer 2 begins filling
---
-Layer 1 empties some, Layer 2 continues filling until it reaches Minimum Threshold A
---
-Layer 1 begins filling again until Threshold C
---
-If Layer 1 has space while actively filling, check Layer 2
---
-If Layer 2 is below Threshold B (less than Threshold A) and Layer 1 has remaining space of Layer 2's population + X, then collapse Layer 2 into Layer 1 after a warning: 30 seconds until your Layer merges into another / 30 seconds until another Layer merges into yours
---
_Player Specific Behavior_
---
-Players are generally locked into Layer upon entry to server (EK or Kalimdor)
---
Transferring Layers follows the priority system below:
---
-If someone groups, transfer layers only if they are in or enter a rested area. Transfer to the group leader's layer.
---
-When accepting an invite outside a rested area, pop up: "Your group leader is in another layer. Enter a rested area to join their layer and play with them!"
---
-If a Layer is full when someone would enter based on party then transfer them to an available server and pop up: "The Layer your group is on is full. Your position in the queue is X. You will be transferred as soon as space becomes available even if outside a rest area."
---
-Anyone taking the same portal goes to the same Layer (redundant, should follow the general group rules anyway but! Hypothetical: Player A is the leader, Player B is not. Player B enters portal from EK to Kalimdor and Player A follows, then Player A should first attempt to enter the same Layer as Player B.)
---
-Anyone taking the same ship/zeppelin goes to the same Layer after first assigning based on group affiliation.
---
Layer merges could also be restricted to only at server resets or other downtime to protect immersion, but this would leave farmers on a low pop layer more advantage which people seem to be afraid of, so there's a tradeoff.
---
"Blizzard must have done this "short-cut" in order to not deal with quite possibly the easiest technical hurdle of supporting Classic!" - Salty internet people.
---
Yeah. Nails it on the head
---
If it gets too racist/toxic blizz will prob do something, It would look very bad to shareholders/sponsors if say the NYT or WSJ report something along the lines of "WoW (World of Warcraft) is a breading ground for white supremacy and racism" while not true, it would be 'outrageous' and very click baity.
---
No problem! In case you are a musician you might try to treat it as music - that's how I time my AA when not using a timer. Use your inner clock to count, you just need to get the feeling of the speed of the weapon first.
---
I actually do the same with abilities, make it a rhythm. AA are the pulse, then I know when to do my shots based on the feeling of rhythm. Just one way to do it in case you are good with music!
---
So you realize the horde have major disadvantage in PVE correct? So even though horde have grown popular and have better pvp racials Paladins and dwarf priests are king of pve. So there will be huge amounts of players on pvp servers that still will play alliance because they want to world pvp with their raid gear but want that PVE advantage.
---
Leveling is a temporary thing an you'll spend way more time playing your char at 60 than leveling him.
---
So I really don't put "ease of leveling" as a huge pro for playing a class.
---
Nahhhh, this is very ideal! haha
---
It's harder to bait them in if they saw their future in the cinematics. Sshh
---
Why ppls don't use GOOGLE anymore? You have shit tons of guides!

Make a rogue. Solo that shank dagger with the massive attack delay, so your ambush and backstab hit ridiculously hard. Enjoy PvP with minimal gear.
---
Thanks, doesn't fd drop the mob that you are kiting?
---
Haven't been to wrapped up in the hype and bickering over what should and shouldn't be. I'm not too knowledgeable about everything but I remember hearing that they intend for layering to last two weeks, but at the latest will be phase 1 like you said. Obviously the two weeks is great on paper but we all knows it's probably going to be a nightmare all the way till layering is gone.
---
No om hit works in forms, since you don't swing the weapon.
---
Yeah, I think it might have been a major mistake to listen to the pirate server PvP crowd and put batching back in, because it's an awful, unintuitive mechanics which will be much more important now that ping time is a much smaller fraction of batch time.
---
But then again it seems to have enabled big crowds in one place without lag, so maybe it was worth it. We'll probably never know.
---
Why do people want 10000 versions of WoW?
---
Also just want to add to this, I remember PvP being totally fine with blue gear for most of classic. Things only got ridiculous when you went up against people in full T2 (or better) raid gear, or HWL/GM gear.
---
The game was balanced with someone else getting 1 drop per x hours at a time, not 3 drops.
---
It's not a question of being unfair because I couldn't get it. The economy and gameplay will be impacted by this.
---
&gt; If I were a nolife hunter/warlocks/feral, I can guarantee you I could stockpile so many resources during 2 weeks, that carries me all the way through to cataclysm 
---
Sorry to say, but that's ridiculous! Every layer will probably correspond to a normal full server population, or slightly lower. Thus it means that you will have as much competition on your layer (or any layer really), as you normally would on a non-layered server with close to max population.
---
If you no-life to 60 and beat the masses, you WILL have an advantage. But nowhere close to what you have described.
---
You are part of the problem with game creators releasing games too soon with tons of bugs and issues, like maybe.. the most recent Fallout game? Have some patience.
---
I was told I needed to be BM on a pserver to farm Mara until I had like tier 1 and up. I tried as mm anyways with pre raid bis(still missing 2 or 3 pieces) and did it fine. The only tough boss was the croc, but if you heal your pet smartly then it can still be killed.
---
Yes, it’s working and it’s only viable on horde side. It’s the only 2hand viable spec/way to go as arms outputs not enough damage.
---
&gt; ᵗʰᵉ ʳᶦᵍʰᵗ ᵃⁿˢʷᵉʳ ᶦˢ ᵀᵃᵘʳᵉⁿ
---
It's funny because it's the worst option available lol
---
I'm legitimately scared of this. I was going to pass Classic entirely because I know myself and I know how sucked into things I can get. I got roped into playing by friends/family because they've said they're going to play "casual" - just a fun trip to 60 enjoying the dungeons and quests. Yeah... somehow I don't see that actually working out. It's like inviting an alcoholic to a party and telling him you'll all have a pint and head home. Before I know it I'm going to be in some sweaty raid in 2 in the morning, going to work the next day tired as fuck.
---
Putting 11 points into MM delays your BM tree by 11 levels. The early BM tiers are arguably better than the MM tree's. If you go for Aimed Shot, your pet isn't going to be able to hold aggro anyways. Leveling MM is viable/fun, but BM is definitely the optimal spec. It's also better for PvP while leveling because your pet does tons of damage against low armor targets.

You will park the imp near where the main tank is and leave it phased. Dead imp is no buff.

Wouldn't you say that the testing is front-loaded, though?  The more general bugs were found right away in the 1-30 sprint, and from then on, pretty much the only new bugs are going to be specific to content in the new level range.
---
I've been looking at warrior guides for Endgame PVE (planning on playing warrior in Classic) and this seems like the general rotation for fury at level 60.
---
I dont really see why copying a character with wow+ or tbc rerelease is necessary, I feel it infringes on the original vanilla servers. Let people make new characters and have each iteration separate.
---
I am hoping for both alternatives for each group that wants to play the version they prefer, but I hardly see a reason for meddling with pristine vanilla server characters.
---
Yes it would.
---
Some call it immersion, others call it escapism. But trying to avoid the shitstorm that is everyday news headlines here is enough reason for many to come back to classic, I suspect.
---
Rank 10 is possible semi casual. I got it back in the day doing 2-3 hours a day for like a month... Is that still casual?
---
Do you live in the US, specifically the east coast?
---
I think both male dwarf and female night elf work really well. I'm thinking about going female NE myself, that bow animation is pretty sweet. Shadowmeld can also be pretty fun, even though dwarf racials are better imo.
---
People are gonna be pissed if they delay honor with 4 weeks
---
The old one with 2019s standard would be amazing..
---
You might be thinking of the addons in retail that can populate a list of players near you. There's nothing (to my knowledge) that puts them on the minimap.
---
Surely, I wont argue against that. Any practice is better than no practice.... I just find his choice odd, since private servers are around and afaik it is not illegal to play on them, only to host/fund/earn cash out of them.
---
Very super interesting. I’ve played on private servers a lot recently to get ready for Classic. Glad to hear that there’s a greater challenge waiting for me.
---
I believe it is the Calculator job (or Arithmetician depending on which version you're playing).
---
I'd say bugs are bugs. It doesn't matter if it is content specific or game-wide. It all needs testing.
---
For a full raid night, if you want to be as buffed as you can be as a mage (which I will be playing, I'm sure other classes have similar requirements), you need:
---
&gt;80 dreamfoil                             
---
&gt;24 mountain silversage                       
---
&gt;2 black lotus              
---
&gt;12 fire oil                   
---
&gt;16 firebloom              
---
&gt;16 plaguebloom                    
---
&gt;40 basilisk's brain            
---
&gt;8 vulture gizard                  
---
&gt;6 illusion dust             
---
Without counting food buffs and potions. On top of which, around 30 minutes at the very least to get all world buffs.
---
Tell me again how you can get all this in less than 2h.
---
They just wont release until 8.2 for bfa is released for some time..
---
The trio of hordes going paladin on Classic, may I ask you: dwarf or human?
---
Yeah, last resort if you screw up
---
There's always one guy without a mic who is the first to see danger coming.
---
right, I see why 2handers would benefit from hamstring spam.
---
Combat is not a good PVP spec you should instead run this [https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tYt8t9t\_t.t\~ufuguhuivet-uaubucu2u3u4uquwyUuuuvu.uxuIuJuKuLuMuPuSuTuQuRu9uDuEuFuGuHyVyWyXy\_u8y.tmtwtvuj](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tYt8t9t_t.t~ufuguhuivet-uaubucu2u3u4uquwyUuuuvu.uxuIuJuKuLuMuPuSuTuQuRu9uDuEuFuGuHyVyWyXy_u8y.tmtwtvuj) for pvp and pickpocket runs.
---
I work with my family, so when I told them I'll be taking a week off to go for vacation, I made up some plans, because they would shame me if they knew the real reason.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtThr78vpGU&amp;t=613s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtThr78vpGU&amp;t=613s)
---
If they reach the point where they can grab an Eye of Sulfuras for PvP they could rather buy the Sulfuron Hammer from another blacksmith and go engineering instead
---
BM for sure imo. Aimed shot is weak at lower levels, I didn’t bother with it until getting the xbow from AV. Beastial wrath DESTROYS everything, especially clothies. Even before that your pet can near solo players.
---
I'm saddened by the amount of "it's only until phase 2" comments that I see. That's literally the entire core  community development stage of vanilla/classic... I mean that's why you're playing. There's obviously constant community development but the first fee months is so foundational. 
---
I'd gladly wait in a 2 hour que after working all day knowing that I wasn't in some kind of parellel universe situation. I feel like the people that are pro layering aren't even original vanilla players, how could you be stupid enough to fall for the same "sounds good on paper" bullshit AGAIN. How do you think we got to retail? It wasn't 1 decision, it was 1000 decisions just like layering.
---
If vanilla had the layering we're about to get in classic, the game might not of even been the beloved game it is now. Anyone who can't see how insane it is to have dynamic layers shouldn't have an opinion in how a COMMUNITY BASED mmorpg is built.
---
Yeah I’m fine with just having classic.
---
Incredibly breathtaking! Keep doing what you are doing.
---
You must gather your party before venturing forth!
---
Did that mage shard in?
---
Personal preference. I'd like to replay all xpacs at some point, and those who wish to play only Classic or only latest xpac can do so.
---
Proc of windury are making this possible. As you mention, the main dps performance is link to the auto attack windfury proc you’ll gain from harmstring
---
It's an interesting problem. Obviously if Classic is as successful as we hope, they're going to want to keep it going and not let it stagnate with no new content for too long. 
---
Classic+ is risky because it's an unknown quantity. Some people might love it, some people might hate it. 
---
TBC is the easy choice, because there's no real design work involved, and they have all of the data already, but if we start down that path, we know where it leads. We're guaranteed to make the same mistakes again.
---
I'm hoping for Classic+
---
pfff xD
---
Sharding was removed because People were crying that they don't want it. Blizzard tried to improve but now People feel like it's even worst xD That's what I call a own Goal...
---
You think you do but you don't was a single Blizzard employee fucking up you can't blame the whole Company for that :p
---
I believe that they will remove layering after the first PHASE - they have not said it will only be a few weeks they said it's most likely the entire first Phase.
---
I'm alright with the way it's planned and if you don't trust Blizzard then you better find yourself a new Company whoms games you Play :3
---
There are always players behind the curve when guilds are doing naxx others will be starting MC. It is just how vanilla works. On how the gear creep is slow and how everything is relevant.
---
Generally speaking based on their racials? No. Although they do have the most efficient starting leveling zones and I have heard a few compelling arguments for night elf hunters in pvp.
---
Screw the guides and play whatever the frack you like. Frack if 1% of minmaxers dictate what the remaining 99% players get to play. The race choice is really really very much inconsequential in like 99% of the cases, having to stare at the kind of ass you don't like for 2 years straight will kill your fun of the game much faster.
---
&gt; Tell me again how you can get all this in less than 2h.
---
Other than blasted lands shit, by the AH.
---
Yes, the blue pvp gear was good. Also, if playing War/Pal/Sham you get the unstoppable force 2H mace from AV.  If memory serves me correctly, only AQ40 and Naxx gear broke pvp and that stuff was very rare, especially Naxx stuff.
---
200 IQ
---
Shadowmeld alone is enough reason to play one.
---
Also "just cuz" and "I like it" are the 2 best possible reasons to play something, cuz it's a game that takes a good chunk of time to play
---
I've seen so many comments like this already - and I'm in the exact same boat.
---
I just don't know if that should help me or make me worry even more...
---
That's a different issue then. It's hard, but self control is necessary!
---
100% this
---
Pretty sure the hyenas in barrens are really bad.  I’m trying to remember why.  It’s been awhile.  I think they couldn’t learn all the wolf skills (dps boosting howl) so you were better off with a bird or cat.
---
You could become famous if you manage to flip like 20+ times in a row, that's pretty neat.
---
I like you
---
That's a fun way to put it! I haven't played music in many years (part of the Body Breakdown Problem), but I'd say I've still got some talent when it comes to that. I'll try it!
---
Riposte?
---
R13  gear &gt; almost everything.  Your spellpower doesn't matter when you're dead
---
I'm just trying to say that the testing process should speed up as it goes along, is all.
---
\&gt; This whole layering thing to me is extremely unsettling and you have the right to have the classic you hyped up for.. not this abberation they are trying to sell us. 
---
We don't have any RIGHTS to anything the own.  We get what they give us.  If they choose to add layering, cash shops, transmog, insta-60 tokens, etc  then we will get them.  You can bitch, whine, and throw whatever cap filled tantrum you want but in the end you'll either play it or you wont.  
---
You are right in the sense of being vocal and letting blizzard know what we want and don't want, its just stupid to assume that they have to listen to us.
---
Seems like the goal in vanilla was building a big, living world. 
---
Players were forced to communicate, travel, invest time, and raids were hard to complete both from a difficulty perspective and a "finding 40 competent people who can log on the same time every week" perspective. 
---
Things seemingly started changing when the games popularity exploded and they realized probably 80%~ of the playerbase would never kill a 40 man raid boss, so they started making everything easier, making comparable epics easier to obtain, and moving away from 40 mans in favor of 10/25.
---
Any plans on making it mobile friendly?
---
In neither of my comments above did I even say the word omen wtf
---
Ok, this one is good.
---
What class are you going to play as? if you are going shaman, hunter, warrior then it is worth it. You can jump to basically ratchet from valley of trials. And then start the long haul there. I would advise you to take off your weapon though so that way you don't lose it due to durability you will die. A lot but don't let that stop you from making your dreams come true.
---
Hunter/mage and to a lesser extent rogue are dps options that don't require godlike gear to be able to perform. but as others has said healer is also a good option
---
3.000 people per layer, and most will be in Durotar or Elwynn, Taurens won't have the most competition, but still wayy more than in beta currently!
---
&gt;Yeah omen was around for ages that guys chatting shit.
---
 Memory issues?
---
It's based on rank, WoWWiki has a comprehensive description of pre-2.0 honor system.
---
The rest won't be completely objective, but IMO, blue set is more than doable when you work full-time. AV rep is very easy and doable in a weekend (or two if casually).
---
I feel like Cata was the beginning of that, where every zone felt more like a theme park, rather than a part of the world.
---
*Heal me!*
---
Neither does smoking cigarettes but hey 🤷‍♂️
---
A family? Ha! You fool!
---
The counter to plate is a Mace. That weapon could blugen someone to death in full plate no problem.
---
Mauls were the weapons of choice against Longsword Plate wearers.
---
[This IS working as it did in vanilla: 5 yard melee range + 2.5 yards for each person moving= 10 yard melee range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k01xsCj_m20&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m44s)
---
Thanks man... I don't get this sub.
---
You talking about COMMUNITY but the only alternative to layering is 10x as many servers, which splits up the COMMUNITY 10x as much, and leaves 80% of that COMMUNITY on DEAD servers in 4 weeks.
---
Aesthetics
---
Shadowmeld
---
You just want to
---
It's a game breh
---
You posted a twitch clip. Prepare yourself, the circle jerk is coming.
---
Go for hunter if you don't plan on gearing it.
---
I will have my children and wife fed me while I am downing Rag.
---
But let's be honest, that code is probably complete shit compared to Blizzard's.
---
plate couldn't stop crossbows and it definitely wasn't immune to everything. a sharp sword can pierce through plate. also not every part of your body was covered. there were exposed areas, mostly so you could still walk and move your arms around.
---
But be par with hunters sounds very good or not?
---
Haha, that depends entirely on what your criteria is :D
---
I think if they do progression, it will stop at Wrath.
---
Healbot currently works in the beta, I have it installed and its working fine (with a few lua errors).
---
The heal was annoying at times, yes. They cast it at around 15% hp I noticed, but not consistant. Half of the time I was able to cast 4 wraths and get the caster to flee before a heal. If I had War Stomp off cooldown, it wasn't an issue at all.
---
That looks nothing like Orgrimmar.
---
So how do you make enough gold to buy everything in less than 2 hours, then? Besides buying it from shady chinese websites, there is absolutely no way to do it. 
---
You can also purchase the blasted lands quest items from the AH, btw. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Horde seemed to always outnumber Alliance on PVP servers and vice versa on PVE when I played in Vanilla. I think you're exactly right. The racials will help away a lot of people depending on their preference for PVE or PVP. I'm really, REALLY hoping that past is prologue and I can roll Horde on a PVE server and enjoy those sweet instant BG pops.
---
I see... So MM seems mandatory..
---
Way ahead of you.
---
Ah yes, of course, you cannot make money while making fans happy, those two things are polar opposites and cannot be done at the same time.
---
If Blizzard truly wanted to make as much money as possible, they would not be targeting a niche group of players that want to play an old game.
---
Shoo.
---
Roll Undead?
---
Also practice sitting around and doing nothing. Get really good at being stationary. If you can develop an advanced case of [anterior pelvic tilt](https://www.hudsonvalleyscoliosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/anterior-pelvic-tilt.jpg) prior to release you will be fully adapted to your natural sitting position and will face your enemies in comfort.
---
The main point in the first 10 points in BM is mana efficiency, something aimed first sucks at. -40% mana cost on revives and reduced need of pet healing (due to the +30% armor rating bonus for pet) are a big save in the long run.
---
Please tell me how you make these!
---
Cigarettes are super healthy lol wtf
---
&gt;In fact no mobs on PServers exhibit this pulsing AoE BAF at all.
---
I am not really sure of what I am about to say, but I think I remember fighting wolves that would sometimes howl and it would aggro another wolf. Did that exist in Vanilla? What about PS?
---
I am ready! Bring it on!
---
Or a good enough weapon.
---
paint.net (basically photoshop)
---
You don’t think they will pace the game as close as they can to the original?
---
In the wise words of Shia LeBeouf... “JUST DO IT!”
---
&gt; They didn't want to have player leaving their mini lowbie shards and entering a single, huge megaserver situation with 10,000 or more active players. So they probably then thought of layering. Unfortunately I don't think they properly considered the side effects of layering and perhaps still haven't.
---
I'd have thought the statistics for this should be pretty easy/accurate to do.
---
There should be an exponential decay in number of people at a level, as level increases.
---
So as long as they don't let a ludicrous amount of people be concurrently active on the same-name server, it's just a simple statistics problem.
---
&gt; My other thought is that you could theoretically just leave the healthy segments of the Cluster alone. If Defias Brotherhood 3 and 4 need to be merged but 1 is thriving then perhaps you just end up letting the situation develop organically and never merge 1 with anybody else.
---
You could do this, but I'd then worry about the distribution of 'good'/'bad' clusters and servers then.
---
As well as player expectations. You could (and there are many potential reasons) join the same server as a streamer you like, but on a different cluster, so you don't have to deal with the initial fallout of *actually* being on a streamer server at launch, but then expect to be merged with them once you're nearly max level and the launch surge has cooled down a bit.
---
But then if that doesn't happen, you're very disappointed.
---
So I feel like if they did clusters, they'd at least have to be crystal clear about what the plan was.
---
And personally I feel the mandatory planned merger is the better overall solution. I'd have thought having several of the clusters all hold onto very high populations (and so the merged server ended up with 6 hour queues or something) would be very exceptional, and not the norm. 
---
&gt; There is another thing that bothers me. They are doing this drastic sharding thing for the entirely of 1-60 (I still can't believe I'm typing this in real life) but they aren't yet planning to offer things that would actually improve things for players like balanced faction servers and RP-PVP. It seems to me that this layering thing is not for the benefit of the players. The old Blizzard, I expect, would try to make things better for us and it makes me sad that we are facing this.
---
In general, I am very on board that the current implementation is not fit for launch.
---
So this is why there isn't a world record for not blinking...
---
Same. Figures I get into med school the same year they finally announce classic. Basically I have to stay away from the game if I want to keep my future intact.
---
Really? I remember playing Nost and having thousands of players running around lag free.. GMs that responded in minutes.. no layering/sharding.
---
Being overweight tends to make people slow &amp; lethargic.
---
Get in shape, you will have more stamina &amp; energy to withstand those long sessions in front of the computer.
---
I don't have any video references at the moment. But here are some things that I know will be helpful in the long run.
---
-pet micro management. For example, when guarding a flag in AB, have your pet hiding far away so if you get CC'd, you can send the pet in to prevent a ninja cap. Works particularly well with cats that can stealth.
---
-learn choke points on maps and place your traps there to begin kiting or get early CC on someone before they even know you're there (ramps leading up to lumber mill, AV bridges, WSG doorways, etc)
---
-get an autoshot timer add-on and learn how to stutter step kite so you don't clip auto attacks. You can't auto shoot while running so you have to pause just as the timer finishes.
---
-feign death drops target, so practice feigning right when you think your opponent is about to do something big. That brief moment where they have to re-click on you can give you an edge. Also feign death when they get a big hit and you're almost dead. Believe it or not, sometimes people will actually think you died (works mainly on newer people).
---
-practice jump shots, running/strafing at max run speed then jump and mouse turn to fire your instant shots (serpent, concussion, arcane), then mouse turn back to your original orientation before your feet hit the ground.
---
-perform a side step when dropping your traps. The side step will cancel the kneeling animation and your opponent that's chasing you will likely not see it go down and run right into it.
---
-go engineering, using bombs and the various gadgets. Nobody expects a hunter to flying from lumber mill to blacksmith via parachute cloak raining down shots. Bombs are great CC too when a mage is trying to exploit your deadzone.
---
-lots of your shots can go through textures/hills. This is particularly useful in AV at choke points. You can practically tab target to find people and rip off a multishot, serpent, arcane etc into a crowd that you don't even have line of sight on for easy damage.
---
...that's all I got for now. Happy hunting!
---
And you're going to love it :-D
---
Would be cool to have more definiteness from Blizz. Right now it's "we'll try two weeks but maybe half a year". 
---
I hope they'll maybe update us on the issue after 13th of August when they have a better idea.
---
2-3 days isn’t a given just because that’s what you’ve experience on a private server. This is a blizzard launch which will be far more populated for a much longer time.
---
Its nice to want things.
---
Well glad to know its doable in MM too. Generally how is your pet aggro? Is your pet "tanky" like in BM?
---
So many big revelations all of a sudden, wow! See, I knew laying off the child porn would be good for you. Keep this up now!
---
4 out of 5 doctors recommend Kent.
---
There is no significant disadvantage though, even for priests no guild needs ALL of them to have fear ward.

---
Alternatively, you can go against the established system and just grab some other players and start world pvp battles. That's what my friends and I did and it was way more fun than BGs (and not nearly as gear dependent). We'd start with three or four of us and could start some pretty large raid vs raid battles by the end of the night.
---
Well I am going to risk it! 
---
We will see hoe it goes, I know its gonna be fun regardless of the outcome.
---
It will end up that way Every private server at least in vanilla content is always no more than like 8% faction imbalance. So it should be about the same you have people who are die hard alliance/ paladin fans. And those of us who are die hard horde/shaman fans. Either way just play what you want and don't worry about the other faction. Just kill them all.
---
they decided to keep layering instead of getting rid of it in favor of sharding which is used on retail and doesn't require nearly as much testing.
---
layering is a new tech that requires lots of dev attention
---
Great art but... that's not Ironforge ;)
---
Easiest to level, but among the hardest to master endgame-wise.
---
Why would anyone ever advocate for less choice?
---
Ideal or not, but a multibillion company doesn't just change it like this.
---
Is the Hunter quest for the bow/staff still going to be in Classic? Also are the pets normalized for Classic or can we get that awesome cat from the Barrens with the super fast attack speed :)
---
I remember that as being one of the most fun/challenging things I did back in Vanilla.
---
Man stay safe is so funny! I'm going to write about this in my diary, can anyone do my pigtails for me please?
---
Improved slam will give you better dps if you are 2h fury. Hamstring is a similar amount of rage but only hits for less than 100. Imp slam will hit with weapon damage + more for a 1 second "cast" time. Get good at weaving them into your rotation and you'll do fine.
---
If you are dual wield with windfury, use hamstring since you won't be speccing imp slam. No reason not to since your attack speed will be 2.4-2.7 mainhand. Slam is a waste of rage here.
---
In Cataclysm/MoP I played Troll for the min-max racial (berserking). I regretted it every minute I wasn't fighting a boss (99.5% of my time played) and it was not worth hating my character. Besides, I don't think there are any classes on Alliance that have drastically superior options for NE.
---
getting the route down is good but when you're actually logging in on week1 it won't be this easy because a lot of people are going to be competing with you for mobs/quest items
---
Cheers
---
Are you actually painting the land in or using a tool like the clone tool?
---
sharding can replace layering for the initial zerg. no reason to make it apply to the whole world
---
Haha, I love this!
---
My guess would be the Plainstriders.
---
Not for their dps or anything, but because their annoying, earbleeding screech will cause everyone in your group/raid playing with sound on to perform subpar.
---
That's what this post is supposed to be about, discussing this and finding better solutions.
---
I completely agree the current implementation is not fit for launch.
---
why is it okay for some streamers but not for others?
---
&gt; who's to say an item isnt added to 4h that has to drop to allow people access to this apparently Scarlet Crusade dominated zone.
---
I sometimes wonder if people even listen to themselves. Yeah, Blizzard should design an entire questing hub for the less than 1% population of the game that has done most of Naxx. That makes so much sense, of course. Blizzard could totally justify that expenditure of resources when people are leaving the game due to lack of content for that they can participate in. 
---
I want you to recall that Naxx was re-released as current content in WOTLK because it wasn't seen enough (and WOTLK was WoW's most popular expansion, so it was mathematically the correct move). In what possible world does it make sense in your mind to design content even more exclusive? Absurd. Ridiculous.
---
Best warrior tank IMHO, dat extra dodge tho.
---
Whirlwind is best wind.
---
just using clone form a another area and changing the hue
---
Thats how it was. Thats how it should be. High speed BfA zoomers will be pissed. But the crowd that truly wants Classic for what it is would be fine with TM/SS wars again.
---
Those are good points. Maybe I'll try another hunter and see if I have better luck/skill getting to 10. It won't feel like a waste of time if it helps me make a solid choice on what to play at launch! I was debating with my husband last night on what to play; he's super busy so he'll get left behind quickly, so I'd rather save a character to play specifically with him (he'll heal on a priest) and pick something else to level on my own...preferably something that can do okay without a pocket heal. (I mean, not that a healer leveling partner wouldn't be nice, but he can't commit to leveling the way I can due to his schedule.)
---
Hunter seems like the obvious choice. Paladin could be fun, too, but you're competing for mobs in melee which I'd rather not deal with.
---
I'd also like to get ahead of the pack a little bit; people will start spreading out after that point and I think it'll get better. But I completely agree with you that the middle of the pack will be a large swath of people and they'll take a while to get out of the way. I'm impatient anyway and considering no-life-ing it on launch week.
---
This is the big lie of classic.. when I played vanilla back in the day, I was a high school nerd with no girlfriend who was able to scrape together passable grades with minimal effort which basically allowed me to play nightly for 4-5 hours and every weekend as much as I wanted. 
---
Now I'm in my 30s, I've got a wife and a full time job and a house... I can't sit down for more than an hour at a time to game in the evenings without feeling guilty that I'm somehow failing the very concept of adulthood. I want classic so badly, and I want those feelings of being truly invested in a game again but I'm really scared it's going to be impossible. You can never truly go home again after all.
---
&gt; but I'd rather not put myself a disadvantage.
---
Who cares.  You talking about a 1% difference in performance.  Though, NE priest suck by comparison.  Missing fear ward and/or desperate prayer to have an incredibly shitty damage ability isn't worth the aesthetics.  Anything else is fine though.
---
Awesome thanks man. I miss the classic/bc era of this game alot but there are so many changes through the years it's hard to remember stuff. Especially from when I was a teenager and didnt know Jack crap about the game I was playing back then.
---
You cannot plan to get Rivendare's charger. The drop rate is absolutely abysmal (0.02%). And even then you have to win it against other party members.
---
Excited to farm alliance noobs in BGs. YOINK - my honuor now.
---
Accurate af.

As someone who _doesn't_ want to wait in queues during the first few weeks to months or end up on a dead server and have to pay to transfer, layering sounds great to me, provided they keep to their promise and kill it off on or before Phase 2. Everyone is griping about no life farmers potentially abusing it, but failing to acknowledge that while we normal folk have to log out and then back in and face queues, these people don't. They get a huge advantage from what's proposed if they can get in and stay in while a portion of the server's population which would compete with them is locked out because of tourists crowding the capacity. 
---
My suggestions for resolving the complaints with Layering, if possible and based on my understanding of the process. I'd rather we try to see if we can minimize all complaints instead of just whining. 
---
In general, of course, play what you enjoy because you will be staring at your character for a long time.
---
That said, the one situation where playing NE might be a big deal is if you intent to play priest. Priests get unique spells based on race, and the dwarf racial spell Fear Ward is overpowered in PvE and PvP. Obviously you can clear content easily without it, but guilds do prefer dwarves and some might look down on you for knowingly playing a NE priest.
---
Uh, yeah sure. You know how much development time it would take, how much cost it would be to keep up servers for all versions, and how much support it would need for character transfers and copies of characters in each subsequent xpacks to properly function?  
---
Not to mention considering that not every xpack would be equally profitable, but potentially would cost about equal investment, if the new ones even costing more, and potentially having smaller active playerbases.  
---
Financially speaking, this is a terrible idea. Even if it sounds like a good idea on the surface(though from replies I feel that it doesn't).  
---
I do like your idea a bit, but realistically speaking, it's unrealistic to expect something like this, unless WoW would be a much bigger success even today, and everyone would be loving and demanding every expansion, not just pre-cata ones(BC and Vanilla mostly at that even).
---
No worries! Just thought I'd share as I had a similar need and whipped that up pretty quick. I might actually make a public API for classic blue posts. Depends on how bored of AV I get tonight :P
---
Sounds pretty close. Spell applications (not checks) involving other units are batched together in 400ms batches.
---
Are you fucking kidding me? Everyone that is capable of being a night eld should...
---
If you aren't front flipping in classic what the shit are you doing on alliance?
---
Female dwarf ftw
---
This would spread communities too thin and also not be worth the support each expansion would need.  There was demand for classic, there’s not much for the others.
---
Is this the case for power shifting as well? Thought the attack power bonus on other weapons in combination with spamming your abilities would put out more dps than straight attack speed
---
Tauren also have a larger hitbox so you get even more range but it's a downside for Tauren casters.
---
The layer switch should only happen in a rested area, or going in and out of a dungeon instance. This would stop all this arena / world PVP layer swapping crap. It would also slow down the mining node hoppers drastically.
---
Good to know, ‘preciate it.
---
Grand questions for reddit. 
---
Accessibility killed wow.
---
Removing accessibility will make Classic thrive.
---
Those that can't watch a movie without checking their phone won't last in classic.
---
those guys don't look as far apart as OPs vid though
---
That was a reply to something else though?
---
It depends what you want to farm... if you wanna farm &lt;40 level mobs for cloth or anything and sell, or low level dungeons up to Scarlet, then mage is better. For same level farming, hunter is better, more relaxing and easier.
---
Good to know. Appreciate it.
---
That actually sounds amazing!
---
&gt; TBH though you should really make sure you are giving people accurate information before responding.
---
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
---
According to that logic you're never able to provide any information, just in  case things has changed.
---
Yeah, the most popular p server right now, has been sitting on 9k players for the entire past month. Every single Quest Zone is contested by multiple Groups. There are more People on your screen at all times, then there are Quest target NPC's.
---
All sense of traversing through a dangerous World is gone. Instead you are now playing tag against other people, until you reach lvl30 (haven't leveled futher, because it got tiring).
---
Great, Authentic Vanilla expirience, right there.
---
&gt;'will it have an affect on raiding' was the question
---
It seems to always come back to the commincation aspect whenever i start to think about any aspect of the game. Would people have liked classic if you could have the exact same content with the 40 man raids, but there was no insentive to talk? 
---
Such as if you had pure classic, with the one addition of group finder and LFR? Does that single addition ruin the game?
---
First aid is a secondary profession anyway so you should be able to pickup something else.
---
Took me a bit to digest this haha. I will try and reply point by point!
---
* 1) I'm not sure what you mean with your first point. Collecting the well stones and the acorns is in the chain of cleansing isn't it? So you'd have to complete that quest first before you can even go to the well to cleanse it. Might as well stay out and complete the other quests then!
---
* 2) Part of not looking up guides is that I wasn't even aware of a staff vendor in bloodhoof, I'm sure a stronger staff will definitely make kills quicker and therefor lower the time required.
---
* 2.5) The skinning bit. I think skinning is time consuming, but its a necessary evil. It will provide the gold required for all the spells (at least up to level 20) and then respeccing. My overall plan was to go with different talens pre-20 and respec into deep feral once I get cat form.
---
* 3) Hearthstone. I've been thinking of a way to intergrate the hearthstone into my run, and heartstoning from the cat area at level 3 sounds like something that will help. But then you get that age old argument that I keep reading on this subreddit. Kill every mob on sight, and killing those few plainstriders and cats when running back is just so damn attractive haha. I guess that luxury won't be available on launch, so HS'ing there is a good option.
---
Thanks for the input, I like to think about these things and discuss them!
---
Could be 8 hour days but 7 working hours. 1 hour off for lunch.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Thaek6C2UQQ
---
Yepp, mostly that. 🔺🔺🔺
---
Haha this made me laugh! This is so spot on for me. Most of my game time is 6 am to about 9 am when the wife wakes up and responsibilities kick in. No raiding for this guy! All good though, just gonna enjoy the journey and my end game will be to acquire my dungeon sets.
---
the thing is high warlord gear is equivalent to MC gear so once the raids start getting past MC you're going to be at a disadvantage in pvp
---
Yeah min maxing is pointless unless you are going to do hard core progression raiding. Play what you want. Also shadow meld is awesome for world PvP.
---
the worst case scenario you describe isn't better then layering
---
&gt;having to stare at the kind of ass you don't like for 2 years straight will kill your fun
---
Basically THIS!
---
Not mandatory, just optimal. 
---
It entirely depends on your guild. Maybe you can make up for being BM by farming some mats or consumables for the rest of the raid. 
---
Maybe your guild doesn't think raiding is much of a challenge and allows for sub-optimal specs.
---
Why isn't Archmeage on the list?
---
But no is the boring answer. Having a question in the headline implies the not boring answer.
---
If the answer is the boring one the headline is just clickbait.
---
Because speed leveling is a lot of fun for some people.  
---
There is nothing new in the game. The quests are the same, the world is the same... if you completed the same quests 30 times already, why would need to go easy and slow on the 31st?
---
Comes down largely to worldbuilding. Create a believable environment and people won't be able to put their finger on why it feels natural.
---
A good simple example of this is the undead starting area. A tiny scarlet camp to the east with the little detail of an outhouse a little distance from the camp tents. In the next part of the zone there is a small scarlet fort, with fields outside where the inhabitants get their food. One of the quests in the area actually involves getting food from that field.
---
If this was a newly made area in retail wow it would just be a series of small self contained little mini zones within the greater zone itself. A castle with no source of food around but loads of enemies and quests. Town in an area that makes no sense I.e. middle of nowhere, not on a crossroads or by a river.
---
Believable locations/worldbuilding &gt; overstuffing areas that don't make sense with things to do
---
You listed out drawbacks of layering. However, I feel like all of the things you listed are, like you mention at the end, worst case scenarios.  But even then...
---
&gt;Then the headline situation will be:  Massive queues. It's clear from media engagement that Classic will be very popular at launch. And queues are not fun, encourage unwanted/poor behaviour (people playing extremely extensive sessions, or 'exploiting' the afk system and staying logged in constantly), and split up friends/guilds/etc. As well as just not being great for anyone with a proper schedule, as you have little control over when you can play.
---
I don't see why the queue would be longer or shorter due to layering.  Also, queue limit is completely up to Blizz I would assume.  If you don't want long queues, let people into the game.
---
&gt;It will naturally create an imbalance between servers, through a bit of FOMO and queues being 'attractive' to some degree since it indicates good populations. So you've inherently got a system which you know creates 'good' servers and 'bad' servers
---
Could you please explain how layering changes this?  I guess the implication is that it makes populated servers more manageable thus more attractive?  Wouldn't that have the opposite effect long term, since long term people look for higher pop servers?
---
This isn't based on facts.  Also, if the starting zones are "unfun", which let me remind you is your opinion, it might encourage players to roll other classes, diversifying the game.  Also, it might end up being a ton of fun, encouraging players to group up to get quests, generally fucking around and having fun other than immediately grinding.  As for the servers crashing?  Well that would be something Blizzard should address independently.
---
Layering doesn't change this.
---
Fuck it you're right.
---
Almost as if its success was its own downfall?
---
Because nuance exists. More choices are good for some things and not as good for others.
---
If only we could get it before 2020 - pvp servers going to be POPPING all of phase 2
---
Was the complete opposite for me. Who the hell had free time when they were in school? It's a 9-5 job that also comes home with you!
---
Can I roll undead when I’m dead? 
---
Or does that rip a hole in the space time continuum?
---
I didn't play during Vanilla. Did people actually think that the early raids like MC, Onyxia and so on were hard? Im talking about their 2006 version, not the early bugged version in 2004, 2005.
---
I grinded kollar rep to exalted in vanilla...... I grinded every color of dragon whelping pet available......I ran straholme 500 times trying to get the barons mount....
---
FuCK No I'm not crazy enough to grind a wintersaber and I'm a guy who likes grinds!
---
Tell me, with zero data, why is more choice a detriment in this scenario?
---
You dumb crocodile.
---
Different factions have different dungeons - DM-Stocks-Gnomer vs RFC-WC-RFK-RFD.
---
For neutral dungeons, Alliance is linked to Ulda and BRD via dwarves, with Mara and DM via nelves, the rest is similar.
---
Alliance has a better Ony chain, all the other raids are the same. Well no, night elves are more important for AQ then taurens. 
---
So the answer is Alliance, but not by far really.
---
&gt; keeping the Vanilla style gameplay in mind.
---
What exactly is "Vanilla style gameplay"? Is Blizzard really going to design and release new raid content with their shitty vanilla balance in mind? 
---
I feel like people forget the original dev team that made Vanilla was largely responsible for TBC. TBC was their vision of Vanilla WoW being built upon and improved. It's not like the later expansions where new blood came in and altered the core philosophy of the game, TBC was Vanilla+.
---
Honestly, if a "1.13" ever happens, it needs to be an expansion-level change that up-ends the shitty vanilla balance and brings it more in line with what BC/WOTLK looked like (without being those expansions). But you change too much, and you alienate Classic-players, and you change too little, and people would rather just have BC.
---
Ehh, I'm honestly not sure. I think the main reasons people hung out in IF &amp; Orgrimmar so much was because you needed to go there to find a group or to use the auction house. Stuff like dueling, trade chat being constantly popping, and whatnot just seemed to happen organically as a result.
---
90s per pummeler. You're going to need more than a dozen per raid.
---
This looks exactly like my warrior when burning crusade came out.  Still have him on retail just like this
---
Very important question for me is the Tauren extra range thing for melee / hitbox. Would this be considered a good thing for hunters? Why or why not?
---
I get it, but why not just respond with why it's wrong, instead of saying you hate them and talking down to them? If they're wrong, correct them. Then hopefully they're accepting and they can move forward with better information.
---
2 slots does not mean that you can have 3 though (1 active and 2 on stables), because you will need to tame new pets to learn higher rank skills from them and then teach those skill on your pets... Only in max level when you have already learned all higher ranks you will be able to have 3.
---
I was thinking more the opposite of getting in better shape so I can order pizzas and play wow all night lmao
---
You just made me realize how much fun it would be to be able to play around with a wow map editor and build my own worlds
---
This is beautiful
---
Exactly. The Code Red is going to need something to burn.
---
That was just an example of the values for shadow priests, once I've had feedback of priest attribute values I can look at mages/locks/disc.
---
Tauren hunters represent!
---
The advantages are not HUGE. Sure, they (racials) can help, but realistically, if you're not going for server first raid clears or first Grand Marshal, the trade-off isn't that huge. Learn to play your class, make some friends along the way, and you'll do perfectly fine in Classic.
---
Also underrated bonuses that don't provide an actual gameplay benefit: 'pretty race', nelf female /dance - if you plan to beg for gold and most of all - BEST Alliance mount. People will be farming rep to get a sabre mount!
---
You’re right I just wanted to point out that lots of stuff in osrs can be much more intensive than wow

Blizzard created a blue post on this subject. You'd think that if you are going to give somebody information about it that you would at least find the blue posts related to it.
---
This particular subject got a ton of traction and anyone who was following this even remotely knew the final result. You didn't have to look very hard to find this very commonly known information.
---
&gt; Avrg DPS in MC before BWL release was around 600 DPS. Thats without MCP / Acuria.
---
I hope you have proof of that, because that sounds very fake.
---
I feel your pain. I'm in my last year of pharmacy school so I'll have next to no time for classic.
---
From the PVP Duel tournament that was held a bit ago, you could see batching having a great effect on things.  Double abilities would go off all the time that normally wouldn't.
---
Here you go from wowhead.

Be ready to heal indefinitely, or be an auto attack andy with little to no dps ;)
---
Just kidding don't listen to me and others who say this. Play the game how you enjoy it, man. It's not all about min/maxing! Have fun on Alliance I will be rolling Horde warrior for this sick R10 set and many other reasons.
---
That code is terrible,  and horribly inefficient server wise
---
I was confused for a sec becuase it Looks a bit like Grim Batol 😂 Awesome painting dude
---
The game used rpg as a design pillar rather an obstacle to overcome. This made the world so much more immersive, a place you wanted to log into and get lost in.
---
That + gaming market as a whole, more quality games = less time in wow, even more so when it takes hours to clear a dungeon, raid, bg.
---
Just wait until your wife causes wipes in BRD...the true test of a marriage.
---
Ah gotcha
---
I've been reading this thread looking for a reply like this. I feel like I was living in bizarro world. I didn't have the time as a kid to commit to WoW. I never made it to 60. School and recreation pretty much ate up most of my time. There was always something I was involved in that kept me busy.
---
Now? Oh fuck ya, no kids, odd interruption working from home. Pretty sure I can play WoW while working from home...
---
I’ve been using classicdb.ch to check out items and drops. It has drop rate percentages, quest rewards, etc.
---
Healing RECEIVED showed in vanilla.  Outgoing heals did not.
---
I know how it's going to be, but I think I'll manage. In MoP the entire server started in a single zone and I still managed to get realms first 90. Just knowing where to go and what to pick up is such a huge advantage!
---
Truly evil
---
On a PvP server, yeah.  On PvE, you can just roll a hunter to 10 (min level for the quests) and summon then switch.
---
Quests are definitely doable at 10 as I did them a couple weeks ago in beta.
---
Only from you.  It will then move to the next person highest in its threat level.  Your pet, a group member who casted a heal, anyone who hit it....
---
How long did you play exactly? Nostalrius and private servers crashed constantly.  "REE JUST LOST IRONFOE 15 MINUTE ROLLBACK"
---
Its that balancing act of sleep vs fun, you can game for 8 hours a night if you don't sleep and feel guilt free :D but youll feel like shit for other reasons lol
---
Yep it's gonna be wild. I can't do that again though, glad I'll be disc lol
---
I'm in med school and still play fuckloads of games. You have time if you get your time management down. There's no salvation for you.
---
This is me, but I have already decided to embrace the abyss and let it take me. The darkness will be gentle.
---
I thought Sylvanas was a Banshee ghost in Classic?
---
Also get a colon cleanse the day before release so you can just fast and not poop for the first week.
---
I approve this message.
---
That's now how bis works. Also, do not pve as a mace rogue.
---
I'm going to level at my own pace, without reading speedrun guides. I want to enjoy the leveling experience fully, not just min max through zones clicking on quests without reading. That's how I played retail WoW.
---
So if it takes me 6 months, then so be it.
---
Funny story about echeyakee I recently had on a private server. This quest mob is summoned by a horn or something and when I ran over to the area to complete the quest there was just a hunter sitting there, waiting for it to "spawn" and he didn't know it was a quest mob that only spawns when the quest item is used. I asked him how long he was waiting and he said something like 30 minutes +. So I then proceeded to summon the cat and let him tame it after me begged me. Was a fun interaction and I felt kinda bad for him waiting for something that was never going to actually spawn.
---
There's been a ton of bugs. Pets not working, all the Layering, npcs not behaving right. They need more time not less
---
It seems like mostly you just don't like the original more complicated pet mechanics of Vanilla. You have to take time and actually check up on your pet, make sure you have a good method of gathering food, build reputation, etc. I played a hunter in vanilla and personally I'm excited to go back to its system. Pets are different from each other and more than just an npc I can order around.
---
My suggestion would be to play a different class, or give yourself time to adjust. I among many others are extremely excited to go back to the old pet system.
---
perfect, thanks
---
Sure, but I think most people agree that launching the game the same week work is scheduled for many people is not ideal.  
---
Welcome to life, only the rich and retirees have open availability.
---
Now do it as Alliance.
---
Why not be in good shape AND have lots of fat stores? Like a bear.
---
Not sure if you get all the quests, some might be tauren only or some bullshit. Class trainers can be a pain. But the run is no problem. Take the hidden path to ratchet, pick up fp there and in XR and follow the road. Tested this 2-3 times this week on a private server, about 15-17min run. Deathless np.
---
Thats true, wasn't exactly a steam store back then with access to AAA games for less than a tenner each
---
is it hard for you to imagine that it might not be the same people who complained about lfg in the first place
---
Streamer man bad &gt;:(( 
---
I mean, if 80% of your player base isn’t experiencing the content you spent the time developing, it isn’t exactly an efficient or intelligent use of your company resources.
---
They made mounts, dungeons, raids, general endgame content, more accessible throughout the years but swung too far in this direction over time, and now everybody gets a ribbon for playing the game.
---
This speaks to me. 
---
Back in February I found out we are having triplets. They are due on August 27th. RIP.
---
same but with university /cry
---
Drink piss and eat shit
---
Memories, every time a group of albs side swipe you with that SoS+mez it was "omg radar wtf"
---
Is this a real story? If so, thanks!
---
If it can run BFA (get the trial and try it) - then it can run classic.
---
Calm down Mitch
---
Damn time to stop my apt stretches.
---
You have to remember, we are playing on a patch that drastically changed the game. We are essentially playing a pseudo-TBC version rather than true vanilla. Everything from class, dungeon difficulty, to item tuning was changed to make it drastically easier. For example, in true vanilla WoW, fury warriors were bottom tier DPS until later patches and often only used for niche fights (Vael). The numbers and such seem right on Classic, the issue is the actual content is an updated version that significantly decreases the difficulty of the game.
---
I'll look into this tonight, I was unaware of that. Thank you!
---
Because fortnite kids will take anything they can get their hands on - instant gratification is nothing new.
---
Full Devout is best devout.
---
I don't look forward to getting Benediction again though.
---
Later versions of heal bot let you use combinations of shift, ctrl, shift+ctrl to bind spells of different ranks to the same key.
---
My Mouse 1 was heal ranks then on key combos. Middle mouse was renew and ranks on key combos. As I leveled so I would change default ranks.
---
*slurps Monster Zero Ultra* POG
---
Which doesn't really change at all because you still have to unlock that stuff first. You got a full Naxx set transmogged? Obviously you cleared Naxx.
---
Sure, reason #1 - it's Classic WoW, you're going to die quite a bit - leveling, ganking, raiding, etc. and NEs get Wisp form. It's a very nice quality of life boost, corpse running SUCKS. 
---
Reason #2 - Shadowmeld has it's uses for any class but Rogue (AFAIK). World PvP ambushes, guarding points in BGs, avoiding mob patrols, it comes in handy quite a bit. I had a NE warrior alt, and it was fantastic for getting the charge off in PvP which can otherwise be quite difficult.
---
Wait what? You get banned for using the most logical option if your wow tooth is aching and want to do stuff without betakey? I understand the differences in numbers so people dont spread misinformation but banning talking about a TOOL feels simply an overkill.
---
Hunter is a good choice. It doesn't scale the best with gear and their tier sets are pretty decent. 
---
I would say any of the casters are fine, as long as you don't avoid both Stam and Int. I would avoid warrior since they need gear like crazy.
---
Paladin is decent too but only as a healer. You will do next to nothing as ret with bad gear.
---
I did. But I didn‘t find anything specific for blacksmithing and palas
---
Honestly it was one of the last things I added, I typed in all the information before I saw what was required to get it. Then I ultimately decided to just leave it on there. I might end up deleting that line out.
---
I'm confused, why is shaman in the title? Are we supposed to only talk about shaman? Was that your class? Whybl didn't you answer your own questions?
---
Is it August yet?
---
To be honest i give wow alot of credit for my social development. Started playing classic when i was 11 and was an incredibly shy kid, suddenly talking to randos wasn't so scary because thats what you needed to do to get to the fun content like dungeons and hard quests.
---
Of combat, you only use them on bosses really and boss fights last about 1 min till aq and then it’s about 2 mins per boss-obviously this doesn’t factor in wipes. It’s a lot but a dozen usually is about right
---
Gratz! Also, sorry for your loss!
---
thats called cheating, it didnt happen in vanilla unless youre a hunter
---
/whisper Can I get kings please? You gave me might!
---
Probably not worth the time on easy/farm bosses
---
So I could take DMT and shoot lighting bolts.
---
Thank you both for this information! I'll update my list after work.
---
I feel like there is a happy compromise. Layer 1-20/1-25 non contested zones, where the real rush is. Let layering die in zones pst 25. It will be hard to quest but guess what... if you’ve put 20-40+ hours in the first 2 weeks of an MMO and expect the world to still be tailored to you, you might be in the wrong kind of game. I just want to have the entire world opened up after a point, and rest assured that I’m not in some split up world, knowing nobody is abusing the easily abused system
---
I *absolutely* understand why we need *some* kind of aid at launch. It would legitimately be 10 hour queues if they just open servers at 2500-3000. However, layering the entire 1-60 experience is overkill to say the least. There is a compromise, just like with loot trading, and the community should really try to focus more on that, rather than “layering is dumb, no, layering is good”.
---
Yeah. That might be an exaggeration, tbh, but I'd be pretty curious what percentage of the playerbase cleared MC and/or BWL, though.
---
I feel pretty comfortable saying it definitely was not a majority.
---
His argument is you can’t say that cause blizzard has never done a true merger. Hurr durr I cant use logic to equate combining server populations and the damage it does to mergers.
---
Hey,  I am almost 30, work a full time job, have a wife and a house and will probably play a little.  My wife never played wow before and we decided we would play together. Even if it’s not her thing , I’ll probably play. 
---
Usually when I get into bed I get my laptop and play a game for an hour or two before sleep.  There’s nothing wrong with playing a game or doing a raid to unwind after work. When I get home I usually just want to hang out and not do too much thinking. You won’t be able to play the game like you used too, but you can still play and not feel guilty.
---
I think what happened with retail vanilla is the dev's reached a point where they decided there was enough content to ship. Instead of fleshing out Hyjal and the rest of Azeroth, they just moved on to Outlands &amp; Azeroth mostly stayed the same (except for Dustwallow and maybe a couple others) and then they came back &amp; changed everything in Cata.
---
Any streamer recommendations for hunter?  Trying to decide between it and a couple other classes but can't find many hunters to watch to get a good feel for it.  I've seen Beans, Jellybeans, and Joana recommended in the past but while they may be good hunters they've been terribly boring streamers the couple times I've watched. I think Beans in particular I need to give another chance to though, as I've barely caught him on and not looked for any saved vids of his.
---
If you can get raid gear, hunters and rogues can use all their set for PVP.
---
In fact except healers and warriors, most classes can use their raid gear in PVP. Might not be optimal but it will be OK.
---
If you can't raid you can't hold your own in PVP once everybody has BWL+ on farm.
---
Isnt that nike?
---
And even if they did flag, who is going to attack them on a pve server? Very few will bother. I've run around flagged on pve servers before war mode was around, and got ignored by the other faction for hours.
---
Yeah dude i love stuff like that. There's a few games that let you create areas (old ones now I haven't played anything like that for ages) and when you make something that is believable and feels like it could be real it just feels \*right\*.
---
If you're interested in how zones etc feel more real than others look up a video on YouTube called the Shandification of Fallout. It's specifically about how the newer fallout games have unrealistic zones built around satisfying the player, rather than realistic zones for the player to explore, but it can easily apply to any other game really including WoW
---
Swift Zulian Tiger??
---
Vanilla wow was a success, did you miss the news? Don't bring up the scraps and bruises as the weaklink of the game.
---
As someone who got themselves in a bad spot last night those chasing mob speeds are correct and fast.  Definitely not bfa.
---
True, in retail these days I don't feel like i "am" my character",  I'm very aware that I'm playing a game, spending a few minutes jumping on to each character I have to get my dailies done.
---
I can‘t answer you that exactly in detail, there are numerous guides, but i think yes, the pummeler does more. Only knowing feral tank pov 🙃
---
It's pretty good for hunter since feign death resets while melded, and it works wonders in PvP. 
---
I would say the only really bad choice for NE is priest. Since the specific NE racials for priests are pretty lackluster once you're done leveling.

---
It look like that some players just want to play Vanilla and import BFA QoL throught addons... Then they'll complain..
---
&gt;Paladin is decent too but only as a healer. You will do next to nothing as ret with bad gear.
---
This is one of the main reasons I'm thinking about going horde... to feast on paladins.
---
Nothing better when first phasing into Stormwind and then the music just turns up to 11.
---
I do believe that the  specs for Classic will be higher than for the original Vanilla. Not by much though I believe.
---
Healer role is going to be needed.  Would get you an instant raid spot and 5mans would be a breeze.
---
All jokes aside good luck!
---

---
It seems to be pretty unanimously considered a negative for hunters.  Your melee hit box is longer meaning you have to run further away to get back into your ranged spot.  It just shifts the deadzone out, doesn't eliminate or shrink it from what I've seen.
---
I disagree. At least in this case. The reason is that i saw the question being thrown around a lot but no one ever asked if the opposite was true. It only makes sense for the headline to reflect what is being talked about.
---
If you want the most useful racial, then no. If you don't care that much about racials, it doesn't matter.
---
You are the hunter we should all strive to be.
---
You're not doing much as ret with good gear either lol.
---
See I figured with anki I can probably manage 8 hours a day studying which is essentially a full time job, so I’ll have time for games. However, I and my wife knows how I get when I play WoW, particularly classic. She might not be so fond.
---
Forsaken can be high elves iirc, just like Sylvanas herself. But it's rarer.
---
No other race have really fought the Scorge. Horde races, even if they did, did it on Kalimdor and probably were not raised as zombies. In theory, there could have been Forsaken dwarves or even gnomes (even though the vast majority of gnomes spent Thrid War in Gnomeregan, it's hard to believe it was 100% of gnomes). But probably their Earthern origins have prevented it.
---
IIRC addons that did stuff like this were bannable in retail.
---
In essence it comes down to this; Are you a gamer or min-maker, do you see the WoW as entertainment or an equation?
---
I understand people saying they want to make their choices in order to be the best they can be, but realistically, being the best has more to do with youthan the race you choose to play.
---
Some of the best players I met from Vanilla to Cat played unconventionally. The difference was their understanding of their class, and talents, but mostly it was the person pushing the buttons.
---
Is this all fully hypothetical or are there hints its getting Content?
---
Right but people back then weren’t playing the game for 15 years prior to its release. I don’t know if you’re a better player now than you were back then, but I certainly am. I was playing a dual wielding melee spec hunter in pvp when I hit 60 in vanilla, which definitely shouldn’t work but was actually doable because of a combination of other people also being bad and probably peoples computers putting out such low fps it might not have mattered if they were good. 
---
Scorpid sting to reduce their melee damage, bat screech to further reduce it, spam improved wing clip and raptor strike with aspect of the monkey on and mongoose when you dodge. So, there’s going to be at least 1 less shitty player this time around, I’m assuming I won’t be the only person to figure some things out between then and now.
---
Classic is 99% the same as 1.12 Vanilla. Some people remember Vanilla being harder because they played or at least leveled up in earlier patches that were harder. Private servers have always been inaccurate in a lot of ways, but people were in denial and it was tough to prove.
---
calling fake unless rank is shown.
---
considering I just made it up it's probably hypothetical
---
Uhh.. we should buy the billboard and have it read "You think you do but you don't"
---
Actually not a bad suggestion. Of course I have no idea how realistic it is technology wise.
---
Oh shoot, I don’t know how I missed that! Thanks a bunch!!
---
Oh well, too bad. I’d rather have content that works, mostly...
---
Eh, it will be different trust me. I was the same way on private servers and classic servers for other games. 
---
Hard facts though, real life is a bitch. By the time you come home from working all day, get dinner ready and eat and take care of chores I often have like 2-3 hours before it's time to sleep and do it all over again. I don't even have children for reference. 
---
Then I set aside time on the weekends and say I'm going to play all day.. only wait I've got a lawn to maintain, my wife wants to go do something, the house needs cleaned, were going to somebody's house for dinner.. and by the time it calms down it's 6pm on Sunday. 
---
Life.. uh.. finds a way. Assuming most of us are not experiencing classic for the first time, were 15 years older now and have more responsibility. Even if you want to fall back into old times for nostalgia reasons, you won't because life. 
---
That's been my experience with these types of things anyway. It's never the same, too many changes over the years. Ymmv.
---
&gt; Before I know it I'm going to be in some sweaty raid in 2 in the morning, going to work the next day tired as fuck. 
---
and you know you'll love every second of it
---
Aaaand we’re back in Legion
---
&gt; with anki I can probably manage 8 hours a day studying 
---
If you're spending that much time in year one studying that isn't a test day, you're not using Anki properly.
---
No, Sharding is dynamic.
---
This forces the same cadre of players into a pyramid scheme of condensing players.
---
see it as an investment. in a couple of years you have your own personal gold farmer trio
---
It's not a BiS list. It's just a compiled list of gear to look around at/for pre-raid. If a guildie asks to do a certain instance, I can look at the list and see if there's anything I need from there. If not, I'll probably be farming the leather for my crafted items.
---
There's already tons of resources for BiS lists.
---
One quest for several 50% drop rate meat until you get friendly. Then once you get friendly, a second quest to kill furbolgs, then at, I think, honored, a third to kill giants. If I recall, they are all 50 rep per turn in, 55 if you're human. 
---
They are repeatable so you turn them in, pick them up again, then go to the proper part of the zone. The stuff you kill is all 55 if I recall so none of it dies easy enough to be called "quick".
---
I never did it but people have said it can take 2 months if you do it for 2 - 3 hours a night. Every night.
---
It is a real story lmao. I felt like I had to give the situation to avoid being potentially ridiculed for asking the question 😂 
---
That’s a good idea though!! Thank you very much, I can even just download it and log in on my account 👍
---
Well you should care only about what bring you happiness and not about the concept of adulthood or if you act normal enought for your age.
---
That's why I'm rolling a class/role where I know I can have fun soloing, doing some wpvp, gearing up via BG reputation and crafted gear, and maybe do some PUG ZG runs. There's going to be a lot of people like us, and as much fun as it would be to try and push all the way to KT this time around, there's still so much of the game left to explore that I believe it'll work out.
---
Is this merge sort????
---
This. Did they make it better than release? Yes! Did they make it easier? Also yes!
---
Easy groups = warlock (summoning)
---
Easy farming = mage
---
Easy to do both, just not as well = hunter
---
If alliance—hunter is more viable in 5 groups as you won’t be competing with shaman for enhancement gear, and only mail wearer in raids.
---
Hunters are also famous for kiting and killing things far beyond their level and requiring groups due to their ranged attack cannot be resisted (like mages and warlocks) parried or dodged.
---
They're a nightmare to deal with in premades if the guy knows what he's doing. blessing of sacrifice is bonkers good. I've had pally healers throwing it on random targets with mouseovers, like pets and shit. That paired with freedom and cleanse. Blehhhh. I hate fighting them. No idea why you would want to.
---
I took shaman in vanilla... got to level 30 with less  than 1g to my name couldnt afford my abilities or to repair my gear so i started again as a hunter lol
---
Reasons to pick Night Elf:
---
Teldrassil
---
Wisp Spirit - 150% Speed when Dead
---
1% Extra Dodge
---
Liberal Thinking
---
Gear looks gorgeous on Males.
---
Shadowmeld - HUGE PvP advantage.
---
Feathermoon Stronghold
---
Superiority over other races.
---
What more can I say?
---
To be a night elf.
---
I honestly think it's just because nightelfs are purple. It was the faster option.
---
this reminds me of how they used to explain shit bonds and special purpose entities in financing class
---
Lol, imagine if Blizzard released a game that was unplayable for days/weeks (it'd be even longer these days, but I digress) and thinking it would be seen as a "success".
---
Honestly, how did you contact them and what did you ask? I'd love to get my original account back, but all I know is a character name and server name.
---
Isn't that the addon that was just a troll? So it doesn't work, but you can download it?
---
ah yes, the *true* fans.         
---
Ignoring how pretentious that sounds, there won't be any BG's available during phase 2 so wpvp is all you'll get either way.
---
Lol ya. That's true.
---
But they won't do that, we all have to accept that layering will be 1-60 for the first 4-6 weeks.
---
Nobody will give a shit about layering in December and that's what blizzard is holding out for.
---
Well... I think LFG without the port to instances is a big Change already... You can't make an alt Level it to 15 and sit in ORG until 60 :P That is quite a Major Change
---
And given that it is an addon it probably won't have enough users to make it work nicely. 
---
So it is back to using Chat :)
---
Everything you just said can be done with layering, at much less costs, much faster and with less impact.
---
Watch out for the mummies when in a pyramid.
---
Pre Orderer here for NMS. Yes, they did screw it up. But the more accurate version is that they teamed up with Sony who put an enormous amount of pressure on them to publish early, way too early, and development wasn't anywhere close to where Hello Games wanted it. 
---
I loved the game regardless, but it did get a little dull after a while and the holes begun to show. I decided to give it a negative rating on Steam. I really wanted this game to be something special and fantastic. But I had put it down.
---
Fast forward about a year and a half, Hello Games has kept working on it, kept providing absolutely massive updates, and continued to flesh out the game. I tried it again and it was a night and day difference. The tram never gave up. They continued to work and update the whole time. In fact, they are on the cusp of releasing another massive update this summer as well. 
---
The game is phenomenal now! Absolutely fantastic. This studio and their game's story is like the under dog sports story everyone loves. I went back and changed my review on Steam to positive. There is so much to do, so much to see, so much to figure out, so many battles, and everything else. They have fulfilled every promise they made and so much more.
---
Hello Games, although an Indie developer, really showed us what a top tier game developer looks like and how to behave. Take note, AAA companies, this is how it's done.
---
Nice :) will look for such guild! Hehe
---
As a mage, I accept that
---
Lewwwll
---
&gt;Oh well, too bad. I’d rather have content that works, mostly...
---
I mean, that's not the Vanilla experience, haha
---
&gt;Can you imagine the raging shitshow when all the nolifers and hardcorea rush to 60 to get their world firsts and it’s a broken mess?
---
10/10, would watch
---
I'm cultivating mass! When classic drops I'll start harvesting.
---
Are BfA numbers even high enough for all that "millions of players"?
---
I'm just looking forward to the slaughtering that is phase 2, before they can get geared :)
---
I'm not sure that's true.
---
I'm a lefty and I almost exclusively use the mouse in my right hand when gaming, but when I'm doing pretty much anything else, or playing a game like Hearthstone or Slay the Spire, it feels far more natural to use the mouse in my left hand, despite the fact that I've spent significantly more time developing muscle memory in my right hand.
---
This is 100% what I’m doing. Is the PvP set gear enough to compete with raid gear? In phase five I plan on picking up the Dungeon set, can that heat compete with raid?
---
Yep I agree till an extent, you still need to sleep!
---
My wife goes to bed very early, well at least compared to me...she usually is ready to sleep around 10pm and I normally go around 00:00 - 00:30!
---
So what I plan is to extend my free/gaming time till 01:30 - 02:00 until I am lvl 60...I wake up every day at 08:00, which leaves me around 6 hours of sleep per night! When I was younger that was the sleep I would get normally, since I went out most nights or I would be gaming till very late...in the past couple of years I have not been doing much of that and I gradually started to get more sleep.
---
Not sure if my body is still ready for that or not, guess I will find out soon enough! What I still don't know is: should I get as much sleep as I can till late August? Or should I start to "train" my body right now to gradually get less sleep than I usually get so it gets ready for it?
---
Going for full "bis" is a waste of time. Just getting good items in every slot is enough to do well in raids.
---
If they have the ability to assign you to a layer, I don't see they would have trouble pre-assigning to you a layer to graduate to.
---
Perhaps you will always be able to see the characters below you... that might get tricky, perhaps by zone instead of level cap specifically?  Where there's more zone layers lower down and they same people move into larger layers as you graduate up?
---
 Ishne'alo'porah, my brother!
---
&gt; Ensuring you provide accurate information is the dumbest thing you have ever heard?
---
Yes, because it's literally impossible to do.
---
uldum should have just been a dwarf dungeon like uldaman, instead we got indiana jones references and egyptians :|
---
Ok didnt find clues for that in your description thats why I asked. But if this starts stones rolling and some motivation for devs its serves a great purpose!
---
you realize you can optimize for other things besides DMG right?
---
As soon as I can. It was 100% worth it the first time (it's still a "favorite" mount in retail that I use to this day), and especially moreso now that the original unarmored epic mounts aren't coming back.
---
I get why we need some kind of solution, but I hate how we went from “shard the starting zones” to “layer the entire planet”. There’s a compromise here that we can find, just like with loot trading. 
---
Just layer non-contested zones, 1-20/1-25. Thats where the majority of the Rush is. Plus, if you’ve put 30-40 hours in on the first week, and get to level 30 in the rush, you should expect the game to be *busy*. It’s an MMO, it’s massive and multiplayer.
---
r/shittylifeprotips
---
Get rid of the black bottom section and it could work.  Separating the player base as little as possible is preferred.
---
They look neat.
---
Yes and even server first/grand marshal can be achieved without being that opti. World first however...
---
100% agree about the aesthetic
---
Yeah, Phase I is what I really care about and what will really decide things, excluding the PvP additions.
---
Actually it’s not a bad idea. As 1-10 it’s more tedious than it is helpful to have large clusters of population. The questing in these zones are quite easy and almost soloable. Until hogger-ish Times. I think the proper breakout for 1-5, then 5-20. Maybe I’m crazy but I can see ppl getting frustrated by not getting to level or being weird alt-oholics during the first few months..
---
My only concern is not seeing enough players within the 7-10 bracket. I think that’s when you actually need to form groups and having small clusters of say 10 ppl - well idk if that’s reasonable 
---
To that point: what are the population of each layer? 
---
I prefer this over layering populations by zones. That’s obnoxious.
---
 But then thinking about wanting to gank lowbies in redridge ... that won’t exist bc you’ll be on the 60s only layer. Yeah idk if that’ll work either.
---
Humm this might be good for you!
---
This depends on the country, but I assume you will have some days/weeks of work right?
---
You are not getting that much sleep in the 1st months anyway so volunteer on baby duty for the 1st weeks and let your wife sleep! You can just stay up all night and play WoW while keeping your children close and act if you need to.
---
I believe in vanilla it was BoP
---
Everything is gonna get slaughtered in phase 2. It's going to be a shit Show of massive raids/multiboxers running around owning everybody. 
---
I fully expect to have my ass handed to me constantly no matter what I'm playing.
---
I'm pretty sure I was one of if not the first night elves on Hellscream to get a horse by getting exalted with Stormwind. Through Runecloth turn-ins.
---
It was so long, I still have a mule character named Runemule. 
---
Now you can exalt any home city in 3 hours.
---
Excessive PvP camping is actually breaking the rules on an RPPvP server if the ones being camped are attempting to RP or RPPvP. Unfortunately GMs just never gave a shit.
---
We did band together against them when possible but they usually had enough numbers to match several RP focused guilds at once. Let alone if they caught us out in the wild.
---
Seems you have no choice if you want to keep your manhood ! \^\^
---
Til ya die!
---
The ghostsabber is white, not the same color as the winterspring mount. Those are frostsabbers in blue and lavendel.
---
I'm happy for new players interested in Classic. Hell I'm happy for new players interested even in retail WoW, because WoW is a game that's kinda hard to get into regardless of if it's Classic or retail.
---
With that being said, I'm also curious why Blizzard gave closed beta testing for a few thousands of people to people like her who don't know anything about WoW. I thought this beta serves for players and Blizzard to recreate vanilla exactly how it was. Yes, free advertising helps, but I'm already seeing those beta players who have no interest in WoW getting back to their main games on Twitch. Most of them didn't even reach level 40. Before some white knight calls me incel or hater, I have absolutely nothing against Pokimane. I'm talking about most of the non-WoW streamers already giving up on beta, which might be worse advertising in the end than letting them play on release like rest of us. I mean for example I know many people from my realm on retail who have been playing since vanilla and who gets into the beta? Of course a streamer that plays WoW like once per month and didn't even play vanilla. No, I'm not saying I should get in. I can wait until release, I have many games to play until then. But I'd like to see more vanilla players getting into the beta instead of some random streamers.
---
Call it gatekeeping or whatever, but as I said, I'm more than happy when there's such a huge interest in Classic. However even Blizzard themselves said they're inviting mostly people who played vanilla back in the day to recreate vanilla experience, why do they need streamers that don't even play WoW and who gave up already on beta for that?
---
R14s on Horde.... I only remember you and an Orc Warrior on Horde. Maybe 2 UD Rogues? The name Grimal comes to mind.
---
On Alliance I only remember Kunego and Nikura.
---
This. I like the silverpine lvl 10 worgs with bite and furious howl, the scorpion in Durotar with bite and poison. 
---
Alliance side I’m not sure. The coyotes in Westfall have FH and Bite I think. Mangeclaw in Dun Morough looks cool. Owls in Teldrassil.
---
Water cooled is the min spec
---
No reason it shouldn't, the demons for the quest are in beta
---
The trick is to be single and unemployed !
---
\*taps head with finger\*
---
This stuff right here is why I will keep eternally shitting on private servers.
---
Stock up on depends adult diapers so you don’t have to get up to shit or piss
---
You underestimate the insane stubbornness of  vanilla hybrid players.
---
I know, I was one.
---
I get it, thank you!
---
The level 59 I would argue that you would fare better with the crit healing in holy  
---
sanctify aura only helps you, in dungeons you would be using other auras because you would want a support role, offhealing/dispelling and lastly dps, you gotta be a hybrid because your class is a hybrid, unless you choose the tanking spot:  
---
\- with this you can heal and tank dungeons at level 20:  
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVz)   
---
at level 49 you can heal, tank and pvp either world pvp or bgs with this (if you are going to be a only healer in pvp I would change imp SoR 5/5 to spiritual focus 5/5):  
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVquZVGzIc0x](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVquZVGzIc0x)   
---
at level 60 you can heal anything, included raids, even without the healing crit because you have sanctuary:  
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVEu0xoZVGzIczx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVEu0xoZVGzIczx)   
---
or you can tank trash and offheal/dispell with this, that is you are going to be a true hybrid, as the paladin is a great aoe tank, but you need approval from the guild and experience:  
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVEuZVGzIczEo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVEuZVGzIczEo)
---
It definitely was. People were changing raid groups to see the different bosses that were spawned in the starting zone.
---
Sleeping less than 7-8 hours is really bad for you, and is the biggest factor in predicting Alzheimer's disease. Just sleep man.
---
It’s crazy to think he is gonna kill the triplets just to play Classic. RIP kiddos
---
To zone in to a beautiful forest and hear that music again for the first time. 
---
To take the boat straight to Darkshore the way it used to be, and see the moon reflecting off of its dark shores. 
---
Starting as a NE is my first memory of this game. I was totally captivated.
---
August 27
---
John: "hey honey i am just going to play for a few hours with the fellas"
---
Mary: "ok honey"
---
3 Months later Mary files for divorce.
---
John says: "keep the kids"
---
All is well in the world again.
---
Just play pally so you can sleep while you play.
---
Tell them you are going to visit some old friends you haven't seen a while.
---
So you hit 20 and the world of players disappears?
---
Your analogy sucks because if you’re playing split screen there’s no way around it. It’s more like if you’re playing at a LAN and your screen is facing your opponent, and they are looking.. yeah that could be cheating. But at the same time, you could just turn your screen away. On split screen you don’t really have that option. Streaming is definitely an option. Streaming on a pve realm is also an option. Adding a delay is an option. People watching a stream aren’t cheating. Show me where blizzard says stream sniping is cheating, breaks ToS or is otherwise a bannable offense in world of Warcraft. It’s not cheating just because you say it is. 
---
Cheating is exploiting, modifying, or automating the game. Watching somebodies stream is just good intel.
---
LOL
---
That's cool, but can we have a mouse-over popup and also the location+boss where each item can be found? That would make it even more usefull than it is already :-)
---
No, it's good.
---
I wonder if it's possible to let them still see their layers they graduated from.
---
A still sees A all the way up, when they merge into with B, they can see all the B players that merged into that layer etc?
---
This is awesome! Thanks for taking the time and creating this.
---
In the words on the Ooga's
---
Go back to retail
---
Vanilla? Bro I was tanking, healing and out dpsing every one back in wrath as a shaman. Ever since then can't do shit tho lol
---
&gt; It's pretty much the same as retail LFG, minus the teleport to instance.
---
So it's not the same as retail LFG...?  Next you'll be telling me it doesn't do ilvl restrictions either.
---
It's basically a chat filter.
---
What problems would this address? Seems like segregating players based on level would cause more problems to me. Those people would all be interested in the same zones. what happens when a level 60 invites a level 1 to a party? Is he now able to clear out levels 1-20 faster with no low level competition?
---
&gt;  Some people remember Vanilla being harder because they played or at least leveled up in earlier patches that were harder.
---
There is zero evidence of any significant nerfs to the overall difficulty of the game over the course of vanilla, because there probably weren't any.
---
I'm already up 15lbs since the Classic announcement, have a prescription for Adderall being filled and I have a pack of laxatives that i'm going to take the week of release so i'm ready to go.  I figure if I gain 50+lbs overall by launch and empty myself out before launch, I won't have to eat or go to the bathroom for 5 days to maximize my time in the WF race to 60.
---
i personally love the leveling zones of night elves. not just because of the looks but also the layout of the quests. shadowmeld is an awesome racial especially on pvp servers. if you have to go afk or something you can just shadowmeld without having to log out and not worry about getting ganked for the most part. if you're a stealth class shadowmeld makes it even harder to detect you i believe.
---
True... mummies can become quite dangerous when you are alone in a pyramid... You should consider that
---
There’s an older post on this subreddit discussing how many people cleared Naxx 40 pre-TBC:
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8kcgtt/the_real_list_of_59_useu_guilds_that_cleared_naxx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
There is also (apparently) an old blue post by Blizzard stating that only 23 guilds cleared Naxx. I don’t have the link for that, and I’m dubious it’s correct, but it is referenced heavily whenever you look into this matter. 
---
Either way, even if we put it at 1000 guilds, that’s 40,000 - 80,000 people who actively raided. WoW subscription numbers were circa 8 million at the time of Naxx (you can google the graph for the numbers) so that’s 0.5 - 1.0 % that actually cleared the whole thing...
---
I say Lashers and Lost Ones.
---
Check out Raziya the Ravager on youtube. Most of his content is based on private server data, but the knowledge is still useful regarding class mechanics, macros, kiting, pulling, farming, etc.
---
Yeah but hybrid specs were actually competitive DPS-wise by then.
---
I was a Spriest in WotLK and they were fucking monsters.
---
No problem.
---
They were "hard" on gearcheck. 
---
Because our characters/items/classes were less powerfull in 1.1 than in 1.12
---
So basically going into MC optimized + full BiS in 1.1 versus in 1.12 + make you litteraly less powerfull versus the content. Taking more damage, we were often oom, lower dps etc... It's just numbers here.
---
As a rogue in pve, what else would you optimize beside damage? 
---
Best. In. Slot. Maces aren't as good as sword/dagger so they aren't on a best in slot list.
---
Actually its because the Forsaken are a specific faction of Undead that is made up almost entirely of Humans from Lordaeron and a few High Elves Quel'Thalas
---
I'm not saying there may not be more at play here, but blizzard said that some of these instances are because of a higher fov, making certain things appear farther apart than they are.
---
No, you'd always be able to see players from your source layer, and any players that have merged into your common "pyramid section" as you move up.
---
So anyone in A would see A.  After 20, you'd see B players over 20 as A, etc.
---
Just sleep on it I guess, I don't think I can make you understand why it's a bad idea if you haven't gotten it by now.
---
Transmog is a creative, cool and great feature. Just not for MMOs.
---
I'd far prefer garrisons or even continued class halls over the limp wet blanket that is the war boat thing in bfa
---
Jesus. Suddenly I feel a little better about the fact my guild only made it to Patchwerk.
---
Hey man I got into veterinary school when legion came out and no-lifed it. I was still able to maintain my grades. Even though I quit wow and plan on coming back for classic, I still get a good amount of game time in (I’m currently starting my 3rd year.) Trust me, you got in because you deserved it and you still have time to do the things you enjoy in life.
---
Are hunter pet mechanics still broken on the beta?
---
DUDE IS THAT A STREAMER????
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
The main philosophy of Vanilla WoW is that you are a nobody that grows up to be somebody without being the hero. You are a simple peon picking up your weapon and you become an adventurer.
---
The game is a bit of a puzzle and it feels so rewarding each time you solve a piece of it. Every quest doesn't tell you where to go, you stumble upon quests because you were curious about what was over the next hill.
---
Did one specific thing change the philosophy? No. Retail Wow is the result of a 1000 cuts.
---
I  chose shaman because I loved the ide of a Jack of all trades character and the journey to 60 was fantastic. At 60 I found out that I was not a Jack of all trades I was a healer. That was a bit of a shock. But in the end it was fine the main reason I like Jack of all trades is that there are more responsibility on them to perform in a raid if you want the raid to succeed. Rather than being just one of many dps. This still applies to healers. One thing to I love whit healing is that you are not slaves to the damage meter sure you can measure healing but different healers have different tasks that bye themself change the possibility to top meters. If your healing target survive the fight you have done a adequat jobb. Sadly for classic I will not play shaman it has been impossible to get my friends to roll hord this time sins they want to focus on pve rather then pvp. So this time it is a paladins life for me. Let's hope for bc right. And always in my heart FOR THE HORD!
---
Yes, turn your hate into a weapon. Hone the gnome annoyance as a sharp arrow. Point your laugh and dance at the enemy. You will begin to see the gnome as the perfect killing machine. As your enemies stupidly rage about your gnome, their emotional stability will overcome their rational mind giving you an edge in battle. And when you kill them as a gnome, cackle and dance on their body to firmly cement this emotional instability giving a long term advantage.
---
That's the true gnome racial. Inducing mental instability in your enemy. Gnome race = Master race.
---
above level 20 you should stop layering, because you have multiple choices (leveling) to make after that, mages can aoe grind, people can run dungeons for exp, etc...  
---
and lets not forget that after level 35 the resources become really expensive and we would not like to see a level 35 alt phasing through layers lol
---
It's actually the other way around, wotf was broken strong in vanilla, while being much less useful in arena pvp.
---
IDK ATM. PvE more likely.
---
If you have never seen this, it’s amazing: 
---
https://youtu.be/ZXsQAXx_ao0
---
Definitely mostly negative unless you plan to do a lot of melee, but it does make your War Stomp radius slightly larger than what the tooltip says.
---
And it can make it more difficult for inexperienced players to judge exactly where your deadzone is.
---
The increased hitbox will probably also make it easier to hit you with grenades, though I have yet to see this tested on beta. Judging from how many that will go engineering this time around this is a big (pun intended) downside.
---
Could it make melee-weaving easier? And allow you to evade certain boss-mechanics will doing it? Possibly, needs more testing. Still very niche.
---
Even if it's only client-side? Like everyone else still sees a gnome, but I see a troll.
---
Is healing fun in Vanilla?
---
I briefly looked at a couple of these addons the other day and as a tank I’ll be trying them out for sure. HIT ME UP
---
So it’s not like retail at all. It’s basically a UI QoL addon to assist in forming groups. You still have to do everything manually including invites and traveling to the instances themselves. Also it’s all done within your own server, as opposed to cross-server, so you still maintain that sense of community.
---
LOL. True.
---
It might work best as a zone layer condensation than a player level centric one.
---
Perhaps keep it level based but remain in the time frame they have. As phase 1 drags out the level brackets begin to merge together. 
---
By phase 2 it’s all one big family.
---
Long spears, then.
---
Sounds racist.
---
They are monsters in vanilla too, for about a minute, maybe two if you pop pots and runes on cooldown.
---
Rogues? Eviscerate is a flat damage bonus so it can crit-OHKO people even with shit tier weapons and you don't need armor when you keep people perma-disabled
---
In raids, kiting can be used as a last resort tank if all your warriors die on trash (it happens). Kiting isnt required buy is a good tactic for Razorgore, early trash in BWL, Drakonids in BWL, some early AQ40 trash, a fair bit of Naxx trash. Long pulls are sort of kiting, like Geddon, some short kiting on Domo if your guild does that and late AQ40 trash.
---
Don't be fucking ridicilous. Most classes got their talent trees reworked over the course of vanilla and some relatively small amount of items got changed, and that's about the extent of major balance changes in vanilla. That's not going to affect the overall difficulty of the game in a meaningful way, **especially** for levels 1-40. The early raids (up to and including BWL) will likely be comparatively easier, yes, but that's about it.
---
Dungeon difficulty was not substantially altered (they retuned some high-level dungeons like Stratholme when they limited them from 10-man to 5-man, but that's about it). Nobody in the beta has gotten to the stage of the game where 1.12 differences actually matter yet.
---
I'm horde but this still gives me goosebumps
---
I’ll be starting my second year of law school and I just know playing will be a terrible idea...but it calls to me
---
I...uh....don't even know what to say to that?
---
Good luck?
---
That requires every user to install the addon, otherwise those without the addon aren‘t in your search. Plus you still have to whisper them to get an invite, by far more you have to do than in retail lol, who would actually whisper someone there
---
Druids are very welcome to tank in 5 mans.  On pservers I felt like no one needed raid tanks because they had their decked out warriors.  5 man tanks were needed though as they were definitely the hardest slot to fill.
---
Druids are sub optimal in every role but they are really fun.  You can heal really well, flag carry in WSG, tank dungeons, stealth runs with rogues, speed boost at 20 as feral so they move around quickly while questing/leveling, etc.  They are one of the least played classes and every raid needs a couple for innervate, brez and curse removals so they get geared up pretty quickly.
---
How much crit, hit, and AP is worth varies depending on how much crit, hit, and AP you already have. If you have a ton of crit then naturally increasing your base damage will increase your output much more than if you have almost no crit. And so on. 
---
Using generic stat weights like that is pointless and misleading. 
---
Also, there's quite a lot of non-phase 1 gear in your list. Haven't looked through everything, but earthweave cloak, the primal batskin items, fury visor/diamond flask/razorsteel shoulder should all be added in later phases. Not sure about the warrior quest one, that might be in, but at least Cenarion Circle and Zandalar items are for sure later.
---
Horde typically consists of more gankers. It will depend on the server but typically Horde control zones most of the time, due to people rolling Horde for the PvP racials. Ally does hypothetically have the best premades due to Warrior/Pally combo though
---
I've only got 1, thanks to several data wipes on realmplayers before they merged with legacy. 
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20160614034153/http://realmplayers.com/RaidStats/RaidOverview.aspx?Raid=37923

Can't find myself indexed on wayback sadly. Just ask Taladril, he was around when I was.

Is the only raid i can find on wayback.

Not in my damn raids it's not!

Nighthaven????
---
Same, but will be my second year of law school...although the first couple months of the semester are usually pretty light so maybe I’ll just play a little bit...
---
All these comments and no one said the real and only reason to play a NE... and that’s to take off all armor and weapons and dance on top of a mailbox and earn some money the old fashion way...
---
LOK’TAR OGAR!
---
Difficulty didn’t really change much in wow until Wrath
---
Honestly? It seems like Blizzard wanted to make Cataclysm but failed so they accidentally made a "good" game.
---
So then just offer free xfers the way Blizz used to do for years. There was a time when there was always 3-4 servers offering free xfers.
---
Whatever they do to prevent the economy for being destroyed they need to keep it a secret.
---
Will there be 16 debuff slots from beginning?
---
I feel you!
---
Int is very very strong for leveling - it gives you so much more sustain and much less downtime - hence increasing your Leveling Speed.
---
Since Weapon Damage doesn't matter for druids they are literally all about the stats for damage. I`m not quite sure which stat give which amount of Attack Power but you should check that.
---
Attack Power is the only Thing that increases you damage in cat form - as well as attack Speed but that is hard to get ;)
---
I would defenitely go for some int if I was you - it's just nice to have - throw on some hots - moonfire - engage. Niceeeee
---
But you are not doing anything wrong. The main damage increase for druids Comes from increasing your spell Level when it's time :p That's why feral is not a meta dps spec - it just doesn't scale nice enough
---
Depends on the level, sub 20/30 you'll get on just fine.
---
Have you ever pugged a raid on retail? There are plenty of people who think no mechanics is hard, judging by their dps.
---
Slam resets your swing timer, Hamstring does not. On horde for both 2h and DW fury it's just better to spend rage on Hamstring to fish for Windfury procs.
---
The big benefit of the crappy alliance racials is that even the min max hearts can go wild with digital NE tits. I mean people always tell you about the cast and swing animations ... but alas we know what the teenage kids want to see animated :p
---
jokes aside. Pick what makes you happy when you play it. For a long term investment the worst thing you could do is pick a race who's esthetics you don't like. If you end up in a weak moment the part of you hating the looks or animations of your character can be the final tombstone
---
As for classes  
---
On Warriors and rogues: We already know that the crappy criminal private servers are wrong about their +15 expertise crap. Talents and basic items that humans will still wear are essential for both classes regardless of their race. All what humans have is a slight head start before they get those items. So it becomes trivial eventually. For PvP a permanent +1 characterlvl to your stealth or a shadowmeld to ensure you can get a charge off as a warrior can be game changers.
---
Even the +5 rifle boost for dwarfen hunters is irrelevant as soon as you get into MC and higher raids - and even before that the BiS crafted/dungeon options for 60 don't give a flip about whether or not you are a troll/dwarf. The old 'I have stoneform vs rogues' is trivial. Your pvp trinket removes slows and stuns and if you don't trap a rogue immediately afterwards its Freedom potion central anyway. The dwarf makes literally no difference there.
---
as for fear ward on priests. Sure it can carry bad warriors who are incapable of stance dancing. If your race pick is only based around compensating someone else's incompetence you are already playing their game and not your own. After all plenty of guilds who were 'big' back in the days had no fear ward and they were handling stuff just fine. The 'must be dwarf' is a typical p-server and bad player excuse. As in: Hey my guild's warriors suck so they ll always bring me because I can cope with that''
---
I will eagerly await this drama to unfold, with my popcorn ready nearby.
---
Then that defeats the entire purpose of layering at all?
---
LFD/LFR *might* not ruin the game if they were only for your server.  While there are a few upsides to LFD/LFR, there are numerous more downsides in my opinion, and they would definitely hurt the game experience as a whole. The moment they become cross-realm was probably the single most damaging change in WoW, imho.
---
&gt; if you had pure classic, with the one addition of group finder and LFR?
---
IMO it would yes.
---
I started during TBC and Wrath was my peak time in WoW. I was raiding at the time the revamped and cross-server LFG tool was introduced.
---
Socialization ended quite literally overnight.
---
The quite satisfying feeling of getting together a group, getting to the instance and working through it was replaced with a sterile encounter where the ONLY thing that mattered was the loot. Instead of one satisfying dungeon people now felt they had to run LFG random dungeons every evening for more chances at loot. Players now kicked each other or left group if one player was a few seconds behind. I was kicked once because I zoned in with my void-walker pet out and the group wouldn't wait for me to dismiss it.
---
Yes it’s worth it. I have a level 44 hunter on a private server which I stopped questing on, and whenever I log in all I do is world PvP while farming in Arathi Highlands. It’s incredibly fun.
---
I was in my 30's when Vanilla was released, played every chance I got and raided regularly on weekends.  Would have to give disciplinary actions to 20 year olds that were late, or falling asleep at work because they were up all night playing the game as well.  Imagine their surprise when we would close the door and I'd tell them I play as well, and we'd talk toons, raids, specs, and gear.  With that connection I was able to show them you could balance work and still be a raider on weekends.   It definitely helped put them back on the right path (for most).   Now I'm in a higher supervisor role and have way more free time, and I'll be spending it in game as much, or more, than I was in 04.
---
Layering should not be in any zone.
---
Hell yeah so for open world farming I'll go horde... might start there then go PvE server after phase 2.
---
They are great hunters and decent warriors aswell
---
They were hard. You have to remember that you were playing them back in 2004-2006 on your shitty Intel pentium 2 with 10 fps and dial-up connection. It took over a second just to react to things happening on your screen.
---
The rationale for using 1.12 was that it was the only backup they could salvage
---
I don’t know who made this but my friend send it to me
---
I’m going to disagree with you - I have had overcrowding in mmo launches and at low levels  you really have no where else to go without making a long trek to another starting zone 
---
It’s frustrating
---
Very interesting video.
---
I guess all the talk about Pservers being off was indeed very true, but everybody claiming it was easier were half wrong. I mean, even I noticed how much easier 1-10 was on Classic than the 4 Pservers I've played on in the past. Like you mentioned in the video, the bag drops were less common in Classic but everythin else 1-10 was much easier.
---
If it takes me 5 hours to get to level 5 because of overpopulation, I'm going to log off. No amount of fun social interaction will change that.
---
I appreciate the layering. There will be more than enough people to interact with even with the layering.
---
I have seen no indication that classic will go beyond 1.12. If it’s popular though, almost anything could happen. 
---
Can you elaborate on 3 and 4 in the list? Would the alternate timeline cover levels before 60? How would new abilities be introduced? What do you mean by “expansion spanshots”?
---
Wendy is coming for his ass.
---
Thanks for the replies. I mentioned my ignorance about the logistics of the idea, but I couldn't help putting it out there anyway. I've just always wished I could go back in time to replay certain parts of the game or do things I missed but will never have the chance to do again. Like, WoD is regarded as the worst xpac but my best experiences in raiding were Highmaul and BRF as boomy. Everyone has a few favorite moments in the game and in an ideal world, we could all choose which version to play. Unfortunately, like many said, it's totally unlikely. Still fun to make the scenario though. Thanks again for reading anyway.
---
Think there's been enough posts about layering. It's the lesser of two (three actually) evils. Bugs are obviously happening on beta currently. It'll get fixed. Deal with it.
---
I think it depends on the addon. One I looked at seemed to be how you describe it. Another I saw just scanned chat for certain keywords to assist in identifying who is looking for groups.
---
Hopping layers to get 10 Arena master trinkets in an hour or two.
---
Demounting off flight paths due to layering.
---
Getting killed by a group of mobs that suddenly appear in what you thought was a cleared area.
---
Hopping layers to kill Rare Spawns multiple times.
---
Clearing an area of mobs or gathering resources and then hopping layers to a full area (rinse repeat). 
---
That's just scratching the surface of issues that have been popping up. There's literally hundreds of videos detailing exploits and showing how they're breaking the experience.
---
Nope, rolling pve this time
---
I would be ecstatic if I only spent an hour collecting troll ears
---
I am a school teacher. I could, to some degree, no life Classic... If it weren't coming out 2 weeks AFTER classes start back. Like, why Blizz! Why do you have to hurt me?
---
Big if true.
---
GM/HWL is roughly on par with T2. I bet the blue set is still better than some T1 sets due to the PvP-focused stat distribution. Though if you're not rocking high ranked gear when people start clearing BWL you'll start getting instagibbed.
---
&gt; I don't see why the queue would be longer or shorter due to layering. Also, queue limit is completely up to Blizz I would assume. If you don't want long queues, let people into the game.
---
I'm not sure how you come to this conclusion?
---
There is a limit to how many concurrent players both a whole server, and individual zones, can hold. Without causing massive lag, crashes, etc.
---
As well as the game itself not being designed to handle a ludicrous amount of players. If you allowed something like 8000 concurrent players to alleviate queues, you'd create completely unplayable conditions for the first ~10 levels of the game at launch.
---
Layering allows an individual server to be scaled into multiple 'channels' of itself, also on different literal hardware, so you can allow 20,000 concurrent people on a 'single server' without ruining everyone's experience, or crashing it.
---
&gt; Could you please explain how layering changes this? I guess the implication is that it makes populated servers more manageable thus more attractive? Wouldn't that have the opposite effect long term, since long term people look for higher pop servers?
---
Layering means there will be less servers (by name), and allows for dynamic choice in the absolute limit of concurrent players and total registered characters.
---
So statistically the population should be more evenly spread.
---
And, exactly, long-term people look to more populated servers. So, without layering of some description, once a single server is "low" pop, it will be in a death spiral.
---
Layering, of some description, means none of the servers should even reach "medium" for a long time.
---
&gt; This isn't based on facts. Also, if the starting zones are "unfun", which let me remind you is your opinion
---
No one can reasonably think any more than a small minority of people would find competing with an enormous mob of other people for quests/kills, having lots of lag, possible crashes, and wasting massive amount of time not being able to progress, "fun".
---
&gt;  it might encourage players to roll other classes, diversifying the game.
---
Making people feel they have to forgo their first-choice race/class combo, otherwise they can't actually play the game, is clearly a poor design choice.
---
&gt; Also, it might end up being a ton of fun, encouraging players to group up to get quests, generally fucking around and having fun other than immediately grinding.
---
Vanilla/Classic is not compatible with group questing in a lot of instances, from an efficiency point of view. e.g. you don't all get mob-drops when 1 person does.
---
The majority of people definitely will not find it fun to be in enormously overpopulated starter zones, I guarantee you.
---
&gt; As for the servers crashing? Well that would be something Blizzard should address independently.
---
This isn't just about flicking some switch somewhere.
---
The game has fundamental limitations of how many people it can handle in a singular software/hardware instance.
---
They would have to make major code/engine changes to attempt to deal with this without some form of layering, or massive queues.
---
And they obviously don't have the time for that.
---
&gt;Layering doesn't change this.
---
Layering absolutely does change this, because it causes the total player base to be compressed into less named servers.
---
So there's less of an effect of "first through the door", and servers getting "full"
---
For maximum effect you could randomise the order of the server names every time you look at it, and not list any "low" "medium" "full" on them at launch.
---
It should result in the demographics of each server being more balanced/average.
---
&gt; The chance of losing your name and identity in the community in the result of dead servers (dead servers being guaranteed to happen) which require merges or transfers
---
&gt; Layering doesn't change this.
---
Yes it very much does, because it's a short-lived thing to combat launch surge, and all the layers are automatically merged.
---
There's no server-merges, and no transfers needed. And everyone within a named server has unique names, so you can't lose your name.
---
Fair enough, and considering WoW has ample black powder and all sorts of intellectual progress I guess it could be argued they're in the reneissance period anyway.
---
That's not how layering works, this would not work at all. You're saying a level 50 from server B would be able to see a level 5 from server A? But the level 5 wouldn't see the level 50? 
---
Layers are either merged or not, you can't merge them for some players and not others. It doesn't make any sense.
---
Classic raids aren't hard
---
If you eat an appleseed by mistake, smoke a cigarette to suffocate the bacteria
---
Would go horde if I were you. My 5 man is going to be rolling deep.
---
That's your opinion.  Most people have fun with high populations.  They do other stuff, not just sit around waiting for a spawn.
---
That's fine because it's involving other players. There's no point in my eyes to have a player house where you can invite one or two friends to come and look at cosmetic crap on the walls etc.
---
It's the garrison problem all over again.
---
yea my fucking bad bro. I can totally see where this is a PVE specific post and a PVE Specific website. So sorry. 
---
I played a shaman at a fairly high level in Everquest. Backup healer, debuffer/buffer, able to solo content, kind of a jack of all trades back then. Not many classes could solo the lesser named dragons in Western Wastes reliably, but with your Epic done, you certainly could on a Shaman. It was always fun seeing what I could solo there...
---
Enter WoW - with a shaman class I wanted to potentially repeat, and I liked the flavor of it from Warcraft 3. I wanted to be continue to be able to heal and be useful from that regard, as I've always veered towards being a support player anyway. 
---
I think leveling as a shaman was great - tons of flexibility to fill 2 roles well in a group, I did my share of healing as I leveled, as well as a bit of DPSing. I also tanked some of the lower end dungeons, as needed while it was viable. At 60, I primarily healed, dungeons were one of my favorite things to do before I really got into raiding. I was on the more leading edge of players to hit 60, so running dungeons with friends/guildies to grab attunements/do quests/gear up was one of my favorite things. LBRS and BRD remain two of my favorite dungeons to this day, and I can still lead you through LBRS blindfolded if needed.
---
BRD became my soloing playground - as I geared up in raids, I tried to see what I could solo. I solo'd my own MC attunement, and would regularly solo Lord Incendius while trying to find the perfect Fire Resist bracers and farm large brilliant shards. As raids progressed we got braver with our solo/undergrouped attempts. In full AQ40 loadout, with a tank friend (who had thunderfury) we 2manned UBRS - not because we needed anything, but because we wanted to. It took forever, but it was fun!
---
The majority of my time at 60 was spent either healing guildmates in raids/dungeons, PvPing with a solid pre-made when I had time, or generally screwing around and exploring the world. I was an enchanter/leatherworker, so I didn't have professions I could farm, but as a proficient healer with top end gear, my groups rarely wiped and running dungeons became a decent source of income/resources.
---
I ground out rep as well - the AQ release, with the accompanying twilight cultist explosion in Silithus, lead to one of favorite rep grinds. I got back to soloing, see which of the summons I could reliably solo and farm, while earning rep to become a top leatherworker on my server with NR recipes.
---
I also lead ZG/AQ20 pugs with a tank from my guild. We would generally do these once a week, even though the reset was more frequent than that, but we had a well established PUG with our own loot system, that was extremely successful and tons of fun. Eventually we transferred this loot system and PUG to MC, and even BWL, as a way for our guild to gear up alts, and for well intentioned pugs to get some gear on their own. These PUGs killed Hakkar, Ossirian and Ragnaros weekly, and we managed to take down Nefarian a handful of times as well (though getting passed Chromaggus with a pug seemed to be the biggest hurdle). 
---
I built a name for myself, in the community, so much so that when BC came out, and I had to take a few months off for work. When I came back to find my guild disbanded and scattered across many different realms, my reputation from classic earned me multiple guild invites from top level guilds relatively quickly.
---
[̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅] bout to pull up on em wit dat Rank 10 boi
---
It does. Spell batching feels worse with very low ping. Unfortunate for anybody with amazing ping.
---
Depends on *how* raid geared. Your pre-bis shadow priest still isn't going to save you from getting near globaled by a T2-2.5 geared warrior.
---
That's funny, because Night Elves are the only race which has racial bonuses that benefit ALL of their class choices.
---
Shadowmeld: stacks with Rogue/Druid stealth, allows Hunters to play PvP Pokemon, others can just use it to stealthily eat/drink.
---
Dodge: great(ly underrated) bonus for all classes, maybe except the Priest but even they get attacked sometimes - and a dodged attack doesn't push back your cast bar.
---
Nature resistance: it's a resistance, situationally useful. Of note is that all poisons are Nature damage.
---
Wisp Spirit: everybody dies.
---
I'm 34 and this is how I operate in general. Girlfriend goes to bed at 10, I can game til about 1, alarm goes off at about 8, in work by 9. It does mean that on one of the weekend nights I crash out early and get more like 10-11 hours of sleep, but it just seems to work for me.
---
If you pvp in full naxx gear transmogged as garbage gear it's misleading to attackers. When I'm on the battlefield and I see a dungeon set person on the left and a full naxx gear on the right, it's imperative to kill the person that would give a better chance to kill the other when the rest of my team shows up. Transmog ruins this aspect of visual identification of gear since you can't inspect the other faction.
---
We are seeing it.....right now....are you telling me you haven't seen all the threads, videos and examples of why layering is ruining the Classic experience?
---
Come on, no one is that naive.
---
I couldn’t imagine going 1-60 without any PvP on the way :/ sounds mind-numbing
---
I'm a druid speed runner myself. This was my most recent on the PvE beta server:

---
While your time is good 1-10, your route is going to cost you A LOT of time while doing bear form. You don't get Camp T flight path prior (costing you an extra 6-8 of running) and you use your hearth so you cant heath back from Moonglade (like an 8 minute flight). Something to think about.
---
holy shit, stop
---
A lot of people also claimed everything on pservers was easier than vanilla, and that's not the case either. In fact many things are much harder on pservers.
---
Damn that's a hot take. What makes you say thats what they were aiming for?
---
&gt;there isn't any non-snowy mountain area in kalimdor in vanilla so that'd be nice
---
Stonetalon Mountains &lt;3
---
I mean sure, it was a little Fallout 76ish or Anthem-y in the start there, but unlike those NMS actually did turn around and become a fantastic game that still expands.  I had a wonderful time with it and it was very worth it to me.  That said, I didn't pre-order any of those titles.
---
Not at all, they have their own problems. Mainly that none of the people I want to play with are on there. Good joke though!
---
I would like to see, if enough people are interested, servers dedicated to expansions. No character copies or transfers from Vanilla to BC, just fresh starts to experience the leveling again, meeting people and also start zones that have been altered for each xpansion. I am sure people disliked vanilla and preferred BC or WotLK. And much of the gear is replaced quickly for 90% of people moving to another expansion right? So just start fresh if you prefer that xpansion and refind gear. Thoughts?
---
Shaman will be faster, Earth Shock will really help.  Warrior might be able to compete if you can get the 2h from the Fizsprocket quest at level 6(obviously with help since the mobs are level 9-10) - it will improve your kill speed significantly.
---
The stat weights that I have will be deleted. I realized after putting in the information that it would be way more effort than it's worth.
---
I was afraid that quite a few items were included in later phases. I originally had Dire Maul drops in there too, but caught that mistake before sharing. The Primal batskin items should have been obvious, but I must not have been paying attention well enough. Thank you!
---
There are ways around it w split screen. As I said you can just buy another screen. Just like a streamer can just "choose" to quit their job streaming. Every "option" you claim streamers have is just going to cost them tons of money. You're essentially arguing that it's fine that streamers get harassed because they can just pay money to not get harassed.
---
You're getting an unfair advantage from outside the game. Just because blizzard doesnt care doesnt mean it isnt cheating.
---
But you guys can't be everywhere 👹
---
underrated comment.  
---
90% of the pug groups for raids and m5mans on Retail are all about compensating how piss poor the players are with entry requirements of gear that's above the average ilvl of what the location drops and mythic clear achievements as a 'you know what you are supposed to do ... hopefully'  
---
Just take a look at preach's experiment for pugging at the end of legion incognito with a new toon.
---
The essence of it is: People are bad at the game or just plain stupid.
---
Classic's simple mechanics are not going to change that
---
I can't speak for the original difficulty however the main reason why Classic is going to be easier is because the people who will  play the game is at a much higher skill.
---
Just going to throw out there how Wow went down the route of fun filled action packed but unrealistic zones, while it originally had zones with believable locations of towns, farms etc. Not a huge issue but it goes a long way to making the world as a whole feel more 'real when you have a fishing village with farms outside of it and loads of empty countryside instead of mini quest hubs every 30 feet and towns in ridiculous locations etc.

Video on the subject: the Shandification of Fallout. Applies directly to the Fallout series and it's locations and worldbuilding, but can be applied to any game including Wow

Forsaken were made from the plague the Cult of the Damned introduced in WC3 (you see it in the purge of strathholme caverns of time) That plague was specifically engineered to affect humans. Other races being raised are done through different means and are thus a lot fewer in number compared to the huge amount of humans that were raised via plague.  
---
That was my understanding of it, anyway.
---
One of the Classic developers is left handed and puts his mouse on the left side of his keyboard and rests his right hand on JKL;.
---
Its mostly about things being advantageous by changing the models. I could change everyone on the opposing faction to be a lot bigger so they're easier to target in PvP. Make all nodes bigger so that I can see them easier. All that kind of thing
---
Its not pretentious at all. Its just fact. The tourists will be upset for sure.
---
I LOL when I hear “auto-attack Andy”.  White damage is a major portion of all melee and hunter dps.
---
If you want the authentic leveling experience go to STV.
---
If you want to hit 60 at a decent rate, skip STV all together.
---
Phase 2 baby!
---
Hell yes, this is fucking great and because I'll play mostly at night/morning, this won't affect me as 15y ago... and in october I will be able to play normally again in the evening and then ganking in peace in STV/EPL.
---
Or they use layering and there won't be any dead servers
---
&gt; Layering is unnecessary because the problems it creates are worse than the problems it is trying to "fix"  
---
i disagree.  
---
On launch of OG WoW in 2004. There was 6-8 hour queue's just to get to character creation. If you took too long making a toon. you timed out back of the line in the 6-8 hour queue. There was the looting bug that made your character get stuck on 1 knee. The only fix? log out back into the 6-8 hour queue.  
---
If think waiting 6 hours jsut to log in is acceptable? Then I dont know what to say to you. I will take layering/sharding all day if that means I can play the game. But you think people "abusing" laying for whatever reason is worse than watching a queue number on your desktop for 5 hours? You got a fucked up opinion. I mean, people want to talk about leveling curve? How fucked are the people staring at the desktop making no experience or levels at all, because they simply can't log in? How pissed would you be if you were actually playing the game, you're on last boss of UBRS with your group. you got disconnected because lag. You go to log back in..and you have to wait 5 hours to do so? The only reason you have this opinion is because you have not lived through the experience.
---
I think they love making "shows" as they call them. The reversing cinematics they showed at the announcement seemed fitting enough, but I'd love to see a fresh take showing different race and class combos in other situations. Dwarven warrior vs. troll shamans or something. Show off their art skills.
---
And fetch quests. Last stress test I got to 10 with only like 22 kills.
---
This test, I hope to get to 12 with about 30, still working on the routing.
---
oh people are going to blast through MC without a doubt. But pug groups will still screw things up.  Especially since pugs won't show up with BiS setups neither in gear nor specs
---
As someone who _doesn't_ want to wait in queues during the first few weeks to months or end up on a dead server and have to pay to transfer, layering sounds great to me, provided they keep to their promise and kill it off at or before Phase 2. Everyone is griping about no life farmers potentially abusing it, but failing to acknowledge that while we normal folk have to log out and then back in and face queues, these people don't. They get a huge advantage from no layering because they can get in and stay in while a portion of the server's population which would compete with them is locked out because of tourists crowding the capacity.
---
My suggestions for resolving the complaints with Layering, if possible and based on my understanding of the process are below. I'd rather we try to see if we can minimize all complaints instead of just whining.
---
Blizzard could also make or treat deliberately abusing layers as an offense and communicate this to the playerbase. Anyone hopping layers more than X times in a given window or at X frequency could be flagged for GM review, warned about doing so intentionally, then given escalating suspensions to offset any potential advantage.
---
Honestly, this sounds more time consuming than just your standard poop routine.
---
I know right!?
---
Tried a PvE server once and just couldn't handle it. Especially when I'm watching someone from the opposing faction farming MY mobs and MY resources and being able to do a damn thing.
---
Fuck dude, your are in for the ultimate test of patience, self control and operating while sleep deprived. I have 4 kids but all a year or two apart and thats tough. You, are screwed.
---
It's a *pre-raid* bis-list.
---
Vanilla wasn't difficult - it was and is only time consuming.
---
I don't see anything on Curse that's an LFG addon for Classic. I think this is a troll post. Either way if such an addon existed, Blizzard would break it so it can't work.
---
You realise you can toggle it on whenever you want on a PvE server right?
---
it's also a blessing because 1.12 was the most polished version of WoW. they actually source code going back a little before 1.12 but they settled on 1.12. the only bad thing about this is they lost the old AV for good
---
Couple weeks to fully gear 1 casual person in a 40 man raid? Lul
---
I think that's too subjective a measure, it depends on what you find fun.  I healed as a druid in vanilla and I had fun,  but there was more to the experience than just the actual function of healing.
---
Nothing is fun in anything.
---
The "difficulty" that people remember is a big of a fallacy regardless of what patch the game runs on.  Boss mechanics were extremely simplistic tank n spank.  But part of the reason why people remembered the game being so hard was because a) people weren't gear enough to be doing the content they were trying to do.  That led to a lot of wipes. b) a lot of people didn't know what the hell they were doing.  So many people I played with back then refused to cc.  Warlocks didn't want to take their sucubuss out because they didn't like using it.  Rogues weren't specced for improves sap.  Hunters didn't want to waste the first 5 seconds of a pull trapping something.  Beyond all of this, a lot of people didn't know their rotations.  A lot of tanks were also just bad because they didn't know how to keep agro on more than 1 target.  Tanking was hard back then, not every warrior could do it and there were a SHIT TON of warriors.  And c) despite a lack of skill and knowledge for the game, everyone wanted in on the "harder" stuff because everyone wanted gear.  Raiding guilds weren't just full of hardcore raiders that understood what they were doing.  They were full of casuals that just wanted to get into doing the cooler things the game had to offer.  This again led to main wipes, countless groups disbanding, and countless guilds disbanding.  And all of this led to the illusion that vanilla was so much harder.
---
Going back to this time: regardless of what patch the game is running on... we aren't noobs anymore.  We know how to play, we know how to spec, we know what our roles are, we know how to progress, and we know what it takes to finish dungeons and raids.  The general fact that most people will know what they are doing this time around will increase progression speeds of guilds and make most of the game seem trivial at best.
---
Hi! 
---
It will still be very effective. I played it myself for a considerable period of time back in the day, after the DR were introduced. The DR rules were primarily introduced to stop chain CC-ing using the same type of tool. Luckily for rogues, we have such a wide variety of CC tools, that DR doesn't effect us too much. (see here for full DR description - [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Diminishing\_returns](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Diminishing_returns))
---
Let me give you a combo example you can pull off with a hemo build
---
Cheap shot - hemo - gouge - kidney shot - hemo - hemo - blind - restealth - Cheap shot - hemo - gouge - evis (or another KS). During this entire rotation the target will not be able to move their character, and you will not experience DR.
---
Cheap lasts 4 seconds, gouge lasts 5.5 seconds, kidney shot lasts 6 seconds, blind lasts 10 seconds - by the time you come to the second cheap shot, the 15 second window for DR to reset has occured.
---
Wrong - layering prevents 10 hour queues. That's the only thing blizzard cares about - so the general public won't shit on them anymore than they already do.
---
Yeah I can't wait to watch this game slowly and utterly destroy my life again.
---
Got tired of getting insta gibbed by WF, if you can't beat them, join them!
---
Honestly chosen, because of Lord of the Clans &amp; WC3. I liked the theme of the class mixed with the Orc race, every other reason came after playing it for so long. 
---
Why play it? Ruining the days of Rogues &amp; Mages were some of my favourite things to do at all levels. At 60 mainly PvP (man I loved old AV, not the version we are getting in classic /sadface) on my Shaman, tanking of dungeons &amp; exploration. Basically Shaman was my fun time class in the end, sneak into Stormwind and fish with the lowbies, take the tram to Ironforge and annoy the lvl60s etc.
---
I raided more on my Warrior post MC/BWL because I didn't want to heal, which is the sad thing about Shaman. Then TBC was the start to ruining Shaman (for me) and then every further expansion made me dislike the class more and more so I spent more time on Warrior and my poor Shaman was leveled each expansion just to bring up to max level.
---
It would, yes.
---
I don't think you should hit level 20, then go back to the very beginning zone and find it empty (chances are by the time you're 20, everyone in your cadre will have left the very beginning bit).
---
I can't play different class, I need to find out whether this one will be able to solo farm what I want.  
---
No problems with finding a method, even with farming specific drop for future. But at the moment I can't get enough from mobs, and I can't buy enough from vendors, and in the middle of a fight "oh another minute without checking pet's status...oh sh\*\*, he's hungry again". No feel of real life in it, converting the real life hours into  ingame speed of events I'd say feeding a tiger every 15min is ok. Carrying a ton of fish, and feeding after every other mob kill - not ok.
---
&gt;Would 15k people all crammed into the same server for the first week slow down leveling
---
no. because 15k thousand aren't going to be able to log in without layering/sharding. Only way this will work. if 10k of those people are willing to wait in 5-8 hour queues to log in. You get zero experience staring at your desktop awaiting your turn. The people bitching about laying/sharding really show their age. They obviously haven't lived through the 2004 launch waiting at your desktop just to get to character creation.
---
I'm excited to actually get full tier 3.
---
Judgement is literally an instant attack.  Paladins do not get a “STRIKE”.  Which I think is a major oversight.  Even mobs in Scarlet Monastery have Crusader Strike (Gallants and Champions).
---
I feel many how spend their time loitering in this sub would be more receptive of a divergent path of content that steered away from simply following the path of progression layed out by simply following expansions.
---
Keep players firmly grounded at level 60 and just keep including new zones and dungeons and every so often a new raid of either 20 man or 40 man where they feel appropriate.
---
You will definitely have a week of release in more than one way!
---
While not super useful you might want to add crit at a value of 0.5 or something mindblast crits are a thing and I honestly believe your value of stamina is to low
---
Hi, /u/The_Lurker_

Hell ya! A couple of buddies and I are doing exactly this. No caffeine or anything for at least a month either, so a cup of coffee will seem like rocket fuel.
---
mineral oil cooling or bust
---
Yeah, I am definitely thinking Tauren Warrior will have more working for it than an orc warrior.  It will be that distance plus another 2 yards.  That's a hefty range for not only attacks, but a 2 second stun.
---
Lol I had those gloves for so long before replacing them
---
Hey I tried to point this out to you before, you cannot get to the UBRS or LBRS via the site, and the pages are not being updated with new rollouts (which I just noticed). The only way to get to this is to look up BRS on google to get you to this page.
---
They are NOT listed under Zone-&gt;Raids or Zone-&gt;Dungeons, or any of the others. 
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?zone=1583](https://classicdb.ch/?zone=1583)
---
It only affects despwan timer of looted/unlooted corpses.
---
The respawn timer is related to the kill time only.
---
No one here understands your coward-runes. Type English.
---
Orc stun resist is quite good and the rogue specific PvP trinket removes the same things that WotF does. So really you're choosing between 35% stun resist or a second fear removal. With the secret being out about how useful Engineering is stun resist will be huge.
---
If it's on the same [battle.net](https://battle.net) account they do.
---
screech is best for solo. AOE melee debuff on mobs.
---
Cut out sugar too (energy drinks!). You'll just crash extra hard.
---
This is why my mage will be female
---
This cadre idea is a good addition to the suggestion I'm working on, based on discussion in the other couple of threads.
---
And, from what they've said, they're already assigning you some sort of metadata 'original' layer when you first make your character. So the infrastructure is already there.
---
I REALLY think people underestimate the impact of them getting better at a game.
---
When you are new and don’t know shit, it makes it seem so much harder. Once you’ve put in hours and hours of playtime, you learn enough to make the older stuff that *seemed* hard not as difficult.
---
It's perfect, otherwise school would be filled with pale kids with vitamin d deficiency, this way, there's atleast a chance for them to see the sun in summertime!
---
I am not even taking the day off for launch. It's fine. I am not going to be the first to hit 60, or raid, or achieve a high pvp rank but I also won't be the last. One good saturday or sunday grind or one random personal day I take off work will make up for the frustration of launch day.
---
Yeah, it might be best used as a zone layering approach?
---
If you assign players round robin, people would still be added to the lower level section of a "cadre" of people like group A.
---
Read some of the linked guides and they talk about what professions are good for Pallies - often Blacksmithing is not mentioned. So you'll get an idea of what you should go with. You can also look up a Blacksmithing guide specifically, or just a recipe list, to see what they make and decide for yourself if it's worth it.
---
Yeah, but that’s nothing close to factions controlling zones and grouping up to dominate the area, constant fear of someone killing you during a pull, etc. turning on a flag and looking around everywhere in the entire game for another person who randomly flagged too is not what wpvp is about lol
---
Say what you want about Cata, but it filled in some of the map and it might be cool to get a past version of those zones involving Vanilla era occupants. Specifically level 60 Pre-Cataclysm Uldum, Hyjal, and Twilight Highlands would be really cool.
---
Key word: lucky drops
---
If you run with a guild that is farming MC and many of them have their gear already, you can get geared really damn fast.
---
I do realize that, but what's the point?
---
How does that help me get rid of another player that's farming the area I want to farm? I can't make them turn on PvP.
---
Considering it is currently scheduled to release the same week that classes start back, I would much rather it drop randomly before then.
---
Could You include the items You ignore but add a way to show those aswell? For us, crazy minded grinder?
---
I mean I'd agree with that if that's what was said, but what was actually said was you can't imagine going 1-60 without PvP.
---
I was never crazy about Night Elves, but since my main is a Druid I don’t have a choice. I’m also not the type of dude to roll female toons but you bette believe my Druid is gonna be a sexy elf!
---
Yeah. Half the time the servers end up being a clusterfuck and that day is wasted, regardless.
---
I think it uses the actual UI Scale setting under Video settings for wow, and then to move PF UI it should say something like "unlock"
---
It is necessary, end of story.
---
Cool!
---
Yeah, just throwing ideas at the wall while I was bored in a conference call.
---
I feel like, if they round robin assign people to cadres, there will always be an influx of new characters in the lower sections as people level up, then maybe compress them into zone layers together as they level?
---
Misspelled ‘DPS’ it should be ‘heal’ /s
---
So nice when you're so positive about the future of Classic, what a turnaround! Proud of you.
---
I try to change all my PTO immediately from August. If they don’t approve, i quit.
---
AV is actually my least favorite BG. I never queued for it back in Vanilla. AB is the way to go.
---
Well'p. Shut up and give me back my money. All-weekend-long AV was the only reason I was ever super-psyched for Classic.
---
It would be a nightmare for the developer to manage multiple support teams.
---
As long as you're fast enough leveling, I feel like you can avoid getting ganked too much.  Most players will be focused on getting 60, I doubt there will be a ton of people interested in PvP for the first week or two.
---
Wouldn't mat because it wouldn't hap.
---
Devs don’t manage support teams.
---
those are for the live client, which has upgraded models and graphics. classic is using a hybrid of the two. they have original spell models and original models, some upgraded bfa textures and things like dynamic foliage. I would still recommend you have at least a newer generation i5 or equivalent, at least 8gb of ram, and at least a 9 series GPU though to get an optimal experience especially in raids.
---
Fight the rams/harpies/kobolds/wolfs/etc for PVE.
---
Why wouldn't it
---
It doesn't. What was said was "without PvP" not "without being able to kill another player who is farming the area I want to farm"
---
You underestimate it. Nevertheless, defending layering as it is right now is very stupid. Its ruining the game in more aspects than just giving it advantage to first 60s. Hopefully, they will come up with a solution and change it before release.
---
Screech is only best when you are fighting 2+mobs at a time. The aggro is amazing and then the damage mitigation is great. You don’t even need to auto-cast growl if that’s the case.
---
If you’re fighting one mob at a time cats are better
---
&gt; The modifier for distance checks when moving was changed when "dead zones" were removed in patch 2.3 starting with Hunters. It's actually a post-Vanilla change.
---
Where's the proofs? I've seen plenty of people, including one autist who's been neck-deep in researching melee leeway and deadzone mechanics for private servers since like 2014, say that this is working exactly as intended.
---
And considering it's an anti-lag measure, vanilla is where it would've been needed the most in the first place, so I *really* doubt they added it later (some people are claiming it was added in fucking MoP, lmao).
---
Healing in vanilla / classic is different, biggest two aspects being classed didn’t share much functionality so your class is not just a slightly different version of another - priest healing is very different to shaman healing for example.  
---
The other difference is spell rank - you have to pick the version if the spell to use to stay mana efficient.   
---
If you like healing you should like it regardless of expansion.
---
hope this get banned, it's still only beta.
---
Just make cluster servers like Hogger 1 Hogger 2 etc and prevent people from sharing names and guild names on that server cluster. Everybody will accept that if needed the two servers will be made into a single one in case player activity drops on the server. The whole layering thing is kinda getting me worried aswell.
---
Just have to have a swing timer add-on to time it right!
---
Haha that’s actually true, but doesn’t change the fact that Ret Paladins literally just sit there auto attacking and hit a button maybe once every 10 seconds
---
Or just stop wasting your time and skip the hiding part because you're a BM hunter and auto-win leveling PvP encounters anyway.
---
I  will check this and add to the zones tab :)
---
I will be disappointed if there aren't a bunch of male nelf hunters named Legolas.
---
In the past, Blizzard has prided themselves on keeping all their cinematics in house from what I understand. I imagine if they plan to redo their own cutscenes, they'd want it to be "blizzard" cutscenes.   
---
That said, they have outsourced other things like 3D models before, so depending on how strapped for time they are it's possible. I just think its unlikely they'd want anyone else touching them
---
idk about that man, i'm pretty absentminded/while i wouldn't do it in a theater, i won't lie and say that when i'm watching a movie at home i don't briefly check twitter or look away to doodle something. somehow classic is able to make me focus in a way that most things don't
---
they're not gonna do that so it's not even worth thinking about.
---
Are you even serious?
---
Alliance has Paladins, Horde has better racials. There's also usually going to be more Horde, so if you want more fights (Alliance) or you want less fights (Horde) that's also a consideration to make. 
---
My thoughts, it has been a while.
---
Layering probably won't make much of a difference in overcrowding, though. I believe that each layer is intended to have 2-3k pop, so unless you are something like the 3,001st person to log in and have a layer all to yourself, you are going to be competing with a server-sized population for resources on launch.
---
Dodge is the worst stat a warrior can get and 1% is almost nothing. The 10% armor active from dwarfs stoneform alone gives more mitigation
---
Thanks, this is what I was looking for!
---
1. World of Warcraft became World of Last Expansion Craft
---
2. Challenge became non-existent outside the very last tier of the game. Meaning it's impossible to have challenge if you don't play much.
---
3. Trying to please everyone, which made the game feel more empty than ever. The world became irrelevant. 
---
4. The inability to make your grind to the top significantly faster by having more knowledge of the game. Everything became time gated and the lottery killed your ability to be more efficient at doing a specific dungeon. 
---
One thing I don't miss, the grind become too much as soon as you want to experience different par of the game, unless you're playing 12hr/day. I'm talking about going for alt or doing pve/pvp. Maybe that's a necessary evil but I think a middle ground could be found.
---
Only because arcaneshot is useless doesnt mean aimedshot is better deep BM xd
---
My plan is I took 7 days off at launch, +3 days since that is a holiday weekend. I should be able to hit 60 in that time. Then when I am back at work I can relax and take the 60+ content slowly. I gave my GF the heads up too. Also helps that I am in IT so when if I need to work after hours while at home I can do that while playing.
---
It's definitely the most genuine sounding laugh in the game.
---
Nostalrius literally had to implement sharding to support the playercounts they had. And by "sharding" I mean the actual meaning of sharding which is that every zone runs in its own instance (so looking beyond zone borders you wouldn't see what's in the next zone over).
---
don't worry so much about racials, only the 1% cares becouse in the actual raid you can't really notice does things
---
i played night elf as a tank for almost 10 years and no one ever cuestioned my capability even in the hardest content
---
You know how that ends up right? With none of you farming it.
---
&gt; Im a horde player but I Cringe everytime I see this garbage. Chill out and Stop making the faction look bad 
---
found a pizza cutter. All edge and no fucking point.
---
Thanks, it used to be there iirc, idk what happened lol!
---
I agree. And we wont stop annoying everyone with this until we get a blue post about it.
---
10/10, can't wait to do it again.
---
ye, priest wold be the only class to avoid, everything else is perfectly fine
---
Luckily PvP is purely cross faction
---
Blizz: Our game will be shaped by the feedback received during beta
---
Also Blizz:  You can't be in the beta
---
Also Blizz: Sorry, you should have said something during beta
---
Fuck yeah. That'd be the only time I'd claim "death in the family" and not come back for two weeks.
---
I don't know how it is on the BETA currently but there's a huge amount of discussion on pservers about if windfury resets swing timer and what patch it originally did so into.
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=10394&amp;highlight=windfury
---
Spamming hamstring **IF** windfury resets the swing timer can reduce DPS for slow weapons.
---
Blizzard doesn't want money from everyone that likes classic only, that's peanuts. This way they get everyone who might even remotely want to try classic.
---
On this plus side.. days will be mostly kid-free. So taking some days off to play during the day should make barrens chat more enjoyable!
---
How deep will you be rolling?
---
About 5?
---
Wat?
---
Every class needs reputation, so human works.
---
Every class needs to escape CC, so gnome works. Every class can use detect treasure so dwarf works.
---
Every class could use a will of the forsaken
---
Every class could use more atk or cast speed
---
Every class would like to have 30% stun resist
---
Every class benefits from tauren stun.
---
But the porn is not going to watch itself if I sleep.
---
Everyone knows it's the Ring of Favour and Protection.
---
I haven’t seen any comments about Tauren war stomping into the talented magma totem. Is that combo viable? Do you pop totem first then warstomp? Or the other way around? 
---
I just figured since theres a two second stun and it takes two seconds for the magma totem to pop, you might as well drop the totem with the stun and then do some other spells. I feel like that would improve burst potential but I haven’t tried it myself and am not sure how global cooldown affects this. 
---
Any Tauren shamans out there to comment? Maybe this will help OP decide if he should play Tauren. I’ll play Tauren either way because I love their lore etc. And the 5% buff to stamina is awesome for PvP.
---
Classic+ should be, like TBC, as a separate server option, with character copy.
---
This way, Classic will be preserved as a museum, which was Blizzard's initial intent.
---
However, without a continuation (and at this point, both TBC and Classic+ have solid support), Classic realms, as a museum, will be as empty...as a museum is.
---
Only TBC or only Classic+ is beyond stupid. The player base will simply lose half of their players...the half that doesn't want TBC or the half that doesn't want Classic+.
---
BOTH have to be a reality, and in a perfect world, released in same time, or very soon one after the other.
---
To ask ONLY for TBC, is to ask for Classic to simply die.
---
To ask only for Classic+, is to shit on TBC players.
---
We should ask for both, and if we can get past "fuck TBC" and "fuck Classic+", we WILL get both.
---
Isn't this the better option?
---
It doesn't look like layering is going to go anywhere during Phase 1.
---
Oh well. If they're going to implement it and not punish people who exploit it then I'm going to get my Grand Arena Master trinket in a couple of hours and then proceed to stock up on Black Lotus and Devilsaur Leathers en masse at a ridiculous rate during off hours.
---
Shit.. why didn't I think of that??
---
EARS!
---
Firstly what class are you looking at playing? Because i too came to the decision that if i was to play warrior on alliance side again after being a human i was to play Nelf Female. Mainly because of shadowmeld and then they have the highest agility gains per level versus any other race in the game. The whisp form while dead is also super handy and then the fact that hey gain extra dodge is also super helpful. Honestly play whatever race you want to play it is your character that you have to stare at for 60 levels and countless hours of game play. So just play what you want to play.
---
Another blind worshipper of Blizzard’s word; mind slave.
---
Aimed shot is a cast. Casts aren't affected by attack speed
---
I mean... I out dps and out-heal people right now on live.  
---
Hell. I can out dps lots of people in resto spec just not healing and dpsing the whole time.
---
Last year of vet school here, I gotta limit myself to like 1-2h a day at most.
---
Sharding solves your problem, not layering
---
I’d like to think alliance. Shamans don’t really shine until they have the good elemental gear while paladins can keep everybody alive. Once shamans can start stacking the spell power gear is when they start ripping through pally heals.
---
Thanks for the feedback - for rogues the values for stamina and agility are the same. Having Spell Power at 11 and Shadow Power / Stamina at 10 would be interesting.
---
&gt; I feel like, if they round robin assign people to cadres, there will always be an influx of new characters in the lower sections as people level up, then maybe compress them into zone layers together as they level?
---
Yeah as long as you kept adding to the existing cadres, based on current population distribution, and didn't just keep increasing the number of cadres, this should work well.
---
And also, yes, it should definitely be layered by zone instead of by player level, otherwise you could find odd situations of deserted areas, depending on your level and zone.
---
&gt; Yeah, just throwing ideas at the wall while I was bored in a conference call.
---
Not a bad thing!
---
I feel like there is discussion and ideas needed, because the current implementation is not ok for launch.
---
And although they have a fair amount of time left, there's no harm in trying to come up with things they may not have thought of, to suggest.
---
Yes, indeed, the way I like it! Being in a whole other place than first time around, with 2 toddlers, one of which does not sleep well, requires me to be able too put the game down relatively fast.
---
Also, I usually just relax and put on a show on my other screen,mind-numbing is my goal
---
Selling them would be easier and profitable
---
You really don't understand what no changes means and seem to have adopted your own meaning. It literally means 0 changes from actual Blizzard history.... none. Custom post Naxx content would absolutely be a massive change and it would no longer be vanilla wow.
---
I for one am patiently waiting for TBC, the best era of WoW.
---
It is the most satisfying PVE role in my opinion(though I have never maintanked).  Most dps classes become button mashing facerolls quite quickly, in which you can just zone out,  mash your rotation, and do big damage.  Healing requires more situational awareness and resource management and provides a much more varied and complex experience as a result.  Priest is my favorite.  The variety of their toolkit allows for very satisfying gameplay when you master it.
---
Also, guilds only had 6months to progress through Naxx before TBC launched. 
---
Naxx patch release: June 20 2006.
---
TBC patch release: January 16 2007.
---
I saw how fast they could delete people while also wearing a shield, mail armor and have healing abilities.
---
This is why so many people roll humans.  10% increased reputation per turn-in.
---
No one gives a fuck what shamans do if they just keep that wind fury totem down BOI!!!!!!!!!
---
It's not about the number of people, it's about being in a cohesive group, like servers are.
---
Nothing is.  Classic+ is as real as TBC. Or as unreal.
---
Blizzard will deliver both, because as it stands now, the community is almost dead split between TBC and Classic+.
---
 We should ask for both, and if we can get past "fuck TBC" and "fuck Classic+", we WILL get both.
---
Using the hearth back to Bloodhoof is indeed not very efficient in the long run. This run was to see how fast I can get 1-10. I have another run up on my channel where I get 1-10+bear form in 2hr and 28 minutes!
---
I didn't realize there was a BfA patch coming. I imagine they'll probably turn off the beta at that time in the hopes that hype transfers to the new patch. 
---
You know, it seems like the beta requiring a sub and the subbing 2 weeks early for your name are also revolved around pushing attention to BfA.
---
Good stuff, phase 2 will belong to the horde and alliance people on pvp servers under 60 will quit.
---
I did most the high end dungeons not long after launch.  Running ubrs and strat constantly.  I was a resto druid that never reached level 60 and wore almost all int/spirit green gear until I got dungeon set.  I don't even think I used +healing gear since people thought spirit was the thing for mana regen. The dungeons were not that hard you just had to be careful on pulls the rest was pretty simple.  This is back when druids were just awful to play.
---
Imagine a cinematic where it's a mage conjuring water,  a Warlock waiting for players to click the portal,  and a druid casting an innervate then going to sleep.
---
Feral AP could be re-written as “adds x/14 to your imaginary feral weapon”
---
It is exactly the same as any other melee’s weapon upgrade.
---
Yeah healbot.
---
What's possibly more "evil" than layering? It's certainly the worst option out of all the suggestions I've seen.
---
If the moon were spare ribs would you eat it?
---
Maybe but as a rogue full fears or psychic screams can take you out of the fight during crucial moments, and for much longer than stuns (fear and poly are like 14 seconds in vaniller)
---
Sorry...WHAT?
---
I think you are missing the point here...
---
I want to play bad, but I've got a wife, a three year old, I'm in engineering school, and I work 45ish hours a week. I just cant figure where the time will come from
---
Sharding being number 1, of course, followed closely by no layering/sharding and simply not being able to play **at all** because of the thousands of people in the same area.
---
 Yeah. [https://willitclassic.com/addons](https://willitclassic.com/addons)
---
How so? I kill them, I farm. 
---
They return and manage to kill me, they farm.
---
The dominate player ends up "winning" the area, instead of it being first come first serve and literally nothing can be done about it.
---
It creates competition, it increases the value of gathering resources and increases player interaction.
---
All these attack range problems. Hopefully they can get it sorted out.
---
Hell yeah brother.
---
It still does more damage per second even with the swing timer reset. Resetting the swing timer is not a bad thing when your 2 hander has 3.4-3.8 swing speed and the damage done is comparable to heroic strike. Hamstring is OK for dual wield, but 2h gets more mileage out of slam when you are timing it right.
---
There were LFG addons in classic too. They just weren't used by many people. 
---
You still choose who you group with, and it's still your server mates.
---
You've got it backwards.
---
For example say you make Dwarf Priest. In that case the Gun Specialization is wasted on your class, since Priests can't use guns anyway. If you make a Gnome Rogue, you end up with a practically useless bonus to Intellect. Orc Warriors, Shamans and Rogues will never utilize the Command racial. And so on.
---
Idk, slows, frost nova, blink and ice block are all pretty defensive, doesn't seem to be a terrible defensive kit. That said, mismanaging them is definitely gonna lead to a bad time.
---
On the contrary, a big thing is the amount of pride you'll feel having earned sets like that and you'll want to keep wearing it
---
Hey Norm, if you were a hot dog, would you eat yourself?
---
I'll trust your word about the rules. All I'm saying, if the GMs are not responding, - instead of giving the harassing guild the satisfaction of ruining your RP, why not implement their actions into your RP? You can create a scenario out of that, some sort of guerilla warfare, organizing other guilds on the server, etc.
---
It seems to me, that the PvE RP servers are for people who wish to organize and control the events, they are the source of the RP, and the world is just a setting. RP-PvP, on the other hand, is much more suited for those, who seek RP that comes naturally from the world itself, primarily stemming from faction warfare - hence the importance of unrestricted PvP.
---
It's to prevent people from doing stuff like turning herbs into ragnaros and other stuff that makes it way easier to see.
---
&gt; layering sounds great to me, provided they keep to their promise and kill it off at or before Phase 2
---
That's awfully optimistic. Blizzard is relying on their assumption that the population will plummet in a month. If they underestimate how many leave, layering is certainly going to become permanent. The only way layering going away is if the game becomes underpopulated.
---
Very true. Having that second fear/charm removal would be quite handy. Does WotF remove poly?
---
What about Feathermoon Stronghold?
---
Ok guys. So I've been set on being a Hunter for quite some time. I absolutely love the class  fantasy although I have never really played one past level 20. That said I've been watching some Druid videos and my confidence is waning. I know this is a dark path and I hope someone can set me straight. Anyone got some videos or knowledge to drop to get me hype about Hunters again?
---
I wonder how people like you actually manage to live in real world, being unable to understand simple, basic wording.
---
Maybe re-read the topic, as many times as you can, and hope to understand what are we talking about here.
---
First off, I want to thank you for making a constructive layering thread! I've been kind of copy pasting the below while accumulating more, but it sums up my general thoughts on the matter. Curious how your system would account for grouping with people from another layer. 
---
i'd have to rob a snackbar cause i'm broke af atm
---
Barrens chat? Bring me my two-hander. I need to scourge strike something...
---
Going to get flamed for this, but make a low level twink. There's premades and talented players if you pick the right server. No gear grind once you're BiS
---
he runs outlands we'll fight him and his leaders. i can't wait to kill nagas and them blue Cthulhu wannabes
---
A mistake by modern judgment? Certainly. But I'm fine with Blizz taking care to implement gameplay mechanics exactly as they were even if current player computer/connection/skill/addons have rendered it obsolete. Let the game release as close to the original as possible, no 'difficulty tuning', just ask "how was it originally" outside of obvious bugs.
---
Having content that very few can do adds mistique to the world and give players something to strive for. A dream that one day, they'll be that good. It makes the world feel big.
---
There's also people experiencing it vicariously by seing another player with mega gear, watching a youtube video, or watching a streamer.
---
L A Y E R I N G is totally fine and not phasing at all! I'm glad people were so adamant this is totally different and won't have the same issues!   
---
So you turn on PvP and then what? You're just inviting getting ganked or attacked. You can't do anything but react to situations instead of engaging them.
---
That sounds extremely boring. Considering most players won't turn their PvP on those who do would become more popular targets than on PvP servers where everyone is flagged evenly.
---
It just doesn't sound fun or engaging. I don't see the point of playing World of WARcraft without the War.
---
A paladin will ninja your loot\*
---
\*applies to any class
---
On a bit of more serious note, a spoon full of peanut butter is enough calories for a whole meal and is quite nutritious with a decent amount of protein, generally good fats, and a good amount of micronutrients all while being very quick to eat and cheap. Not that I'm planning on having a few peanut butter tubs nearby on launch day or anything like that...
---
Nah nah was just clumping it with fear cuz how long they last (and cuz I been rolling mage, EVERYONE GETS SHEEPED)
---
Seriously, there's not many ways to truly fuck this up but this will most certainly be one of them.
---
Rogues and Hunters.
---
Some classes have a lot more going on for healing than others. I rank Priest as the highest in funness.
---
Your holy paladin truly is spamming flash of light, often on a few select targets (although not always-- whack-a-mole raid healing I'm sure is fine). 
---
Resto druids rely a lot on healing touch rank 4 spam, Resto Shamans do a lot of chain healing when appropriate, etc.
---
I'll always argue that in a strictly PVE environment (and likely pvp too) Priest is the most fun, with the biggest toolkit of stuff you can do.
---
In PVP, the "toolkit" is pretty good for all the healers 'though.
---
That would be rank 7.  It was the first rank where you could get the blue gear.
---
Well the method outlined above would ensure you have friends in there with you. Hopefully they are good people. And brave.
---
Fair enough, I couldn’t remember what all WotF removed
---
I would suddenly have a really bad stomachache and tell my boss I'm going call the doctor as soon as I get home.
---
Awesome dude, I'm very impressed
---
I'll be on EU realms so I will await the youtube clips with relish.
---
I do really like the need to go to a rested area, maybe even a capital city a-la WarMode toggling in Retail?
---
Charms and fears iirc. Could just be fear.
---
If this actually exists, I *really* hope that Blizzard bans any players who use it. It's a huge problem is this becomes a part of the game.
---
At the cost of countless number of exploits? At a certain point the ends don't justify the means.
---
I'm down for Layering 1-20 zones but once you get past there the number of possible exploits just skyrockets and the pros of layering become vastly outweighed by the cons.
---
I just listened to you on that episode yesterday.  I really enjoyed it!
---
I just want to give a shout out to streamers who are doing this kind of testing while enjoying the game. You the real mvp.
---
Rogue
---
I kinda hate how people always say that hunter is the "lowest pure DPS class".  It kind of puts a stigma on the class.  I've always played rogue, and it's been fun, but the skill ceiling doesn't seem that high.
---
Hunters on the other hand, seem to have way more going on, and should in theory be way more rewarding when played correctly.  I really want to give it a try, but don't wanna be labeled a noob, idiot, or "huntard" for it.
---
How big a dps gap is there really between hunter and the other classes?  Is this just something that will be considered in the way late game raid progression?  Or will I get passed on for a stronger DPS class in pre-raid dungeons, or early raid progression?
---
Can’t wait to get Broken Tooth again!
---
Opposite for me.  Lose as much weight as you can so you don't get fat when you give up exercise for WoW.
---
Polymorph only works in caster form. So rarely unless they are healing
---
First, congrats! Dad of twins here. 
---
Second, you are completely fucked. Get your parents / in-laws to move in and you might have a chance of getting some sleep, let alone playtime. I didn't get more than 4 hours of continuous sleep per night for the first 6 months. With an EXTRA kid on top of that, I literally can't even fathom how busy you'll be.
---
If you ever want to vent / get tips, PM me anytime.
---
Listen. Your original claim was that you couldn't see going 1 to 60 **without any pvp** I'm telling you that doesn't have to happen on a PvE server. You can whine about that it's not the type of PvP you want, but that's not the claim and its not what I addressed.
---
Entirely subjective.  Dwarfs look like stubby turds imo.
---
Sharding or not being able to play the game at all would both be considerably worse than layering lol
---
major moves guys! I think the most similar project I can think of is the rarethief.com map for sea of thieves which has some filters for POIs for different reputations and patch content they put into the game.
---
Alternative Timeline: New expansions with different features.  
---
Expansion snapshots: Release a TBC expansion as a fork of a current Classic server and allow players to continue the progression on the TBC server and also still having the ability to log on the L60 capped Classic server. These two servers should have no interaction with each other once forked.
---
People will still care, but enough people will be invested in the game by that point that they aren't going to quit when Blizzard goes "Oops! We forgot to remove layering. Oh well."
---
you are still delaying your next weapon hit with it as the reset happens at the end of the slam cast, which means less rage generated over time and delay for your basic attack to potentially trigger WF(for horde)  
---
Which doesn't mean that it is not an option if you have way too much rage available. But it is a factor that people rarely keep in mind when they blindly follow the 'just slam right when your swingtimer starts' ruleset
---
No, they need people to play 8.2 and pay again retail.
---
I think a lot of the streams are getting kind of boring since they’re capped at 40 it doesn’t leave them with much to do besides farming and the odd bg or wpvp run in.
---
Would recommend Bean though he’s a really good player and I think the streams will get better once the game is actually out.
---
"You guys have PHONES don't you!?"
---
Nononono, you eat healthy and excercise now so you can eat like absolute dogshit for a month straight come release or better yet dont start eating like shit after release and keep with the healthy lifestyle
---
wow truest thing ive heard all week
---
But shadowmeld is dog poo in classic, lol. You can only shadowmeld out of combat making it almost useless
---
The original cinematic is both nostalgic and great.
---
A new cinematic? I don't know. Maybe, if it expands on the old cinematic.
---
Blizzard are damn good at cinematics.
---
Look at how many BfA copies they sold...because of a great cinematic.
---
I always thought Vanilla was missing a Scarlett Crusade Raid.
---
when tbc launched i had 3 60s in full r14 gear, it was all vendor items, that is what people are posting
---
They won't forget - that makes classic, bfa.
---
The exploiting if layering won't matter in December
---
Ah i see. So he works for nike
---
If you think there won’t be a need for some sort of traffic mitigation you must have not been around for any of the xpac launches.
---
Yea and that was if your guild was ready to hit Naxx immediately. The numbers would likely have been different if BC had been released a year later.
---
Nope.  Rep grind quests were so you could buy other race mounts.
---
i would prefer if addons weren't allowed, but they are
---
Pendant of Celerity is a drop off one of the tier 0.5 quest bosses too. So that's out. 
---
Actually started doing a gear list for myself now haha, might post it later. Trying to do a compromise between what is easy to get and what is absolutely bis. Like if there is a quest reward that's good enough, there's no point grinding dungeons just to get a marginal upgrade.
---
What about gnome mages?
---
Too far and too costly, given Classic travel times and prices. I want people to be able to look for a group in general chat, then either travel to the instance in their own layers or at least be able to meet at the inn to join the right layer and travel together. It dramatically cuts down on rare spawn camping and inconveniences resource farmers without making friendly play impossible.
---
Opening with "it's actually funny that you believe" puts the recipient on defense because the tone it creates is condescending.
---
I was an altholic already back then. I had very slowly leveled an orcc rogue to 53 when I suddenly felt like trying shaman instead. I fell in love right away. Lightning bolts and Earth shocks.... Using nature's ressources to your advantage. So cool 😎😎😎😎😎😎
---
yeah one is an active and is temporary the other is not
---
I loved the Troll Shadow Hunters, specially this image: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/f4/50/19f450d79ff2041afa3c1630246da2bd.jpg
---
When WoW came out, I was sure Troll Shamans were made for me.
---
I played one until level 30~40 and then didn't like it :(
---
So I ended up rerolling a Warlock and played him until WoD. Not really a shaman story I guess lol
---
&gt; I'm going to get my Grand Arena Master trinket in a couple of hours and then proceed to stock up on Black Lotus and Devilsaur Leathers en masse at a ridiculous rate during off hours.
---
And when everyone else does such an incredibly original plan?
---
Double negative.
---
Still, I think we all understood what he meant. No need to point a grammar mistake.
---
Hooray! More unnecessary posts that don't don't regard classic.
---
Retail takes much more dedication than Vanilla.      
---
Things are just slower in vanilla.  But retail, you NEVER reach a max/min you contantly have to keep playing to get tf/wf or new content comes out which makes all the work you did useless...
---
On god
---
Desolace will be the new STV because everyone who wants to ding 60 fast thinks they will be alone over there
---
^ understands it
---
I'm sure they plan on it, just a matter of prioritizing getting more features in the web version, or adapting a basic version for mobile.
---
And when the blues tell you they're still going to use layering?
---
Watch the clip again. It's not leeway. They walk into melee, swing, walk out, back in, swing.
---
&gt; So how do you make enough gold to buy everything in less than 2 hours, then? Besides buying it from shady chinese websites, there is absolutely no way to do it.
---
Playing the AH. I'm not the clueless one here.
---
And sorry if I didn't remember a detail from a quest I did the last time 13 years ago
---
No, Nost didn't have sharding. They had queues.
---
This isn't 2004 anymore. There are other solutions that are a lot better. They are just going with layering because they already have the tech to do it (it's the same as sharding), so there's nothing new to develop.
---
Randomly?
---
MY GOD, maybe they already did it !
---
Now that would be really random.
---
oh man, this trailer should be made! I lold.
---
lol the api today is way more restrictive than what was in vanilla.  just because you didn't do it back then doesn't mean it didn't exist
---
If you have good gear a Ret Paladin is a force to be reckoned with in Vanilla.
---
IF you have good gear and a good weapon.
---
The bow/staff quest will be in, just not in phase 1. Iirc the leaf/eye of divinity were added to the MC loot table in 1.4 (or 1.5) which would mean they’re being added in p2 at the earliest, or p3 at the latest.
---
&gt; Arena is what helped WoW grow to where it is today
---
You mean completely downhill? lmao
---
https://youtu.be/5frS6BjaiD8?t=122
---
Both targets are moving, the player gets dangerously close to the mob a couple of times yet doesn't take a single melee hit.
---
There should be a way to shake up the entire leveling experience. Maybe a Cataclysm or something
---
Yeah.
---
Maybe require zoning into the instance... or maybe require people to touch the meeting stones and give those an actual purpose outside the instance so they can summon people with warlocks and interact to defend each other?
---
No, there are two other solutions, and they are not even close to being better.
---
I look forward to ganking you on that bridge. FOR THE HORDE!!!!!
---
No changes.
---
ever play on a pvp realm? shadowmeld will get you out of a lot of shit
---
i like this
---
In the very first clip, why does he run in the center, fein death, and drop a frost trap?
---
I know fein -&gt; frost trap is a combo.  But idk why the feign is needed?
---
Link a video of you clearing a raid in Classic WoW.
---
Waiting...
---
Joana will be cleaning MC when i could barely leave the Barrens anyway.
---
well thx for that information, i'm not going to tell him that he is an idiot, tho I find it funny and it really made my day haha
---
Hi, /u/Abigfluffydoggo
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0l1nf/the_best_thing_about_classic_wow_servers_besides/). 
---
I came from a game called Tibia, was actually pretty reluctant to get in to WoW cause we viewed it as a casual game with minimal death penalty etc, but there were mobs in Tibia called Orc Shaman that summoned snakes and were strictly casters, so there was a familiarity that appealed to me. 
---
However, I'm the type of person that likes to get in to the thick of the action, not a fan of hanging back like a coward shooting from range, and I saw the 'Enhancement' spec option - being a 'Totemic Warrior', using the power of the elements but also the might of your weapons to take down enemies, and I was completely sold.
---
I resubbed (but haven't bought BFA) in the hope of getting in to the beta, I've tried playing on my Shaman, and I'm sure it's a fun class to play if you've never played it before, but it's just so far removed to what it was when I started playing, that it's almost unrecognisable as a Shaman. I can not wait to pick up a two-hander again.
---
You don't understand. With one baby, this migt work OK. Triplets is three babies at the same time. Three. At the same time. Pray to all gods (old ones included) that they have the same nap schedule. If they are different schedules, there will nit be a moments peace.
---
Nah I'd rather them do the original idea of BFA style sharding in the starter zones. Layering is significantly worse because it covers the entire world for a long time. Mind you, I'd still rather them do none of this shit because it's insulting to their fans, but Blizzard cares about doing it the cheap way, not the right way.
---
&gt; that isn't the day before a test day
---
Shit, you got me
---
there's not really anything insignificant about removing the meaningful choice aspect of pet ownership.
---
Named mine “Pink Menace”, since I was still active in the gay rights movement back then.
---
There will always be players that will sacrifice the classic experience for utility and convenience.
---
There will be players who load up on so many Add-Ons that their Classic will run a lot like retail.
---
You can click the buff then equip a different weapon.
---
Exactely, that's why I would like to have both of them. Which is almost impossible because both do not have the fast AS you want for PvP. For raiding you need a wolf or a wind serpent. Back in the days I was happy having BT. But today I would like to have some "vanity" pets as well. ;)
---
Anyone else a getting deterred from rolling hunter because of melee leeway? Hunters rely so much on kiting in PvP, but with the melee leeway range being so far it’s going to be much harder to get melee people of out your dead zone.
---
I do like the idea of using meeting stones as a potential layering beacon! But this only works for informed players, what about casuals or those new to the game who can't see their friends and don't know what a meeting stone even is?
---
I was just trying to cheer up the guy! Now his anxiety its probably off the charts xD
---
People used to think Rogues were like this but that's why they could never get top scores on worldoflogs. Good rogues don't button mash as it actually makes you do less dps, especially in tbc.
---
Is there any point in playing the game... play a NE because you want to... nuff said. I'll be a NE priest pointlessly waiting in stealth to MC horde off cliffs or whatever.
---
Me and my buddies have a huge spreadsheet we've been dumping useful resources into for the passed few weeks. It's going to be an awesome help come release.
---
Nice breakdown. I feel like it would be cool if you made some sort of nicely organized guide with maybe bullets or something to summarize some of these things. People would certainly read it.
---
This is a valid argument. In classic I rolled a NE Priest because my GF wanted to roll a NE hunter, and no one really knew the importance of Fear Ward in 2004, so when it came to endgame I'd be passed on many groups and raid slots because they'd rather a dwarf priest.   So much so that I ended up leveling up a dwarf just so I could experience the endgame more.   Sucks but it was a reality.  Who knows if it will continue that way.
---
Healing in vanilla has some gimmicks to it. 5 second rule, dispelling, down-ranking. It's alright, I wouldn't say it compares favorably to later  expansions (last expansion I healed was WoD, which I enjoyed from tank, healing, and DPS perspectives). Efficient AE/raid healing doesn't really exist aside from Chain Heal on Horde side, so there's a lot of switching between targets as well, and in a raid with 40 people your raid frames are massively bloated. You're also going to be running macros/add-ons to help you with dispels which takes away a bit of the skill from playing (compared to modern raids where you have an 6/8 second cooldown on dispel). 
---
You also guzzle a shit load of mana pots because mana regen sucked back then, and there's no "two potion per encounter" limit so you can blow tons of gold. It's worth mentioning that there is no dual-spec so you have to farm with a healing spec with sucks. You're almost certainly going to want to herb in that case so you can gather and make pots yourself.
---
No. Changes.
---
I mean. If I see my target is missing 1000 health and I pick a 2000 heal I'm a moron. You should have made better decisions to begin with.
---
An addon that tells you the amount of overheal after the decision has been made is about as useful as an addon that display "You Died!" on your screen after you got killed.
---
You guys are all pretending as if people are utterly incapable of using their brain when making decisions in a raid and can only figure out the apropriate rank to use if an addon tell you how dumb your previous decision was when in reality you had all the information you ever needed to begin with.
---
Server merging? Better. Dynamic Spawns? Better. Increasing the server cap? Better. Of course none of them are perfect, but they are significantly better than shardi-\*cough\* layering.
---
Lemme pull out that video I have saved on my old '95 real fast.
---
But first get HoA level 50, then 65 after the patch, farm out residum for Azeroth gear, and get gold so you can contribute to the guild bank, 
---
You’re only looking at like 20 hours a week of game time my dude.
---
I will say this. I do not like layering, I agree with you that I fucking love mmo launches because of the chaos involved. I started in 2007 and was there for every expansion launch up until Legion. Legion introduced sharding and it just killed the launch hype for me. There was no competition for mobs, there was no race to max level. The launch wasn't an event to be remembered, it was just the game coming out...
---
But at this point, Layering in classic comes down to 2 things
---
* 1: How many people are in each layer. If the layer is 2k-3k pop each, **and they can find a way to stop the 1% abusing layer swapping**, then this is not an issue. That's enough population to make the launch hype as fuck and encourage me to fuck up my sleep schedule to get ahead of the rat pack
---
* 2: Are they GUARANTEED to turn off layering after the first few weeks. If the server cap is 9k (rumour) and they follow through with their plans to turn off layering, then its only an issue at launch to keep the servers from crashing at 3k players in razor hill
---
My biggest concern is that they decide to keep layering forever with some bullshit reason like "well, there's 3x the players now than there was back in original vanilla...so it makes sense to have 3x the world with 3x the resources". But I am...optimistic? that it won't go that way
---
hell yeah, thats why I am coming back. Never liked raiding, pvp and leveling is where its at in wow :)
---
Probably got at the end of vanilla. There was a patch right before BC that made R14 gear achievable by virtually anybody.
---
I don't mean boring as in what they're doing, I mean they're simply not entertaining personalities to watch (to me).   But I do totally agree that all of the streamer are pretty much hitting a lull with the level caps and the minimal amount of BGs that seem to be happening.  Looking forward to some more duel tournaments in the future and to see how the AV weekend goes for streamers since everyone will be locked out of normal beta.
---
You will understand the Classic WoW difficulty when a single guys in your random group will make a 1 hr dungeons run into 3 hour run, with 10 wipes.
---
NO GAME is difficult for good players.
---
Classic is not difficult, but it will punish you IF YOU DO A MISTAKE...unlike retail, where 5 bad players can clear any dungeon without a wipe.
---
In Classic, it takes A SINGLE bad player to understand WHY it is difficult. And trust me...there will be A LOT of bad players...just like in any other game.
---
I look forward to corpse camping you on that bridge!!!
---
Dont forget to quit your job.
---
Mark Kern said the design philosophy for the game was to be "intensely social".  One of the head honchos wanted servers to be max pop 500, so that everyone knew everyone else.  Even though that didn't happen, it is clear that it was the ethos guiding the design.  That, more than anything else, is the core of what makes the Vanilla experience what it is.  It is "intensely social".
---
So most of the testers being non-streamers are doing nothing since they aren't monetizing their testing?
---
Well, shit. Guess I'm going horde.
---
That week is different by country and state. Some countries hardly get any time off in the summer, like England, and some states go back in September. People in university start even later and people working don’t get a whole summer to do nothing.  
---
The fact some people go back to school that week is probably a small percentage of the player base, especially if this is bringing back people who played a decade + ago.
---
You're delusional if you think WoW would've gotten nearly as possible as it ended up getting without the addition of arena
---
Flips, don't forget the flips.
---
my home is in Ironforge)
---
I would be upset because I booked 2 weeks off for launch.
---
I feel like two hours for an entire MC raid seems not enough. I played at release and may be underestimate the skill impact
---
I saw the cinematic when I first loaded the game and decided that I wanted to be that Tauren Shaman and have access to healing and offensive spells while being one with nature, class fantasy was big for me. I ended up raiding up to BWL killing Nefarian, 10/10 would do it again.
---
This almost made me want to roll Alliance - almost
---
I love stam/int for levelling, but it's also important to balance it out with some str/agi. If you are ending a lot of fights with zero or close to zero mana, add some more intellect/spirit. If you find you can take on multiple mobs and still come out with half a mana bar, maybe drop some intellect for some more aggressive stats. Either way is fine really, but negating downtime is key - and ferals already have insanely low downtime haha.
---
You're actually going to give your balls for classic. Damn that is some dedication.
---
This. There are tons of bad players out there. It's why something like less than 5% of WoW's total player base actually did 40 man raids.
---
Have you not played BfA with phasing/sharding? I have a few examples at hand: 
---
https://youtu.be/lPBqj8pYyx0
---
https://youtu.be/Jo39mIJsMHE
---
https://youtu.be/RuYd7wKZBA0
---
At least, other than current bugs that should be fixed (and gone completely by Phase 2 regardless), and blatant abuse of layering which hopefully will be fixed/punishable - BfA phasing is horrible. 
---
Layering being worldwide makes it SO much better as you don't pop in and out like the Druid did after leaving the WQ area. Sharding is also random which you join, whereas layering puts you with your guild/friends etc. unless you join a party which is on a different layer.
---
This isn't mine - it's just a copy of a response someone made on this video that was posted elsewhere.
---
Ok but I mean...
---
how is that in any way an oxymoron?
---
They could get a prompt with a warning that you're in different layers with a quick list of the ways to merge layers?
---
&gt;Server merging? Better.
---
This isn't even on the table. Blizzard isn't going to make 500 servers and later merge them altogether. Blizzard hasn't merged any servers in years, they aren't going to merge hundreds of them together in a few months when layering is an option.
---
&gt;Dynamic spawns
---
Already exists, so... Unless you're talking about infinitely scaling dynamic spawns, where you've got a thousand defias raiding the abbey? lmao.
---
This also does absolutely nothing for server stability, which is the primary problem. Completely laughable solution.
---
&gt;Increasing the server cap
---
What on earth does increasing the cap have to do with server stability/ gameplay? Make it **worse**? LOL
---
&gt;but they are significantly better than shardi-*cough* layering.
---
...no
---
That sounds about right. It was like bracers and belt or something? Its been many years.
---
Just have to bring your boys and will be mostly ok.
---
Behind the door of the bank vault. You can slowfall into old IF from there IIRC
---
"Yeah this isn’t working as intended" You might be right, but you also might be wrong, as long as we don't have a vanilla video of a guy doing exact same movements (cause the streamer in the video does very specific movement to trigger this stuff) then we can't really know.
---
Hashtag nochanges
---
Which is why I am gonna roll on pve server this time around. I was on pvp server vanilla till legion and absolutely hated it. 
---
Why I rolled it in first place was because of friends, most of them will roll on pve aswell. 
---
I’m not gonna miss the gankfest, that’s for sure.
---
Paladins standing in the background, wearing dresses, just buffing everyone constantly and cleansing them.
---
It's been a while, but I remember surprising peopel with the amount of damage I was able to do as a healing ne priest.  PI + swp + starshards + smite
---
&gt; Server merging? Better. 
---
Isn't this just layering with extra steps
---
He has posted a few times here explaining the depth of what is going on and all those posts are under his top level comment.  
---
I like the new content, but I would really be more impressed if the environments and world were reforged like warcraft 3.  The animation improvements they warcraft team made during WoD and the new BFA environments look stunning.  Just knowing those changes could be ported into the wow classic client and bring more life to the world, keeps me hoping and wondering they will have the reforged world of warcraft one day.  All I know, is they said the 2014 WoD models were in the game as an option, but the option was removed since the good looking models clashed really badly with the old looking world.
---
I'm so confused. Are you being difficult or am I being stupid?
---
&gt; Things seemingly started changing when the games popularity exploded and they realized probably 80%~ of the playerbase would never kill a 40 man raid boss, so they started making everything easier, making comparable epics easier to obtain, making it easier to get an epic mount, moving away from 40 mans in favor of 10/25, implementing things like cross-server dungeons that were more efficient, but greatly reduced the need for player communication, etc.
---
Making it "easier" isn't the problem.  The problem was making it "less social".  By far the biggest culprit there is LFD/LFR.  You're right, cross-server dungeons are also a big part of the problem.
---
You have become soft with age, man up.
---
If I was Alliance I would 100% roll female NE for the flips alone.
---
Humar was the only black cat at the time and for at least a while he would maintain his rare mob emblem around his name when clicked, adding to the allure. His special ability was some bleeding effect when he was your pet which wasn’t that special. I never had Rake so I can’t say for sure
---
I think we’re both being both tbh
---
Most of the data structures have already been figured out by private server devs, for example for spell effects:
---
[https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/blob/master/src/server/game/DataStores/DB2Structure.h#L2594](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/blob/master/src/server/game/DataStores/DB2Structure.h#L2594)
---
Most of the ppm rates are not public, you wont find them in the dbcs.
---
If Nelf had shaman, id do it all day
---
Are you making sure that your pet is FULLY fed before continuing on? It's been awhile since Vanilla, and I didn't play private servers, but if I remember correctly you can feed it multiple times before it's fully fed. And I remember being fully fed lasting a little while. So maybe see if you can't dismiss your pet (so it's hunger won't drop) and solo farm a small stockpile of food. Or you can switch to an animal with a wider diet,  bears will eat almost anything. I also remember a talent in the pet tree that allows your pet to stay happy from killing mobs, so once you get that, you're gold.
---
Or it's possible that the fed timer is glitched. Submit a ticket report, and if others are also experiencing the same issue it will be fixed.
---
&gt; I mean, if 80% of your player base isn’t experiencing the content you spent the time developing, it isn’t exactly an efficient or intelligent use of your company resources.
---
I disagree.  The fact is that I never set foot in Naxx in my vanilla days.  But I knew it was there, and I *wanted* to go.  That was enough.
---
You've got to figure that the audience here is likely not the broader audience that will play.
---
The only instances I can think of with a shaman in the cinematics are Thrall in the [WoD Nagrand finale](https://youtu.be/D1SdVC2mrz8) and Zekhan in the [BFA cinematic trailer](https://youtu.be/jSJr3dXZfcg). Both of which seem to be more elemental or enhancement focused.
---
That image took me at least 30 seconds to figure out the logistics.  
---
Arms and legs coming out everywhere!
---
your talking about classic, all the best accessories trinkets and easily obtained weapons for PvP came from pve. the pvp gear didn’t keep pace with the early tiers.
---
Ya, blizzard can rework all the zones. 
---
Art and other assets. New quests, remove old ones, increase gold obtained while leveling
---
Make it a little easier, more linear, instead of a zone giving quests/having enemies in different ranges, they are all pretty close in level or progress at a steady rate. 
---
Lower mount levels to 20 and 40
---
Reduce the amount of cost needed
---
My goal is to hit 60 asap so I can start working on Tanking gear and proffesions with least amount of competition. Solo leveling is just faster in the end.
---
Also, all my boys stopped playing video games after the careers/kids came along. Thankfully my kid loves watching me play stuff and soon will be playing himself.
---
Whoops I was wrong.  You got boots/gloves at 7.  Bracers were at 5, Cloak was 3, and neck was 4.  So... You got several blue pieces before 7.  I don't think there was a belt for the pvp sets.
---
correct me if I'm wrong but so far we haven't seen a single clip of the minimum firing range going up when leeway occurs. If anything it makes your deadzone smaller which is a good thing
---
(well unless a player is one of the dual wield dagger hunters ... but in that case said hunter is free food for literally every physical dps in game anyway)
---
&gt;I have a wife a corvette and a $5,000 guitar
---
I have two wives, two corvettes and a $5,001 guitar.
---
It's always like that though, Desolace always had all the people thinking they were clever.
---
What do you think is the most annoying thing about hunters? I'm deciding between lock and hunter, and I've seen many times on this sub how people were talking about their strenghts. However I thought it would be interesting to ask in this thread, what you personally don't like about this class?
---
Practice stutter stepping for the first 10 levels. Having a shot timer add-on is extremely beneficial.
---
I want to get full T2, Full AQ set, Full T3 and corrupted adhbringer and pwn some noobs
---
I'm sure that was the philosophy when the game got made, but it's pretty clear the game designers started to deviate from this as soon as we saw raiding as endgame.
---
More or less every design decision in patches after Dire Maul seem geared exclusively at the aim of raiding and PvP. There's almost no changes during Vanilla that actually expand upon the endgame outside of these areas. Dire Maul was the only dungeon to get added. There was no real outdoor world content other than World Bosses (again a raid), and Battlegrounds being instanced means they dont expand upon the world either.
---
As it stands, even though the philosophy might have been that hybrids such as Enhancement would be tanking open world content and 5mans, there's actually no real content where these specs would be useful, and players simply arent going to put in the effort to gear and play specs that are only useful for the same few 5mans with nothing else to do.
---
Haha, I remember in Vanilla reading the WoW forums, filled with stuff like this: "We need more low level content" "High level raiders have MC and ONY, they dont need BWL!". Aaaah memories, casuals, awesome.
---
and you realize it's 5 a.m and you have 2 hours to sleep before class but you know if you did you wouldn't wake up so might as well try to ding out another level
---
When everybody indicates you are being a prick just to be a prick, its not them, its you.  
---
The dude was polite, upfront, and not entirely wrong. You really seem to just be fishing for reasons to be a dick. Im sure you have a lot of friends
---
I am guessing that you haven’t played on a vanilla PvP server. Whenever I play any other race, I miss shadow meld so much.
---
The OP (u/Moldyrockets) asked me to clarify that the creator of this artwork is Conpatshe (https://www.artstation.com/conpatshe).
---
It ends in a draw haha
---
"Stranlethorn" ?
---
Technologically, layering and sharding is mostly likely based upon moving players between OpenStack node clusters ( Read the Blizzard SENIOR CLOUD SYSTEMS ENGINEER Job Posting -  https://careers.blizzard.com/en-us/openings/oGmU9fwP ).
---
Each "Server" is likely a large cluster of Zone/Continent servers plus administrative nodes for login, character creation, auction house, etc and instance nodes for dungeons and battleground.  This is why lag in Stormwind doesn't typically affect Ironforge (or even Elwynn Forest). 
---
My guess would be that Sharding implements smaller, but more numerous nodes that dynamically scale and balance based upon server load in a specific area within a zone. While Layering likely implements fewer, but more powerful nodes (possibly even OpenStack provisioned Bare-Metal) capable of hosting larger total player counts and an entire zone of expected demand before lagging.  Hence the statements from the Devs that layering is only being targeted for starting zones and not levels 1-10.
---
All that is to say that while it can be done technologically,  level based layering would require large per zone, per level-group, per layer nodes that are likely more numerous than they want to allocate. Sorry.
---
Disclaimer: This could be 100% wrong.  I have not run a private wow server, but I do work with Enterprise Cloud Systems, including OpenStack (and I stayed ata Holiday Inn Express)
---
I mean there are other reasons...but Wow Classic is definitely the main reason.
---
A lot more Forsaken should be elves. Arthas pretty much decimated them and we can guess most of them became undead. A huge part of the Lordaeron lore is about the scourge, but also for Quel'Thalas. I understand some roaming undead from multiple races here and there without being playable, but since the Queen is an elf and because the scourge invasion was such an important event to elves, I think they they should be playable.
---
Also you have to factor in that everyone knew TBC was coming, so many people didn't even want to bother with Naxx, because they knew the gear was going to be invalidated instantly on TBC release.
---
This has to be bait right? Nobody actually thinks that video games can't be challenging to skilled players?
---
Again this... copy paste my typical answer :
---
Raids were "hard" on gearcheck.
---
So basically going into MC optimized + full BiS in 1.1 versus in 1.12 + make you litteraly less powerfull. 
---
Taking more damage, we were often oom, lower dps etc... It's just raw numbers here.
---
I'll be a female dwarf priest. Already scheduled my psychotherapy through 2040
---
Then I move onto one of 100 other options until it's 4:56am and those areas have died down again.
---
There will always be competition but now those who are knowledgeable about layer hopping will have a vastly significant advantage over the average players.
---
They had sharding and I told you exactly how it worked and what sharding actually is. You either didn't play there or weren't paying attention. All the current private servers have the exact same thing.
---
Kind of, I guess. Keep in mind this was at least 13 years ago. I remember having all the gear, and assumed that I had to be rank 14 to hit it. Everyone else did a pretty good job explaining it
---
LOL.
---
Why do you double down when you're clearly lying? No one else is reading this, we're too deep into the thread now. There's no reason to keep arguing and pretending. You're not fooling me and you're not fooling anyone else. 
---
You're not gonna "play the AH". 
---
Just own up to it and admit that you don't know what you're talking about.
---
agreed, it takes the sense of danger and a living world out of the game! Just mindlessly grinding monsters without any ally stomping seems like a waste of the game for me, not tell that to my friends who refuse to pvp! I never understood that, it probably explains why they like retails so much.
---
I think this is a good and often overlooked point.  You can't make a game that will appeal to or satisfy everyone.  The more they tried to do that, the worse the game got.
---
This is very helpful, and super interesting. I guess there's a lot I forgot over the last decade and a half. Getting old sucks
---
Anyone who's going to be farming these areas are going to be knowledgeable about layering
---
I like the way you think. I might jump in front of a moving car instead.
---
That's a cooldown (believe using it breaks stealth too - though not 100% sure on that) and you won't always have it up when you need it. It can be good in duels against people who don't know that racial exists, but any Night Elf who knows what he's doing can simply stay stealthed in a corner for 20 seconds until Perception wears off, then start the duel normally.
---
I'll just collect a lot of spirit gear. I'm also a troll, so I regen 10% even when in combat.
---
Is it just me, or should the cathedral not be there
---
Yep, that's exactly what happened. I assumed you still had to be rank 14. I definitely had to gear but definitely didn't earn rank 14
---
This is where you are WRONG! FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
He was specifically talking about duels my dude. Pretty sure you could have it up every duel if you really wanted to, just wait for the CD.
---
Nost had massive hype too, it was the largest private server launch that WoW's ever had. I found out about it through a forum for an EverQuest server.
---
On the other hand, you can never say that everyone already knows about Classic. There was just a post on this subreddit recently about the value of a Classic cinematic and their were replies from people who are just now discovering Classic. 
---
There are also posts here from people who obviously know about Classic WoW, but have to (or are choosing to) play 1+ months after it launches. 
---
And I'm not claiming that Classic WoW will grow at the same rate as Nostalrius, but what I'm saying is these doomsday predictions that claim 90% of the playerbase will quit within the first month are ridiculous.
---
"b-but I dont want to get killed, I want to get to 60 as fast as possible so I can get bored of the game in 2 months!"
---
\- someone probably
---
&gt;Playing the AH.
---
And just to clarify, making golds in wow is stupidly easy.
---
I had money for my epic flying before TBC came out, it's not that hard.
---
I paid my last month the month before WoW Tokens became a thing. Been playing on golds since.
---
I have met the WoW killer and the WoW killer is...WoW.
---
&gt;There is a limit to how many concurrent players both a whole server, and individual zones, can hold
---
I'm not saying remove all caps, just that the cap could be raised.  Obviously you can't have 1000 people all spawn in the exact same location without issues.  But that has never been a problem either.  It's almost like they made it up.  It's the migrant caravan of  Blizzard.  "Oh god what are we going to do about 1000 people logging in at the exact same time to the exact same location?!?".  Same thing you do with other games - have a queue if it gets way too ridiculously bad to the point of performance issues, but other than that, let it happen, and have multiple servers.
---
&gt;Layering allows an individual server to be scaled into multiple 'channels' of itself, also on different literal hardware, so you can allow 20,000 concurrent people on a 'single server' without ruining everyone's experience, or crashing it.
---
Who cares if they are on the same server?  That literally does not matter for the gaming experience. No one has ever enjoyed a game more because there's people they can't interact with that are on the same server as them.
---
Server death spiral is fixed by merging servers, which is less immersion breaking than layering (IMO).  If you are worried about name changes, Blizz can pre-plan server groups that share name pools.
---
&gt;No one can reasonably think any more than a small minority of people would find competing with an enormous mob of other people for quests/kills, having lots of lag, possible crashes, and wasting massive amount of time not being able to progress, "fun".
---
This is the most short sighted Blizzard-esque line of thinking that made retail such a fucking piece of shit.  Sorry if I'm raging here, but honestly.  There's a reason people choose high pop servers - they are more fun.  People don't just sit around waiting for respawns, they go to other locations to level, or engage in pvp, or group up, or duel, etc.  You know, things that used to exist before Blizzard started streamlining everything?  That's what this is.  Streamlining.  Pure and simple.  Blizzard doesn't want people to have to wait to do their damn quest.  God forbid they be forced to wait or minute or they do anything else and actually enjoy the game and give the game some life.  This is Blizzard fixing a problem that doesn't exist, and their fix makes the game worse.  It's like LFG (but obviously not as bad).  Overpopulation forces people to compete, group, explore, adapt, socialize, and so much more, and those things all compound on eachother, making the game richer and richer.  Maybe you roll a human and the starting zone is overpopped shit so you decide to *run all the way to the elf starting zone like a psycho*.  That's a unique experience you wouldn't normally have, plus it adds to other players experience when they see the out of place human.  It's stuff like that makes Classic so good.  In Retail, you level without interruption, pvp without interruption, raid without interruption.  The whole reason Classic is good is it *interrupts you*.
---
&gt;For maximum effect you could randomise the order of the server names every time you look at it, and not list any "low" "medium" "full" on them at launch.
---
This is actually a good idea and could be expanded upon too. Obviously this would help quite a bit and would be a much better way of balancing the servers than adding layering.
---
I feel like Blackened Marshes needs some Dragonkin.  It follows the trend where marshes and swamps are, Dragonkin are also.  In addition the surrounding zones like Badlands have elite Dragonkin in that basin, and how the Twilight Highlands have dragons.
---
The reality is that in MC and BWL the disparity isn't immensely noticeable but once your melee start getting all the gear they need, from those instances a disparity begins to be slightly noticeable. Once they get their AQ stuff it becomes a lot bigger.
---
The reality is that those other classes just scale much better with gear and are notably much more simple to optimize in terms of raid gameplay which exacerbates the issue.
---
There are hunters that put out some pretty competitive numbers on "undocumented" servers and their logs are impressive but even with these players who push the class to the absolute limit it the rogues and warriors still run the show.
---
The trade off is supposed to be the utility you bring, most vital of which is tranq shot, and in addition to that a whole host of other options not related to DPS such as traps or kiting.
---
I was a frost dk main for years, and hadn't touched blood during warlords. Group knew I was only comfortable doing dps at the time since i hadn't played blood like at all that expansion, and didnt have very good blood gear. They still made me tank and then mocked how squishy I was. 
---
Man, i was a fresh 100 who didnt want to fucking tank.
---
The funniest part of this is assuming a decent amount of people will complete Naxx
---
Alliance not resubing for vanilla haha
---
It’s definitely there. Our crappy computers probably just didn’t render it back then lol
---
Yikes. Oof. Cringe.
---
Retail is about hitting level cap so you can play the game.
---
Vanilla is about leveling and the journey is the game, many who are coming back are coming back for that reason! levle 60 content is the end-game. Not the game.
---
Sounds good. Works in any layering style too!
---
Second question more related to your system: How do you handle the Gurubashi Arena? Is there a chest per cadre? If a level 55 gets it, does it disappear in all the lower layers they're merged with? Only their source layers? 
---
What about a level 45? Does it disappear for them if a 45 in a different cadre invisible to them gets it? What happens if there's a 55 in the same area and the 45 that got it wasn't in the same source cadre as the 55?
---
It's a bigger problem than just the arena too. Nodes in general would be wonky with the cadre system, imo.
---
In vanilla I didn't eat because I forgot to and lost 60lbs. I may have died if I didn't have the extra weight to lose O_O
---
Buffing frostbolt is not a QoL like giving hunters 3   more stable slots. 
---
I see your point, but I do not fully agree. IMHO one year after the launch Blizz should think about some small QoL.
---
I understand that. I'm saying that Perception is not permanent. In order to make use of Perception in a duel, you have to activate it as the duel starts and then enter stealth. Any Rogue/Druid who knows what he is doing is just going to stay far away and wait 20 seconds for Perception to wear off before getting close to you because they know that you have the stealth advantage while it's active.
---
200 Thrall bucks says half the people here will download add-ons for all types of stuff on classic.
---
Oh my God, I've never seen that dollar/face combo before and it is amazing
---
All I said was that I couldn't handle not being able to attack someone in my farming area. That's a big deal for me and how I play the game.
---
Sure you can turn on PvP and wait for someone to attack you but thats just boring and lacks any sense of engagement, also what's the point? What advantage do you get by doing that aside from your own enjoyment?
---
On PvP servers everything has more value because there's a certain level of risk associated with doing anything in the world. If I stop another player from farming certain items or resources I actually feel like I'm inhibiting that player from progression and their rewards, thus gaining an advantage over them.
---
On a PvE server I'm passively getting inhibited on progression and rewards when someone's in my area and I can't do anything about it. It feels bad.
---
Honestly though, I've been thinking about forming a guild basically focusing on 5-mans with occasional raiding simply because I no longer have the time to dedicate to raiding.
---
Still, I want to play with people who at least try to be as good as possible, basically having the raider mentality of min/maxing but without the massive requirements weekly raiding have.  
---
Basically a guild for adults who still take the game seriously but due to real life constraints no longer can be hardcore raiders. 
---
I think such a guild could be fun and suit quite a few people nowadays.
---
Getting all the ranks for your pet's abilities. It gets a bit tedious. 
---
Also food and ammo, you're bound forget it at least once.
---
I'm never going to get over how hilarious it is that all five of the Heroes actually survived.
---
On top of that four of the five people who wrote the epitaphs on the statues have either died, or become undead.
---
I played hunter on undisclosed private server.
---
MC you are a god, up there with the best of them in dps. Everyone doesn't have enough hit, and you get 3% from talents and only need 8% to cap. You can hit 550dps in full T1 since boss fights are so short and many have adds to multishot.
---
BWL you get your biggest spike with T2 and Chrommagus Xbow, but warriors, rogues, and geared mages/locks are now gunning for top spot as they have found hit, crit and spellpower/AP. With ZG trinket though, you have more burst than a POM-pyro mage at the beginning of fights. Double multishotting groups of clothies to the tune of 2-3HKs never gets old. You'll do 650dps here, warriors 900, rogues 800, mage 700ish. Forgot what warlocks were doing, but probably similar or better than mage since they are still Frost at this point.
---
AQ you fall off as there are no real upgrades for you there besides your BiS trinkets, which of course melee classes (higher dps than you) are all eyeing as well. Other classes, like warlocks and dagger rogue, find half their BiS in AQ40 while you are stuck whining to your guild lead to grab a Badge or Jom Gabbar for your collection as warriors, rogues, warlocks, and mages all do 900++ dps while you max out around 700. 
---
Naxx is dependant on whether you get KT down. You can get your BIS weapon in the game with KT xbow. I never had it drop (we only killed KT twice before guild fell apart). T3 is kinda okay for wPvP but if your raid has 3 hunters you might as well sit in T2 because the debuff is so good.  Your loot council knows this and you will be the last to get tier and dps items since all you bring is utility. I won belt/hands/boots tier and NOTHING else for months of Naxx raiding. You max out at 900dps here. Warriors are about 1600, rogue 1400+(TF?), locks 1300, mages 1200 (except the guy who rolls the ignite, he will top dps but it's technically not 'his' damage). A guild with 3 locks and a Shadow priest might see locks pull ahead of non-TF rogues but nothing beats a warrior.
---
This dps also assumes you are weaving melees into your rotation, which isn't possible to do for alot of fights. Bottom line, you'll beat ret paladins, but are scary in PvP and have a high skill ceiling and bring needed utility to raid.
---
Perhaps, depending on how they implement it. But I'm talking about each server being 100% isolated from the next, so you can't go layer hopping, talk to people in different layers, or share an economy with other layers.
---
Imma change the name
---
it's the marches - as in frontier region - to be fair though dragonkin would still fit pretty well
---
Ragnaros mechanics aren't at the same level as Kil'jaeden
---
In Wrath mechanics were harder but threat for example doesn't really matter anymore
---
dont listen to the guy above you, some people think that the only way of being good is playing 8 hours a day, this is simple false.
---
Labor day weekend? If you are American and don't take off launch week - good for you.
---
* Content stayed relevant for a long time because it dropped relevant reagents (leg enchant books, pristine black diamonds, righteous orb) and wasn't trivialized by the very gear it dropped (gear much rarer and ilvl discrepancy much much smaller)
---
* The world was dangerous, which made succeeding in it a reward in itself. Mobs hit so hard that many classes couldn't take on more than one and the lack of flying made it so you couldn't just skip past all the danger.
---
* The lack of cross server groups, server transfers, name changes (etc) coupled with the large amounts of time leveling to maxlevel took made people behave out of fear from being no longer taken along. Your char mattered and so did all the other people on your server. 
---
* Dungeons were organic places and not just loot tubes (in fact the same goes for the world. We went from an organic world to a themepark gameworld)
---
* Loot was much more scarce, making it a really joyous moment when you got an upgrade
---
* No group finder mechanics, increasing the importance of long lasting friendships and a good reputation to speed up group searches
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
What took away from the game?
---
All systems that impacted social behaviour. Servertrans (implemented towards the end of classic) made it so that if you ruin your reputation, you can easily start being a prick on a new server. Crossrealm made it so you don't need to care about others (Dungeon Finder especially) anymore and the automated group finder systems made it no longer required to build any social bonds. In a handful of changes all the systems that lead to me making dozens of friends were gone.
---
Gear inflation (the huge ilvl jumps between raid tiers and the huge amount of items that drop) trivializes 'old' content (tanks can solo heroic dungeons in heroic dungeon gear) to the point that anything that isn't freshly released is a waste of time both in terms of fun as well as rewards.
---
Streamlining of systems like class homogenization, items and layouts of dungeons and the world and quest lines so that everything is a nice and straight theme park ride where you cannot get lost or don't really have to do anything than following the arrows on your mini map.
---
Also I hate the whole "You are the General Marshal World Leader Dragon Slayer revered Master of Stormwind Hero!" narrative. It's so fucking cringy and terribly written. I've never seen any of the big lore heroes address each other like this shit but somehow when XxXSlayerxXx they start gushing praise.
---
Can't tell if serious or kidding... and that terrifies me.
---
Just because you don't know what I'm talking about it doesn't mean I'm lying.
---
&gt; You're not gonna "play the AH".
---
That's exactly what I'm going to do. It's how I've made gold since Vanilla, I'm not going to change it for Classic.
---
But, you know, feel free to not believe me and farm inefficiently.
---
all the patch notes are public. Except the strat-scholo revamp were they enforced the 5 man rule ( and slowed down the respawn rate to compensate for it), could you point out those major change that nerfed the game?
---
cause I remember being a clicker, keyboard-turning shadowpriest who managed to heal 5-man just fine despite the tank being a 2-handed arms warrior, sucky DPS, using fear instead of fade, spreading SW:pain to contribute to DPS...
---
You understimate how friggin terrible people were back in 2004. classic was never hard... time consuming? maybe. hard ? no.
---
I'm losing my marbles, sure, but there's no way I'd forget that. I just got confused and forgot that you no longer had to be rank 14 to buy all the gear.
---
I’m talking about the game as a whole. Not just raids.
---
#SubvertExpectations
---
Oh wait, this isn’t Game of Thrones.
---
Good luck
---
Limited bag space, but that's an issue with Warlocks as well due to soul shards.
---
&gt;Classic is not difficult, but it will punish you IF YOU DO A MISTAKE...unlike retail, where 5 bad players can clear any dungeon without a wipe.
---
you haven't pushed M+ very far, did you?
---
I'd say Alliance holds the greatest importance lore wise. 
---
The Dark Iron dwarves are the foundation of why Molten Core came to be because they summoned Ragnaros (Alliance). 
---
Onyxia storyline is far superior with Alliance. 
---
Blackwing Lair is kind of an extension of Molten Core in Blackrock Mountain. 
---
The storyline of AQ is heavily influenced by Fandral Staghelm and the sacrifice of his son (Alliance)
---
Lastly Naxxramas ends with the defeat of the Kel Thuzad, which I believe had some corrupting influence over Arthas while he was Lich King.
---
So yeah everything really centers around characters of the Alliance.
---
I feel the novelty of only allowing one xpac at a time in order would be stronger than having all of them available at once.
---
If solely or entirely for Classic, they Ryzen APUs could also do a very good job for the price.
---
Me me me me me!
---
Oh, you know, Steve, Bob, Thrall, XGANKMASTERX, Cairne, and Terry.  The bois.
---
Lfr
---
Are shamans popular in vanilla? I know Druid is the least played class, but how is shaman?
---
I've been watching a lot of Hunter streams of the beta, and it doesn't seem to be that big of a deal. I think the pet bugs are going to be more annoying.
---
By default its alt, alt+ healing spell will automaticly heal yourself.
---
Nornal heal while targeting an emeny will say "invalid target" iirc.
---
What the actual f are you serious? Are you sure you dont just want to play retail lel
---
As soon as they started calling player characters “hero” and “champion” and getting meetings with faction leaders we were doomed.
---
Cringewind.
---
&gt;private servers
---
&gt;sharding
---
What kinda crack you smoking haha
---
Best of luck to you, my man. My op went smoothly, afterwards wasn’t the best, though. Hope you recover quickly!
---
Yep and those lvl 25 drones also get 1 shot by ambush, even the lookouts and other mobs higher on the tower are super weak to rupture and eviscerate.
---
I dunno most people spend more time than that watching TV each day so its probably fairly casual, you're just doing vidya instead of TV :P
---
Then they either institute queue times, increase the server population cap, offer free or reduced transfers off overpopulated servers or some combination of these. Layering can go away without the game becoming underpopulated while still being a solution to concentrated surge populations.
---
Pets are normalized. No Takk the Leaper running mounted people down. Lupos doesn't deal shadow damage. But certain creatures have higher attack speed like 1.0 Broken Tooth vs the next highest Starving Mountain Lion at 1.2 for cats. This lets it keep Frenzy talent up earlier, and (this is a theory of mine) utilize attack power buffs more effectively than slower atkspd pets.
---
I can't wait to 
---
&gt;get ganked in Stranlethorn Vale
---
I want to get 60 as fast as possible within reason. I enjoy PvP more than anything but even I plan on avoiding STV while leveling, too much time wasted in fights. Fun fights, but I can always do that on an alt. I want to be ahead of the curve so that my Warrior can actually do something in PvP at 60.
---
Eviscerate scales with ap
---
Don't listen to the haters. It's a role playing game. Every class is essential. If you play Hunter, you just need to be better than the other Hunters.
---
Learned a new word- thanks!
---
Vanilla WoW is still the only mmo I've ever played where it felt like a living world to me. The fact that I could walk from one part of the continent to another and never have to go through a loading screen. The fact that you'd be going along the coastline just to explore and find a little hut that served no purpose. The fact that sometimes there was a huge body of water or mountain right in the way of where you wanted/needed to go. Things like that last one could be annoying at times, but that's what happens in a world - mountains and deserts get in the way.
---
That's precisely why I wrote "seemingly insignificant". It'd be a big change for hunters, but for many it wouldn't seem so.
---
I like the limited slots, having a plethora of pets to choose from feels more boring to me.
---
Rogue. You can kill people naked with just good weapons lol
---
I have/had the opposite problem. I was addicted in high school and my grades were not good. My mom and dad hated the game as well, hard to get the subscription from them and even so far as my mom blocking the ports on the router. Still figured how to get past it and got smart with computer stuff. Fast forward I’m in my mid 20s, traveling and working but still have time for it and the fiancé loves the game and were excited to play. 
---
Take things in moderation. Even WoW!
---
I dont know much about paladins so i didnt creat a set for them but i made a template if someone wants to make his / her own :D I also didnt change the stats, i was focused on set bonuses
---
argumentum ad hominem?
---
In tie with druid.
---
&gt; if you get multiple enemies on you you'll most likely get ripped apart
---
this is true for hunters as well. Hunters are amazing at being evasive and blowing people up from range, but much like a mage if you can double-team them they still evaporate.  A hunter should beat a mage 1v1 but both of them fill a very similar niche in pvp, with a very similar weakness.
---
Can anyone confirm whether leeway mechanics were ever supposed to work on mobs? Because I thought it was merely a player vs player mechanic.
---
You stank of /r/iamverysmart
---
You know that just because someone's in an area before you, they don't automatically claim all mobs and resources, right?
---
You kill them, you farm. They kill you, they farm. In the end, it's the same result: Both of you farm approximately 50% of the available mobs and resources.
---
Also, you wPvP enthusiasts are so keen on pointing out that if someone kills you, you just ask for some people in the zone to come over and fight them. That's not even close to "the dominating player wins the area", that just means an all-out brawl occurs and nobody gets to farm anything.
---
And just because I feel like it, let's go through your points at the end.
---
Competition? That's a given even on a PvE server. You compete with the other guy in the area over who can kill mobs faster, tag more mobs and claim more nodes. That's dictated by your skill and gear level. If you want to farm efficiently, better not be a scrub, if you're slow, you don't get to farm.
---
Increased value? How so, exactly? It's still the same amount of mobs and nodes spawned, split between the hypothetical 2 people in the area. I mean, do you also bitch and moan if there's someone of your own faction farming the same spot? You're probably one of those people who start flaming them and bitching about this being your spot.
---
Increased player interaction? Debatable. Sure, if you only count PvP as interaction. Emotes, interference in pulls etc. is still interaction, and believe me when I say that you'll develop a healthy dislike for the opposing faction and remember your adversaries name whether you fight him or you just annoy each other the whole time. Sometimes, you even make friends with the opposing player, if you can even fathom that.
---
In retail the player is seen as a major lore figure who's done a variety of things to help the world(s) over the years such as the downfall of the Lich King, jailing Sargeras with the artifacts that we gained the power to wield. 
---
It's hard to easily convey that in an MMO that you personally are a focal point, but we're always the 'champion' that Sylvanas has requested etc.
---
It's also a matter of time, being a lowly adventurer after 15 years wouldn't be great especially if 'we' technically participated in the victories against dire enemies. Simply ignoring the players contributions would feel equally as crappy as everyone being THE champion. It's a catch 22 situation really.
---
So many great ideas such little land to work with!
---
Yeah, nowadays it is like this. Because of the modifier I told, located in the interface menu. I want to know if there is this option on Classic Beta, to be more specific.
---
On pservers using the 1.12.1 version, there is no such option.
---
the bulk of my experience is 2.0 to 3.3 live, however.  My impressions on this date from then.
---
One mob in particular was a duskwing (bat) in EPL - it barely seemed able to catch up to fleeing players.
---
Nope. No equivalent either.
---
I don't mind. I recall being excited to get my Alterac Valley Frostwolf around my mid-50s. The Alliance Frost Ram looks pretty awesome too.
---
You cant drop traps while in combat in vanilla.  So you need to FD in order to drop out of combat for a second to drop the trap.
---
Being in a party and seeing it drop I think is still the "rarest" thing I ever witnessed in the decade I played WoW.  Was playing on Spirestone and some guy named Finesse got it.  Weird that I can still remember that....
---
I hope so, too! I really don't want to go down the same route ... classic should stay within the original continents as much as possible
---
I want to point out though that the game will ship as version 1.13 so any new content would probably be at least 1.14
---
The only reliable resource you can turn into gold is time. IF you have a ton of resources (meaning time AND gold), you MIGHT be able to set yourself up in a niche market and EVENTUALLY reduce the amount of resources you put it and increase the amount you get out.
---
Some rando who can barely raid log and won't be 60 for 8 months isn't going to do that. That's a fact. I don't know if you're retarded or if you're just lying for no reason, but either way, I'm bored with you now. Good luck "playing the AH" when classic goes live.
---
I see you're speed running
---
&gt;On PvP servers everything has more value because there's a certain level of risk associated with doing anything in the world.
---
You also have things like the devilsaurs mafia which can destroy the entire economy of a server for an extended period of time after release. So it's not as simple as saying "everything has more value"
---
&gt;On a PvE server I'm passively getting inhibited on progression and rewards when someone's in my area and I can't do anything about it. It feels bad.
---
You think that never happens on PvP servers? It happens worse. That's exactly how the devilsaur mafia functions. You can't do anything about them other than temporarily. Even if you round up 20 people and kill them, they play more than you. They eventually take it back and you're right back to being able to do **nothing**
---
Literally nothing too, instead of competing for the tag/skin.
---
Hi,
---
Ive updated this now - it should show correctly regardless of timezone :)
---
abar
---
and get the weapon crate beneath the waterfall near ratchet
---
Holiday Inn Express you say! That's enough for me, you're hired!
---
You just said you're not even sure if it breaks stealth now you're typing paragraphs based on that hypothetical...
---
Sorry dude, you're just the type of guy who argues for the sake of arguing.
---
 What are you talking about? you literally said "Arena is what helped WoW grow to where it is today"
---
Wow today is shit and is in massive decline, so you're saying it Arena helped ruin the game right?
---
I’m going on Paternity leave! I’ll be holding that baby tight and rocking her back and forth while I grind my enemies to dust in Arathi Basin!
---
Oh shit, well that's good to know.
---
Does shadowmeld take you OOC?
---
Don’t forget old noobmaster69
---
Exactly this. That's why i referred to classic specifically.
---
Mechanic wise it's easy. Rotation wise it's easy.
---
The problems back then were:
---
* Gear
---
* Roster issues
---
* General lack of knowledge / optimized builds / lack of raiding mentality
---
There's still a possibility it will be in phase 1. As far as I know we havn't heard anything specific about items like these and it's somewhat likely that Blizzard just lumps them in with the rest of MC/Ony.
---
I do think p2 is the most probable though.
---
This is incorrect. [Math done here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/byrkth/reputation_farming_through_levelling_for_other/eqkssan/?context=3)
---
Goo look at yourself in the mirror and read your comments out loud.
---
Is it sad....i already did 🤣😂
---
&gt; The only reliable resource you can turn into gold is time.
---
you're vastly underestimating knowledge.
---
Asthetic is probably going to nelf female. ESPECIALLY if you're rolling on a pvp server. Sitting in STV stealthed with your cat is amazing. Being able to stealth and get an opening Aimed+Multi defending a flag in a bg (or any open world situation) is amazing. Being able to feign + shadowmeld and literally drop off the screen like a rogue is amazing.
---
Or you can be a dwarf, have a little better gameplay vs. rogues and a free 3% hit rating while leveling with guns, and for the first phase of raiding as BiS becomes Dwarven Hand Cannon (BOE). This is the only time Dwarf matters in PvE as all other tiers are  crossbow BiS.
---
try talking about it in discord its worse than the blizzard forums. The nitro discord users are trolls and the mods will just delete anything you say about layering.
---
Pro Tip: Don't have kids in the first place and play video games as much as you want for the rest of your life.
---
Pro-tip. Ask to be put under. They can do that now.
---
Acquire literacy.
---
Who cares. You chose you profession, your job, your responsibilities. Play what you can and enjoy it or just dont play. I'm sick of these posts constantly like people have no control over their lives...like life was forced on them. How will you find the time!?
---
I'm 36, principal software dev, debt free, no kids (parents had 4, learned from their mistake of no savings and debt still &lt; 10 years from retirement), no house only because I dont want to deal with the upkeep time right now. Outside of 40-50 hrs of work I do whatever because I made choices to allow me to do so.
---
Want to deal with whining kids, I have 2 nieces and a nephew 20 mins away. Want to go to dinner, a movie, a show...anytime I want. Vacation, sure. Oh I work fulltime remote as well, so I could just take a month and go anywhere with internet while continuing to work. Oh and I'll fit classic in there a bit I'm sure.
---
I feel so bad for you,   
---
You are totally right in pretty much everything you said and the fanboys just wouldn't listen. All we can do now is pray they don't fuck this up. They don't realize that the competitive mindset of Vanilla players will force them to abuse systems like this to stay competitive.
---
why would that be confusing to her lol
---
That’s good to hear! Any streams you’d recommend that show hunter PvP in beta?
---
I think you underestimate the casuals. Private servers have been around for years and they don't need to progress.
---
If I get to 60, knock out some Molten Core, then stop playing for a year or two, I want to come back and pick up where I left off. This has been impossible since the game came out. I logged in and remember being on an airship heading towards the Broken Isles one summer. I thought to myself: "This isn't WoW anymore." and that was when I knew I would never return.
---
I just want Wind Fury Procs with my "ARCANITE REEEAPPPEERRRRR". That is what I look forward to.
---
No better introduction to wow than a venture across the world to come level with you
---
Bro. Yall must not have beta, I get in so much cleaning while Auto running my 1 quest back and forth along Dusk wood between Ravenhill. Get to the road, auto run, change a diaper, turn my toon back to the road, pick up toys, and finally get there.
---
Oh it was there in Vanilla, I'm saying the math could be wrong when you put deadzones back in. The grace was more than likely extended by a few yards after the change and is now applying to the original formula, extending the range.
---
We've seen comparisons between Vanilla videos in 2006 and Classic and there is a difference.
---
I definitely remember getting smacked while running away without being directly next to the mob, but from the looks of some Classic videos it seems like there is extra distance.
---
Right now I'm of the mind Blizz doesn't have all the data or if they do, they still need to comb through code to make sure numbers passes are correctly being calculated and not being funneled by 8.x client methods/functions which can easily result in this distance change.
---
Yeah it’s possible, but as there was a blue post in which it was stated that items that were added in later patches will be added in later phases, I would be extremely surprised if the majordomo loot was included at launch rather than added in p2/p3.
---
AcQuIrE lItErAcY
---
Meet you at level 10!

Because i don't want to buff 40 people every 5 minutes.....also wind fury totem....also
---
Shaman&gt;paladin
---
Horde&gt;alliance
---
You are wrong.
---
sounds like you're playing an elf
---
What am I missing?
---
This is my biggest concern too. I couldn't give two fucks if a quest event has slightly wrong text formatting - but layer hopping for high end resources is shit.
---
Dude 100% send that's how i ended up in the military. Skipped classes for wow, failed out of enough to fail me out of college then joined the military.
---
Sounds like you are very okay with working so much but I'm working on my MBA right now and one of my peers is an Attorney at F500 company nearby.  We were both talking about work/life balance and she said its pretty normal 45-50 hour weeks usually for her team.  She's paid well and obviously has enough time to work on her MBA as well.  They are also paying it in full and she leaves at 4:30 on days with class to get there on time for a 530/6 class start.  
---
I would say it's possible to do both but obviously a  sample size of one doesn't mean much :)
---
Oh my god yes! My gf started two weeks ago and is loving it - I’m trying to back seat game as little as possible but eventually I broke and told her to take auto attack off her action bar (level 13 warlock). 
---
It’s a blast though, and such a blessing. She already despises murloc camps. I hope you two have a kick ass time
---
There's multiple ways of seeing this. I was young too, and I am an adult with responsibilities. Plus, I have worked really hard to be able to go back to school in Level Design next year, which I really want to focus on. So ofcourse I am afraid about time management too.
---
Although, when I was young, I remember that it took about 2-3 weeks to get mid 20s. The journey to max level was a long and fun one. Full of challenges, great exploration/adventures and mostly, a lot of fun with my friends creating memories forever. And even if I am an adult now with less time... I must admit that my fears are the opposite of you. I am afraid that it will take a lot less time to reach max level. I am afraid that this epic journey will not take months like before. I want it to take time. So don't see it as a bad thing. See it that you can enjoy a good thing in moderation and be hyped for months, rather than rushing to the end.
---
Vanilla wow was meant to be a casual-friendly, solo-friendly alternative to the other MMO on the market at the time ( EQ, DAoC, shadowbane, UO...)
---
you might think the social aspect in vanilla is important... but compared to the games that came before it, it was a joke.
---
As for retail wow ; they've expanded to cater to more type of player. the world quest / LFR  is tuned for the most casual baddies of casual baddies while mythic raiding and M+ pushing offer a challenge that make everything classic has to offer look trivial.
---
She thought that since we are both playing from the same realm we would be in the same starting location, so I explained that races begin in different zones... she said, and I quote, “well that really doesn’t make much sense.”
---
2 hours is really slow atleast on private servers, our mainruns did them in 30~ min average and altruns with socials ran by us around 40-50min.
---
Thanks :)
---
technically it's possible, one of you will be waiting a little while though
---
http://lyberty.com/wow/locations/travel1.html
---
Are you the owner of this site? Are there any plans to sort mods based on categories by any chance? Maybe after launch a sort method of most downloaded/popular?
---
Hey, whats that tom cruise movie with morgan freeman?
---
Feeding is based on pet loyalty , and quality of say meat, my pet is loyalty 2 and hardly ever eats.
---
Thanks, I'm planning on that.  I don't want to be awake while that is happening.
---
This is my problem with the internet nowadays after the advent of /s to know when someone is joking. It's 100% obvious to that this person is completely serious and I'm surprised no one else can tell.
---
Ive leveld a fair few pets on private servers. I just spam them with the least expensive type of food they will eat. Initially you have to feed them very often but that drops off as they gain loyalty I found.
---
There is a pet window. Tab next to your own when it is summoned. No way of checking stabled pets without getting them out.
---
You're responsible for like a quarter of the pulls in AQ. That was soooo fun (not).
---
Since we will be using a modern client I think the option for auto self cast should be there.
---
Any beta player want to confirm?
---
If not you can always make a modifier macro
---
I have, but the idea of not moving at all to be stealthed is very bad imo. On a decent CD also
---
Just drag your PC into the bathroom.
---
Would we be thinking differently if the hunter was credited for all the DPS gains from trueshot?  Kind of a moot point, but just an example of the utility probably being overlooked some.  Idk if I can play on a schedule required to raid with 40 people anyway.  Seems like a tall order with a full time job and a gf.
---
Pro Tip:  have offspring and teach them how to farm gold for mounts.
---
They are good hunters too. Ranged weapon skill modifiers are not as big a deal as melee ones.
---
Some of them are quite decent actually, especially the druid set bonuses! :) However, I think in general the set bonuses have a bit too much of a "modern wow-ish" touch to them.
---
Hmmm that hunter 8 piece really changes the pvp meta. Gimme!
---
Try out Zeroed. He is good at the class and is usually up to something interesting like kiting dragons to SW or trying to clear instances that are 10 levels higher than cap.

Well said.  It's my personal opinion that the worries you have are enough to warrant a different solution.  I personally thing think the answer ought to be marking a server as "full" and throwing a queue on there, and leaving other servers unmarked until they reach that point, but overall letting chaos reign.  I mean let's look at kind of the worst case scenario- you have 5k people all logging on in low level zones.  You have probably 1k people in Northshire.  So.  Fucking.  What.  Yes it's going to be crazy. But... you'll have people grouping up.  Dueling.  Socializing.  Leaving to quest other places.  Forming raids to kill Hogger.  All the shit you should *want* them to do.  Hell, now I'm going to be disappointed if there aren't 300 level 1s trying to kill Hogger at launch.
---
best of luck to you both
---
You better have a VERY comfortable chair.
---
Releasing, and renewing Judgements is a waste of mana for the most part. That said, in the beta I have almost the full Scarlet Mail set, and I feel damn near unkillable. Gotta save that mana for self heals when Im killing 4 things at once. (slowly but at once)
---
He obviously isn't serious. He continues the joke from the previous poster about a Cataclysm. Because the things he mentioned were exactly what happened when - can you guess it? - Cataclysm dropped.

&gt; Sadly for classic I will not play shaman it has been impossible to get my friends to roll hord this time sins they want to focus on pve rather then pvp. So this time it is a paladins life for me. Let's hope for bc right. And always in my heart FOR THE HORD!
---
It sounds like you need new friends!
---
&gt;So I could take ToEP (talisman of ephemeral power) and shoot lightning bolts  
---
&gt;Well, shit. Guess I'm going alliance.  
---
Really I loved shaman cause of the tauren in the cinematic Trailer for wow letting magic dust flow in the wind with his shamanistic headdress on.
---
That's exactly how I looked, but tauren
---
I've been mostly watching Zeroed recently. He really shows how Hunter can shine in wPvP and BGs.
---
the only reason why people rush down BM is to get bestial wrath for pvp. For farming that timer is completely irrelevant on a grinding setup (and as much as you can call it questing - in classic it boils down to go grind X mobs 99% of the time)
---
Especially for new hunters or people who feel a bit rusty my recommendation stays with AiS at 20. 
---
Learn the spec the way you will play it on 60. Don't spend 3+days learning to play the class in a way that will become trivial just to toss it all away and to relearn the basics at 51
---
Last but not least. AiS at 20 gives you an additional weapon dmg based hit even if you stay out in the fields for 10+ level intervals without visiting trainers or if you just use the rank1 to keep it mana efficient while leveling
---
Retail is taking the approach of RTS games with story telling.  
---
If you're vanilla baby you probably won't appreciate it.
---
Hi! I’ve never played classic but I’m playing retail for the first time, my hunter is lvl 55. In classic is there the same first tier skill ability that allows you to have two pets out at once (one comes from your first stable master slot)? And in retail (once max level) you can call up to 5 different pets without going back to a stable master, how many call pet slots will you have in classic?
---
i'm just taking the week off
---
doesn't getting the snip mean you shoot really unsatisfactory loads?  it sounds horrible!
---
&gt; I played a shaman at a fairly high level in Everquest. Backup healer, debuffer/buffer, able to solo content, kind of a jack of all trades back then. Not many classes could solo the lesser named dragons in Western Wastes reliably, but with your Epic done, you certainly could on a Shaman. It was always fun seeing what I could solo there...
---
Lets not kid ourselves here.  The main reason you played Shaman in EQ was SoW.
---
Some of your BiS is based on professions. If I want to be a mage without tailoring, what are my options for pre-raid?
---
Why not keep one for gold farming?
---
I haven't had my pet dying too often, so it didn't feel like a good investment, considering the alternative is getting 5% crit which usually does something every fight.
---
Can you please relax and stop acting like this post was a complaint? 😂 So negative...
---
You’re so cool! You hate hunters how funny and edgy
---
uh, what
---
C O N T E X T
---
That little fishing pool is near the rogue trainer too. 
---
I always kinda thought it would be cool if the class trainer in the other faction was yellow and not red. You COULD attack them, but they wouldn't be hostile to you simply due to the same class. Like an honor bond. 
---
Like the Order of the White Lotus in Avatar the Last Airbender.
---
Haha. Man, I don't miss getting nuked by Pyroblasts
---
As long as it can take care of itself
---
Oh I was going to do the opposite. Lose as much weight as possible now, so when I no life I will fit the clothes I am currently in.
---
hahahaha
---
dude
---
That is me 100%
---
Ehh, I suppose. Though real shaman have been using DMT for centuries or more down there. Not just hyping their podcast.
---
Yea, some of them are either talents, glyphs or old set bonuses from other expansions or some sort of modification of them, its actually kinda hard to come up with something intresting without just creating new abilities :D
---
Is that walk ability in retail?
---
I think one aspect that poeple overlook is that the zones in vanilla are not as sensory overload like they are in retail. The condensed zones in BFA and Legion feel like there is too much shit everywhere like rocks, trees, buildings, and npcs(colors are too bright as well, random glowy stuff). Vanilla’s zone are spread out nicely. There is room to breath and feel like your chracter is a part of the world. 
---
Also on the npc note the amount of mobs are insane.
---
In dungeons you mostly look at nameplates, every class has a pet that can be summoned adding more nameplates. Overall just too many nameplates in retail.
---
It looks both warm and cold at the same time. It is a wonderful piece of artwork.
---
Yes :) it started to change in patch 2.3 then during WOTLK. After that i could leveling while taking multiple monsters at the same time.
---
For real.
---
You're 100% wrong, my dude. Shamans are a very popular class. They are only available to horde, so you have to double their numbers to compare them to other classes in polls. They are one of, if not the single most popular class on horde. Not a problem though, because they also take up a disproportionate amount of raid spots compared to other classes.
---
Right there with you.
---
I’d disagree wholeheartedly. You clarified your comment below, but I think it’s more than just raids. The game still *felt* very similar, but I’d say questing was almost easier because classes had at least a few more tools at their disposal to handle tough moments. 
---
Meanwhile, I’d say group content was much harder. Remember those 5-man ogre quest chain around Blades edge? Or the ring of blood? Those both got pretty insane towards the end, even compared to something like Jintha’alor.
---
And dungeons got harder, too. Maybe normal modes were either on par or only slightly harder than Vanilla, but it’s hard to dispute Heroics being harder than Vanilla dungeons. 
---
Then raiding... not only were the bosses twice as hard as Vanilla’s, in terms of both mechanics and numbers, but the non-raid portion was harder too... the attunements. Now, I love a good attunement questline, but BC kind of took it too far. Either way, the attunements took you around the whole planet, in dungeons, towns, and secret areas, like Vanilla on steroids (which should be BC’s slogan).
---
Funny how the Horde were the first ones in Vanilla to destroy the biggest and baddest bosses :s
---
It baffles me when people say stuff like this, because often launches are the most fun time of the expansions.  You have people competing, grouping, exploring, pvping... In part *because of* overpopulation.  Launches became worse as they added sharding, etc, because god forbid players have to *wait* to get the dopamine rush of completing their quest.  Just normal Blizzard LFG-esque thinking.
---
Why they are so scary for dueling.
---
Just garbage memes as usual
---
Thats a bit extreme, dont you think?
---
&gt; getting meetings with faction leaders
---
IDK about that. Meeting Thrall to get sent into RFC was a thing in Vanilla. Of course he treated you like a grunt. Which you were.
---
Night elf hunters are BIS for Arathi Basin. So that's one reason other than Druids.
---
I wouldn't go full MM either, just Aimed at 20 and then fill in BM. It does delay your BM tree by quite a bit, but I can't say I've had too many aggro issues.
---

Can they make smaller areas than zones shardable?

Force all layers to merge in the arena?

I remember wackiness with phasing in WOTLK causing mining nodes to disappear right in front of me from a person in a different level of progression in the zone's quest phasing mining it.

I believe it! Paladins seem to be pretty versatile from what I’ve seen. Gotta keep this in mind though, the current level 40 meta we have on the beta will be very different from the level 60 meta
---
Now I realized that but either way.  The marches or the marshes.  Up to you :).
---
Don't listen to the other guy. They are one of the most popular classes to play, but also one of the most desired healers in raids. A resto shaman will never have a difficult time finding a raid spot.
---
It's a good pod.
---
Ranged dps isn't a niche when it comes to pvp lol its just way more effective than melee at group combat
---
I just don’t do podcasts in general.
---
But I do know the Rogan pod to watch regarding this is probably with Graham Hancock.
---
Not listing there , I think, but Joana has often complained about the pet behavior that would be off in classic. I am not sure how exactly but that part seems pretty major as well.
---
One of you might need to do the infamous Wetlands run!
---
lol! I had no idea it was even a thing when I started EQ - but man it was nice once I got it. SoW clicky boots were even better, because I didnt have to cast it.
---
No, there is no skill that allows hunters to have more than one pet out at once. You also cannot swap your pet without visiting a stable master unless you dismiss (get rid of) your current pet and tame a new one.
---
The pet system for hunters is completely different in retail to what it used to be, you should have a look at pet happiness (they need to be fed etc) before you create a Hunter, it will save you some frustration!
---

Just gather and adapt from there.  When you are around 50 you can check the AH and get an idea of what prof you want to make money on, or keep gathering to always make money as long as you log in to play and farm.

That’s fine. I’m talking about how in later expansions they summon for you by name and you’re present during discussions you have no business being involved in.

“What’s the highest level dungeon” would be another way to word the question op was asking. Instead of highest he said max, which in this context definitely mean the same thing, but still makes for a convoluted sentence.

Actually best warrior tank is humans bar none, trolls make a close second. NE warrior tanks actually aren’t that great specifically because if you dodge you don’t generate rage and if you don’t generate rage you can’t gain aggro. Warrior tanking in Vanilla is a bit different.
---
Take your dwarf to teldrassil and level together, I think its possible to jump down from the mountains to ress at menethil harbor, take the boat to darkshore, then darnassus. Should not take more than 15 minutes. The only problem is when you want to play dwarf paladin, since there are no paladin quests and trainers in teldrassil.
---
Simple solution here that gets you bonus husband points: Let her roll NE while you roll Dwarf and play The Proclaimers "I'm Gonna Be" on loop while you make the cross world journey to Teldrassil.

You are getting new content. You get to raid the early instances with 1.12 talents. You get updated graphics and UI. Updated mods and macros. Updated raid frames. The list goes on and on.

---
Commenting before this gets deleted :/
---
We have to compromise. It worked with Loot trading, it can work with layering
---
So what does Blizzard want to get out of layering? They want to make the game “playable” and have a population size that works, in the short term, and for the long term health of the game. So we really can’t expect a launch like Vanilla’s, that’s not in Blizzards best interests.
---
But if they layer the first few zones (kind of like how they said they’d use sharding), maybe the 1-25 zones, before WPVP opens up, and leave the rest of the game untampered, that would appease most people. The initial Zerg rush is handled, while the later areas are one contiguous proper world of Warcraft. 
---
Sure, it would be difficult to do some quests at level 30, when there’s no layering, but to get to that point, that means you’ve already spent a good 20-40 hours on one game, in a matter of 1-2 weeks. You can’t go that hard and expect the game to be tailored to you. 
---
Combine that method with, perhaps, a server queue (anywhere from 10 mins to 1 hour) to keep populations controlled, and I would be a happy camper. I just hate that we went from being told, in certain terms, *THERE WILL BE NO SHARDING AFTER STARTING ZONES* to something along the lines of “There will be layering for the entire 1-60 experience”... and then, in the same bold-text certainty, they say *IT WILL ONLY LAST A FEW WEEKS*.
---
Chromie is now best girl.
---
I could need a list aswell.
---
I never played Wow and it's going to be my first time. I could really use some QoL addons which will help my first adventure
---
Honestly I don't see why the twitch list wont do the job you need.
---
Also I think when I read joannas speedleveling guide, the best way to level from 10 to 15 is in darkshore, then 15-20 in loch modan, so you can meet at level 10 in darkshore if you decide to play separately at first
---
This is why I've settled on Hunter. In addition to all of the solo play you listed above you also get to go pet hunting/collecting

While it's not your typical lore video, it will get anyone excited to play WoW and get a sense of the epic nature of the lore.

Stealth outside of an instance or at a choke point to gank, hunter can stealth with a stealth pet, stealth in AB to defend a flag. I mean you just have to be creative it’s not “very bad” imo.

how is layering the cheap way? wouldn't the cheap way be them not doing anything about early stage overpopulation and let the players deal with it? putting the time and effort into improving all the bugs around layering seems to be the most time consuming/expensive

---
one of them needs to go, ditch the gf.
---
They are still going to use layering, but they've clearly been testing it the last few days. We should at least give them time to test it and get feedback before freaking out.
---
I dont think Shadowmeld is usable in combat during vanilla either, so you wouldnt be able to use it similar to FD.  But you *might* be able to run around a corner or out of sight and FD then Shadowmeld to trick opponents in PvP.
---
Dude! Where can i get one?

---
Good one!
---
Hmm. It looks like Wowhead has different numbers for rep gain compared to Classicdb. That's unfortunate. I did all my math based on Classicdb.
---
They could probably merge all layers in the arena, but while this solves problems coming it may create some going. First, I'm going to assume no layer phasing while in combat for reasons. Now, suppose you use Layer 1 as the nexus, there's simply no chest on the other layers, but the announcement yell applies to all layers. Do people stay on Layer 1 after leaving? Do people return to their layer after exiting the arena complex and being out of combat? Is there an additional timer to allow for chases, or prevent rogue hijinks?
---
None of this solves the node problem though for characters of merged cadre and below
---

I was a 0/30/21 shaman that got to do a bit of everything.

Tanked BRD.  Seriously.  Rockbiter and threat shock FTW.

IMP totems was the ‘instiller of erections’ 
---
NS was so clutch for a quick heal.

It just felt really cool to be able to do some of everything.

Also water walking, Self Rez, ghost wolf, and astral recall.  So many quality of life abilities!!!

I need to stop now or I won’t be able to resist being a shaman this again this time around...
---
Omg Faxmonkey!
---
Pretty sure cata had elemental dps in top 5 for the first season of raids
---
Never said it was "cheap"? I said it was the best way. 
---
Players dealing with overpopulation isn't going to do anything. It just means, as always has happened, people flock to the high pop servers with the streamers or high end players, the other servers will eventually die. No sharding means more servers are required (because it won't be possible to play), which means more dead realms later.
---
&gt; what we know works
---
What do we know works though? This is a rhetorical question because almost any answer you give me some other player will disagree with you. 
---
Vanilla is vanilla. It is a flawed thing that "works" because we collectively agree "this is the way it was, and many of us had fun, so that's enough". Once you start changing things, that's where the ball is likely to drop. 
---
You bashed TBC, but in many respects TBC did more right than vanilla (and the numbers don't lie). You can't really tell me I'm wrong, let's be frank about that one. You can't. So where do you go from there? How do you deal with players who like 40-man raids, while acknowledging that the 25-man raid design is generally regarded as superior in terms of content-design, player retention, and game-feel? Remember, TBC was the vision of the WoW developers who worked on Vanilla as the next step. This is their design - you can't say Vanilla was their perfect vision of the game while acknowledging the fact that it was those same people wanting to take the next step with their game. It was only going into WOTLK and beyond that the core team started to change. 
---
It's a bit of a bind.

No, the ambercorn/wellstones quest is a different chain than the cleanse quest. The stones are for Rite of Vision, while the cleansing is after you kill wolves and plainstriders I believe.

Pet pathing follows BFA rules not Classic rules.  There’s also an intermittent bug where loot appears on a corpse for only a split second then disappears and the corpse becomes unlootable.  There’s way more bugs than OP realizes.

Difficulty in Vanilla wasn't necessarily the bosses -- it was the people.
---
Finding 40+ people you could tolerate and rely on was the biggest barrier to most folks to even start.

From there, try finding 40+ competent people.

Shaman - My favorite role in any mmorpg is medium armor high dps melee. But, I NEVER want to tank. That means, no warrior, no druid, and I just don't like the mechanics of rogue play. So I was drawn to Enhance. Upon learning Enhance is not viable end game I fell in love with Elemental. No pet to worry about. You get to wear mail + shield, and play the best race (Orc). Awesome pvp burst, ability to heal/cure/walk on water, totems people love. It's definitely my class and the only caster I'd play. I don't want to be a pansy caster in robes and cloth (though spriest is fun but again not viable outside of pvp). I know Elemental isn't really either, but you can slap on healing gear and do that job just fine.
---
Dude, do you realize how pissed people would be if they sniped and got their rare name, played on a server for several months building a good reputation then losing it all when the servers merge? 
---
Being forced to name change, change the name of your guild etc because the more common ones are already taken. That's way worse then sharding.

Download the twitch app (curse became twitch) and skim through.  More or less every addon you can think of is in there.  Most with detailed descriptions and what have you.

---
Just wait until the real changes start to happen, they need to hook people again, because they know once players are invested they can do whatever they want.
---
I agree but sharding/Layering and the lack of phasing is another thing that SHOULD NEVER be toyed with. I'd prefer dynamic spawns 100 out of 100 times over layering/sharding.

It's generally best to do when you have ~30+ rage and your instant attacks are on cooldown. If you're specced for improved slam it's a better use of rage than hamstring. If you're fury you'll have flurry up and should be generating a white hit quick enough after the slam.
---
Never been here, looks cool but I'll stick to Orgimmar
---
&gt; Somethings fucky...
---
I thought so too, then I realized that his wife's boyfriend borrowed the money from the wife who took it from him.
---
Why?  You do realize the game gets infinitely more complex the later you go in the levelling process right?  New spells mean new interactions with the server, new enemy and boss mechanics similarly do, there’s quests with far more steps, pathing in areas, etc.
---
I wish there was a guide on how to make the trek from each starting zone to another as really low level
---
My route in the stress test from undead to human took hours, I'm sure p server players know way better ways
---
Neither does the problem... Blizzards servers can hold however many people... Layering is an attempt to solve a problem that is not server load.

Kiting is what makes the class hilarious, nothing like sitting outside intercept range whittling a warrior down who has a 0% chance of killing you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwbKNDU\_WsE&amp;t=0m29s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwbKNDU_WsE&amp;t=0m29s)

From what I've seen, (havent played the beta, didn't play original) there's very little going on. It's all just this ability does this, this ability does this, and that ability does that. Little synergy, and zero flashiness

It's a good thing that axe isn't made of stone, 'ey?

Also pro tip: if you're on the fence about it, its objectively one of the most effective and safest contraception methods if you don't want kids or more kids accidentally. If you force your lady to either use birth control or have her tubes tied instead, you're a weenie and should be ashamed of yourself.

Blacksmithing will not get you any BiS healing gear.  Go for other professions.

If youre wiping on bosses then yea, otherwise you should only need it for those fights

I am not getting ganked, Barlton. I am the ganker! A guy quests in STV and gets ganked and you think that of me? No. I am the one who ganks!
---
I dislike playing mage because if you go to a capital you don't get a moment's peace from constant whispers.
---
Pussyyyyyyyyy! Lol JK.
---
I’ll see you running around in circles on the roof of the bank. (Stealthed in the corner by the ramp up to the flight path of course).
---
Right, although there were pretty glaring issues with handling large groups of people in the same place during the stress tests
---
Alright it's a deal
---
Yeah, I was a stubborn wannabe prot paladin all through vanilla. I never got to tank, but I invested a ton into tanking gear in hopes that the paladin rework would make it viable. There was always the hope of some future patch.
---
I was the guild disenchanter, and they'd let me keep unneeded tanking gear rather than sharding it, as long as I put equivalent shards into the guild bank.
---
It was kind of fun going to AV with T2.5-T3 tanking gear, though.
---
Hunter has a *very* hard medium/high skill cap where many players get fucked by the deadzone and positioning but past that cap the class really begins to standout.

It's really not that had. Worst part is the needle in your sack. After that. Nothing. Was fun to watch but I don't have a weak stomach. Watched in amazement when the doctor performed my wife's C-sections. I thought it was cool to see.
---
If I get ganked in STV on August 27th, then that means I got to 30 within six hours of launch. I'll take it.
---
You can only drop traps when out of combat. FD drops combat.
---
True! That's what I am theorycrafting, I'm trying to make a mage build which uses AM as a damage source in combination with T2 8-piece set bonus. The thought is to get instantcast-procs from using AM and spending them on Pyroblast. The math actually works out quite well! I will make a post on here and maybe a guide on wowhead once I have done my final exams this semester.
---
Id rather not be AWAKE while someone jabs a needle in my balls and then cuts my pee pee open 😂🤣
---
Hey I wouldn't worry about it. They numb you up and the entire procedure takes under 2 or 3 minutes. My doc was talking to me about work the whole time. It just felt like being at the dentist in a weird way. Shave your balls first so they don't have to do it.
---
That is probably true for all "old" content that it moves through. But as soon as new content comes into play (you know, a new raid for example) then it will not be called 1.0 anymore. Otherwise what would have been the point of going through 1.0 to 1.12 through all of vanilla back then?
---
Again, that issue is completely separate from server load. This would be a valid point for you to make unlike your original reply.
---
That's great!. The wife would love that one!
---
Manners always went far with me. Free food and port if you were a nice person. However, if you were a dick about it, the only thing you got was a port to Darnassus.

---
This is the zone where the hidden Elven ruins are located, right? There are many [theories](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Northern_Lordaeron#Speculation) about this zone:
---
&gt;This could be the land of the "northern vassals", whom Terenas's grandfather helped in their negotiations over their borders with the elves of Quel'Thalas.
---
&gt;the High Elves who did not become Blood Elves settled in many zones across Azeroth, a large number of high elves took refuge on some lands in the north of Lordaeron and adjacent to Quel'Thalas. This could be that location.
---
&gt;There are some evidences to suggest that this unnamed area could actually be the mysterious Northeron mentioned in lore. (Northeron was the home of the Wildhammer gryphon riders).
---
It could also be the location of the Dragon Isles.
---
I think it would be interesting to see some of these possibilities, maybe the zone could even have all of the above. A Wildhammer village would be awesome in my opinion, since their culture is so different to the Bronzebeards.
---
It was best for dungeon boosts at the time (mop and wod)
---
They killed Enhancement but Elemental is still pretty okay
---
I think playing balance would be really enjoyable for leveling and world pvp. If only it was a little more viable for pve.

Using the scouts tabard while sporting R14 gear looks sooo weird to me.
---
At least use the Stone Guard's tabard, or better just use AB or WSG exalted since you got those automatically when grinding to R14
---
Meanwhile, on the border between Tirisfal Glades and WPL there's a spider that tells you that.

O.o

Your welcome sir! Can I go play in the ball pit now?

Is this sarcasm? He's saying he doesn't want as many hunters because he's going to play a hunter.
---
I picked Shaman because I like to be able to do everything in RPG's, like swing a big ol' two-handed axe while slinging spells and throwing heals out and dropping totems to buff me and my allies, Shamans could do practically everything. They also had neat bonus spells like far sight, astral recall, water walking/breathing, and ghost wolf.
---
It's not that bad. Pissing can be a pain and the first squirt squirt hurts. They give you an awkward pair of undies that are super tight but oh man are they nice. My mother hit me in the nuts on accident, when she tossed a diaper to me, a day after surgery...
---
It adds mystique to the world, sure. but that’s a secondary effect. Content is designed to be actually used by players, no company wants to spend thousands of work hours to design a raid only for it’s main purpose to be mystique and something to strive for.
---
midnight salmon have 1% catch rate during the day, 5% catch rate at night.  over 100 fish that's 1 salmon during the day, 5 at night.  salmon are 10x more expensive than a regular fish catch, so it's like catching 110 fish vs 150 fish for the same number of casts
---
locked dungeons is an example of things that could be different depending on day/night time, which the post i replied to says is the point.  it's not a good point, because it's just a pure negative for 1 side to experience that they can never do anything about because the cycle is synced with real time.  they don't care about fishing so it doesn't affect them, but scaling it up to something as important as dungeons is literally gamebreaking.
---
Up to Wrath I can see this working, and wouldn’t be surprised if it happened sometime in the future. Anything past that I think wouldn’t be popular enough to warrant servers, even though I know some people really liked MoP.
---
I know because I got my R13/R14 gear/wep the same way. That is why I'm asking for a picture of the title.
---
You underestimate the power of the new meta...

You won't see many dps shamans getting raid spots

Pets normalised? That's bullshit, that's not classic. :(

Lorewise it shouldn’t even be that rare since the high elves were nearly drove to extinction from the Scourge invasion.

Please message me a link when you're done. even if you only partially get through it. We have nothing but time, and that's kinda why I posted this after only a couple hours of tinkering with it. By August I hope to have a full accurate spreadsheet.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Mage = low HP target in cloth. I pref to run around with 5-6k HP wearing mail.

Perhaps he didn't know about the twitch list.
---
Give  us a guide master

All of them. Explore and grind to 10. Then start questing.
---
I'm sure if there are issues they'll be fixed before release. Or just go old school while leveling.

If you're serious, no. Sperm only makes up a miniscule amount of your semen. So there's no discernable difference between before and after. ~~Tastes the same and everything~~

If you wouldn't mind elaborating, which TBC changes to Shaman did you dislike? I actually liked most of the changes, the exception being that I wasn't a fan of dual wielding becoming the way to go for enhancement.
---
Read the comments of that post.
---
Normally dual dal’rend is prebis but for orc i would look into axe of deep woods/flurry axe, could just run dal’rends + edgemasters though
---
Good luck with that
---
Alright thanks for confirming you don’t know what you’re talking about
---
Yes, just remember not to bite the other children.
---
Ikr. This sub is so full of people proudly claiming they don’t need 8 hours per day. Painful to read if you’re aware of the research literature on sleep deprivation.
---
Your family reunions must be wild.
---
They are so scary as long as they have mana, which after a few mindblasts they won't.
---
Lmao, sorry! I guess the title does sound a little misleading.
---
The reason old AV was not popular is because the honor gains were low. Players mainly do battlegrounds for honor. If blizzard brought back old AV, they would need to rework the honor distribution in the battleground. The biggest flaw with AV is that you would earn way more honor doing AB or WSG then spending hours in an Alterac Valley battleground that never ended.
---
That one time the hunter feigned and pulled every bug in AQ40 onto the raid.
---
No....no i do not. I do not like getting the flu shot.....So is rather be in la la land while all of this happens lol.

Dude. I'll break it down for you since you cant comprehend even with others explaining it. PVE servers, there are 3 types of Zones. Alliance, Contested and Horde. If an alliance goes to a contested zone, they need to type /pvp to be flagged, if an alliance goes to Tirisfall Glades, Mulgore, etc... they are automatically flagged. It does not matter that it is a PVE realm. Same goes for Horde in Westfall, Darkshore, etc... I mean really, this game is what? 15 years old? This isnt new information. The ONLY thing a PVE server does, is make contested zones flagged. Repeat that with me.
---
Shaman will be a little more colorful imo, but I of course have a bias. For the Horde!
---
Yes, it was the best MMO before it went live and all we had was beta Hype.  The team that took it from korea and ported it to US were very poor custodians of the game, and the length of time they took to introduce any kind of end game progression was embarrassing.  I spent a lot of time fishing the second third and forth week, until I stopped logging weeks 5-8.  I came to the realization it was not worth staying subscribed to keep the land plots and guild halls the team helped contribute to build.  managing the farms was very time consuming since you wanted plots in different climates for crops.
---
Pc
---
Avoid strangle 🙄
---
Fair enough. Mages, and rogues for that matter, are very interesting pvp classes. Played well, you send people crying about them being OP, but people underrate how it's a balancing act to utilize the classes in a way that maximizes their pvp potential.
---
&gt; My biggest concern is that they decide to keep layering forever with some bullshit reason like "well, there's 3x the players now than there was back in original vanilla...so it makes sense to have 3x the world with 3x the resources". But I am...optimistic? that it won't go that way
---
I expect that this is going to happen.

You're just making a sad attempt at "no you" with the "wrath baby" meme. The one having it's roots in a version of the game that was largely (outside of top end raiding) so trivialized that the players who got used to it couldn't deal with the difficulty of launch Cataclysm heroics. Their whining, rooted in them being used to a version of the game that is piss easy, earned them the title wrath babies.
---
You just throwing out 'Vanilla Babies' like it means anything is hilarious because it strongly suggests that you are the triggered baby here trying to get revenge by pissing off the main audience of this sub with a ridiculously unfitting "no, u!"
---
You're pitable.

That is a $200 plasma screen TV that you just killed! Good luck paying me back with your zero-dollars-a-year salary plus benefits, babe!

I'm sure it'll be load more fun to run UBRS 20 times, with no change whatsoever in the layout or abilities, no increase in difficulty... just getting easier and easier until you snooze your way through.
---
That's why I mentioned it to them, silly!
---
Why can't healers use their raid gear in pvp?
---
This isn’t very impressive when you consider that by Wrath pretty much every spec of every class was viable in some way
---
Well, your memory fails you. Hard.
---
specifically playing it for my hunter so I can afk stealth while questing and gank people with my pet while stelathed
---
How many kids do i have to trade for rank 14.
---
Downranking and the mana minigame are their whole own world in a vanilla/tbc raid. Playing the 5s rule, making use of clearcast procs, inner focus..good shit.
---
It has it's lowest player count since Vanilla...
---
No real downsides playing a Nelf hunter. Besides playing a hunter.
---
This is one thing I dont understand and something I dont see talked about often. Isnt beta pop supposed to be low? Why the fuck is there layering already?
---
Lol. I bet you're the type of person to pass out if a mosquito lands on your arm huh?
---
I got in vanilla with my Undead Warlock. I rarely used it. It's a rare but fun goal to have.
---
I hope this is sarcasm lol.  Short term... unless population remains intact, or even grows.  Now you have layering forever when it wasn't even necessarily to begin with!  Yay!
---
Yes,  I can absolutely say 'no' to them.
---
Damn right it's a nice dress! It brings out my girlish figure...
---
All of them. People often overlook the amount of time you can spend running from quest to quest, especially without that sweet lvl 40 mount. Best to put on "live to win" and start grinding them boars
---
&gt;a Warlock yelling at other players for clicking the portal twice
---
I fixed that for you.
---
Get a cateter and one of those fluid food thiggies you see around the hospital.
---
Well, that and theory crafting wasn't nearly as prolific as it is now. When people got tier pieces, they replaced their bis blues with them. Pre-stat change people were using full tier 1, even though it was mostly trash. You can still go look at comments on bis items that people are saying its trash etc etc.
---
I lucked into Shaman. I started alliance as a druid, and around level 43 two people I had met and played with daily asked me if I would switch to Horde with them. I felt little connection to my druid and the Alliance as a whole, so I jumped ship with them and never looked back. 
---
When picking a character, I knew I wanted to be a Tauren, but I had already done Druid and had no interest in Warrior or Hunter, so Shaman was it. I also knew they were a healing class later on which is one of my draws to them (and originally Druid). I have always been a healer in group environments, even back in FFXI as a White Mage, so it was the obvious choice. 
---
Cut to me never once hating the leveling experience, heading to outlands with my buddies at TBC, clutch healing end game when the raid wiped down to me and those 2 buddies I mentioned above (Tauren Warrior and Druid), and slamming in duo arenas that same Druid... I will be rolling alliance this go around with some real life buddies, but I am dying that I can't be a Shaman. I am a Shaman.
---
Your doctor is a sadist. They normally put up a little curtain so you can't see.
---
I need help convincing my wife to give the game a fair shake. She spent a good two hours customizing her character at creation in another MMO and a good two minutes before she logged out. 
---
Worst case is waiting for the 6 month old to grow up and pocket heal me in a few years.
---
lmao so triggered
---
LOL I'm sure the private server guides out there are way more accurate than anything I could pull together after being separated from that part of the game for 13 years.
---
I thought he just played Fortnite these days.
---
Why not? If everybody can farm it since day 1, people will abandon it earlier. If you can't do it, but really want to do it, you will keep playing untill you can (or the next expansion rolls out and its no longer relevant), or, at least, it will extend the time played by that player until he gives up.
---
You are correct. Enhance in ICC was raw too.
---
I would be most happy about more leveling zones, making a new character is always fun, especially if you find new friends on the way. But after some time doing the same quests becomes too repetitive and I don't think many player will have more than two character at max levels because of this. Adding 2-3 new zones would not hurt and could add some alternate routes for a new leveling experience, also as far as I remember there were some part where the leveling became grinding mostly due to the lack of quests or too slow quests (early 30 maybe and late 50). 
---
I would not like a post naxx content that would give better items than naxxx does, but for example a scarlet raid that is a little worse or on pair with naxx gear would be great.
---
I aint reading the whole pots. Bit yea sure its good for BfA
---
When did spell damage become Spell Power?
---
This is a really good list but can't believe you left out the part about getting ganked in Stranglethorn Vale.
---
Hm, true, didn't think about that at all. Sorry.
---
Tho, in game design (and many other things) you only realize later that you need something that you didn't think about at first. I don't believe Blizzard thought about having something like that at release, similar to many other shotcomings of classic (e. g. the bad talent trees).
---
Everything you listed as a con, I whole heartedly believe contributes to making WoW classic great and immersive.
---
All of them?
---
Cause it's all +healing and mp5 with very little survivability which you need as a healer in pvp.
---
Ok real talk. As a meme on an early days pserver that shall remain nameless, I leveled moonkin past 40. You think you do, but dear lord please save yourself hours of /played spent drinking.
---
this isnt really about making intricate details of these new zones, just potential that could easily be explored. Alot of these areas are mentioned in lore or old design ideas but dont exist currently. You know when blizzard announces a new raid far in advance they also dont give you insane ideas. 
---
Also its not just a raid. Its scarlet citadel that gives you more than half the information about it already about what they could create.
---
Basically to your question about what type the raid, the answer is...yes
---
Aren't dal'rends nerfed with 1.12 itemisation? On nost and similar pservers it was really good, but they used the stats from before the nerf I think. They might still be best, I dunno, just taking it into account. 
---
Anyway, I feel like any of the bis boe weapons are not really something I could expect to get very soon after hitting 60. And definitely don't expect to get my hands on edgemasters any time soon.
---
Well, they could easily disable (enemy) transmogs in battlegrounds. I don't believe it is that important in Open World PvP.
---
Yes that multiplier is 72.2% of what the two handed multiplier is. But it gets added to the raw swing dmg of the weapon, which is much higher on the two hander. So it is not even close to 25% of the dmg difference between weapons as you claimed. Its quite a bit more significant. Especially when you consider that is applying to cleave/sweeping strikes/whirlwind.
---
I am not sure what the slowest 1 handed weapon is but they are like on average 2.0 second weapons vs on average like 3.3 with a max of 3.8.Its not like you will always have a super duper slow 1 hand will you?
---
Retail has phasing.
---
If you think every guild is going to be some harcore min/maxing guild you're nuts.
---
There will be plenty of chill progression guilds.
---
Min-max-y wise you could be a Night Elf dagger rogue. Highest base agility. Also Nelf Hunter is BiS for PvE.
---
I don't think you should play wow when your babe needs attention though....
---
This. Although without the deadzone, Hunters would have certainly been the most OP class in Classic pvp.
---
Oh I have no intentions of playing it. I just like the idea of being a boomkin. 
---
Who doesnt like a giant chicken that shoots laser beams.
---
These are the kind of tips that keep me coming back.
---
Easiest 1h for an orc is 1h axe from Strat Dead.  Pretty high drop rate, but you will be rolling against Hunters for it since they like to roll with 2 of them.

I see you missed the several dozen times this has been posted here. The several dozen bloody YouTube videos covering this very topic as well. The several fucking spreadsheets listing prebis for every single spec for phase one.

No one here has the answer sadly. Wish I did. Don't.
---
Great source, thanks!
---
It's not necessarily.  We literally know this as a fact from numerous launches that did not use layering.

Just because it existed doesn’t mean it’s not a cheat.

I wish I woulda gone under for it. If you have the option... do it! There was WAY too much going in the tugging and moving department. I had to take a break half way through. Numb or not... it was super super uncomfortable. Good luck! 1,000,000% worth it!

/s is a crutch used by people who are afraid of downvotes from people who don't get the joke. It usually kills any possible humor the post had.
---
Yeah the fact that all 5 survive makes it seem like the feat wasn't that impressive. Like they travelled across the universe to another planet, won a series of battles against the horde on their home turf, then got ripped through the fabric of space-time itself when nerzhul opened all the dimensional rifts.
---
But that's nbd, they got out A okay! All five! Even though they got seperated. ... Like the more you explain what happened the more it's obviously just story padding :(

'Impossible'
---
I dont want to. The title already suggests its pointless
---
Also, a different but related question.
---
Common knowledge is that slow main-hand weapons are better than fast ones. But as a fury DPS, what abilities actually scale with weapon damage? Deep wounds?
---
The only change that would be great for classic is summoning stones. LFG system ruined the social experience completely in my opinion.
---
Convenience is the method which kills immersive gameplay.  The small things that inconvenience the player create a risk reward dynamic that is pleasing.  I have to go into BRD to craft at the anvil.  Holy shit is that inconvenient, and fucking awesome.
---
Boo hoo. Pick a class that looks dope in a tier set you believe you'll stop at. Priest tier looks dope as hell.
---
Considering I spent about 5 years playing on private servers I think I'm perfectly entitled to shitting on them. I'm all too familiar in all the ways they suck.
---
I highly recommend eating more than just peanut butter, if not stock up on some toilet paper
---
It's frustratingly odd that you've been convinced of this when technology is 100 times better than it used to be and we never had 10 hour queues before or anything remotely like that even at the absolute worst.
---
You get better gear so that they can't heal through your damage.

Farming mounts in vanilla? Not really. You just did AV40 and did the turn-ins. You'd get exalted with all factions before you hit GM. There was the winterspring frostsaber, sure but that's it really.

Sure will! I still farm the same maps in Diablo 2 since release. Enjoy your retail fam.

Are you me ?

Knowing there was still content to experience and an adventure in front of you was a big carrot on a stick for a lot of people. I definitely went hard on BC and loved it because it felt like so much was building up to Black Temple/Sunwell. The pendulum definitely swung too hard in the other direction, now instead of being goals on the horizon most content was week one clear outside of mythic raids.
---

---
Damn, those are some slave wages.
---
Yea looks right. I think its a bit unfair to use whirlwind axe when its nearing its least efficient point ( you are looking to get rid of it around lvl 40 or shortly after). Also, w shield slam's poor scaling, its probably about as strong as it will be at lvl 40. 
---
If you use Stoneslayer instead, I get 369 MS damage, which sounds more like the difference in dmg between MS and shield slam I feel when I play the specs.
---
You picked the right place, almost think there are more people here trying to make YouTube videos than there people who aren't.
---
Lol I thought this post was about salt of the scorpok
---
It seems atleast the 1-30 part of classic is quite overtuned on private servers, meaning classic is correct, and is easier.
---
You honestly want he Highest DPS weapon in the game or just rock ARCANITE REAPER and go 2 handed fury. This is very viable as a horde warrior because of windfury and just raid with that bad bitch until you can pick up some raid items.
---
"We" did during wotlk and cata too - but hey keep believing stupid shit 🤠
---
I just did some googling for you and found this: https://tripletsmum.com/triplet-baby/gear/babywearing-triplets/
---
Imagine wearing all three on you while raiding!
---
Well, besides the part where it is shit if you are forced to play something you don't want to just because your items look like shit otherwise there is also the issue, that full tier sets are often a bad choice, that you might end up having items from different sets or great standalone items.
---
Last, but not least, taste is subjective. I think the priest sets look "meh" at best and akward at worst.
---
Ugh
---
I think people should be slimming down to not get morbid on a Monster and Hot Pocket diet.
---
Oh I loved my Spriest in TBC, they were amazing, but damage output-wise WotLK was on another level.
---
Indeed. I wasn’t suggesting that someone else’s use of the atlas would affect my play cuz obviously that’s absurd. Just commenting in general on the subject of having everything mapped out for a player. Obviously if someone is using it it’s because they want to. I suppose I just won’t be.
---
Everything you listed isn't a downside though. It's part of the game. It's something anyone in a world at WAR would have to put up with.
---
It's amazing that there can be a Devilsaur mafia, that a group of dedicated players can coordinate and effectively control a zone. If that can be done then it can be outdone by others, it adds a whole other level to the game.
---
People killing you while leveling again adds a new layer to the game, it's like if you lived 10,000 years ago and needed to survive in the real world, some people would mind their own business and others would kill on sight. It adds a sense of danger to the game, and having certain zones be required visits for all level of characters only helps with the progression of leveling as you get higher the world becomes more dangerous.
---
I get it, if you want to focus on raiding and PvE then roll PvE. If you want to tune out while questing and not have to worry or get distracted by WPvP then all the power to you.
---
I just find more immersion and a better experience on a PvP server as it feels more alive.
---
They do high single target dmg, have control such as fear against close range targets and silence against casters. Can mana drain casters/healers, and can sheild from dmg. Also they do decent healing through dmg. 
---
So for about 30 secs they can out dps/survive most classes. If they fight goes too long or someone can out survive the dps they will lose. 
---
Warlocks are good against them
---
You misspelled windfury my dude

Shaman burst is incredible on fresh servers. MC and lower gear does not offer much stamina.

Picking shaman for the first time. Can u explain the whole ruining mages and rogue thing???
---
dal'rends are the same. just get them.
---
yes you are an orc, but you wont always be using axes, . just having a good weapons is better. classic got few and between weapons, so in many cases its not like there is a choice.
---
\#alexwasright
---
classic is a joke
---
I picked shaman initially because I wanted to shoot those lightning balls but then I saw my friend was playing one so I rolled a druid instead. 
---
I was a little disappointed at my green shooty balls' killing power but decided to press on.  Imagine my disappointment when getting Hurricane as the max balance talent. 
---
From there I specced resto and never looked back. The best compliment I ever got was, "Its ok to run Scholo with this guy, he heals like a priest!"
---
I'm so fucking ready!!!! Pogggers and Widepeepohappy!

Dun Moroch was where WoW began for me as a humble dwarf. I will never forget the first walk up that hill and into Ironforge. One of the most remarkable videogame moments of all time.
---
And for the pet dismiss animation :-)
---
Fuck yeah papa, let's farm the scrub ass alliance until bgs come in p3!
---
What a silly thing to say. It's not all a downside.
---
Also citing the name as if that means something is utterly pointless. That's like saying I refuse to play Red Dead Redemption because I'm not red, and I'm not dead.
---
You're right,  I didn't mean to disparage dps as there is a lot of preparation, theory crafting, and perfecting the rotation that goes into being a top performer.  The point I was attempting to convey is that, in my experience, healing will put you into unfamiliar/ unexpected situations more often that force you to make calculated decisions on the fly,  which I find to be a more satisfying challenge.
---
Haven't found anything for orcs, which is the main reason I was asking. I also don't like the answers a lot of people have given in older threads, but can't discuss it with them there.
---
I would have been ok with a AQ or ZG style outdoor raid. But yeah, the writing of the storyline in Ulduum was pretty shitty – I think they got too hung up on making those Indiana Jones references that the zone felt really stupid.
---
You don't know if servers are going to crash or not, you are just conjecturing. The same argument from my previous post applies here anyway: the people who don't want layering realize that the servers may crash, but would rather take that risk and its potential consequences instead of supporting Blizzard's layering "solution" which would result in dividing the community on a server. Therefore in their view the risk of a mechanically "faulty launch" is still worth it compared to the proposed alternative (and the resources that are required to make it).
---
You lucky bastard
---
Class quest weapons
---
I played in the beta, then from launch until quitting on the news of the changes coming in TBC, I haven't played since vanilla.
---
I played troll/shaman, I choose it by going on the WoW forums and looked for the class people complained about the most :) 
---
I enjoyed shaman a lot because it's a hybrid which means you get to do a little of everything, I spent the majority of my time World PVPing (which was the most interesting thing about WoW to me and got me to buy the game in the first place) or in raids/dungeons.
---
I'm actually thinking about getting back into WoW after all these years with classic coming, I'll definitely roll shaman again, and if I wasn't just playing for nostaligia I'd pick Tauren, but I'll be troll again. This time I want to try Enh shaman, as I was always Elemental in vanilla (which I still think is the best) Just want to switch it up, also my gear will be worse because I'll be casual, so I won't be able to stack spell dmg.
---
Ur a retarded.
---
Time to find a new friend, he don't know Jack..
---
Damn, yeah you're reminding me of all those fun crazy pets!
---
I understand why they can't allow those in Classic (Some pets were just to overpowered) but it is disappointing!
---
This has been irking me, too. 
---
To simplify for the confused posters: people have been making hypothetical ideas for new content for classic that are NOT Burning Crusade. Most of them are referring to a hypothetical “1.13” patch. 
---
Classic IS patch “1.13.” 1.12 was the actual Vanilla patch it’s based off of, but classic is 1.13. 
---
Any hypothetical content would be for a hypothetical patch 1.14.
---
as long as it's done properly, through the api, it's not a cheat even if you think it should be
---
Also out of a raid of 40 maybe 20 something were there to do their part. The rest just showed up and expected pixels at the end.
---
So it's one issue:  someone might get more loot than you.
---
1.  Someone got loot too fast!  Oh no!  The arena trinket only spawns every 3 hours anyway.  They can still get this before you by simply playing more.
---
2.  Don't switch groups when you aren't in a safe spot.  Also, this happens even in Vanilla without layering.  The centaur in the Barrens northwest of XR did this.  The Kodo in Desolace did this.  Nothing to do with layering.
---
3.  I still can't care that someone farmed more loot than me.
---
4.  Or that they decided to grind more than me...
---
You think mobs appearing out of the blue (because you triggered it on purpose) is somehow more experience breaking than inviting someone clear across the world to join you on an adventure by whispering them?  Since when did you become a telepath?  Why is talking to someone the world away without any magical aid not "experience breaking"? 
---
You're trying too hard to let it ruin your game.
---

---
Play Wow Classic / have a social life / eat &amp; sleep well : choose two
---
That is the most clever idea I have read all year.
---
We do know. It was fixed to avoid lag causing you to not be able to hit somebody when you're in range on your screen. The change included AoE spells. If you spam arcane explosion just out of range, and then start running away from the target, suddenly it will reach.
---
Go ahead and do that. Tell me afterwards how effective grinding 50 boars split between 25 people was.
---
I've also mained Shaman in EQ since 2000. I started playing vanilla WoW for the first time a few years ago with Nostalrius, and decided to play a Warrior for some reason. Totems kinda scared me away, and I heard Warrior was the OP class.
---
This time around though I'm going back to my roots.
---
We are simple adventurers in vanilla. Casually slain Onyxia, Blood God Hakkar, Ragnaros the Firelord, Nefarian, Cthun and Kel'Thuzad. I think its a pretty big misunderstanding about vanilla. We were always the heroes. We may start as plebs that do chores for some random farmers, but thats just the begining of the story. As every next expansion is not a fresh start to our characters we have to become bigger and bigger. Thats why I think its okay that we are important. We always were.

Thanks for the info, I forgot about the requirements to start the quests, but it's good to know that at least the quest chain should be available at some point.
---
I might wait and start a hunter as my 2nd or 3rd Classic character.
---
and make sure you are ahead of the blob
---
On the surface, it would seem this is the case. You want to use your resources to create what players will actually see and consume. What's the point of spending months to create something that less than 1% of people will see?
---
Well, it is PRECISELY the exclusivity and mystery that gives WoW its depth and immersion. You WANT there to be content that only the elite access because it makes the world seem vast and unique. You absolutely do not want to use the design philosophy of only creating what 80% of players will experience. This is how you get a streamlined boring game.
---
I was a vanilla player who never stepped foot in BRD much less any raids. Although I PvP'd for my gear, I was always jealous of raiders in their shiny raid gear and I was filled with wonder about what was in those raids. I couldn't be bothered to apply for a guild like I would apply for a job back then, and raids were definitely seen as something that only the elites had access to. But that was fine to me. Just knowing the content and challenge was there made the game feel more dynamic to me.
---
they are not gonna get rid of it.
---
it's clearly part of the server design and it's obviously here to stay.
---
they say it's just for phase 1, but honestly I don't see why would they get rid of it at all.
---
phase can last 3 months
---
people will use to it to avoid getting ganked
---
people will use it to leave zones that are being pvp raided
---
enjoy Blizzard bringing retail wow to vanilla :D
---
Keyboard turning is the real issue.
---
Why's that? Someone who isn't partnered isn't earning anything, the channel won't be partnered to start out so we are making a pure lose. Once the channel is partnered we'll also share the monetisation revenue with creators. 
---
$20 is equal to around 10k views depending on video duration and number of adds played which I doubt anyone who is interested in joining us is achieving on their own.
---
I’m of the mind that being part of the pack will be part of the hilarity of the experience. I don’t really think I’ll want to sneak off and level in a corner somewhere. Part of Classic WoW that I actually love is being forced to deal with and interact with other players.
---
Of course! How could I forget.
---
You say that but someone who isn't partnered isn't earning anything, the channel won't be partnered to start out so we are making a pure lose. Once the channel is partnered we'll also share the monetisation revenue with creators. 
---
Lmfao.  Why not do those things now then.
---
It's interesting to me how you *know* layering is bad, you *know* there are other solutions, yet Blizzard has managed to convince you "just the tip, just to see how it feels", so to speak.
---
It baffles me how Blizz has managed to convince everyone there will be 10 hour queues when there never have been before and they have better tech and more $ and strategy than ever to control influx of people to servers.
---
And that's the exact problem with games nowadays.
---
One of the reasons why Dark Souls became so huge was because it had so many things hidden that people could just completely miss on their playthrough. People talked about stuff they did or found and they could have completely different experiences.
---
I have a question. Will I get ganked in STV?
---
Getting dal'rends is a pretty decent chore in itself with all the competition for them from rogues and such. I was hoping there would be viable axes that could replace that as an orc. 
---
Also, if you're tanking, loosing the set bonus make the dal'rends quite a lot worse.
---
You can do some really fun stuff with shadowmeld 
---
Plus it’s really nice to eat in stealth on a pvp server. 
---
And they get avoidance + stealth increase for stealth using classes. 
---
Unless you are that type , to care about your racial ability, then just do what you want. What ever will bring enjoyment to your game.
---
Just imagine. One of the first things that child will ever know is to not leave the flag unguarded.
---
isn't saying that someone is going to be behind for enjoying the game equally as judgy as my comment?..
---
Ferals who (let's be honest) overcompensate can be #1 on damage meter.
---
Nah I requested to watch. If anything I'm the sadist breh.
---
That's true, there is an anime called goblin slayer that I think kinda has an answer. Basically there are adventurers who have done and killed amazing things and people know of them but at the end of the day they are still just an adventurer. Maybe as people who have killed rag or whatever they would feel any thing lower would be beneath them but at the end of the day normal quests serve as gold makers. 
---
One problem I have with current WoW is the needing to one up the big bad almost every expansion. That's where mists kinda had the right idea. We weren't going there because of a new evil bad to the world but as a new area to explore. I think if the ally/horde stuff was more in the background and we are just going on an adventure it would have been better.
---
If you're going to be anal it's Spell Damage &amp; Healing. I prefer shortening it to Spell Power but whatever I've changed it.
---
The people there though are the ones that seem more chill and want to just quest, so although ganking certainly happens there, it was always a lot more tame.
---
Don’t forget epics. BfA is all about epics.
---
I will have to mute everyone on the server.  This should be a bannable offense. Lifetime ban across all games.
---
Where the game is now I dont see a problem with transmog and it's one of the things I enjoy in retail most. I don't think it belongs in classic though.
---
Many items are iconic and some have incredible on-hit effects that are game changing which most items today in retail dont see. Every item you wear is a like badge or an indicator of your strength/progress. Imagine you end up fighting a shaman and he mogs to look like a fresh level 60 but hes actually BIS with HoR and oneshots you.
---
Madseason has put out some great youtube content, mostly guides and other helpful vids. I dont watch twitch streams, but his content vids  isnt lowest common denominator pewdiepie garbage.
---

---
Yeah, you'd log on and it would say 10 hours, then 15 min later you were in the game.  You people would rather hurt the integrity of the game than wait 15 minutes *one time*.
---
Sham tank it is. I was the druid player convincing my shaman best friend I could heal his tanking. Super rough (even just finding dps to go along with it), but some of the best 5-man experiences I have.
---
will be a good zoomer filter
---
They are definitely a good pick for hunters, shadowmeld is really strong. Rogue and warrior the dwarf and gnome racials are just way better, and priest unfortunately fear ward is just essential. From an RP perspective play whatever you want, if it helps you hit 60, but from a min/max perspective only druids and hunters... but they fit the class theme best anyway.
---
I hope the #nochanges fanatics tell blizzard no on this addon.
---
Yes.  We need more coffee.
---
And how can you be sure they didn't ban people after that?
---
Kok...ha
---
No changes. Yes TBC
---
You can skip whatever is too packed of people and figure it out from there. And kill every mob when you are going from A to B
---
&gt;But it gets added to the raw swing dmg of the weapon, which is much higher on the two hander.
---
Yes, accounting for weapon speed, for that specific portion of the equation you're looking at something more along the lines of 60% damage. Attack power seems to generally make up about 50% of your total damage (guesstimate based on a grand total of two data points), so that would mean that we can just take the average of 60% and 72.2% and land at about 66% or 2/3rds damage for one-handed instant attacks vs. two-handed ones.
---
&gt;I am not sure what the slowest 1 handed weapon is but they are like on average 2.0 second weapons vs on average like 3.3 with a max of 3.8.Its not like you will always have a super duper slow 1 hand will you?
---
On average, maybe... but probably not even then. There are two broad categories of one-handed weapons: fast ones and slow ones. Fast ones such as https://classicdb.ch/?item=6802 and https://classicdb.ch/?item=13034 are probably pretty close to that 2.0 average. Slow ones like https://classicdb.ch/?item=19556 and https://classicdb.ch/?item=4116 hover around the 2.6 - 2.8 mark. The slowest one-handers you'll find are 2.9 (there are a couple of 3.0 ones but they're bad in all other regards).
---
So yeah, it's pretty close to the 0.5 I cited earlier.
---
Haha this is awesome. Thanks!
---
IIRC, when accounting for *all* players then more than half never even made it to 60.
---
Thanks, appreciate it.
---
Nah man there's no phasing in Classic, only layering.
---
As pointless as commenting on it?  Man people with your mindset are exactly what's wrong with the world today.  Voicing your uninformed opinions based on misguided understanding of what you're even talking about.
---
I'm just wondering what all this shit people talk about is and why it's shit. people seem to hate streamers for no reason, lol
---
Gnome is small and makes it look like its further away.
---
Because you're just some dork looking for people to create content for you to exploit for financial gain.
---
I say yes, because that's mostly what I did in Vanilla. World PvP, BGs, some dungeons. Eventually I joined a casual raiding guild that only ran the two 20-man raids (and at first just the one, ZG). That was it, and I enjoyed myself. 
---
I might get stomped on by full BWL+gear folks in a BG, but honestly they were usually so busy doing PvE stuff I didn't encounter them in great numbers. It was actually a point of pride that our dinky little scrub pre-made of ZG geared players held on to Stables against an onslaught of a full-decked raiding guild. They even gave us props afterward, said they had been 5-capping everyone else XD
---
Ah who cares. It’s either this or decade-old shitty chuck norris jokes on repeat and thunder fury spamming. It’s all a garbage fire anyway
---
Exactly. Where did this “only first two weeks” crap come from? Phase 1 could last almost 4 months if they hopefully pace it similar to the [original content patch releases. ](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x)
---
That's IF I kill them, or IF they kill me. One person could dominate the spot and force others to move on to something else. 
---
Competition with your own faction is a given and a PASSIVE form of competition. You can't do anything about it other than farm more efficiently.
---
Competition with the opposing faction is an ACTIVE form of competition. Huge difference. Someome can farm as efficiently as they want but YOU will always have an active role in effecting their farm. On PvE servers and competing with your own faction you don't have this chance to actively change the situation.
---
 I can deal with competing vs my own faction passively, but when it comes to the enemy I want to compete actively.
---
Increased value because you're actively competing with the other faction for those resources. It's more risky to farm X item for Y amount of hours on a PvP server than on a PvE, therefore X item is worth more on a PvP server than a PvE server.
---
The rest I won't even bother to respond to because it's just assumptions about how I think/play that are totally off.
---
I'm still going to go shadow this time soleky because my time was spent on hybrids back then. Now I get to go back and do hunter, rogue, warrior, and priest like everybody else did.

---
Same! I played a rogue in Vanilla, so switching it up with holy pally will be really fun.
---
Isnt it permanent ?
---
Theoretically is there enough spellpower for a hunter to use arcane shot instead of aimed shot in pve? Or is it mainly a pvp/meme spec?
---
$20 is nothing for the amount of work a good video requires. They're better off forgoing your slave wages and publishing themselves. You offer nothing but a permanent leech.

ikr? an useful streamer POG

Layering for certain zones only *is sharding*. It was purposefully designed to be continent-wide.
---
-bites other children's parents-
---
Nice troll
---
You keep your balls... It's not a castration, lol
---
* The world is at the same time large (long travel times), and small (bumping into the same players in the same zones multiple times). The opposing faction provides indirect competition (for mobs spawns on PvE realms) or direct competition (wPvP), and end-game dungeon instance zones in particular are dangerous places to be.
---
* Social interaction with players isn't strictly required except for dungeon, raid, and end-game quest content. Players can make meaningful progress via professions and gold-farming even when playing solo or waiting for friends/guildies to log on. Leveling can be done completely solo as well. Ranking via solo PvP is possible on most servers as well.
---
* Social interaction has multiple benefits that increase efficiency and provide otherwise unobtainable rewards. Elite quests, dungeons, raids, and professions like enchanting provide benefits that a solo player isn't able to achieve on their own. Premade BGs can help a player get honor more efficiently.
---
* The slow gearing rate in raid content forces players to be patient about getting their upgrades and helps develop a sense of wanting to help guild members achieve their upgrades.
---
* Server based communities form naturally, as players interact on the forums and as server populations are low enough that you're able to remember who was a good player and who was not if you've grouped with them before. Personal reputation matters, and reflects on one's guild as well.

I remember as a teenager going to my friend’s house while he was leveling his boomkin through winterspring (I had never played past level 25 so it was cool to see). He asked if I wanted to try, so I started playing for a bit, and kinda hated it. Asked if he ever used his bear or cat form and he said no, so I started trying those. Even though he was specc’d boomkin, I started clearing mobs quicker and with full health and high mana again and again with cat form. I think started to pull these red level 57 chimeras for fun and could totally kill them if I did moonfire regrowth rejuv then 5 combo rip, rinse and repeat. It was super fun, and like 3 standard deviations stronger than a specc’d boomkin, even with no talent points.
---
Lfg is never good and has never been good. I played for two years before it was added and it was way better. I will miss summoning stones at dungeon entrances but still better then with lfg
---
If everyone follows the same guide won't that lead to the same kind of bottlenecks?

I picked shaman based on the descriptions that Blizzard had (has?) up on their site. A jack of all trades, attuned to nature? Cool and Thrall is a bad ass in WC3, sold. Though I could have easily taken Druid, I'm quite glad I ended up on shaman. 
---
I had no idea what I was doing, no game I'd played previously had the true tank, healer, dps dynamic. While leveling up, as elemental, I healed, and tanked (up to SM as far as I recall) dungeons. After 60 I heard about this awesome huge dungeon called Molten Core and stumbled my way into a guild who wanted to start raiding it. I still didn't know entirely what my job was, and I healed as elemental for a couple bosses in MC (at least until our first kill on luci) before I respec'd. After our shitty guild merged with a different (slightly less shitty) guild and combined we were able to move past Razorgore and Vael, respectively iirc. By the end of the expansion I had killed everything in Naxx except 4h, sapph and KT. Unfortunately for me, my guild got 4h down, but I was unavailable for RL reasons. 
---
Raiding and farming materials was a good portion of my play time but I did run BGs as solo queue and occasionally with the guild premade. I also ended up making an alt rogue that I took into pug/alt MCs, but mostly made him to farm since resto is so terrible at it and I hated the idea of dropping gold to respec. I also healed 5 mans long after I needed to be doing it, for no other reason than they were fun. I really liked the 45 min strat run, I remember doing that a fair amount.
---
I'm going to be rolling shaman again, this time leveling as enhancement. The other major change is a wife, a kid, and a full time job. So I wont be raiding, currently the plan is at all, but the hope is to pug/casual guild MC, ZG, AQ20, that sort of thing. If I could get a full set of Earthfury I'd be so excited, long ago I lost all of my t1-3 due to getting hacked.
---
My Dad did this while playing everquest 20 years ago. Me and my sister just slept on his chest while he played, at least according to my parents.

Don't let society dictate what "adulthood" should be. Define adulthood for yourself and what you want to get out of it, and live your life man. Don't be at the mercy of other people's perception of you.

The cooldown on the ability is 10 seconds in vanilla, that is as good as nothing. For most of vanilla shadowmeld only broke when cast was finished. At that point in time, shadowmeld was way over powered. As it will be in classic, the ability is just strong. Especially for hunters, but also for priests and warriors in group PvP.
---
A tbc quote during classic launch... smh
---
True, at any rate BM is great for leveling and even PvP but not for raiding.
---
A true hero.
---
I have three kids and work 7-3pm and have a great balance between work and quality of life. The wife and I do all the kids' activities and everything wraps up around 6:30-7:30pm, which mainly revolves around baseball and dance.  My kids are much older now and very self-sufficient, which helps, but I can tell you having a baby is going to consume your life since it's your first kid. 
---
I can say Classic will be tough if there are other activities a person does outside of work and family. For me, I'm a big gamer and most of my friends game as well, which means there won't be much of a change in my routine besides dedicating more of my time to one game.
---
Pets: Warlocks have to buy grimoires for spell ranks, demons match player level. Hunters have to tame beasts to learn new spell ranks, and you have to level up pets, which can suck if it's way behind. Hunters can only have 3 pets whereas Warlocks can summon from 4 demons, not counting felguard and doomguard, or any demons you enslave.
---
Inventory: Warlocks can use a soul shard bag like hunters use a quiver. Both classes lose a bag, but hunters can at least buy ammo whereas you have to grind soul shards. However, soul shards aren't a big deal if you get them in pvp often or go grind a bit in the wild.
---
Pvp: Hunters go fast and have to keep moving due to deadzone. Warlocks can stay in place and melt from afar with Dots and shadow bolt. 
---
Pve: Hunters have threat management with Feign Death, damage output is ok but they start to fall behind after BWL. Warlocks will start off strong with 16 debuff slots, and progressively keep up with mages in terms of damage; however, you have no threat management unless you're Alliance with Blessing of Salvation, so if you have to mind your threat else you'll die a lot.
---
Money: Both classes can solo dungeons and farming content. Hunters have an easier time of it and have more options. Warlocks do get a free mount, and a "cheaper" epic mount (depending on how much the dreadsteed mats cost).
---
Survivability: Warlocks wear cloth but can be beefy if you stack stamina, and spells like Drain Life and Sacrifice help you stay alive. Hunters have traps and Disengage, but they're screwed if in melee range and those are on cooldown. Hunters can take a few more hits because they wear mail.

She understand, she clearly has made her choice and won't compromise. Submit now!

Logic was never his strong point.
---
No,  Tollobrandy is right, firstly this pic is I think edited and not just a straight IG screenshot, and secondly they actually had a fake, larger cathedral pre-cata, the same way they had Stormwind Keep, so you could see it more from the distance. So it "shouldn't" be there, as in, you shouldn't be able to see it, but you did.
---
Thank you so much for the detail! Really appreciate this post! :)
---
what exactly is your problem
---
If I get into your exclusive content creation harem, can I refer friends to join and collect a percentage of what their videos make?
---
It's not that someone is getting more loot than me or anyone else. That's always bound to happen as there will always be someone with more playtime who's more dedicated than you.
---
It's when they're exploiting the temporary mechanics used to solve a completely unrelated issue to ridiculously increase their rewards more than you would ever have happen in Vanilla on a server.
---
I've never once in Vanilla coordinated a group while questing, join a group while I'm in a cave I just cleared and eating only to join a new layer and be sitting in a room full of full health mobs. That never happened.
---
There's got to be a happy medium with layering, it's useful but needs to be better implemented and restricted.
---
Exploit is harsh, I could be putting this time into making my own videos and not make a lose, my personal channel is already built up enough for that or even just have them create videos on my channel for "publicity". If exploitation was my goal then there are way better ways of going about it.   
---
Sure when the channel gets monetised id make money but I also have to put in the time to get the channel running, get it to the point it will be monetised, consistently recruit and train new creators as from past experience working for channels like TGNWoW creators come and go all the time and create thumbnails/seo for the videos to succeed.
---
This is not how you bug test, you don't hunt down one specific instance out of millions that shows what you want, you look at the consistent behavior and this is not how melee leeway worked in Vanilla.
---
Thanks for coming to my WOW talk
---
retard
---
yo someone share these links i need help
---
Great to hear!
---
I'll never forget the day I had 3 tests in school and I was like "ill just hop on and play for a few hours."
---
8 Hours later the sun was coming up and I was like "Holy shit it's 6am.. WTF"
---
I literally studied on my way to school and fell asleep in the middle of my last test..
---
Healing in classic was so easy. Dont stress
---
And after that tbc+ and wotlk and wotlk+ and cata. .... thats the main reason its a dumb idea. Id maybe would like to see the classic+ but there are plenty of things People will not agree on. Is it just gonna be a content patch with new zones? Is it gonna bring some balance changes? Is it going to have any new features? Thats a lot of things to discuss. If thats just a new landmass and a new raid id actually would not like that.
---
Most of the time. It can be reversed just not reliably. Best to get it done after you've had the kids you want to have.
---
Classic DB says +10, so unless it changed in the last 12 hours..  
---
    
---
In the spell database (extracted from the game client MPQ) number ranges are a thing, if you wanted to create a custom spell that did 50-60 damage you would write 11 and 49 in the columns as the spell should do the guaranteed 49 damage plus a random number in the bonus range, with a minimum of 1, making it actually 50.  
---
This is the case for a lot of values, be it bonus percentages on talents, dmg/healing values or simply the run speed on your mount buff.  
---
My guess is that this value being set to 9 is a wrong setting somewhere, making it just 9 when it should be 9+1.
---
Because that is how these stupid discussions are won ad nauseam.
---
This sub is ridiculous in the sense that people will go on a crusade to argue they are right *on something they want to be true* not that they know to be true.
---
This is one example, so is stuff like picking a race, consensus about specs etc.
---
Any really good in-depth PVP videos?
---
And you still don’t know how to take a screenshot
---
Executus has a couple great BG commentaries for hunter on his channel
---
It will be interesting to see how players (new and old) adjust to plate wearers (and other armor type wearers) rolling for cloth gear. As someone who's leveling a holy paladin, I expect i'll have to spend a decent amount of time explaining how certain pieces, which aren't plate, are still considered "paladin gear"
---
You're a pretty terrible charlatan. Not even a mediocre huckster.
---
That's the worst analogy I ever heard and just proves the entire point went far over your head.
---
Glad your response is nothing "That's silly", I was tired of stating the obvious anymore.
---
Never tested myself but I've heard that you can get arcane shot and serpent sting pretty buffed (while your multi and aimed will suck) however the reason it is probably not worth it is because you also loose your auto attack damage which is a huge chunk of your damage even for pvp.
---
Not sure exactly what you mean, but the below screenshot is from Vanilla and it seems to be there...
---

Thats correct, the add-on probably ships with the image assets for the emotes so if you didn't have the add-on you'd just see weird text.

Should say do you have phones...

16 for the whole of classic.
---
Shamans have decent ranged attacks, so Mages will have a hard time kiting them. Shamans also have a short cool down ranged interrupt, so mages are forced to use a lot of instant cast spells, draining mana pretty quickly. Shamans are able to heal/sustain for longer periods than mages relatively easily given their healing spells.
---
As a max level shaman, I lost very few duels to mages, if I was able to survive their initial burst. 
---
Rogues were a little more 50/50, but due to wearing mail and usually a shield, it was pretty tough for a rogue to 100 to 0 you in the space of one stunlock, at which point you just out-sustain them.
---
$20 is just the base, as stated once money is actually rolling in they would see more revenue. I'd also be putting in time to help coach them essentially, if they are newer to youtube and want to take things more serious then I don't see how this isnt a win win. Honestly im expecting some people to just make a couple of videos, learn what they can and peace to their own channels.

---
this is the most text i've seen in one post on reddit
---
Ah yes, all that competition for tank gear.
---
Have you ever seen twitch chat?  It's pure cancer.  Take the retarded chuck norris, anal X, TF spam and multiply it by about a 1000.   That's how fucking awful it is.   This addon should be banned asap.
---
They were normalized in 1.12 (except attack speed).
---
The offhand weapon can only be weared in the offhand, so it has no affect on tanking. 
---
You'd be doing a ton of UBRSes anyways for ony quest and in general for other items, and Rend only runs done quite fast. its not as hard to get really, compared to many other items you'll need. Many ppl will have them already or parts of it, or will be doing ubrs for other items.

Then why would Hand of Edward be BIS?
---
What you are saying is basically that something great as that shouldn't find its way into classic because of Open World PvP "balance"?
---
I would love them to be unpopular tho lol. I'm still deciding what healer to play.
---
It's not very fun in the raiding setting because it's litterally just watching green bars go up and down. Dungeons however are way more fun.
---
I still remember being top dps in ICC on trash as a hunter, something with multi shot doing insane damage
---
Are you going disc for phase 1 and 2? I'll be disc for 1 but thinking shadow for 2 before switching to disc/tri for 3.

I'm glad to see at least one sane person in this thread. :)
---
That's a bold statement.
---
Not long enough.
---
Same, but I think its worth reading. Let me just continue..
---
what happened to the statues in cata was pretty representative of the course they were one.
---
Are you actually referring to yourself, when in your last thread you revealed you had no idea when sharding was even introduced and that it negatively affected expansions it wasn’t even in?
---
And then you need to kill some earth elementals.  Hope you don't rely on nature damage!
---
omg thats my story :D
---
I had mine done a few years ago. I test rode motorcycles the day after lol. Maybe I can somehow swing a 2nd vasectomy?
---
Those were really great. I love his commentaries for each class. Really helpful in seeing what his into playing them, even if restricted to wsg
---
I played a boomkin in vanilla and all through tbc. They are indeed super fun to play. Rogues/warriors/hunters run up to you like you are a mage and hit your thick feathers and nothing happens, while you blast them down with the power of nature. When you do get low on health you just through on a couple quick hots and cheetah form away 30 years and restart the fight. And you can sneak up in stealth on someone before opening with a huge starfire crit and a 3 sec stun
---
I would like to know too, heard the best is combat/assisnation build. But in all honesty I have no clue
---
For my alt, nothing beats female NE for a hunter. Such a great bow shooting animation. Orc male comes close but that’s Horde so it’s out.

---
A devoted resto shaman is not that popular. A lot of people play shaman because they want to pvp/dps. If you're 100% devoted to healing, and your talents/gear reflects that, you will be a rarity.
---
alliance and those prettty maps, ~~just like twitch girls~~ no soul only appearance..
---
Why don't you do the quest after lvl 6-7 for bear form? It's worth your time inho
---
Really?! I couldn't d be remember. Anyway, they kept changing it as the people who understood this gave up and left.
---
Same for me! I always loved Vuljin and played an troll shammy to 40ish as well as an alt. I remember wondering if they where ever going to do "advanced classes" and let me make a shadow hunter!
---
Yeah, I didn't realize how long it was until I tried to post it. I was actually over the limit and had to edit a few things out.
---
I considered splitting this one up into even more posts but I think it all had to flow together to make sense.
---
Real quick. It’s a slippery slope, but I see what he means. Would be cool to see more legendary weapons, but still make them very hard to obtain.
---
&gt; The offhand weapon can only be weared in the offhand, so it has no affect on tanking.
---
I meant there might be better weapons that I want for tanking anyway, since I'm not sure only using the dal'rend mainhand is that great.
---
I think most of the elves became Banshees.
---
After I finished reading this post.
---
"I thought it'd be Aug 27th by now!"
---
Probably the same amount of time spent eating as a warrior
---
You'll be behind hunters until tier 3 most likely, and you won't have the Tranq shot that keeps hunters around.
---
Find a chill group with a bunch of locks and get your attunements done early, if you're fine with being a lower priority to play the class you want you'll be fine enough.
---
"So much variance" good don't take the cookie cutter builds and experiment and make up one that fits your play style.
---
Early in TBC myself and 15 other hunters in my old guild went to the Draenei starting zone, the hostile NPC's would set off snake trap and if we zerged down the guards quick enough the snakes would auto target the dozens and dozens of level 5 space goats.
---
His commentary is just so clean, accurate, he plays well tactically and mechanically. Definitely my favorite pvp content creator lately.
---
I'll be 26/25/0 till phase 2 then PI spec the rest of the way. I cant can stand the mana inefficiency of tri spec even with silence lol. Might go shadow to meme sometimes but don't like it too much
---
So you are saying just uploading a video is enough to succeed? If that was the case then the people im trying to appeal to would be successful themselves. I understand your suspicion you don't know me, but you have to understand that this is aimed at creators who arent successful at all, they want to get into it but are struggling. The creators im aiming at can only benefit, if they feel they aren't then they can stop contributing, it isn't like they will be forced to create content.
---
the ovjective answer is: no.
---
If you’re trying to tell me Ironforge at Christmastime has no soul, you’re basically the grinch
---
The best PvP Rogue specs are a mix of Sub and Assassin. If you don't have Prep you're gimping yourself.
---
This WASNT true in vanilla. I played only on PVE servers and could run to Goldshire to the darkmoon faire without being flagged.
---
I could quest in Darkshore, run to Westfall to run alts through the deadmines without being flagged. 
---
On vanilla PVE servers you’d only flag if you attacked an NPC or tried to go into an opposing factions city. 
---
You could sit blue /unflagged and watch the tarren mill /south shore battles without being involved as long as you didn’t flag up, heal someone or attack someone!
---
Now, granted, I stopped playing in 2012 when Cata was released, but very much doubt a horde now auto flags in westfall!
---
I was literally not singling you out or being sarcastic. Everyone else keeps calling it Spell Power everywhere else, this thread, other threads, discords, streams, everywhere. I'm just curious as to how/why/when it changed. I / the communities on servers I played on always called it spell damage.   
---
Slightly defensive today?
---
Ragnaros-EU right?
---
Must suck having people line up to give you money ;)
---
Honestly, they could limit it to the starting zone (Ex: Northshire), the two followup zones (Ex: Elwynn Forest &amp; Westfall), and maybe even the nearest capitol (Ex:StormWind), and that would probably handle enough of the community that's just there to look around and check out the game.
---
Nobody cares.
---
Things like this would be so cool, keeping the game vanilla but just creating new zones within the vanilla world that fits the vanilla feel of ogres, goblins, etc
---
hunter does have the highest aoe in wrath with multi shot + volley.
---
Made me laugh harder than it should have
---
Why rumbleshot ammo, is not the crate instant respawning? I did not check that on stress test. You can try to group for the diary in the cave but it can be hectic.  
---
During the second stress test the mobs you need to kill for better brew or something (snow leopard, ice claw bear, elder boars) took forever to respawn so that one might be dead in water as well.    
---
In darkshore there are some annoying to find enough mobs during the 525 something quest or previous part of the chain.    And there is the mushroom cave that might be camped to death.    
---
Maybe the time limited killing quest in loch modan if you do those.    
---
In the map south of darkshore, there is I think a quest chain part of tower of something where you need to kill cultist and retrieve an orb which has a low chance to drop.   
---
Same when you have to kill satyres for horns or something, they barely drop any and you can single kill a whole camp of them.
---
How can you hate troll, its the absolute chillest
---
Its pre-raid BiS due to its stats... What do you mean? If mages could use maces they would use it as well.
---
way ahead of you
---
Stop watching the streamers then. No one is forcing you to burn yourself out by watching others play the game.
---
Darnassus was the only port I ever wanted, SW and IF are close enough to fly or tram, but taking a boat to darnassus and then flying to winterspring? Fuck that
---
it's not as bad as it sounds. more than half the posts you see on reddit are just parroting stupid shit they read from youtube comments or other posts. just being a generally nice person goes a long way but ofc you need to find a guild

Classic will be the most successful and populated mmorpg in NA and EU in 2019 - and it came out 15 years ago.

I want like 30 legendary wepons but tough to get so like 1 person per server has each

I used eyes of the beast and then walked while I was controlling the pet.
---
I've started playing wow around the release of AQ patch, I remember that is the first thing that took my attention, the poster of that Scarab thing looking down on you.
---
I got sunk in the game so much that I loved every part of it. I was a total noob. running around on my Undead Warlock past lvl 20 seeing those other warlocks with Voidwalker and Succubus, I did not know how to acquire them but that made me love the game even more. gave me a goal that took me days to figure out.
---
It was the adventure and the mystery, the social aspect of it. seeing that Player in Tirisfal Glades and then few days later I see him again in the Barrens. and then again in Orgrimmars Auction house or Valley of Honor.
---
Looking at a player from far away without clicking on his character or reading his name. you would know who that player is from his gear and his mount.
---
Just outside Orgrimmar, you would see the people who are always dueling each other. and after few duels you see them group up to queue for some BGs or run some dungeons together. 
---
I could say a lot more about what I liked about the game. but to answer your question my friend they killed the game for me when they added the following features.
---
LFG was the first thing that I kinda had mixed feelings about. I was ok at first but then I realised that it wasn't that great, sure it is convenient to queue up for a dungeon but at what cost? the server community did not need to interact with each other to do dungeons anymore.
---
LFR... oh man I might get a lot of hate for what I'm going to say...
---
In my opinion, it was the biggest mistake Blizzard ever made, first thing they hype up this giant Dragon, Deathwing and all of his big titles... he calls him self THE CATACLYSM for god sake dies the first day of Dragon Soul patch. end bosses used to mean something, entering raids used to mean something... hell I remember asking my friend to give me an invite into his Lich King save just to see the throne room.
---
The greedy feature:WoW in-game Shop, for some reason it disconnects me from feeling immersed in the game. every item you acquire has a story of how you acquired it. but having an outside reward that is not tide to attending special events or such is a big no for me.
---
After that, the game turned shallow for me.
---
And finally... The final straw that broke the camels back was CRZ and all its phasings it literally killed wow for me and the magic(social aspect) that held it together. 
---
Why do I still play? well because of the people I've met during the golden age of wow, they are the reason why I keep subbing from time to time.
---
Now I know Blizz made most of these changes out of love for the game, they wanted to improve it and make it more fun. I also believe that change is good, who would have known what could have happened to wow if it stayed on the same classic formula, maybe we wouldn't be having wow classic again. maybe the game would have died a long time ago and we wouldn't be here reminiscing about a 15 years old game that we all love.
---
30 mins sounds fast.  I feel like it takes just 10 minutes to run the whole thing in retail oneshotting every boss for xmogs.  Its a big place.
---
Get carried or don't get invited to raids.
---
If you're going to directly correlate the decline of retail wow to the addition of arena then there's no helping you and no point to this conversation.
---
Seriously... delete twitch and just wait it out.
---
I’m not saying you have to sway the complete opposite direction, there’s a balance.
---
Suboptimal specs are fine if people are willing to carry you, that’s the reality of it. You can say the same about other classes where people don’t put in effort but suboptimal specs are gonna take a shitload of effort to be on par with people that aren’t even trying.
---
agreed, dwarves are ugly as hell.
---
The one thing I've noticed about classic wow dugeon/raid design is that the layouts don't look like they were designed with a specific path in mind. More like what an actual dungeon or raid would be like. Over the years, the newer raid content started to look more and more like a predetermined path where the rooms and boss locations were weirdly wide open spaces specifically designed for a fight. Kind of like FFXIV fights. I never liked that. I much prefer raid designs like MC or BRD where it felt like the player was actually busting into an enemy fortress that they were actively using and living in.

---
Not to mention the streamers have revealed all the bugs that are turning people off.  The complaints about how the game is easier than it should be only exist because people are watching streams.
---
Damn the game is going to suck cuz this one guy might play a bit less. Oh how we will miss him
---
Awesome, thanks for this!
---
Well, I am, but yes it does break stealth. You need to use it before entering stealth.
---
good thing diablo 2 have 3 layer of difficulty + patches making content harder + seasonal reset...

Can you cast dispel magic in shadow form?
---
This topic has been discussed multiple times a day, and the general consensus is that for raiding you want to play the optimal spec. So for shaman, that would be resto spec. If you’ve read the other posts about this topic, and already made up your mind to play a sub-optimal spec, that’s fine. Just realize you won’t be as highly sought after for PvE content. That doesn’t mean you won’t be able to find a guild to take you, or be able to find PuGs, it just means you’ll have a harder time to get a group.

Of course im saying it as a joke even tho i would like to. But thats a problem they are gonna have.

Why stop at wrath? Some People think MOP was the Best expac.
---
Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time to get snacks while you are in flight paths.

I agree, but Blizzard blatantly wanted to slightly change the imbalance, they just went way too far eventually.

Rumor is that you can grind quicker to rank 14 quicker than you could reading this entire post talking about the grind.......!

So, I was determined to make a hunter and after playing one thing that really got to me was the dead zone. I got to 40 and i just don't think i have the energy for how complex it is to be a good hunter in pvp. 
---
Thoughts on where a BM hunter will rank in organized battlegrounds? i don't see any spec able to put out the damage a BM will in pvp due to the amount of mobility options classes have to get in the deadzone.
---
Yes m8
---
Brilliant
---
"but i wipe my own ass"
---
That screenshot really says fuck all.
---
I think it will, at least for 3 months, after that I believe some people will stop paying the subs
---
Some people like not using quest helpers on their first adventure.
---
You're right about the scaling. Shield Slam gets most of its damage from its base damage. They actually kinda gutted it in 1.11 when they gave it scaling, because it used to do about 20% more damage *without* scaling than it does with... except maybe if you have extremely good (AQ+) gear.
---
Either way, I'm confident that the extra mitigation from having a shield and Prot talents will help make up at least some (but certainly not all) of that difference. Shields basically double your armor rating and let you block.
---
I'm not familiar enough with the mitigation formula to know if there's a hard and fast rule for how much extra EHP each point of armor gives you, but after looking at a grand total of two data points it looks to be something on the order of 25-30% extra EHP for having a shield (percentage points, so eg. 120% EHP without shield and 150% with). And then you have blocking on top of that.
---
It's banter you dumbass xD if alliance players had dicks they'd join in
---
You could play a million characters and that mount will never drop
---
Hi there, I have been playing rogue at a high level since vanilla and can answer all of your questions.
---
First of all, in regards to a rogue spec, do you fancy playing with swords or daggers? Generally, daggers are more cooldown and burst based while swords are more consistent damage and control based. I prefer daggers but a lot of top rogues use swords! Its all preference.
---
Hi, /u/Tenoke

---
Has a lot to do with the hunched forward posture of the male and the slow motion running animation. Plus the size and posture covered up the casting animation to some extent, which could be bothersome in PvP situations where I wanted to see a cast animation on an instant spell. The other thing is that I always felt like I had a bigger hitbox than I'd had on the undead character I race changed from.
---
I'd probably like a Zandalari troll more.
---
Dont forget the early owls w/ screech
---
People who play on private servers are I am guessing in different league than your average retail player.
---
To play on a private server means that you are invested and you went out of your way to get to play the game.
---
But your average medium/bad casual is just in it for the lols...
---
Obviously no data or anything behind this other than my feels.
---
But I suspect strongly that the worst private server players are in the medium upper medium range of player skill in retail and same will be true for classic retail.
---
barrens.chat's speedrun list has a 1:25 Tauren Shaman run on a Private server - 1:12 and 1:14 on private repacks.
---
Yeah, they are both classes who's strengths lie in utilising their utilities optimally to be good. If someone wants to throw hardcasted spells for damage, destronlock is a better option!
---
Wtf I got in an argument with a hunter yesterday and said that a priest would just dispel viper sting and he said they couldnt. I looked and dispel is listed as holy
---
It shows a month of views and revenue, what else do you want?
---
Hunter DPS is good in MC, yeah. However, their DPS doesn't scale up as much when content gets released, so they're not a high bar of standard. I only have personal anecdotes within my own guild up till AQ40, and even though our SP had pretty much BiS caster gear, he could not reach mages/warlocks/warriors/rogues. Not even on Vael (where for once mana is not an issue), because of Mind Blast's extra high threat. I don't know how they fare in Naxx, but my speculation is that it's not that great.  
---
But as I mentioned in my post above, I think SPs strong points are the utility and buffs they bring to others, rather than raw DPS. That's why I'd want a SP in my raid at least.
---
The "one of many" philosophy. You are not THE hero. You're A hero, born of many others, that rose up to the challenge of saving the world.
---
I forgot to say that I even started playing in a private server and therefore by the time the game is out I will already have experienced the game for 3 whole months
---
I remember doing like one or two boss a night back then. We where so newbs.
---
 I actually had a buddy warrior that wasn’t even using hamstring against my hunter when dueling. He ended up at 2300+ rating in arena S3, so hopefully he did get better at TBC, like most of the players !
---
This is what I hope is the right anwser, but after the first 2 minutes of this post being up I've already got 3 drastically diffrent replies. As a wise man once said.... ***This gunna b goooood.***
---
This is a good idea. 3 versions of a server. Restrict names and merge when dead.
---
Itemization is different in 1.12 as well. MC won't be difficult for pugs IMO
---
How good would a Hunter be at farming similar levelled mobs compared to a Warlock or Mage? Which class would be most efficient?
---
How is this more low effort than half the posts here?
---
I deleted twitch 2 weeks ago best advice ever
---
Not OP but I enjoyed enhancement very much in TBC. Dual wield was different but TBC through Wrath we got some amazing tools for soloing group content. But it's always been a thorn in my side that they gave 1h axes to rogues.
---
Are you looking for the one answer that tells you what you want to hear? Or are you looking for the reality of the situation.
---
That's actually extremely good, especially up front.
---
Most people's video will not earn 20 dollars of ad revenue unless it is getting serious views.
---
Decursive is still an addon, it just doesn't auto select. It has a tiny square for each player, a super mini raid frame, and you left click on red cells, right click blue cells to decurse/cleanse. I use it on dps toons that can help cleanse. 
---
Anyway, the addon will most likely exist, just not in it's super old vanilla state. Same with healbot and others.
---
I agree with what you're saying about how PvE still involves competition between two players over resources and mobs within an area. 
---
For me though, and possibly others, if it's me and someone else just competing in that way, I feel like some sort of jerk for tagging a mob right before they tag it. Or running up and mining a node while they're standing right on top of it killing a mob.
---
With PvP, the competition seems to have more justification and meaning to me. We're opposing factions in a world at war. I'm _supposed_ to kill them. 
---
I can see it either way, for different people with different perspectives. But that's how it seems to me.
---
You don't like the dragonball z kami hami ha? My only issue is how bad a lot of the armor looks on them.
---
Probably the best race for Hunters. You are not relying too much on guns. Dwarf seems cool but Shadowmeld enables you to do things that no other class does.
---
It especially shows in battlegrounds. A night elf hunter is so much more dangerous defending an AB base.
---
If beliving that helps you, sure 🤗
---
I mean...it would eliminate the risk of a whoopsie pregnancy. Unless you're an incel and won't be having any sex period. The thing with a vasectomy is it puts the contraception in your control. No risk of pills not working, chick "forgetting" to take them, etc.
---
My granddad used to day "You don't go to a whore house looking for a kiss.".
---
Informative, concise and useful information for improving.  I can dig it.  I'm in the dark completely on macros, so this was really helpful.  I had no idea you could implement mouse over casting.  This is like the difference between quick cast and normal cast in league of legends.
---
No, it says exactly what was asked. Those are the vital statistics for his channel, you just aren't knowledgeable with what you are looking at.
---
Lol i meant for that zone change but great joke 10/10
---
I hate to break your bubble, but there's next to no chance other weapons are competitive. Ashbringer, Sulfuras, and other weapons are about 200 dps behind MCP in Naxx. Procs can happen off SoC, but SoC+3.5 weapon is upwards of a 300 DPS loss over MCP+SoR. You're better off using Jackhammer than Sulfuras or Ashbringer. Speed matters more than literally anything else. 
---
The proc rate on Shadow Oil and Chili are flat, there is no locked PPM. the slower your weapon the worse these consumables are. Ret does not have the scaling it needs without these. 
---
The build revolves around the 1.2 attck speed getting a shit ton of procs on flat % rate procs, and the speed lets you ignore maxing hit and crit. The fast speed artificially inflates Vengeance uptime as well. MCP is also proccing 2.1 speed SoR on a 1.2 swing time, so SoR's value is just shy of doubled with MCP. Even weapons like Blade of Hanna or Jackhammer should be better than big 2h weapons and SoC. 
---
Fast attack+SoR is really just about the only reason ret is viable now. If you want to do your own thing, fine, but even the MCP is middle of the pack, you will probably do pretty dogshit damage if you use a slow 2h. 
---
Keep in mind ret is still a janky borderline meme, you cant really afford to deviate much. I genuinely hope there's an alternitive to MCP, but it doesn't look like there is. Don't hold your breath on it.

You're right, it is for MMOs. 
---
But not MMO **RPG**s.
---
You have no one to blame but yourself man. You’re burning yourself out on streams and private servers yet you blame Blizzard?
---
No Google search will refute his point. Now quit being a racist  that rushes to the defense of no one
---
Zero proof of whose channel it actually is.
---
&gt;  Just realize you won’t be as highly sought after for PvE content. 
---
I know. But on the other side of the same coin, if there are 20 DPS rogues in a guild, alot of them will be sat. Thats also not a preferable situation for anyone.
---
I have played every expansion, some significantly more than others.  I don't need to know the exact date something was introduced to understand the negative effects of it that can be easily seen.
---
It is very much a when, I can guarantee the channel will get the requirements for partnership even if I have to make all the content myself. It needs 1k subs and around 40k views, that is more than achievable.
---
It was done in Asheron's Call. One of the first 3 big MMOs (the smallest of the 3, of Everquest, Ultima and it) Housing had a big cost and maintenance, rare lower level item needed, and they were sprinkled throughout the real world, and later on they added mass apartments inside of dungeons that had portals to them to try to deal with the lack of housing for the incredible demand. However this game also has a much different design philosophy, there's lots of "empty" space in the world of Asheron's Call. 
---
It was super cool, if you had a house, but I can't see a way for WoW to do it outside of instanced houses.
---
They are devastating against warriors because of their damage reduction and shields mean the warrior just can't get any rage. 
---
Rogues have similar issues with dealing melee damage.
---
Mages can't lock them down very well because priests can dispell both defensively and offensively. They can also silence on a very short cooldown.
---
Warlocks have huge problems with them because their dots are useless and the high shadow resistance means they pretty much have to throw curse of shadow on them instead of tongues or agony. 
---
Hunters have a fairly easy time against them because of the shadowpriest's limited range on their abilities and also viper sting is devastating to such a mana hungry class.
---
Druids can usually outlast a shadowpriest but they have problems dpsing them down.
---
Paladins can't do much against them.
---
Shamans can be tricky because they purge their shields and buffs. They are prone to being bursted down though and they have troubles locking the priest in place so they can hit them. 
---
Their mind blast hits very hard even without much spell damage and shadow word pain is the strongest dot in the game, especially with the duration increase which actually makes spellpower add extra damage to each tick. 
---
Their great weakness is their mana though and a good shadowpriest has to pace themselves in order to succeed. Another weakness is that they don't have a consistent nuke spell like shadowbolts, frostbolts etc. Their mind burst has a cooldown and they have no instant "finisher" abilities like shadowburn or fire blast.
---
But it doesn't bother you when there's a person on your faction taking your mobs and resources?
---
Fine Tarren Mill.
---
Its called self control.
---
A bunch of warriors and ret paladins pretending like this is classic for the pvp buff.
---
This change fucks mages/hunters.
---
Yes but streamers aren't forcing themselves into your apartment and making you watch, it's all your choice.
---
Without the context you cut out, this is pretty worthless.
---
Everyone and their mother has Echayakee. Only cool if your Ally imo
---
really? Thats surprising since you'd have to travel so far for training. I guess It makes sense to go for 3 or 4 levels and then get training when going back to westfall
---
I mean the music is the best part of Stormwind. Ironforge is a better city on how it works but it doesn't have the epic music that Stormwind does and that's why it isn't as good. Plus Ony buff.
---
My MMO days are over. My watch is done. Maybe when I'm retired but until then life has just gotten in the way.
---
I'm looking for all the anwsers, doesn't mean I can't have hope :)
---
Yeah it's basically lag compensation which isn't required when you are fighting a mob
---
Yes I am. I am a consumer, I want to consume. If I cannot consume the good product therefore I will find a way to consume it the only way it is possible.
---
Me too.  Told the wife it's to play Wow Classic and she said "OK Honey, have fun!"
---
And then I requested the week off and told my boss it was for Wow Classic, and it got instantly approved.  He's gonna play too lol.
---
Why? Are you expecting we will be returning to the times of Ghengis Khan and killimg looting and raping soon? If you've had the kids you want no reason not to do it.
---
A poster up above had a good idea. Credit to /u/_Falathrin_
---
Make 3 versions of every server. Illidan A, Illidan B and Illidan C. Restrict names across all 3, then merge to a single illidan once the population stabilizes.
---
Okay you got me. Except only one of those points is the reason we have layering ("Players don't have to wait to complete objectives.") and 3 of them don't apply at all to layering (3,5 and 6).
---
It's not Blizzards fault you have zero willpower.
---
I don’t see how layering would have players stay in one location. I understand the concern but the parallels don’t line up.
---
Playing every expansion means nothing here. You stated that sharding ruined expansions. It did not, because it wasn’t in them. Whether or not you played has no bearing on what you’re saying now, because it’s literal bullshit.
---
well.... people were looking for original, real content on this subreddit. here is some
---
really enjoyed the first post and this one is even deeper.  (about 1/3 of the way done though)
---
You are talking out of your ass, mate. It’s not as great for every class but it is practically a must-have for Alliance hunters.
---
If you ever played battlegrounds in slightly serious groups you would probably appreciate the value of a defending hunter that can stealth. They can solo stall caps in AB almost forever.
---
The most fun I had as a healer was solo healing as a disc priest during MOP when and where I could in 10 man heroic before mythic came out. Solo heal/tank Heroic Garrosh was incredible fun and a great sense of achievement.
---
Yeah, my main is gonna be pve and then I might roll some pvp characters on another server if I truly get bored. I like wPVP, but nothing annoys me more than being ganked by someone &gt;10 levels above me, or killing someone and then them calling a whole battalion of friends to come corpse camp me. I remember playing on pve during vanilla and I thought it was fun, especially since I love leveling alts
---
Shadowmeld is the best PvP racial for every class that can get it. It's useless in endgame PvE, but Warriors still like being NE for 1% dodge and Hunters don't have a strong alternative. Rogues that use daggers instead of swords also might as well go NE.
---
No because they're my ally, they're on the same faction, I can try and out farm them as a friendly competition.
---
I'm ok with half of the players out there being my ally and passively competing with me.
---
I just want a more active competition with the other half.
---
whoah, didn't see any int in the set bonuses
---
Addons like Spy work by scanning the combat log for abilities that happened around you, and the game sends you info about everyone. That will work 100%.
---
Can't give you a radar, as I don't think that's ever been possible but will tell you if an enemy is nearby and using abilities. I think auras buffing also counts, so it can be pretty good at that.
---
Hell yeah Brother!
---
Is there a series of these anywhere for all classes?
---
It really doesn't matter how "good" it is. The amount of money is so low, it's not worth giving this guy who hasn't been relevant for 8 years the claim to your content and an unknown share in any future revenue.
---
Watch out, guys, we got a white knight out in the wild.
---
I am not saying it's the role factor...I am saying it played a part in it.
---
By killing world PVP and Nerfing classes with also removing fun spells.
---
But it's not just open world. Battlegrounds dont change your stats or alter on use itens
---
you’re comparing apples to oranges
---
Until they get within 15 yards of you and there's no getting back in range lol.
---
You asked for revenue, I provided it. If you wanted proof you just needed to ask -  [https://gyazo.com/ec630317d6b546cd2dc97de106f99fd8](https://gyazo.com/ec630317d6b546cd2dc97de106f99fd8)  there, the same screenshot but it also includes my channel name. Feel free to check it out on socialblade. The channel has been dead pretty much for years until the last 3 months where I decided to get back into it all again.
---
I do. I saw that you have to find everything by yourself and when you don't know anything about the maps or the game in general I find it hard :D
---
ladies and gents, people who are fun to play with don't join guilds that make you treat it like an obligation. Its a game, not a job.
---
You hate that every major city is basically an atm? I'll be selling ports and enchants for sure.
---
The more I see, the more convinced I am that Blizzard went with some crap nerfed version of Classic in a stupid attempt to appeal to retailers.
---
THis makes me much less excited the classic.  mindless spamming with no risk of death is boring.
---
If we were able to clear content a decade ago being inefficient, I don't understand why people nowadays are so insistent on min-maxing. If anything we should be intentionally gimping ourselves to make the experience more challenging and memorable.
---
SL1 Dark Souls anyone?
---
Alright I'll fill you guys in on my secret for Classic launch - 50 pounds of homemade beef jerky.  You're welcome.
---
Is there one of these for rogues?
---
What would you like to see so that I can convince you otherwise? They asked for revenue so I provided that, they asked for proof so i've also provided that.
---
Change enhancements to enhancements.  Sounds like you’re asking for enchanting (the profession) not variations of gear.
---
Lmao
---
The thing is, this game has had so many players over the years your bound to get a massively varied response. 
---
There will be guilds who let you raid as you like, others won’t. Some players will expect certainly specs from players, others won’t! 
---
All you can do is play the game the way YOU want to, where you have the most fun. Then find a guild who appreciate that, and will let you raid as you are. 
---
Loads of guilds are recruiting already, so do your own research, and find one which suits your play style, situation and aims. 😀👍
---
\*\*\*System error: Option 1 cannot be combined with options 2 and 3\*\*\*
---
Paladin has the best set of them all, the player decides the set bonuses! No but really, paladin is the only class i know nothing about, im not sure what they would want as set bonuses
---
Some gay people think it's an insult to be able to have children
---
Not doing all you can do to help a team that is trying to progress is selfish.  You are basically asking them to pick up your slack because you are going in with the intent to underperform.
---
But honestly, that's only if you want to swim with the big fish.  I'm sure there will be plenty of guilds that are just happy to be there and don't care, but I don't expect them to be getting as much good loot either.
---
Jewian where's Jewian? LOL
---
It does not make sense for new characters though.  One moment your killing rats and in the next week your're a faction champion.
---
As I said I am not shitting blizzard or streamers. I am just put it out loud that I think this is bad for the game in the long term.
---
Would this have to be exclusive content for your channel or can these videos be mirrored on their own channels?
---
Yeah idd you really feel like you matter in a more deep sense.
---
There is difference between being carried because you dont care and are disrespectful and being carried because you are a core part of the guild and everyone is there to have fun and clear raids together. And they are happy for you to be there doing your weird thing while they race for top dps spot on a human rogue.
---
Obviously a lot of the early guilds that will be pushing raids will be people playing more seriously so you wont fit in with those guilds. But later down the road after a phase or two plenty of guilds will be casually doing mc and maybe dipping into bwl. Which for 80% of wow players is just as much or more than they ever saw during vanilla and will suffice.
---
Hunters didnt have disengage in vanilla!
---
It doesn't. Calling it world of warcraft doesn't mean the world has to be in a constant state of war. Just like calling something Red Dead Redemption doesn't mean that the world has to be Red or Dead. Calling something Half Life doesn't mean it has to involve radiation, calling something Dead by Daylight doesn't mean you have to be dead by daylight and so on and so on.
---
Trying to appeal to the name to match your own subjective expectations is asinine.
---
I thought priests cant dispell poison, not sure brother
---
Having kids brings the magic back to everything. People around here always talk about how you can't relive your first time playing wow. Having kids is about the closest you can get. You get to see them experience things for the first time and how excited they get. It's great.
---
Ones where you have to wait for spawns, like that tools quest for dwarves / gnomes.
---
For kill x, the spawn rates will be fine. 
---
Just embrace it and have fun. 👍
---
&gt;Then hopefully they're accepting and they can move forward with better information.
---
This is the Internet, that rarely happens.
---
So specifically in Dun Morogh,  I've practiced a version of 1 - 10 that requires quite few kills in the 1 - 5 area as a Warlock.  Basically I skip the wolves,  troggs and boars quest at the start area and rush at level 2 (get it from delivery quest and odd kills)  to the troll cave. There I do the imp quest and 14 troll whelp kill quest.  Return that,  get book quest immediately go do that.  Then return all and you should be 4. 
---
After that do the mug quest back and forth and you should be arouns level 5 in 20 mins with easy, almost no roadblock route.  Doing the book quest is important in order to unlock the two follow up delivery quests. This works really only for warlocks,  for others I would do either quick Felix tools or Boar kill quest depending on what seems manageable to you. 
---
Contrastingly to private servers,  Gris'lok the Cold (?) is around 1 min spawn in beta. Item quests like Rumbleshot and Felix bucket are perfectly good to do.
---
Yea i didnt change the main stats, just focues on the set bonuses. But btw, thats how PVP gear looks for hybrids, some of the pieces only have int + stamina and spell dmg, regardless if you are feral or enhancement for example :D
---
Let's see the 1099.
---
Watching twitch is whats bad. The beta is necessary for us to see how bad layering is for Classic.
---
Not completely exclusive, as we are paying for the videos would like to have priority on it but say after a week they would be free to upload it to their own channels also. Otherwise people would just throw videos at us for the sake of double dipping.
---
If a location is overpopulated, some players will leave to other locations to level.  For example, a human might go to the NE locations to level.  This is generally a really good thing.
---
Oh man. I totally forgot about the fishing pond and the server forum post drama.  Good times. Hope they both come back lol.
---
Not sure the server forum posts will come back since everyone has discord.... but the guild and rivalry drama (both internal and external of your faction) really made for my biggest memories
---
i also remember when a whole other pvp group transferred to our server and it really threw off the equilibrium lol but at least queue times improved
---
This is the problem with these types of questions though. Every day you see people say “I wanna play_____ (Ret Pali/spriest/feral Druid/ele shammy) , but everyone says I won’t get a raid spot. Plz tell me if this is the truth”. 
---
If you want to play a sub-optimal spec then go for it. This game will require so much time commitment to get to the point of raiding, that it doesn’t make sense to roll a class you won’t enjoy playing. At the same time, you need to realize that not every spec was designed for end game raiding.
---
Yeah sure but what do You want them to do? Make you replay all the past content so that it fits your character? The world moves on whether you like it or not. It has happened.
---
Dont join a competitive progression pushing guild and you should be fine. Obviously the early try hard guilds will be full of min/maxed people and they wont have room for hybrids and weird builds. But like you said if you have 75% of a decent raid the rest can fill in as they like
---
Idk. I never played a priest but plan on playing one and I have been doing a lot of learning and theory crafting
---
Seconded. Like for real, seconded. Op, you are not prepared.
---
Rogues with shadowmeld are harder to detect, I believe.
---
I am not blaming them for that, I am blaming then for hyping the game too much too soon
---
Ya won’t be sleeping for 6-7 months anyways. I’ve got 9 month old twins. Caffeine, wow, and knowing not to lay your headset on keyboard if you have to grab a baby are what’s important. Ya don’t wanna be “that guy”
---
Psh, Dwarves have more soul in thier stubby thumbs then all of the Horde's stupid random spikes laying around
---
The dumb thing is they didn't even give a good reason for trying to recreate it. They just said "we want to re-create that *feel*. Like, what, that feel of warriors charging each other and swapping places? You like that? That feel of kicking someone before the cast bar was up and having it not work? You like that feeling? wtf
---
Im not from USA so that isn't possible, also as stated above my channel was inactive for the last few years.
---
Or get to STV ahead of everyone else and quest in peace
---
The issue with tier sets are they tend to have stats that follow this order of importance:
---
Healing (Look at druid and paladin)
---
Tanking
---
DPS
---
So in the case of a DPS warrior they don't tend to want their sets because they have defence, parry, etc on them which are useless stats, even the tier bonuses generally follow the above stat weighting.
---
Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like
---
I'm the exact opposite. Playing on a PS is reinforcing my desire to play it on the modern platform.
---
There is no really good healing addons in Vanilla, and the macro system is a steaming pile of garbage.
---
Bullshit, pure bullshit.
---
Viper Sting is classed as a poison (green debuff border) rather than Magic (blue debuff border) so Priests will need jungle remedy, anti-venom (2 min CD) or resto pot (not rly worth the cost) or a Druid/Shaman to remove it.
---
I think they actually took the wrong lessons from it. They never really deprioritized raid development, they just lowered the barriers to that piece of gameplay. 
---
The most popular, imo, non-raid developments have been all the solo achievements and quests from Legion, and the mythic+ system. Catch ups, more gear, etc. all point players to the current raid tier, but don't excite the sizeable player base that will never be "into raiding".
---
The elves weren't turned by the plague. Only undead made by the plague can be Forsaken.
---
Because they aren't dealing with 10 or even 50k players you dunce.
---
There will be hundreds of thousands and servers will have 10-20k at launch.
---
Layering is 100% necessary for launch. Get over it.
---
Try the new server in a week and you’ll see why layering is the better option
---
The streamers play on a server with 200 players. The times that pservers have reached 10k have usually not been launch and blizz aim to have more than 10k from what i understand anyway. And layering is also a fix for later emptyness of servers not just for making launch nicer
---
Doing the same thing but with more math.
---
lol 6 hours, you won't even be getting to STV in a day.
---
I've genuinely scheduled my tonsillectomy 2 days before release so I have 2 weeks off
---
I feel nervous for what this sub is going to do to you - enjoy classic on the 26/27!
---
There will be plenty of chill 8 month behind guilds, it's a stretch to call them progression.
---
Wouldn't mind that either.
---
Oh I thought dispel was a more blanket cure. It says remove harmful spell in the tooltip so I thought it might just mean any debuff. Thanks for the info
---
please do a reminder to next month and answer this topic. I am truly interested in someone who has the opposite opinion as me. I am serious.  We might be in different cycles of interest or maybe you are the type of consumer that increase his desires a little by a little. I am genuinely interested in other people way of consuming
---
Great post - so much nostalgia! 
---
I remember being in vent with the top cartel on the server on a monday night and hearing them talk about how they were going to stagger their logoffs to make sure they ranked in the appropriate fashion. That's where a lot of the serious PVE players (like me), got to participate a bit in the honor grind to fill out the ranks and keep pushing those Warlord's up the ranks.
---
Forum trash talk was the absolute best - We had rap battles arranged on vent that maxed out servers, iconic callouts and ganks that I still remember. Funny story - I was in discord with some players from back in the day, and I dropped one of the callouts "COMB YO BEARD, IRIPPIUS!" and the place just lit up. Community is what made the game, and experience so damn great.
---
Well written sir. I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
---
I LOLed so hard at this... My wife and I are in the same exact predicament, but I'm going to play Undead Priest and she's going to go a troll hunter.
---
With the exception of this bad boy that did work on Druids. But it doesn't drop until Naxx

Shamans kicked ass in WotLK. I played shammy through vanilla till cata and I gotta say Wind Shear is still my favourite addition to the class. Purge, Wind Shear and Tremor Totem made any spellcasting class' day a nightmare
---
You should most definitely raid ZG, MC, and BWL to get gear. What class are you planning on playing? My dream is too play priest and heal raids, and some day get enough gear for shadow priest pvp so I never have to raid again! that probably wont happen though
---
As Kevin Jordan said it: "the content (raid , dungeon, quests) is the pretext for social interaction" that's what it was about, everything that had been added to the game that removed it, slowly killed it and turned it into a solo game.
---
Also the feeling of accomplishment as a group and at a personal level was important, not everyone gets the same medal for doing nothing that matters . 
---
Catch up mechanism every patch put the nail in the coffin for me.
---
Patch 3.0.2, November 2008. I've seen it called both by people on the pserver I play on. I guess it depends on when the person stopped playing.
---
I recommend you to go watch Asmongold and stop participating in what you dont have interest in.
---
sharding at a world level. Each server has multiple copies of the world and you can jump between them by switching groups and things of the sort.
---
You can buy a potty seat at CVS or Walgreens
---
You dont think it would be worth a jungle remedy to remove a viper sting in a 1v1 fight. Dont shadow priest have a hard time with mana already? Should you just focus and burn the hunter down before you go oom
---
3) Prevents people from cluttering at various locations and the chaos that ensues
---
If people have to stop at a quest objective or wait around for something to spawn, people tend to clutter.  You can have interesting stuff pop up when this is the case.
---
5) You can stay in the exact location you want - no need to go outside of your comfort zone.
---
Overpop encourages players to level in other locations, which is actually a huge boon to having a thriving world.
---
6) Players don't have to waste time running around the world, getting sidetracked by random happenings, exploring alternative paths, getting involved in unique conflicts, because they can just complete their desired objective without interruption as planned.
---
Same thing as 5.  If you're stalled out on levelling, you'll do other stuff.  Pvp, group up, go to another location, etc.  People getting out of their seemingly assigned paths.
---
Whirlwind and overpower.
---
I wish I had kids to help a rank 14 grind. I'm thinking of adopting a couple of korean children.
---
Your an idiot
---
What’s the rotation for this spec? I’m intrigued by it for leveling. Seems like the no imp evis might be a problem. Could you take out from improved poisons to evis?
---
But you do need to follow up, it can repair itself after being snipped. 
---
Happened to my dad, thankfully no surprises there, but he, uh, wasn't shooting blanks in his follow-up appointment. Had to have it redone.
---
Right, as mentioned you just aren't aware of the context of this. 
---
You can do a LOT of things to make more money. 
---
The goal isn't for you to suddenly quit your job and start making youtube videos for profit. Its an opportunity for those who already make videos as a hobby or part time job and are looking for another opportunity to branch out.
---
I don't know why you are so overly skeptical, but you aren't doing much here other than naysaying.
---
If it comes out its a scam or something, then talk like this, but until then, settle down. 
---
This is a legitimate offer and having a proper youtube community channel back like the old days is really something many people would love to see.
---
If you aren't one of them, then that's all good!
---
The way this layering shit is looking so far, is like LFGing the entire continent. You get invited to a group, you get ported to their alternate reality, complete a quest and leave party, get ported back to another alternate reality, and may never see those players ever again because they all might be on a different shard. 
---
People think it’s supposed to bring us together better, but we know already from BfA that it actually separates us. 
---
Classic is about living in one world community.  
---
Layering is not good for what Classic represents.
---
I'll be avoiding that by being the first one to STV. I'd love to roll on a PvE server but unfortunately there are no quality guilds I could find that are also rolling on a PvE server unfortunately leaves me with PvP
---
Yes, the gays are beginning to use the terms ‘breeder’ and ‘hets’ to be derogatory towards normal, procreating human beings.
---
Aww. I'm sorry she hurt you. Go see a therapist you retard.
---
You know you can strafe using A D + holding right click right?
---
Imagine thinking the amount of players that play on pservers even comes within the same universe as the amount of players that there will be on launch.
---
I used to love it when I ganked someone enough that they would get on an alt to send me hate.  Can you imagine my boner from getting 1k+ from ganking someone?
---
i'd actually enjoy this tbh
---
Watch out guys, we got a neckbeard out in the wild.
---
This post already addressed how 10k, hell, even 12.5k has been proven to be playable. What's your argument?
---
Man ain’t this the truth!  This is the like the golden age for nerds.  We *literally getting Classic WoW back* from Blizzard!  Like has anyone really contemplated this?  Literally the cries and dreams of players for years has come to fruition.  Not to mention,  new Star Wars movies, Palpatine is coming back like we loves in the EU all these years.
---
What a time to be alive guys.
---
thanks, edited the post to be more clear.
---
You can request a 1099 no matter what country you're from.
---
You posted ~11 videos in 2018, ~17 videos in 2017, ~32 videos in 2016, and ~50 videos in 2015.
---
The 1099's from those years will do.
---
yes it does. lmao
---
In group PvP shadow meld is a very strong ability. In pve the night elf racials doesn’t do much for you though, but it is not like you will heal less as a night elf compared to dwarf (you will heal less than a human though). For the 68 of the 72 boss fights that does not use fear as a mechanism, there will be no practical difference between a dwarf or night elf (and for all of those 4 fights having more then 2 dwarfs doesn’t really make a difference) .
---
Very good article about the topic I'd say:
---
https://www.progamerreview.com/something-is-wrong-with-the-world-of-warcraft-a-critique-of-modern-wow/
---
I appreciate the word Gnorf.
---
I remember when I rolled on a PvE server when I was tired of getting ganked. There is nothing fun about getting corpse camped by a max lvl player, but when I got to STV, I disliked a lot more the fact that the world is no longer a dangerous place, were if I get distracted I would die.
---
I don't know, it feels like PvE its the smart choice for a game, but PvP its the world building choice, hard to pick one.
---
Makes sense. I've already made my choice with the shaman, but I would prefer being able to spec enhance for PvP reasons. From what I've gathered, I guess I'll need to keep an eye out for the right kind of guild.
---
Ah, sorry, thanks for confirming.  You ARE actually retarded.
---
Read all but last line 😝
---
really weird stuff was a melee-damage talent for balance druid))
---
That isn't spell batching. That's your internet having issues. None of that happens for me on the beta at all
---
Not to mention the stigma against them is different these days.
---
They play on a server with 200 people, so why is it layered? This is a very good indicator showing how Blizzard will implement layering: when it's not needed.
---
I'm thinking a NE hunter (if I go alliance) just for the shadowmeld in wpvp.  It'll be handy for surprising people, sure, but I also have to AFK now and again and being able to shadowmeld AFK will be quite helpful I think.
---
Isn't it only free to level 20?  Not a hell of a lot of content you can access at that point.
---
I take it Theramore wasn't a destination back then? Or was it not as out-of-the-way for Alliance as Darnassus?
---
It depends on the spec.  
---
A lot of guilds bring a single enhancement shaman, but that's a highly contested spot.  You can raid as resto and collect dps gear for pvp.
---
Hey, not sure if you're interested, but a number of us in similar situation to you. We just started recruiting for an alliance guild, TGIF, that is only focused on Friday night raids 3 hours a week, and you don't need to worry about farming world buffs beforehand either. All other content completely optional.
---
pservers make things hard so people buy gold
---
They will only using layering during early game, phase 1
---
Yeah we were ally and he was a human rogue.  He looked amazing on it and it was such a rare thing.  He walked through IF on it and people would stop and be like "holy hell how did you get that" because this happened at at time when most of the playerbase hadn't even hit max level yet.
---
Good luck leveling to 60 with playing couple of hours a week. Nevermind gearing.
---
&gt;probably 80%~ of the playerbase would never kill a 40 man raid boss
---
&gt;[The world feels a lot bigger if there's unbeaten content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Falm0H7VEiQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m12s)
---
I'm not saying you're wrong with what you said after about "easier content" and things of that nature, in fact I agree with you, I'm just highlighting how much the designed philosophy changed Vanilla to TBC and beyond.
---
I mean pservers would likely have more per server, which is the more relevant number
---
Ahh cool. Sorry for the questions, which of those specs would you prefer for solo pvp situations? Is it possible to survive outside of shadow in 1v1?
---
???????
---
Not tanky enough, and most of them don't want to heal in PVP.
---
I'll go ahead and skip sending randoms on the internet my tax return for now but if you want to see something more realistic i'll see what I can do.
---
Because it doesn’t matter if it’s not needed. It has to be in the game for launch. They arnt going to turn off things that will be on for launch.
---
What is the deadzone?
---
Ironic
---
$20 a video isn't a part time job.
---
If it's your hobby, you also don't care about $20.
---
What you DO care about is control. And this guy would take that away.
---
It doesn't need to be a scam to tell people to steer clear, it just needs to be a bad deal, which this is.
---
What a lonngggggg strange trip been!
---
I will gladly Shaman heal.  We all know enhancement sucks anyway.
---
Don't get your parents or in-laws to move in unless you want to add murderer to the list. The fuck is wrong with you dude?
---
Layering isnt necessary dude. At all. Continue being sheep.
---
I exclusively played a night elf rogue because I loved the race, the saber mounts and the jump flip was too awesome not to have. Shadowmeld was a wasted talent but didn’t care at all because I played a race I wanted. Was competitive in raiding and in pvp. Play what you want imo.
---
What starting zone are you running?
---
[It keeps the flavors fresh.](https://youtu.be/urglg3WimHA)

If it is my internet, why would character movement prevent this from happening?
---
How do you get all the ranks of your pets abilities?  Do you have to tame a different beast that has each rank of the ability?
---
Efficiency wise hunter or warlock.
---
But if you aoe farm mage can kill more mobs faster just gotta deal with the mana issue
---
Yeah that happens but it's not common. It's kind of rare.
---
Sylvanas is Forsaken, so are her Dark Rangers
---
👍 gj champ.
---
&gt; Liberal Thinking
---
?? 
---
Nelves are one of the more conservative races, especially if you consider 'progress' to come in the form of arcane magic. They are theocratic reactionary isolationists with strict gender roles in their society (only male druids, only female soldiers, though this is ignored for player characters). They're basically forest Taliban.
---
Depends on what you are looking for. I've always preferred combat. It's reliable and provides invaluable utility with imp. kick and imp. sprint. 
---
But really you should just try out a few different specs and decide what you like best for yourself.
---
lmao!
---
Yeah because babies really care about what you are doing mate
---
You can block out anything that would doxx you. But more likely is that you know it would show you as a fraud not worth giving content control over to for a mere $20.
---
Yes they do my friend. Just not the same disengage as in retail!
---
And if you don't want to smell the cake, you can leave.
---
It is but it also removes a bit of the magic. And you can never undo his: So many people wish they could play WoW for the first time again without all their knowledge.
---
But ofc there is no shame in using quest helpers. But they can make leveling very grey and almost make it feel like work. There is no exploration, no stories and little surprise. It just numbs down to *go to the spot marked X and kill/click* and rinse and repeat perhaps 350 times.
---
It's not - when it comes to a commercial AAA game distributer.
---
Way to waste your time 👋

I also plan to duo level, but yeah I'm guessing that I will spent like 2 hours ( Launch day )  
---
But non the less, then it's always better to practice, than doing nothing :)
---
They are testing it by messing with it. How are you that dense.
---
"Hard mode" dungeons/content always felt like such a cop out to me.
---
It feels like it's a way to avoid designing new content; you just take the existing content and jack up the health/armor/damage/whatever coefficients on the enemies.
---
Yeah I played all throughout TBC, started late Vanilla.  When I hit 70 in early TBC there was a ton of world pvp happening.  I remember being really frustrated at being ganked by druids over and over with their instant flight form and travel form while trying to level my professions/do dailies.
---
I don't think flying was as big a problem as people are making it out to be.  They put in anti-flying in daily quest areas and world pvp was prolific there as a result. I remember something like hammers coming at you from the ground that dismounted, and birds in Terrokar forest that had a high chance to daze?  Been awhile.
---
Lmao good one, you don't have a single clue as to what you are talking about. 👋
---
your post doesn't prove it. you need a source that does

I appreciate that you corrected the date format.

Btw I found this.  https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Item_suffix

Scroll down to the animals and there’s a chart for you.

Maybe this can help.

It happens.  Layering is bad for the EXACT same reasons LFG is bad, and people can't seem to understand that.  It's very frustrating. It's Blizzard doing the same shit again, and fans only seeing the pros but not the cons (herp derp, if I don't have to wait 15 minutes in a queue *one time*, go ahead and fundamentally change the game)
---
Basically what I think too.
---
2.9 vs 3.8 is a 0.9 second difference. Its nearly double the number you cited if you get the slowest 2 hander you can.... I dont call that pretty close.
---
...dad???
---
Some of the BiS lists are kind of ridiculous tbh. Look at the difference between the druid BiS chest til AQ40 and say the Stormrage Chest.
---
&gt;Robes of the Exalted, 11 Spirit, 5 Int, +68 Healing (cloth chest from UD Strat)
---
These stats are great for a druid, an incredible amount of +healing that you won't find anywhere else, but not a ton of other stats.
---
&gt;Stormrage Chestguard, 25 int, 17 spirit, 20 stam, 10 fire resist, 10 shadow resist, 1% spell crit, +42 healing
---
Sure objectively this has less healing, trading off for a touch more spirit, but 20 int is not insignificant, the fire resist makes this usable in FR fights, and while the spell crit isn't fantastic for you, it's not a wasted stat. Is someone seriously telling me they'll wear the Robes of the Exalted if they have a Stormrage Chestguard available to them? 
---
BiS lists don't tell the whole story, they're a good guideline to gear up your character, but make your own decisions on what you need as you go - enforce the needs with data and stats, but don't be afraid to veer away from the generally accepted BiS list to progress your character.
---
This is an issue you get from reverse engineering the 7.3.5 legion client.
---
Yes, but you are aware of what you are fighting against immediately. Plus, they could implement something to "force" disable transmogs in battlegrounds.
---
shamans are perfectly cromulent healers
---
I ... am not sure you understand what RPG means.
---
It will not be a permanent thing.
---
I feel dirty, I just submitted vacation request for the week of the 27th so I can no life the crap out of this game.  Still can't decide on mage or shaman, though.
---
Leave my own house? And also have always the feeling that I cannot comeback to my house because there is cake everywhere?
---
Joke's on you. I'm a rogue, half of these either don't apply or will be the direct result of my actions. See you bitches in STV.
---
I based it not being possible from Googling a 1099 as I wasn't even familiar with what it is. Now I know what you're after I don't see any reason why it's worth it sharing that with the internet?
---
My favorite quest zone is
---
&gt;Stranlethorn Vale
---
Marksman hunters, sure, and you're right, but trueshot aura is part of the unsung heroics of being a hunter. It's definitely there but nobody is ever gonna say anything about it or notice you because of it...pretty much people tunnel vision on the meter.
---
I thought Alcors Sunrazor was BiS for TPS? It's a 1.4 iirc with bonus fire resist because we all know vanilla likes it's fire damage.
---
http://www.wowclassicbis.com/

You kidding? Did you even google?

Pushing this further ahead, why is this?
---
Why do humans have this need? 
---
Is it to further confirm we are right in our mind when we agglomerate with similar minds?
---
Is it for the sense of security offered by our similarly attuned group?
---
And finally and not the least, why somes insist of playing Alliance gnomes ?
---
The mysteries of human nature...
---
STV is beautiful chaos and a really cool zone. ^I'm ^not ^just ^saying ^that ^because ^I'm ^gonna ^be ^a ^rogue
---
Lots of guilds? Who? I only know of one single guild (Onslaught) seriously attempting a Week 1 clear. There’s also another Horde guild attempting to enter MC week 1 and maybe kill a few bosses but they aren’t planning or aiming for a full clear though.
---
The really hardcore guilds are targeting a week 2 MC clear. With Leveling in Beta proving to take more time then on pservers and no dynamic respawns the reality is that no guild is going to clear MC week 1. Heck even the latest pserver launch saw Rag die on day 9, and that’s with faster leveling than Classic will have.
---
Well you should look at phases and rework your bis list 🙈 itemization.info
---
Aw, sad for you. I got to tank a fair bit while leveling with my protadin, but at lvl 58 finding healers who wouldn't need the drops was a pain in the ass :D
---
A realistic 1h axe alternative
---
If we're talking race, then no, the Dark Rangers and Sylvanas are not Forsaken, they're just allies and the chosen leader of the Forsaken. And none but Sylvanas show up until WotLK.
---
Seems like you are going to play an elf ;)
---
I will level with you in pain my friend.
---
Yeah he probably spam watches MGTOW videos on YouTube all day thinking he's gonna become "alpha as fuq" and make that bitch Jessica regret dumping him.
---
Your choice of class will impact your experience heavily. Warriors for example, are notoriously reliant on good gear.
---
I would strongly recommend playing Mage. Caster damage is relatively gear independent and mages especially rely on using abilities to avoid taking damage rather than tanking it. It's a class with lots of outplay potential and much of it's value comes from the gear independent utility of controlling the battlefield with roots, slows polymorph and counterspell.
---
You'll never have the best gear of course but neither will the vast majority of people and the difference will be less significant in the early phases.
---
Im not even asking for full exclusivity, the creators would be free to repost the videos on their own channels after a cooldown period of a week. Anything less and we'd purely be taken advantage of from people trying to double dip.
---
Ran into a Moonkin the other day in Feralas. He said he could support it with his main and strictly advised me NOT to ever do it.
---
You go Moonkin later. Don't level it unless you're absolutely sure it's what you want to do.
---
For those of you who do roll moonkin, you're always welcome in my  groups.
---
Wait, what? Why do suddenly I need to watch Asmongold?
---
tl;dr
---
Exactly.
---
Well fire beats frost mage in a 1v1 90% of the time. But it does horrible vs the majority of others compared to frost.
---
Ok.
---
Absolutely. So my general rotation is Cheapshot, Hemo, hemo at that point you'll be at 5 combo points most of the time. So use your general finisher. I generally open with garrote after i pick pocket before i get cheap shot or on mobs that are immune to stuns. It is also useful to use Ghostly strike on cooldown because it is a percent weapon damage so it hits really hard. I prefer the poison damage but you can for sure get evicerate damage as well. That one is personal preference in that regard.  But generally i try to run using either kidney shot or use slice and dice while leveling to help me kill faster.
---
and this is different from normal mode being used during level'ing, heroic mode as a starter upon reaching 120, then progressing through mythics?
---
but I do love how half the people bash the game for being diablo-like while the other claim to love diablo and hate retail.
---
Yeah, use one and burn the shit out of the bastard by all means but even so, Viper has no CD and doesn’t cost that much mana :(
---
I meant that the resto pot is not worth it.
---
At least stings don’t scale, so as you get better gear, it becomes less effective (still a pita though).
---
&gt;but I think most people agree that launching the game the week school begins for many people is not ideal.
---
We will let the downvotes speak for themselves. You know how kids think adults ruin the fun? That street goes both ways.
---
That's shit for an orc warrior. You can't expect to get those weapons when you hit 60, they are way too rare.
---
Shhh, don't tell them that you've got to let it happen organically. You're ruining all the fun!
---
Don’t feel guilty, my sons birthday is the 28th...
---
I don't wanna doom my potential offspring to a life of WoW though
---
This is a load of bullshit. I played a private server launch in 2017 and there was not only 10k players online, there was around a 10k queue to log in. I managed to level fine and had a blast, even made many friends during that time. The key is to just trigger dynamic spawns in the starter zones. If a group of random ppl can supply a server that supports this, then I think a multi billion dollar company can figure out a way too as well.
---
Ha! That would be awesome.
---
I played Reaps on Thunderhorn.  Led Destined.  Was a jackass back then.
---
I take it you never leveled as a warrior.
---
Imagine comparing classic to wod and then asking people what their argument is 😂

No bgs until phase 2 - wpvp all you want.

If you love her you’ll run to teldrasil
---
You know you can move your camera by holding right click and moving your mouse around? People who don't use Q and E to strafe are missing out on great keybindings for other abilities.
---
You're an idiot. Your argument is trash.
---
^
---
Oh, whirlwind, that's pretty significant.
---
Good to know I’m looking to heal in pvp but barely hit 60 in vanilla so don’t have experience with it.
---
Idk why nobody has mentioned rogue. I mained rogue vanilla (mostly did a lot of dueling vs BGs tho) thru TBC (gladiator); 
---
class is the LEAST reliant on gear in PVP (and has the most interchange between PVE and PVP hear because, other than hit, the stats are transferable and your survivability is CD dependent) and arguably the best solo PVP class
---
Inarguably the greatest arsenal of cooldowns to counter your opponents (tho CDs being down becomes a huge issue)
---
 decent leveling if you maintain first aid, and the ability to skip trash mobs and go straight for quest objectives makes some onerous tasks a little easier
---
Amazing at world PVP/ganking starting pretty much at level 1. 
---
End-game PvE is kinda boring in one sense (it's just a standard rotation, but that's true for every class) but I found positioning as a melee DPS to be sometimes challenging and a lot of fun. 
---
Skill cap is very high but very easy to be decent if you're still learning.
---
Only drawbacks to me are:
---
- playstyle, while always entertaining, is not super versatile (you're CC+DPS in PVP and DPS in PVE and that's it) versus eg priest where you can be DPS in PVP and heals in PVE 
---
- to really excel in PVP you need to master target switching and have decent twitch reflexes for interrupt and vanish juke
---
- there are gonna be a lot of rogues
---
- youre almost never going to use most abilities in PVE -- maybe sap sometimes -- mostly it's just a single Target DPS rotation
---
God god, thank you for the anecdotal support on why not to do it.
---
Usually not no, but it depends on your spec and level of ambition.
---
So we have you doing roughly 60% damage to one mob vs doing 100% dmg to 2-4 mobs w sweeping strikes.   
---
And you MAY have 150% EHP. But, you take dmg more often cause you can't hamstring kite. (sure maybe hamstring kite is broken in classic). The 0.5 second difference in speed you quoted is a myth and is probably closer to 1.2 seconds or so on average. With a 2.7 vs 3.8 speed weapon, you are getting hit 140% more w perfect kiting. But you reduce that dmg with armor, so you get less rage per from the mob. So you do less damage because you have less rage.  If it was raw HP, it would be different, but since you have armor you are stunting your rage gen. You are also stunting your rage gen by doing less damage.
---
Yeah this is a big ole yikes from me.
---
Just wait till the week before classic drops.
---
You can consume your hype then.
---
For warlocks, assuming similar tier take the item with the most stamina (Unless it's something like a +healing neck for e.g) warlocks just want to outlast their opponents in PvP so more stamina makes this happen easier.
---
agreed. i wont be playing hardcore so im just gonna do whatever i enjoy the most
---
Lmao good one. You don’t. Private server teams have been able to do it working off DONATIONS. I know this because I’ve done this three times across two different private server projects. They handled it fine, sure there were some crashes, but a group of nobodies surely can’t do a better job than blizzard right?
---
That bucket can only hold so much.
---
Lifetimes
---
What about improved sprint in the combat tree? Seems really important, especially since rogues don't have cloak of shadows or shadow step.
---
oh gotcha. ill keep that in mind. thanks
---
you mean 1.12
---
Some of the sets are really good for some classes, some are not. 
---
For a hunter for example t1 and t2 is bis, and later t3.
---
Thanks! How about warlock? What are your thoughts on them?
---
A week moratorium might as well be exclusivity.
---
Then just farm DalRend.
---
So Desolace is kinda like the Cold War while STV is akin to full blown Vietnam?
---
Define playable for me. Im genuinely curious on your thoughts. Because I have played on these mega servers where over 10k players are on at launch. You literally have 5+ people camping around a single mob spawn, all vying to get the tag for the xp. "Well level by exploring" I dont want to. I want to play the game how it was original designed to be played. Everyone has to make some sacrifice on launch day, but have a private server launch experience for Classic WoW isn't the route I want to go.
---
Combat is for pve mostly. It's trash for pvp compared to the other trees.
---
Classic is primarily based around the final patch of vanilla (1.12.1) but they are introducing certain pieces of content as 6 individual "phase" releases.
---
Phase 1 is world PvP only with no honor.
---
Phase 2 is world PvP only with honor and ranks.
---
Phase 3 introduces WSG and AV.
---
Phase 4 introduces AB.
---
Yeah I’m not waiting in line for Benedict’s chest. Hopefully there will be mobs to grind.
---
people can abuse that to escape ganks
---
Hey smartass - it's not an enjoyable experience. Get fucked ✌
---
P Servers also use dynamic spawn which lets mobs respawn in seconds, ruining the early economy.   It gets so bad that by the time you clear a cave, the front mobs have popped and you are stuck in it. 
---
It's not a better solution than layering.
---
My only comment is that some euro was mad about the date format but really bad at Photoshop.
---
Actually... leveling as balance is way different than end game and not *that* bad.  Get a good 2h, spec omen of clarity, and let moonfire do most of your dmg while you auto attack.  Don’t spam nukes, just open with them to pull.
---
Between thorns, moonfire every 12 seconds, and auto attack you will kill things quickly enough, but everything is worse than feral overall.  The main advantage is one gear set for healing/DPS more or less, and slightly better at healing overall in dungeons.
---
Now the damn Pokemon theme song is in my head.
---
Ohh gotcha I know what you mean. Definitely give bean another shot though he’s a little more entertaining when he’s in discord with other people.
---
This reads like a philosophy paper.
---
I don't think it's about being right or a sense of security, as much as it's the feeling of being united by something. Why humans have the desire to be together and to be united is a mystery, as is the reason people play Alliance Gnomes.
---
It's worth sharing because it's the best proof you can give of being a legitimate YouTube earner.
---
Nope
---
21/8/22 for awhile, 31/8/12 if you have super gear (5pc nightslayer for 120 energy etc)
---
You can run over the mountains near Gnomeregan and die from fall damage into the Wetlands zone, when you release you're at the spirit healer outside of Menethil - the only issue is if you're going to play a paladin, I don't think the elf areas has a trainer for that.
---
my wife's bf paid for my vasectomy AND my classic sub AND a nintendo switch to enjoy while i wait for classic to drop!
---
im currently snacking on some cliff bars and a soylent shake playing some legend of zelda 😎
---
Haha. You'd be surprised what you're willing to trade for a few hours of sleep. I've never been so tired in my life as those first few days with my twins.
---
LFG is what killed WoW.
---
Man racism in game where 8 different races are killing the shit out if each other. I smell irony.
---
Well he doesn’t want to pay anything for the best items. He will probably ask for a realistic alternative to Devilsaur too.
---
Isnt dps just watching red bars go up and down?
---
I love healing. Not to argue with everyone who prefers dps, that means I never have to fight for a raid spot. 
---
Healing is all about strategy. Knowing when someone just needs a quick HoT to top up, or when to blow a cool down to counter an incoming crit. I get to play God, and let the rogue die because he can't stay out of the fucking fire. 
---
DPS just seems like finding a rotation and doing it forever. I don't get it.
---
&gt;If you dont care enough to get bis then you probably don’t care about weapon skill either.
---
&gt;Then just farm DalRend. 
---
For tanking too?
---
I’m not sure why you’d travel crossfaction, but the only difficulties are NElf and Tauren. The others have easy transport between them with zeppelins or the tram.
---
That depends, are you a meta-fool, or do you like having fun?
---
Good one.
---
For hunter alone there are huge bugs left. I hope two and a half months will be enough
---
Wrong.
---
Most of all players, when they are playing a damage dealer class (mage, rogue, druid, shaman, hunter), always go for more %crit. It does make sense since a crit can end up a fight faster than a fight without crit. How many times you can hear a stream saying "wooah! look at this crit I have done. almost one shot kill him. i am so overpowered." Answer: many time. 
---
Spell crit a paladin is never a good idea.
---
The way decursive worked in vanilla, will not work in classic. That there will be an addon called decursive that is basically just a mouse over macro substitute doesn’t make it «decursive».
---
How decursive worked in early vanilla and on private server, is so that by pressing just one key, it will decide if you cast dispell or abolish disease, it will prioritize who is dispelled first, and it will prevent you from dispelling players that do not need it (like the mana burn on baron geddon fight on melee players). That is what I mean when I say that decursive will not be a thing in classic.
---
Patch 1.9 changed it. So, unfortunately for hunters, yes it is classic. 
---
&gt; Base pet speed is now standardized for all pets, including legacy pets. Pet speed can still be modified through the talent Bestial Swiftness and pet abilities such as Charge, Dash, etc.
---
All hunter pets will now always deal Physical damage for their base attack.
---
That's exactly what I'm saying tho - I'm looking at the stuff and making my own decisions, because I value the increased Stamina, Intellect and Spirit over the 26 extra healing - which by the time you can get to Nef and get that chest piece, 26 healing is minuscule.
---
Oh yeah definitely, vasectomy is still a great option, you should just do exactly what your doc says.
---
pretty sure drums of war was 1.12, which is what blizzard officially is going with
---
It’s ok sometimes people are just flat out stupid and say stupid things. I wouldn’t try helping him if he can’t realize this on his own.
---
Yeah,  they kinda have to write the game based on as if you completed everything possible. Even by Vanilla's standards, by the end of the journey we were no longer simple adventurers. We (Alliance players) were deputized by the Regent of Stormwind himself, amongst earnings renown and respect of some of the most important characters in the setting.
---
Back in vanilla I made my way to Ironforge as a level 14 nelf hunter because the friends who got me into the game kept talking about it being their favorite city. 
---
When I proudly encountered them in the city, after multiple hours and countless deaths, they bursted out laughing and asked me why I didn't ask for a portal as one of them was a mage.
---
Solid no. 
---
The tried and tested rotation with aimed/multi/auto is best.
---
Oh interesting dude - I guess you stopped your research there.
---
FOR PORN
---
Bro pallies wouldn't even toss you a flash of light the fuck
---
Why wouldn't it be your business given how much your quest completions have moved the story along?
---
Ok, so you're an extreme alarmist. Got it.  
---
Have fun expecting the world to cater to you.
---
That's not blind optimism - that's experience with how the process of rolling out features and how betas actually work.
---
Public betas, especially from blizzard, are almost NEVER the most current build of the game at the time. The stuff you're seeing in the beta is just a stable enough build to let the public use. Public betas are mostly a way to test network infrastructure and concurrent user load, and free advertising. 
---
Do you really think they would actually let players stomp all over their most current build, since so many people do what people are doing here, and forming their opinions of the game on unfinished work? No, they just put out a "stable enough" build and wall off content or features that don't work, and iron out the kinks behind the scenes. Any features in the beta that aren't working properly yet have likely been long polished or revised. That'show most software companies do it - unless they follow the EA model, of just releasing their beta version of the game, call it complete, and charging people while they actually finish it.
---
I've worked with stuff like this long enough to know how it works.
---
Yeah this seems way too far. Not what I remember from vanilla.
---
You can right click -&gt; inspect on any of those numbers and edit them to your heart's content. 1099's or go home.
---
Homosexuality is great birth control, just saying.
---
We are talking about raids here.  Please review Classic's phased release plan.
---
This comment makes you sound like a spoiled child
---
Baaaah baaahhhh, yeah go find your Sheppard. If you think Blizz isn't capable of doing servers without layering, you're ridiculous. Private servers can do it? But Blizz cant? Get a clue.
---
Are the streamers in your house?  By your logic, Twitch is the second floor and they are there MANY and MANY floors.  Just go downstairs to another section and  be happy that it's the same house, just without any distractions.
---
Just because you choose to stay in the same room  as the cake isn't our fault.
---
Well I won't be sharing my tax returns in a reddit thread unfortunately. As any sane person shouldn't but take from that as you will, we already know exactly how you'd be regardless of if I did or didn't post it anyway. 
---
As I mentioned though I haven't been active on my YouTube, why? Because ive been working for various MCNs and companies in the scene, one of which was ESL so I must know something at least.
---
Surprising that your first R14s had a BG team around them. Our first two (Gioa and Exid) just hit the grind hard, think Gioa got R14 before BGs were released and Exid was close if not there as well.
---
I do remember that HKs had diminishing returns in the world, so the honor grinders would carebear with you once you got killed three times - but only at that point!
---
I dont see what makes anything "immediately aware" of what you are fighting against in this case. In classic you can easily get 1-3 shot by someone out gearing you. Modern wow it doesn't matter as much because of how the game is designed and balanced. Classic had hardly any balance at all. I understand the plight of it because transmog is about 99% of what I do in retail right now, but I dont think it has a place in a game like classic where your items actually matter.
---
patch 1.12.2 was the final patch in vanilla. where do you get 1.13 from?
---
You can have a few to half, but not a majority.  Raids up to AQ40 are stupid easy, and many people raided while having an off spec.
---
But you can just look at my socialblade and the number match?
---
There will be plenty of guilds doing 1 night clears of MC in phase 1 and BWL in phase 3.
---
I healed just to make my way through raids for good PvE RET gear.
---
I felt like a whore
---
Yes I know about the phases. What makes you think that having method play on NA would give them any benefit though?
---
50 lbs is too much man, lol. 20 lbs would give you the same result. if you gain 50 lbs youll be fat as fuck. unless youve done this before then more power to ya.
---
This is what I did back in vanilla in the 50-59 bracket. I remember dinging 60 and instantly equipping my entire blue PvP set. Awesome feeling!
---
You just need to do enough drugs to make it past the bottle neck to the empty pastures.
---
That would actually be useful! You have to aim for something until you get devilsaur
---
He didn't found him, he found him
---
Legion was pretty awesome though, that's not an insult my dude. It's pretty much general consensus it is the most beloved expansion since WOTLK, as it had great content, added great new systems, had a "Warcraft" feel, etc. 
---
Maybe that's not a particularly high bar considering how many disastrous expansions we've had since WOTLK... but it was still good.
---
Modern version yes, vanilla version no
---
Honestly I think every class is pretty complex if you want to be good at pvp. You need to be using autoshottimer for maximum kiting potential
---
The quests shouldn’t have been written in that way to begin with. Wow went from being regular people in a world exploring dungeons, to everything will end the world if we don’t personally do something. They went overboard and not for the better.
---
are you retarded
---
&gt; They are one of, if not the single most popular class on horde.
---
No they're not. While they're definitely above druid, shamans are middle of the pack popularity-wise. The beta is the only place where there's been a huge amount of shamans, which stems in large part from the fact that the level cap was 30 for a long time and it's kind of overpowered at that level. On actual servers, shamans are behind warrior/mage/rogue, roughly tied with hunter, and ahead of priest/warlock/druid. Smack dab in the middle.
---
What is this, a picture for ants?! [Here's a bigger version](https://imgur.com/thVVdJ6).
---
Starfire and moonfire are arcane.
---
Only wrath is nature.
---
Most people have more willpower than a five year old though. The entire argument you’ve made across your posts is that you literally don’t have the ability to avoid twitch and PS. That doesn’t make beta bad for the game long term. That makes you unimaginably weak willed and kinda sad.
---
If it is anything like pserver fresh I’m skipping STV. Desolace for sureeeeee
---
Get Bone Slicing Hatchet. When DM comes you can get Hedgecutter. Axe skill isn’t THAT important since you build fuck all rage with white hits compared to the rage you gain from incoming.
---
What a copy and paste.
---
Maybe you can't read 👋
---
I turn 30 next December, I will have much more free time than when I was in high school.
---
Don't get snipped. Men who have a vasectomy are more likely to get prostate cancer.
---
Exactly
---
Starcraft Ghost? That was scrapped ages ago,
---
Current blizzard doesn't do it to quite the same degree, but yes, its still there.
---
If you get a lions crest helm recipe you can charge a lot to make it. That or arcanite reaper.
---
Imagine thinking a billion dollar company would be fine with a 10k player queue in 2019.
---
[This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11REn6WuKIsWijjqYoBxf_bVGkofaZ8R07C4vvLM5pE4/edit?usp=sharing) is what I've been doing at work for the last week and a half to map out my Hunter. 
---
Good to see I'm not alone with over-preparing!
---
I’m on a Pserver now . Just started I have a 21 warrior. 
---
I walked from darny to IF, to Booty Bay , to Southshore and everywhere in between in that time. Got my fishing way up and I fish in these higher levels. I’m having the time of my life
---
in vanilla, I leveled to 45 last summer as Assassination before switching to combat. This was PVE. I enjoyed both.
---
Did warlocks not have soul shatter in vanilla? Can’t remember
---
Less than you think. Weapon Damage is normalized so the only difference is in the base damage, the AP scaling is the same
---
You are in crazy land then unfortunately if you feel we need to pay them more than the videos would earn and also let them instantly upload the videos to their own channels.
---
I farmed hearthglen/Tyrs hand for it.  Got lvl 60 and my mount doing this.
---
My favorite PvP spec is 21/21/9. You really excel with scatter shot. It is one of the most important abilities to get people out of your dead zone. 
---
BM hunters are strong as well, but you will have more trouble with deadzone.
---
At this point nobody knows the exact api specs and possibilities.
---
But it is save to say blizzard is lowering the ability to a point that will match more or less the early addons. 
---
Not the early api. The early api was more capable than todays. But programmers where not used to it.
---
Only god knows whats todays programmers could do with the first api ;-)
---
I use A and D out of preference, then I have 2 rows of binds above that, well I guess 3 with the Fs.
---
As nice as imp. sprint is, sadly you sacrifice that talent for better options in the other trees. Imp. Sap, Preparation, Dirty Deeds from the Sub tree are all really nice for control. Here is a quick talent tree example. There is room for variance but the majority of this allows you to control your opponent and not relying on ending them during your opener. 
---

---
I can vouch for this, i rolled male tauren in vanilla and resorted to modding game files to change the model just so i wouldnt be a fatty anymore.
---
The Introduction of Dailies: Dailies being brought into the game further dictated players focus for grinding and pushed them down a specific playstyle of long in complete and then your done.
---
And I mean walked through land and on boat. Not that ocean hack where you die and Rez in graveyard crap.
---
On a pvp server
---
Rofl you literally tell people they don’t know what they’re talking about and then use an opinion to justify your answer. You are just a dumbass. Try to not be such an asshole next time or you’ll get an asshole response. Get fucked LOL sound like a complete loser.
---
And I'm guessing 2x bone slicing hatchet is not good for fury due to main hand weapon speed? 
---
&gt; Axe skill isn’t THAT important since you build fuck all rage with white hits compared to the rage you gain from incoming.
---
This is the sort of thing I wanted discussed when I made this thread.
---
Jellybeans, hes a blizzcon champ streaming a hunter in the classic betta
---
If the wife is an elf, that pretty much means you're going to be an elf too...
---
You are in "crazy land" if you think any person with half a brain would take you up on this "offer".
---
VuhDo works on the beta. I would expect heal bot to have a working version by launch
---
If you ain't killing rag in first month, you ain't shit.
---
When you reach STV you will get what you want.
---
Dont discuss diablo since youre clearly clueless.
---
Hopefully. Maybe some VR or AR for that ‘immersion’.
---
You'd have to be an asshole to expect someone to be ok with you receiving the benefits of someone else's video's popularity.
---
Sure, if shamans get credit for all the windfury totem damage lol
---
Yeah training from someone with more experience than themselves, paid for the videos, can still upload to their own channel after a week and a cut of the monetised revenue also. They would have to be insane to think that's appealing.
---
Classic will be easy people need to deal with it.
---
&gt;but say after a week they would be free to upload it to their own channels also
---
After people no longer care about that video.
---
Theyre fine, people bitch too much
---
Jellybeans
---
Layering is not related to initial launch. It's for 3-4 weeks down the line when only 30% of the initial rush remains.
---
What part bugs are in classic right now? Haven't seen anything on that yet
---
Whether it's made 10 years, 100 years, or 1000 years from now, the ultimate video game has definitely not yet been made. I'm thinking a truly matrix level game.
---
Just google it. Private servers cant be mentioned by name on this subreddit. The most popular vanilla server has 10k+ pop still at pretty much any given time.
---
One thing to watch out for is buffing flagged players.
---
Every so often, my mates and I sneak into Goldshire and follow some poor flagged player into the Fargo Deep mines where we then gank him.
---
Poor bastards. Be careful who you buff because being flagged can spread like the clap.
---
how about that, thanks very much guys, appreciate it :D
---
honk
---
Same here. It's 3 weeks ago, still hurts.
---
But it's still a good decision. I know many men that did it and have no problems since.
---
You don't need each rank. The highest rank of any skill will do just fine.
---
That said while levelling you want to update claw and dash at least a few times.
---
The game isn’t even out yet.
---
&gt;The true ultimate video game is a full recreation of reality.
---
Big ol' **IN YOUR OPINION** disclaimer. Because the ultimate video game, to me, is one I can play and have fun every time I play it, regardless of how much or how little time I have to play.
---
those are called simulators, wow is a game
---
Haha that sounds fair.
---
Do you know if Hunter pet damage is counted on the vanilla/classic damage meters?
---
Your Socialblade says you could have earned as little as $52 last month.
---
Kind of, the best pvp specs are sub tree while pve is combat or sometimes assass. You can get away with pvping and pveing with an assass build but its not optimal.
---
The main one I can think of right now is pets hitting once then running back to you. Forget what triggered it, but it's a painful bug.
---
Do whatever you want, broski. I use ESDF for movement which nets you more bindings than I know what to do with.
---
just pm me a source that shows a server capable of handling 12500 players in the same area
---
There's a grand total of 4 3.9 speed two-handers in the game, and three 4.0 speed ones. The majority of the weapons you'll be using are 3.6-3.7. But yes, that's still 0.7-0.9 seconds of a difference. In the context of Hamstring kiting I don't think that's too meaningful, and certainly it should be offset by having a shield.
---
If it’s constantly progressing, there will be a ‘greatest’ for each generation. 
---
If I’m dead, it won’t matter how good the game is.
---
Hahaha sounds fun! 😂
---
2h is also a very good early game choice since hit gear is so limited.
---
Just wanting to make sure I understand correctly because the implications for a Combat Sword Human Rogue bis list would be heavily affected.
---
If I have 1 point in Weapon Expertise (308 weapon skill) and 5 points in Precision (+5% hit), I effectively only need 1% hit from gear to reach hit cap, is this a correct understanding? Thus, would pre-raid bis be more like, for example, Wyrmtongue Shoulders (23 AGI) instead of Truestrike Shoulders (2% hit, 24AP) to go for AGI gear which also increases crit? Or, is the increase to white hit % still more valuable?
---
Quiver attackspeed affects autoshot only.
---
Berserking/Imp AotH/Rapid Fire affect autoshot *and* Aimed Shot. It makes the window tighter for sure.
---
The slower the weapon, the better it is for you, since it will clip less attacks. The exception is Rhok'Delar with 2.9 speed, as it is a massive upgrade over other weapons, even if it is slower.
---
TBH your math might be a bit off, considering that it's still not clear whether Aimed Shot is supposed to be 3.5s or 3s. Patch notes from TBC/Wrath describe Aimed Shot as going from 3.5s--&gt;3s (Patch 2.3.0) and then 2.5s--&gt;instant (Patch 3.0.2). Footage from 2006 would suggest that it's 3.5s, but I'm not 100% sure whether that's the state it was in 1.12 or not.
---
i dont think its going to be hard at all, most people have this mindset.
---
wrong how?
---
I don't necessarily mean the most fun. I'm just looking at the trajectory of video game evolution. That's better graphics, bigger worlds, and more people. What does that eventually equal? Our universe.
---
the area between your maximum melee range (5 yards) and your minimum ranged attack range (8 yards). those 3 yards are your deadzone, and the hunter is locked out of almost all of their abilities if a target is there.
---
You *can* but the reason you take it on your Rogue for this is the BoP blues to D/E for those shards
---
Whenever you say "training" you sound like a fucking multi-level marketing shitstealer.
---
I watch black mirror too!
---
It gets tiring honestly
---
The deadzone is an area in front of the hunter where a target resides where the hunter is too far from it to melee, and too close to it to shoot it with your weapon.  So effectively, the hunter can do nothing (except have the pet attack the target.)
---
I believe the deadzone is in the range of 4 yards to 8 yards away.  Move within 4 yards to melee.  Move outside 8 yards to shoot.
---
In PvP when facing a hunter, the opponent almost always tries to stay in the deadzone where the hunter is ineffective.  The hunter is almost always trying to stay 8+ yards away from the target so he can shoot it.
---
The opening cinematic made me want to play dwarf. But I was sold on playing rogue because I loved the assassin in d2. The worst part was my buddy who got me into the game was horde but our buddy who was pushing raid content and was server first was ally. So I jumped from one server to the other like 3 times before finally finishing off my undead rogue. Got my lock to 40 and couldn’t level ally anymore
---
Has no one made any sim tools for classic yet? In modern WoW I could sim stuff like this to see for myself how things work. But on classic I'm pretty much stuck trusting what other people say or making complicated as fuck spreadsheets to calculate stuff and then get bored halfway through...
---
I don't mind playing Classic, as long as they don't keep releasing patches and updates every three months and making the game so top heavy.  Let me journey through the world at my own pace and get to level 60 in a couple of years.  Then when I'm done, i'll go play something else.  I don't want to always feel like I need to keep fighting to stay on top.  Maybe I want to be a level 35 elf for a while and enjoy the game at that level.
---
the biggest and, it seems overlooked issue on this sub.  during classic days there was no social media like it exists today.  so a lot of 'what made classic what it was', was the fact that it was in a sense, its own social network.  legacy MMOs were basically glorified chat rooms with 3d graphics (and now they're slot machines / barbiedoll dress-up fantasy with 3d graphics)
---
member when talking to someone from another country was an incredible experience because you only interacted with people in your hometown / greater metro area? ---probably not because now you're so sick of hearing about Brexit, China, Russia, and god knows what other xenophobic nonsense the mass media spews at you day in and day out.
---
member when aol instant messenger and ICQ were the go-to messengers, when DMs were IMs and group chats didn't exist because only a few of your friends could even afford the shitty PCs that existed at the time?  --- probably not, its so easy to get ahold of someone now you actively ghost and ignore people because it's too emotionally draining to tell them how you actually feel anymore
---
member when gaming was 99% male dominated, because you were a fucking loser if you played videogames and women wanted nothing to do with gaming in general?  --probably not, because now "designed with your grandma in mind" is the mantra because GREEDY PIGS WANT MONEY, NOT "TEGRIDY".
---
member when the community was patient, took time to learn together, and grow as a group? --probably not because
---
many will be in for a rude awakening come august 24th.  when the beloved beta 'community' gives way to the flood of retail locusts that is going to poison the well the second the gates open.  it'll be like reading these very comments here on tarddit, every single time you log on.  and you'll think "oh, right, it's the same dickwads that I was hoping to get away from...but since this is 'the new big thing' (Memberberry Flavored), I'm actually here right alongside them again.  
---
all this emphasis on the social and community aspect, where do you think that went?  you assholes ruined it with your memey edglord forthelulz "humor", and you'll ruin it again when classic releases.  i personally can't wait to see your hopes and dreams shattered when you bite into that sweet Memberberry pie and VOMIT immediately once you get a taste.  ha ha ha!  get ready suckers!
---
Yes, druid is their only purpose.
---
Absolutely! It's a discipline spell. You can also cast Mana Burn.
---
And what exactly does that have to do with this discussion? Why don't you preset some hard evidence to back up your ridicilous claim, buddy. Shouldn't be hard to find evidence of sweeping, large scale difficulty nerfs to the game in the patch notes.
---
Thanks :P
---
should be listed as discipline.
---
Haha I saw that vid too! All serious though, there's no reason to not show a bunch of different things. We want to do that clearly and with the ability to turn it all on or off depending on your interest.
---
that fucking clown
---
Feign death + meld

Imagine being so stupid...they will have multiple servers and can easily support thousands of players on each one. I was providing an example, obviously blizzard would have multiple realms if they ever had such a problem like this....wow this subreddit breeds some of the lowest iq people I’ve ever interacted with.
---
What you said is not correct.
---
Ah you're back again, I don't know how much more accommodating I can be to you two, i've provided proof (at least the proof that isn't asking for too much). I've answered all your questions. So let me ask one, what is fair? What should I be offering to these creators for this to be reasonable if what is already on the table isn't enough? If what you say makes sense then i'm happy to incorporate it.
---
It's one of the first games to simulate a universe, and I think that's why people are so drawn to it.
---
Depends what you care about the most. I think Hemo Rogues bring the most to the table in terms of BGs, but they're not the highest raw DPS.
---
The first char I levelled was a Moonkin, so even though it was a shit show, druids are certainly fun
---
They generally used dynamic respawns though. That wasnt a thing
---
Thank you so much. I did my best to make things as concise as possible, so this means a lot.
---
Hyper cringe, you’re probably orbiting as we speak.
---
If it is in range, /tar &lt;name&gt; has always worked.
---
This hasn't been scientific consensus for a long time
---
Take the tirisfal zeppelin to durotar. Run to ratchet. You can hug the durotar coast so you dont have to cross into the barrens. Take ratchet boat to gromgol. Run up shore to westfall/elwynn.
---
Still dont know why though lol
---
This couldn't be more wrong.
---
The autoshot regen of mana is OP, if I’m a vanilla hunter I should be feigning death and drinking during boss fights god dammit!
---
Anyone with any sense of how YouTube works would know how much those views are worth though, adsense doesn't range that much at all for gaming content.
---
this is the part where you prove that
---
🤡🌎
---
Just for Priest, as that's the class that I'm focusing on. However, I could look into asking a trusted member of each Class for a breakdown of their macros and perhaps I could do one for each Class?
---
The quest is there yes, but the staff sucks you'll just use to bow
---
1.13 is the current build of Classic. I think it's up to 1.13.2 more specifically
---
And the Horde is there for him!
---
Not right now. Something I could look into though if people would like a similar breakdown for all classes.
---
Why can’t you prove that you’re right?
---
You really think we are playing on Vanilla patch 1.12? You do know that’s impossible right?
---
Losing hype due to not getting on the beta?
---

Vanilla WoW is a multiplayer RPG. It is an MMORPG in the truest sense of the word.
---
Retail WoW (and every copy that has come after it) is just an MMO. The RPG elements have been stripped out. What is left is just an illusion, your choices don't actually matter.
---
Every online multiplayer game these days is just another MMO. You log in, queue up, do a few matches, and log out. You rarely interact with the people you're playing with. The game has no soul. Retail WoW, LoL, Dota 2, Fortnite, PUBG, they're all the same.
---
But Classic is different. Your choices matter. Progression is hard, but it feels rewarding. And because it is hard it brings people together. Friendships blossom and communities form. No other MMO like it currently exists.
---
And the best part? We're getting guaranteed, polished content releases every few months for at least a year, maybe two.
---
Shadowmeld gives you an extra point in stealth effectiveness. But what's actually more useful is that as a rogue you cant eat while stealthed but you can eat while shadowmelded
---
it's been a while and i am torn between druid or hunter. if i roll hunter i'll try a scattershot build first. I just remember trying to get away from warriors/mages drove me crazy as MM
---
Right, by the end of Vanilla, it stopped being that way. You can't put the genie back in the bottle after you become a Deputy of Stormwind, a legend amongst the Hydraxian Waterlords, exalted with the Argent Dawn, recognized by Nozdormu himself,  and local heroes across countless areas in the world.
---
You press more and lose 2 buttons to do the same thing while losing 2 easy access keybindings.
---
It's not even close to a simulation. Other games existed before WoW with far more simulationist elements. In fact, WoW was very much the start of non-simulation based gameplay. WoW Classic is a theme park, but a theme park with lots of public benches and open parks to hang out in with other people rather than solely dedicated to the attractions.
---
&gt; They're basically forest Taliban.
---
Found my new favorite way to refer to Night Elves.
---
Let me ask you this also then, what would be fair? What do we provide if the above isn't enough to make this at least an equal trade? If the things you list make sense then im happy to incorporate them.
---
I mean, alliance 3 to 1'd the horde and instead of letting them re group for another fight, just corpse camped for an hour. Alliance where the shitty ones on this day.
---
We can dispel Magic and Disease, not poison. Viper Sting is our greatest enemy.
---
My thought for that was we would have a "path" overlay that could show you in dungeons where generally to go so it's clear and it could help with stock dungeons to give a clear idea too. Would that do what you need do you think?
---
Well you not thinking its meaningful unfortunately doesnt actually make it not meaningful.
---
Huh Kalimdor looks a little different than I remember it...
---
It is, but I didn't think that it was realistic to mention it as it's so rare.  It's actually a 1.3 speed and 45 dps.
---
This dude is good, but Im pretty sure the video is from Feenix. Stuff like the FD+shadowmeld to dodge stuff doesnt work in classic
---
Lmfao what
---
 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch\_1.12.2](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.2) wow patches in history.

---
your turn
---
What will the contractual revenue split be?
---
Eh greatest game to ever be made was made years before WoW and no MMO or game since has come close to it. 
---
Talk about do what you want, go wherever. 
---
You could literally make a living as a sheepherder. An animal tamer who tames dragons and nightmares. A bard who uses music to lull your enemies into a peaceful state or provoked them to attack whoever you want. Become a murderer, pirate or a thief constantly on the run.
---
Own a house, castle or keep. Have your own Vendors to peddle your wares from your house. Make a living as a carpenter, fletcher, or smith. You could be a scribe or powerful alchemist. 
---
It featured mounted combat, guild wars and the item you saw in your bag was what it looked like equipped on your character.
---
Because it's a beta and thats one of the bigger things they are TESTING... 
---
Do you guys legit not get what a beta is for
---
due to seeing the whole game for the second/third time in my life and not being able to play it
---
Hunter's ranged attacks like [Auto Shot](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=75/auto-shot) and [Arcane Shot](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=3044/arcane-shot) have an "8 - 35 yd range" while their melee attacks like [Raptor Strike](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=14260/raptor-strike) are "Melee Range" which is 5 yd.
---
The deadzone is the 5 - 8 yd area where none of their attacks are within range to hit.
---
ok, bye
---
Oooooh. I see. Well lucky you. Lol. #heteroproblems
---
Oh. You’re the guy that spam messaged me. The guy that literally kept messaging me after I stopped replying. This is pointless.
---
Can you shadowmeld + stealth at the same time? I thought shadowmeld would cancel stealth.
---
Thanks for the video and reply. Looking to play a spriest for classic. Mind if I ask you opinion on some ideas and builds?
---
the best spec for raids and farming is the same spec (basically) 20/31/0
---
Meld. Dodge is kind of relevant if you're a tank or something. Low number of people rolling nelfs and not a ton of "power gamers" so you wont be competing through the first like 20 levels of your route. If you have a dumpster computer, Darn and low players mean you'll be able to play with an acceptable level of enjoyment. Ummmm. Did I say meld?
---
They are including raid finder and the random dungeon queue system.
---
I stop leveling for at least 2 weeks when I hit STV.  Even when I try to level I end up just killing alliance left and right.
---
There will be layering at launch and content will roll out over 6 phases.
---
I would go Aimed shot first just to get used of the rotation.
---
Ok
---
For swords this is like your cookie cutter build, its never a bad choice:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhe0RxkZhZxMe0cGRo
---
This build is all about getting 5 combo points then using cold blood + evis to finish off the target.
---
There are a lot of ways to mix it up for example if you are in a premade wsg you can do something like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhebosdhZZxrI0cGRo
---
This is very good when you can coordinate with your team 'HEY IM KIDNEY SHOTTING, BLOW HIM UP'
---
Any other build or rogue questions let me know. You can pm me as well.
---
Yes. And if they become the size of grapefruits...go back to the doctor.
---
I get that you are into streamers and it's burning you out but not everyone is like you. I don't really watch twitch
---
If the have a topic that is that time sensitive and they feel it would benefit having on their own channel instead, then they just upload it to their own channel instead? They aren't forced to submit videos or hit a certain number of submissions. Majority of WoW topics though are not that time sensitive, patches don't come around often enough for that to be the case.
---
He read that on the internet.. and everything you read on the internet is true.
---
Repost for the 1000th time - report him, block him and move on.
---
No he has it correct.  What point are you trying to make?  You basically listed some of the strongest pvp race/class combinations, then say the minor non-important racials are a waste.
---
No money upfront and 99.9% of any and all revenue. That's how much your "influence" is worth.
---
I love the moxy on this loon. Just doesn't let up!
---
Get woke!
---
You gotta love the "X class that just killed me is so overpowered."
---
Yes we just need to get a linkable point feature added first. The maps are done.
---
They also have the lowest dps.
---
Dude I just wanna play classic wow for a year or two for fun. I’m not trippin on what comes after or if it just stays the way it is. 
---
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
Oke dude.
---
Grabbing popcorn...
---
Also can add in power creep over time for vanilla.  A lot of classes went through balance changes which generally resulted in them being stronger.  For example, warrior threat by 1.12 was a much different beast than it was for original BWL release patch which had several multi-tank fights.
---
This comment killed me
---
When you guild is pushing new content, spec for it.  When you're progressing fine meme spec away.
---
not when you work 40+ hours a week and then come home to take care of a couple kids under 5 yrs old, then go to sleep, wake up, and repeat the process. i could use a break to just unwind and chill out playing a game i miss. it's not like i'm going to be glued to my chair for a week straight
---
They are there but sort of hard to find. Mouse over each hive. There are 2-3 for each main hive.
---
YoU wOuLdNt DoWnLoAd A cAr
---
Oh I love healing. Minimum work/attention, you get carried through nearly every dungeon, you get gear for free pretty much. As a 30/21 Druid it’s also great because you’re actually able to do quests and tank 5 mans, and you get to see what the armor you worked to get actually looks like. I’m a big fan of healing
---
No classic server will ever have 9k concurrent on the same layer though. And yeah n*d was a bitch to level on before the recent mass migration of classic fans without beta to all the pservers
---
n*haven is sitting at a comfy 3k conc usually, lots of active levellers but it’s manageable
---
I find it hard to believe that her dead stomach flesh is less vulnerable than the arms/chest of garrosh. 
---
I can understand when magic is protecting her, but not when its just her body and her minimal armor
---
Ah I see another professional Ret Paladin whore.
---
To be fair that whoring felt so good when after raiding was done for the week you spent your 50g to respec and stand on the bridge in IF infront of the AH and look all shiny.
---
I've done 4 flips in a row twice, and three flips only once.
---
??? ???
---
For months
---
I think a very important part of vanilla is game feel, as vague as that might sound I think vanilla nailed over other expansions.
---
Small things like the quell serrar quest make like you are in world, not collecting a token you know you will come back to same boss to get more. Not having a certain set of gear designed for an immaterial pvp stat that you need to separate. Fun items that aren't just stat sticks. Classes having distinct imbalanced separations, the world isn't catered to everyone but everyone has their own advantages.
---
You want to feel like you are apart of a world not playing a game in a world background.
---
Listening to someone means not listening to someone else. We don’t all share the same opinions.
---
You can use the Elixirs of Poison resistance (they remove up 4 poisons from you) as they have no cool down. However, they tend to be more expensive due to this (mats are easy to get though - large venom sacs have like a 15% drop rate off Scorpids in desolace). 
---
When I pvp I use those to allow usage of a lip/fap/mana pot.
---
just do what blizzard would do to troll everyone and have 3.5 be a Ret or Paladin Tank set ;P
---
I mean if we have to play the projection game, I bet you didn't even have sex twice yesterday. I did. Your turn.
---
Please would really help out a new player who’s lost (me)
---
You discovered our deep secret. We will definitely be getting better mobile support but right now the push is more features and more tools.
---
It's a shame you wasted all this time writing a nonsensical post.
---
Did you try Enhancement though? I'm not sure I'd be willing to go ele, cause I REALLY want that medium armor melee hybrid! Urgh
---
Maybe I am. Maybe I am being presented with a product that I cannot  have and I do think that creating a 2 tier of consumers and telling them is a bad idea.
---
I would say that If I want to travel to Paris but only people higher than 1,90 can take the plane, I will go to Paris by boat, because I even thought I want to go to Paris by plane, I mostly want to go there.
---
Is this a risk with vasectomies or is this meant as just generally good advice?
---
Yeah, it should look good on a laser printer. Maybe print it using ledger paper size.
---
Prot Pally PvP, I see you’re also a man of culture
---
At first I was like, "Why are you on this subreddit if you hate Blizzard so much?" Then I saw the word "sheeple." So now I'm torn between you being a troll, or you being one of those nutjobs who actually use the word "sheeple."
---
Either way, quiet your talky hole.
---
I see so my value and time are worth around 0.01% i'll keep that in mind. Guess I shouldn't have expected serious input.
---
the real pro answer is this :
---
MM until level 25ish then switch to FULL BM for those sick pet dps talents. Costs an extra gold while levelling, but the early levels are way way way more fun with aimed shot. Especially if you find a slow ranged weapon early.
---
&gt;I dont see what makes anything "immediately aware" 
---
You know who fucked you up after the first death.
---
Weird thought: if you had actually done this in 2004, they'd be perfectly of age to pocket heal you in classic.
---
Herbalism and alchemy
---
Don’t bother dude. He’s a troll. Doesn’t know basic classic information lol.
---
There are a few things I need to learn about hunters that can elevate a good hunger to an exceptional hunter in PvE.
---
1. I’d like to know the PvE rotation for Hunters.
---
1a. There’s some kind of Aimed Shot weave with auto-shot for maximum sustained dps. Can someone explain how to weave Aimed shot and what addon shows/tracks your autoshot in classic?
---
1b. Is there a bow / gun speed which works best, or any particular margin whereby aimed shot weaving shouldn’t be used? E.g. a fast bow?
---
1c. Should serpent sting always be ‘up’ for boss fights (non raid)? When should you arcane shot, when mana above x%? Is multishot prioritized as ‘on cooldown’ with more than 2 mobs, assuming tank has aggro?
---
2. Pet management and macros. Should pet skills be macroed or bound to other skills? Should a pet’s Taunt be manually controlled by the hunter? Which pet abilities can be left on ‘auto’ and which should be macroed or keybound? (For simplicity, assume cat pet for 5-mans and wolf for Raids.)
---
3. What addon can show a boss’ enrage buff for Tranquilizing Shot?
---
4a. Other macros: is there a list of common, vanilla-friendly hunter macros I can look through and pick what I need. 
---
4b. Are there any you’d highly recommend or consider essential?
---
Thanks for your help!
---
It's very clearly a thread about shamans
---
I mean humans are obviously English imperials. 
---
Dwarves are just frost Jews.
---
Back in the day... I played Shaman because of the Mail actually.  I didn't want to be the big heavy plate user.  I also wanted to be an off tank and Shamans had threat generation tools and high armor, and shields... so it sounded like something they would do.   I was misinformed.  I also really liked that they had a little bit of everything.   They were the representation of the Horde too.  I thought berserk was going to be a better ability than it was, and I was a little disappointed with the troll statline.  I always had felt Tauren was a superior choice, but I also went alchemist and that informed my position.  
---
When I played, I figured out that they really couldn't tank, and that they were very versatile.  The Armor didn't really matter.  They were a melee class and though they werent the best at duels and such... their were very good at supporting their team.  Totems being their mechanic was awesome.
---
Totems are what is going to have me playing a Shaman again.  I may even go Troll again because the berserk ability really reinforced my enh build with heavy hammer proc'ing windfury with the Unstoppable Force.  I also like that they can be a really great healer, and that will keep me a viable choice for raiding.
---
Cool copypasta
---
Clearly you've never played Fester's Quest on NES
---
On PServers, you were able to /tar from the Entrance to see if he was there and then reset. I think it's confirmed that this will not work in Classic. It was tested in SM GY when people were farming BIS on a specific spawn.
---
The /tar range is a lot shorter on Classic.
---
I would rez you but I play druid and I'm fresh out of seeds so...yeah.
---
raid spec and pvp spec are very different, but hemo pvp build is just fine for 5mans and farming n such
---
Not the disengage i was thinkig off lol. Its a threatdump that should drop combat aswell? I guess nice to trap melee.
---
Cheers from IrAQ.
---
Wait, why?
---
Classic is not about getting best value, pick what you think will be more fun, making tons flask pots? Want to be a specialist in Leather armour, maybe an super efficient skinner. It is up to you, have fun :)
---
But don't you think your case is rather unique? As a contrast - I'm 32, living with a gf, full time job. I get up at 7; take an hour drive to work (which is considered pretty good in my city); 9-6 (usually 7 though) at work; get home best case scenario by 7; house chores, cooking, groceries, eating dinner - all in all another 2 hours. So that leaves me at most 4 hours of free time on weekdays, in which I can game. But I also like to watch TV series, an occasional sports game, a movie, some YouTube. All in all this means 3 hours a day on average, that I can devote to WoW. 
---
At least I have a gf who games with me. Now imagine if there was a kid as well, which is a more common situation for my age - that would cut those 3 hours in half, and that's extremely optimistic. 
---
I feel this situation I described is much more common for the main demographic.
---
I’d recommend Herb/Engineering but that depends if you want Engineering bad enough. Engineering puts you ahead in PVP but I’m not sure if that’s what you’re looking for
---
I leveled a boomkin in TBC and have been maining it ever since; skipping vanilla balance feels like the right move
---
It doesn't look like a marsh.
---
i've been doing this since i was born :)
---
Is it isolated to hunters or are warlock pets also affected?
---
Did you snort too much Gfuel gamer? Chill out.
---
Had this realization last night. It was a feeling I can only explain as giddy panic.
---
Because you are wasting time watching gameplay from streamers you feel like FUCKING BETA TESTING is bad for the games success? This is an authentic unpopular opinion. Only an unpopular opinion would state that removing bugs is bad for the games success
---
People don't call it Strangethorn Vietnam for nothing.
---
For being someone’s Twitter bitch? Yes, that’s all you get.
---
Hypothetically reversible, but the odds of success drop over time.  After 10 years, you've only got about a 1 in 3 chance.
---
Yeah im just gonna take a few days off lmao, not have invasive surgery for a fucking game
---
Thank you.
---
Don't have to hold Shift to auto loot.
---
What is layering?
---
cool, sorry! I wasn't aware, couldn't find any info on it
---
Gr8 b8 m8 8/8
---
But how do you know that's not how it worked in vanilla? Very few people can remember minor details from a 15 year old game, and private servers can't be trusted.
---
you gotta cheer up a little
---
I haven't heard this either. Seems wrong but I don't know
---
It's not a direct simulation, it is definitely a game. That doesn't mean it doesn't have aspects of a simulation though. It takes aspects from a simulated universe and adds game play. The game play on its own wouldn't draw as many people as it did. It's the persistent universe that really grabs people.
---
Oh ok. Or maybe he doesn't want to know? Been seeing a lot of that lately, specifically when it comes to layering :)
---
It does happen but it's also not common. You can reduce the chances of it happening by just keeping your balls clean while they're healing. Happens if they get infected.
---
Oh... THAT'S why everyone has been saying that they're weighting for Classic.
---
I don't always bubble hearth macro, but when I do, it's on every keybind.
---
Ooga
---
People are telling others to roll underused specs because it makes more people level classes that can heal in raids, since most of the memespecs are classes that can heal. And once they reach max level and face the reality they are too emotionally connected to the character and submit to healing, since that way they get a raid spot.
---
If they're close enough to get behind you you can't shoot anyway.
---
BoE though right? So if someone is rich (or a guild is playing for the team) then reasonably obtainable
---
I will test when I get my mount 😁
---
You need some mining really to pair with engineering.
---
I am really going to miss my wife. She has been so good to me.
---
Shut up sheepieboy
---
Eh. There are already existing spreadsheets, but I dunno if anyone is working on any simC modules for classic.

I was in a similar boat for my Hunter but I eventually landed on Skinning/LW for levelling purposes with me using LW to replace any pieces of gear that are like 10 levels behind and using Skinning to help pay for my Mount at 40. When I hit 60, I'll drop Skinning for Herbalism and start farming Maraudon. And depending on whether or not I'm needed to actually skin the Devilsaur in Un'goro, I can drop Herbalism or Skinning for Engineering after I can afford to buy all the ore needed to take Engineering to 300.

There will be no peace in STV for warriors.
---
You can honestly skip them all and just grind out a few levels. Go back for any crucial class quests a little later.
---
It takes 8 mobs to get from 1-2, not a big deal to get to level 5 and start the next area. Will probably outpace others

---
For causal, any but Bs really. I like enchanting or alchemy. 
---
Enchanting bc as druid you can solo pretty much all dungeons upto max (including a little of high end though sloooowwww), means lots of easy DE.
---
And alchemy, well potions for days!
---
Or they could like also like fix the issues layering is having atm, since it's a beta......
---
You get that it's a joke right?
---
It's a meme. Youd figure people would realize that by now
---
What about if I'm interested in daggers? What kind of build would you work with then?
---
Holy shit, you’re really an incel. 😂😂😂 Get those numbers out of your name, btw. Could tell you were not bright before I even read your gibberish.
---
I dont know why people are trolling you. It's a good question.
---
Macros and addons will be different - they use the new system.
---
Also small related changes like no targeting of totems via macros.
---
Better graphics options.
---
Spell batching will be at least slightly different even after tuning it.
---
Content phases.
---
Layering at launch.
---
Bigger realms (5k vs 2500) - I might be wrong on this one, ill double check later.
---
Im definitely missing some things so hopefully there will be at least a few useful comments.
---
"Go to bat for your class"
---
Have fun coloring your books!
---
I forgot about the UBRS kite, that was pretty epic for newly 60 hunters in their first 10-man.
---
Dont watch it? I Think it sucks to atm. Playing ps4 instead and staying away from wow streams. The hype will be there after the summer man.
---
I did cheer up once you stop spamming my messages.
---
Nice. Ill check it out
---
Sharding world wide
---
I've heard it's the same with warlock pets too.
---
Also planning to do a mage alt skin/herb and farm a lot so probably my main can stick witg alchemy with enchant, however it maybe takes forever due to lack of time to be a teen again and be addictted by the game again😀
---
Lets say there's 5k people on a server. And they all congregate in the one place.
---
There'll be 10 layers. Each with 500 people on it. So 5k people won't be on screen at one time. It's a way to combat overpopulation.
---
After having 3, it's ok.
---
An offensive support class??? SIGN ME UP.
---
I played competitive dota for many years and always played support. My friends picked dps(in wow), so I would need to do the dirty work.
---
My first character ever was a Druid. The concept of jack of all trades seemed amazing to me. I thought healing was super powerful, so I decided to play it. I enjoyed it, but not nearly as much as a shaman. 
---
I like to play a healer with kill potential. It just makes outplaying people so worth it. I can’t wait to dabble in pvp and raiding.
---
It is. He's talking shite.
---
He just wants to argue. He spammed my messages yesterday until he got in trouble from reddit.
---
This is fine as long as your team is breezing through content, but the first time a guild has to call it for the night because they keep wiping, all the meme specs are going to get the blame.
---
If you haven't been taking DMT while you shoot lightning bolts then you haven't been reading the literature.
---
I mean spreadsheets are good enough if they include everything. Classic isn't nearly as complex as retail, so going full simcraft on it is not really necessary.
---
Get fucked you alliance gnome smut!
---
I don't remember how far away it worked, just that it was possible at some range.  I don't think you could /tar the postmaster from the entrance, for example.  But I could be wrong.  It's been a long time with lots of changes.
---
If t wasn’t said, I was going to point this out too.  My goal is to only think of this stuff as an issue if they fail to stick to what they said about removing it later.
---
Lololol 😂😂😂 delete post inc.
---
Is this just a player thing? Does it happen with mobs too?
---
Oh hey it's Kala!

He used to make some great HotS content.

All three Alliance zones. My 1-10/12 route is:

- Menethil Harbor
---
- Teldrassil
---
- Auberdine

- Back to Dun Morogh
---
- Loch Modan
---
- Bacc to Elwynn
---
There wasnt enough time for most guilds, with TBC on the horizon and so many bosses.  Lot of players lost motivation too because the gear will soon be worthless.  Naxx difficulty is overstated.
---
I have been that 1% rich player on multiple private servers controlling devailsaur skins and lotus. Layering will make it happen up to x times as fast where x is the number of layers we can abuse. It effectively nullifies respawn times in the open world if it's able to be abused. People do it on every private server but they are limited by respawn times. They have to min/max their farm within the confines of respawn timers. Layering will break this game. It's not like BFA where you can find surpluses of every kind of herb all over the place. 45 minute-1hour respawns are seriously restrictive and the way it's meant to be. Otherwise people will be complaining about the rich players that got ahead early for the entirety of Classic I guarantee you that.

as you can see this guy is either a troll himself or ridiculously unstable.  
---
anyway, thx for the info
---
To account for the massive amount of people starting at the same time realms will have layers.
---
-Each layer will have the equivalent of 1 server of players.
---
-Over the nezt few months/weeks as the active player base drops off layers on 1 realm will be consolidated. (Realms that had ~3 layers will be consolidated to 1.
---
Nope, the shadowmeld racial change came only in LK or Cata I don't remember.
---
In vanilla and TBC, you can only shadowmeld if you are already out of combat. It basically work as a rogue's stealth but you can't move.

Unless the wipe isnt because of lack of dps.
---
OP has a point about oversaturation leading to fatigue.
---
A daily dose of anything can eventually run thin on you and you don't even have to participate or spectate - just read about others spectating.
---
This goes with anything.
---
YOU might not be fatigued but it does happen and not just with gaming news.
---
I'm 17 i took a raptor with bite

Then buy the bars and stone? Are you being serious lol

Layering and no collectors edition. But for some reason they are trying it to retail with the old collectors edition.
---
AHHH KNEEEEEEE SHAWWWW DAYYYYYYY
---
"Rev up those mana pots. Because I am sure thirsty for one.. "
---
Play what you like tho. Making a hybrid class work is what will make vanilla fun!
---
TIL you cant test bugs at maxlevel. /s
---
I’d recommend alchemy/mining personally
---
I honestly don't remember if it was or not. I think it was. Most people just wanted to go back to Ironforge and it was a pain in the ass to get there from Darnassus.
---
You were wrong and i only commented to point out that you were wrong and what you were saying just wasn't possible at any point in vanilla.
---
Apologies if you took offense, but i remember this grind in vivid detail because it consumed 10 days of my life, and i find it hard to believe anyone else did it and just completely forgot how long it took, and that they'd finished it before leveling 60 despite it taking longer than 1-60.
---
Sheeeeiitt an r/keto user in the wild, what's up homie
---
most bug are found by playing the game. which is what they are doing.
---
1a. I think for a lot of addons we'll have to see what's available.  1.12 addons won't work.  There will likely be a swing timer and/or shot timer available on launch.
---
1b. Slower is better.  Aimed shot is such a long cast time I think you'll always clip auto-shot, so getting the biggest auto-shot after aimed (and getting the most damage onto the aimed shot) is the way to go.  If TBC servers are released, a BM hunter will want a 2.8 speed bow.  I remember that much!
---
1c. Dungeons yes, raids no.  Arcane shot shares a CD with Aimed Shot, so you will mainly use it while moving or if you don't have Aimed Shot talented (especially if leveling).  Don't remember the exact priority of multi-shot.
---
2. Growl is NOT a Taunt.  Growl is a threat increase that you should always have on in solo, and always have off in groups.  (Later on you'll learn situations to break these rules).  Manually activate growl to pull mobs off a healer, or else turn growl on to get them off the healer.  Lots of hunters use macros to have their pet attack or retreat, and those with Wind Serpents may have more complicated macros to serve as RDPS.
---
3. See 1A.  Probably a derivative of DBM.
---
4a. Check the vanilla and classic versions of WoW Wiki and WoWpedia.  
---
4b. There was an addon in Vanilla called zhunter, which included an auto-shot timer in addition to bars for pets, traps, trackings, and aspects.  It freed up a lot of real estate on my action bars.  I assume something similar will be in Classic.
---
Hence why the new player expertise is so bad.
---
That's a weird analogy. It only applies if you're actually LIVING with the streamers - or if your roommates are blasting streamers on every screen in your house 24/7. If either one of those is the case, then you have my condolences. If not, though, the problem lies with you CHOOSING to watch them.
---
I haven't watched any, because I don't want to take away the magic of actually playing it myself. If I choose to watch them and burn myself out, it would be my own fault.
---
Did you play classic? Hahahahahahah. You don't just get tons of money handed to you on a plate. You can keep downvoting me if you want but I'm right.
---
&gt;i'm not going to tell him that he is an idiot
---
It's important to be honest with your friends.
---
At least feral dps provides leader of the pack, that should of been enough for a few raids
---
I don’t see whats confusing about this. Herb is a better moneymaker than mining. You herb, sell the herbs, but engineering mats. Very few people collect their own mats for their crafting professions except for the beginning of fresh
---
Most streamers are just playing for fun, some wont even report bugs when they find Them
---
Still the bugs they encounter will be seem by many people and Will be discussed.
---
Streamers are overall good for the beta
---
That's right, remember that being a big deal in TBC arena.
---
Meters back in vanilla included pet damage and we still didn't come close to other dps by the time AQ and Naxx rolled around.
---
As for whether a Hunter with Trueshot Aura is an effective dps increase in a group with 4 melee compared to adding another melee I'm unsure.  By Naxx timeframe with the huge differences in dps I'd wager it wasn't.
---
Still, any decent guild out there is going to carry a few hunters.  You have occasional utility and remember that tier pieces in vanilla dropped as actual pieces and not tokens.  A raid stacking wars and rogs is going to be unable to equip them all with BiS (there are rogue guides out there specifically talking about going dagger spec not because it's better but because it's easier to gear up so you'll probably be ahead of some sword spec rogs on meters despite having a 'lesser' build).  Hunters still have the occasional utility even in Naxx.  Any decent guild will carry 1-2 throughout Classic (for logistical and utility reasons).
---
Until something becomes the primary means of interaction for all of humanity - you're right. (See: The Oasis from Ready Player One)
---
Stop, man. Just tune out. Stop watching Beta streamers, stop reading this sub every day. Take a break from it all and your enthusiasm will return by the time Classic is released.
---
We do know the API capabilities - anyone with a beta can test them. A bunch of add-ons are ported already.
---
It's basically legion API with some minor changes - no focus, no totem targeting and probably a few tiny things.
---
Fresh out of seeds? Shouldn’t of got that vasectomy.
---
Shadowhunter would be awesome. I'd play one for sure lol.
---
The closest thing would be a Troll shadow priest I guess.
---
you do know that WoW was regarded a laughably easy, casual MMO compared to everything that came before it.
---
and you do know that the genre as a whole is dying off?
---
It's a passive bonus associated with the shadowmeld ability.
---
I prefer them to italics
---
My guild will take off spec hybrids but as long as we have a healthy raid size (more than 40 raiders) I don’t plan on bringing more than 1 of each. 1 Ret, 1 Feral, 1 Shadow Priest,etc... if your not “The Guy” your coming as your meta spec (healer for hybrids). 
---
The issue is we all know what is good and what isn’t now. There will be no new untested specs. We know what is optimal and what isn’t for sure. If you want to DPS. Roll a DPS character. 
---
This is coming from a 14 year paladin main who is rerolling warrior because I will be main tanking for our guild. If I asked 39 others to hamstring progression for me to play a paladin tank I would be very selfish. 
---
Beyond that remember if you are going as a hybrid DPS you need to play all of your class. DPS, CC, Cleanse, Buff, Spot Heal. No one will be bringing an enhancement or ele shaman for their DPS. They will be their for totem twisting to make either Melee or ranged to more damage respectively. 
---
Expect to carry a healing set and expect to need to use it on some progression fights.  Vanilla is a team game. Be a team player.
---
I’ve gotten to 60 multiple times. Maxed engineering is like, 80-100g. I don’t see why you’d keep mining when Herb is a better money-maker. I’m just confused how you don’t see that you can sell herbs and buy ore. There’s an auction house
---
You think you want this shirt, but you don't

I love these guys soooooo damn much.

Horseshoe IQ - post so big-brained it wraps around and looks retarded.

Fuck your allyassed dwarf

---
This shit is getting old. Layering will be in effect for a couple weeks to a month. They've said this over and over again. It's meant to solve the crowded zones at launch problem, and _will_ be removed from the game once servers/influx is stabilized.
---
So just wait until you are 23. Then go to the tree above ratchet and look for the black lion Humar the Pridelord. He has a 1.3 attack speed and is a very unique model of lion. 10/10 would recommend.
---
/r/woosh
---
Are you sure? Because at least in retail (where shadowmeld is basically a vanish and can be used in combat to drop combat) it does dodge stuff.
---
So I tought the same principle would apply if you were able to do shadowmeld in combat (via FD)
---
Things that went wrong:
---
- LFD/LFR combined with instant teleportation to dungeon (detrimental to the social essence of an MMO).
---
- Making all content accessible to everyone. Removes the mystique of the world and its lore (as some people put it).
---
- Balancing all classes and letting everyone do any role they want. This is a complete 180 to what an RPG is. People need to feel uniqe in their class choice.
---
- Flying mounts. It was cool the first few months of TBC but it makes the world feel smaller and not as epic. Feels like having a cheat code.
---
- Watered down social aspects of the game. And MMO should have social interraction as the very core function of the game. It should not be voluntary. It should be required to succeed in an MMO.
---
- Sharding/xrealm removed realm identity. Everyone became an anonymous NPC that you will probably never meet agian (also HIGHLY detrimental to an MMORPG).
---
- I'm probably forgetting something.
---
My favorite sound is the color purple.
---
A few questions along the lines of gold-making at 60:
---
1. What is the best way for hunters to farm gold at 60?
---
2. What is the best way for hunters to farm gold at 60, which does not involve Mara or Dire Maul (can't remember which one Hunters were known for)?
---
3. How would you rank hunters compared to other classes for farming gold at 60?
---
4. How much does gear affect a hunter's GPH potential, based on both points #1 and #2?
---
Be better at writing plot.
---
TBC is for casuals
---
Also disengage drops threat as a melee attack and does not panics you back at all
---
I would skip some quests except for the loss of rep (I'll be a gnome or human working on Darnassus rep).  Gotta do them all to avoid more work later.
---
actually autistic
---
I don't know, I'm not someone who is knowledgable enough to specifically know things about melee leeway in Vanilla WoW, I was specifically commenting on 1 specific instance *not being a sound example* because of the vast extenuating circumstances that go into single moments and instead analyzing the behavior as a whole or what happens consistently and what "should" happen
---
Things like lag, interpolation, graphic display location vs. server-side location, computer specs and even the amount of frames a recorded video is taken at all matter. This is why in many high level FPS games it is preferable to study a FPVOD (a recording created by the player) rather than use an in-game replay/demo system as the replay systems often record at a lower frame/tick rate than a twitch recording will and thus are not as "true" to what really happened
---
Because the money you use selling your gathered reagants could be used for something like epic riding. If you take mining and engineering, then you max engineering, you still have a gathering profession that you can make money from. I think it's short sighted to be honest and can tell you for sure, with people's lack of sense of inflation, shit won't go that cheap nowadays.
---
Hahahahahah
---
There were very few Alliance Warlocks back in Vanilla, there are very few Alliance Warlocks on private servers today, there will be very few Alliance Warlocks in Classic.
---
Or engineering and blacksmithing with 9 alchemist transmute cooldown alts.
---
I downvote these posts based on the title. Read them just in case i should change the vote and by the end I regret that i dont have a downvote left to give.
---
1. TLDR: Weave aimed shots and multishots between the autoshot swing timer. The lowest the weapon, the better
---
That's not what the OP's post is explaining if you think the private servers are over-tuned. The op had examples of where pservers have it much easier to play the game when it comes to respawns, drops, mob abilities, and I'm sure there items that will come to light. 
---
Also, it's not about being better at games and more about the amount of information being available for Classic. Even with all this great information, it doesn't mean that there won't be bad people in Classic.
---
well its like frostmaul giants, their melee range is very small.
---
How do you figure?  Will they remove it even if population increases?
---
I hear you. There were also several occasions where my roommates be partying or drinking in the common area, and I had my door closed so I can play WoW in peace. Missed out on quite a few social events.
---
These are pretty weird “tier” sets but they're really nice PvP sets.
---
This is gold
---
1a. There's an addon called YAHT that is good for tracking your auto  shots. Basically you want a very slow speed. A 3.6 bow/gun = 3.6 second  cd between auto shots. Aimed shot is a 3sec  cast, auto shot  has an internal 0.5sec cast. So you basically want cast your aimed shot immediately after an auto shot (3s aimed shot + 0.5s autoshot) means that after your aimed shot is cast you won't lose an auto shot.
---
1b. You want slow speed. at least 3.6. See above why. 
---
1c. SS should be up for boss fights. Usually you should always arcane shot, even if it's a lower rank. The damage it increases by related to the mana it costs is out of whack. It costs a lot of mana at higher ranks for not much more damage. If mana is an issue, derank. Multishot is a DPS increase regardless of mobs and should always be used.
---
2. This is sort of preferential. I like to have a  pet attack macro and an autoshot+pet attack macro. Sometime you want to pull mobs away and not send your pet flying in to 3 mobs. I would keep taunt on a separate macro as well and just kinda toggle it on and off for questing/dungeons. Claw can be on auto for cats.
---
3. Pretty sure dispelwatch works for this (usually used for casters) and power auras.
---
4a. I would just google this. There's one you can use to help you always have highest rank of spells but i don't really like that. Again, this is preferential. You can always go with a hunters mark, auto shot, pet attack macro if you want.
---
4b. I'd say switching between aspects is kinda nice to have a macro for. But here's a [laundry list of them](https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/vanilla-wow-lazy-hunter-macros/)
---
Fresh out of seeds? Shouldn’t have got that vasectomy.
---
Casual is pretty subjective without real data. Would be cool to see an actual average-time-per-day statistic so we could quickly label everyone appropriately. Haha
---
But yeah 2-3 hours per day for a month is nothing for someone without wife and kids. However it's a pipe dream for someone like me.  I'll probably log in every day for many months, but at least half of those log ins will be just to check the AH, farm 3 nodes, do a quick quest, that sort of thing. Actual dungeon running will be twice a week at most, especially those later dungeons that take 2hrs easy.
---
I was thinking of a hoodie, but it's pretty toasty in Arizona. You know what, I might just get one anyway!
---
Actually extremely interested in this, I just applied under the username “Hamit” I am looking to rebrand myself. Hit me up, this could be very very good for the both of us
---
So you want to wander the world bringing cheese and sheep to old People doing chores for them forever? Nothing in the world to ever happen?
---
I'd always be super polite and have already purchased the rune reagent from a vendor. Many mages would see my lowbie alt with nice manners and the reagent and make the portal for me for free.
---
&gt; BWL you get your biggest spike with T2 and Chrommagus Xbow
---
Heh... if it drops.  My guild in vanilla had BWL on farm for months (only cleared 3/4 of Naxx so never saw KT).  Not a single xbow ever dropped for us.  I used Rhok for basically all of vanilla.  :-/
---
Frustrating to be a class that doesn't scale with gear very well and then never see the few items that do give you a little bit of a boost.
---
I've heard some of these private servers upped drop rates.  If that's true some of those players are going to be in for a lot of disappointment when Classic launches.
---
Not nessecarily true, the content is the players.
---
All of the matts you use on engineering from mining it yourself isn’t free. You’re using 80-100g worth of ore to level it. It’s called opportunity cost
---
Horde player here, but every time I walk into Stormwind and hear that epic music, I get goosebumps. Fucking awesome.
---
This helps thanks
---
Absolutely!
---
Not sure but I think it’s partly to do with how far down the survival tree it is. However, this is the beauty of vanilla. If it works for you - go nuts!!!
---
I really hate things like dailies. I want a list of things to do, at my own pace, not a feeling that I need to login at certain times during the week to do specific things prescribed to me.
---
Ah, the ol' Donald Trump defense.
---
This is a fantastic post. I was part of an honor cartel on Alexstrasza-H. It didn't start that way, but as it was a newer server (opened right away in 2006) and we attracted PVP talent and interest even before everyone was 60, it would be inevitable.
---
Doubt there's anyone else who plays that would remember &lt;Onyx&gt; these days, but we absolutely gamed the system to maximize the progress our guild as a whole could achieve, to the best of our knowledge.
---
They got Soul Shatter in TBC, not Vanilla.
---
Region lock china
---
I think Jed is different because he is technically near the entrance. Just above where you come in. But until we get into UBRS we wont really know.
---
Thought they said there can be more changes till release. And even after they want to have an eye on whats going on with addons...
---
Hunter alts are probably better off as Engineer Enchanters, if the solo DM tribute run is still possible. (Which is very likely)
---
A.  That doesn't make it a good thing.
---
B.  You know it's not a good thing or you wouldn't use "it's temporary" as an excuse.
---
C.  There's no guarantee it's temporary.
---
Yeh, just feign death while they are casting something long like pyro to get even more utility out of it.
---
With split screen you can also just screen-peek your opponent right back, so it's still a bad analogy. Screen peeking might be poor sportsmanship but it's not cheating. A streamer doesn't have to quit their job streaming, they just have to add a delay. It's not an uncommon practice. Or not play on a pvp realm, if they both don't want a delay and don't want to get ganked. You're acting like they are completely helpless in all of this, but they are a WILLING PARTICIPANT.
---
You're going to define cheating as "an unfair advantage from outside the game"? Having better hardware is an unfair advantage from outside the game, too, do you think that is cheating? Using discord for voice comm is an unfair advantage from outside the game. Is that cheating? Having a better ISP is an unfair advantage from outside the game, is that cheating? Having a higher IQ is an unfair advantage from outside the game, is that cheating? Having more time a day to play is an unfair advantage from outside the game, is that cheating? The list goes on.. If it's not changing the game, and it's not playing the game for you, it's not cheating.
---
O o g a g a n g z h i t
---
Thank you. Yeah I've heard of differences between original and re-release 1.12 but I can't really find these in one place.
---
What's the purpose of addons that tell you about your auto attack cooldown anyway? I don't see how that information is important - enlighten me please :D
---
&gt; For a very long time they acted as if they knew what the players wanted more than the players did.
---
That is actually not strictly a bad thing.  A Dev with vision should be building a game to fill their vision, and run with it.  Then the players will get their hands on it and decide if they like it.  Players largely don't know what they want... an individual player may know what they want, but the playerbase as a whole is too diverse to truly have a single voice.
---
yeah, i was just bored as hell and wanted to see if this would actually trigger someone. guess it did. but i only meant it as a joke lmao
---
I was my gilds raid leader and I had way more fun running 40 man raids than I did 10 or 25, felt more like my army invading some stronghold in vanila, tbc just felt like a longer burst run with 10 people.
---
Twitter dm is easiest for me if you want to shoot some ideas around! @kurtislloydnbd
---
Excellent, your answers were really helpful.
---
Can you clarify clipping Autoshot with aimed shot? 
---
Do you always cast aimed on cd, or do you allow an autoshot to finish if say &gt;75% of the way through the shot?
---
A good 40 man raid will not allow a hunter to wear 8/8 T2. Each 8/8 debuff takes its own slot - if you have multiple hunters in 8/8 there will be multiple debuffs and there are much better debuff options available
---
It's good for launch but would be bad in late game..
---
My only character is vanilla all the way through BC was a balance Druid (never tried any other spec or class). I got to do Molten Core, ZG, Onyxia, and some of AQ 20/40 because my guild liked me. 
---
I was much more useful in BC and actually necessary in the boss fight before Grull to tank one of the ogres who polymorphed. It felt great to finally be useful. 
---
Not sure if I want to relive that or try another class, but I’ve got months to decide.
---
Haha yeah sorry my q was poorly worded. I meant what gear (slot and quality) does r10 offer?  Cant play around on wowhead at work.
---
World firsts happened 14 years ago, of course it doesn't count
---
No worries.  Lok`tar brother
---
&gt; I kinda hate how people always say that hunter is the "lowest pure DPS class". It kind of puts a stigma on the class. 
---
Well, it's not false information. Hunter itemization isn't great.
---
Thanks for reminding about that!
---
My wife's boyfriend bought my a Nintendo DS when I got my vasectomy, is was well worth it

I haven’t healed since wrath but I loved playing my holy priest in raids
---
No. You can't have a discussion about not having kids without some schmuck feeling like you're attacking their lifestyle and telling you why you SHOULD have kids, when nobody asked them or cares.
---
I know I would! Heck, I'd even have seconds. Then I'd polish it off with a tall, cool Budweiser.
---
its banter.
---
People used it, they sure did. Then realized survival is not as fun as marksman or BM. Turns out blowing clothies up is more fun then tossing out a touch more CC.
---
Hunter is the most efficient **single-target** leveler in the game.  I don't think DoT-cleave is enough to overcome that, but Mages certainly can do well with AoE grinding.  With that said, Mages can't AoE grind ranged or caster mobs.
---
Hunters have several advantages over other classes, that make them very efficient, especially at lower gear levels:
---
1. Their pet is roughly 1/3 of their damage, and doesn't scale with gear.  This sucks for scaling, but also means that 1/3 of your potential is accomplished by "pet attack"
---
2. Only 1/3 of your damage potential comes from special attacks.  I don't think any other class can be as efficient as a hunter can by simply sending their pet in and attacking.  Nobody with wand attacks, no melee class just auto-attacking, is going to be that efficient.
---
3. The Hunter pet is better than the Voidwalker at holding threat, which allows the hunter to realize it's full potential.  Warlocks have to drain life instead of shadow bolting, mages have to kite, melee has to kite, Paladins have to stop and self-heal.  Hunters just do.
---
4. Because pets don't scale with stats, the only piece of gear a hunter is really concerned with is a good bow and good ammo.  Nothing else matters much unless you're competing on damage meters.
---
5. Mend Pet is vastly superior to Health Funnel
---
* Compared to a Rogue, Warlock, Mage, or Warrior, the Hunter has much more efficiency in that they can heal through the damage taken.  The Warlock has slightly more down time and less efficient pet management.
---
* Compared to Druid, Paladin, Shaman, and Priest, the hunter has a higher damage output.
---
* Compared to any class that uses mana for its attacks, the hunter has more efficient output.
---
* Hunters can fight most mobs with +30% movement speed active.

I'll be waiting.

&gt; I was told I needed to be BM on a pserver to farm Mara until I had like tier 1 and up.
---
Huh?  Not sure what you mean by this.
---
As for BM vs MM the former is easier to level with but as soon as you can start raiding swap to MM.  Higher dps and a party buff for some lucky melee.
---
No, you don’t want 2 x Bone Slicing Hatcher for Fury. Just get the Dal Rend’s set for dual wielding and Bone Slicing Hatchet for tanking. Eventually get the Ony Axe to serve as your main hand for both roles.
---
The weapon skill matters (it reduces how much hit you want/need), but weapon skill and hit are expensive to obtain. It requires things like Devilsaur set and Edgemasters.
---
Can’t get scattershot and wyvern, wyvern has longer cd and can only be used out of combat.
---
plus, you still have to move out of the fire, watch for cleaves, etc... it's not a walk in the park.
---
Imagine wanting to be a manchild for the rest of your life

My first toon ever was a ne rogue.  By the time I made it to Ashenvale, I saw a translucent wolf running towards me.  No idea what was happening and suddenly it morphed into a huge blue troll and obliterated me.  I logged off and re-rolled troll shaman and never looked back.  I came for the ghost wolf, but ended up loving the totem system, 2h wf, and eventually healing.
---
You know, I had the same thought as well. And it's a funny comment on "now we know" with this game. Everything thought housing would be cool. So they gave it to us in WoD. And in 3 months everyone said, "we've made a huge mistake". It's so cool that the MMO industry can pull from all these examples for future games.
---
You can only have a max of 2 pets as well. Also, until you get all of the pet skill ranks learned, you have to keep one open to learn new ones.

Hi Kala, I watched your levelling video which was also really good. I remember on retail using fear as a regular part of the rotation to allow a couple of extra Mind Flays. You don't seem to mention that in your guide. Is it not worth it do you think?

It's was either between Wyvern Sting and Scatter Shot in a 0/21/31 build... But with Scatter Shot I dont what you can do with that 4s sleep, compared to Wyvern's 12s.
---
That's a good way of fixing enhance lol
---
oh I though Monster/Humanoid Slayer from Survival tree are important for raiding.. 3% damage and critical damage..
---
Don't be alliance.
---
The only two things Classic and Live hunters have in common is that you have a pet with growl, and you have a bow.
---
I am astounded so many people have this misconception. Have you guys never played a popular private server? Its not hard to get past level 10 lol. Btw dynamic respawns have been confirmed to be in the game since day 1
---
Wow that seems really inefficient. Don't those soldiers realize that by specializing in polearms they can no longer get Improved Hamstring?
---
Just send them a screenshot of your 10 manual crowd pummelers, you will probably out dps all the rogues and warriors once the world buffs wear off.

So good, he had to say it twice.
---
Nope, that makes you a masochist. All part of the same family though.
---
People keep saying "leeway leeway leeway."
---
I don't like describing the above as leeway, because it isn't- according to the research I've for Vanilla through Wrath there was an additional 2.66 yards that was given to auto's that REGISTERED, but hadn't been resolved by the server yet.
---
That means if you went into melee range, the stationary one shown in the video above, and walked out as the rogue is autoing but BEFORE the auto goes off, so long as you were within 2.66 yards it would go off- this behavior, this leeway is preserved on Classic Beta, and I'm sure of it because if I walk into melee and blink before the auto goes off but after it would otherwise register, it doesn't.
---
Now what happens above is the leeway (adding range when an attack is registered in the static melee range) is added to range that is granted while both targets are moving- [this clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/DelightfulFurtiveStapleDBstyle) shows when both are added (I say leeway in the video but it's actually both at the same time). Both are moving so it produces the Cataclysm era attack range increase of 2.66, I dip into that extended range and run out, but not beyond 2.66 yards so it gives it additional leeway.
---
This creates bizzare incentives where people are forced to backpedal or stand still where they would otherwise strafe away because it removes the Cata era additional range, making it Vanilla-like and not enabling them to be hit from nearly 10 yards away.
---
tldr;
---
From my research into vanilla videos the reason why we have such scuffed melee hits is because a cataclysm era movement based attack increase is in the beta. This "melee increase" is not the leeway that was present in vanilla, but instead a system that allows for an increase in range when both targets are moving forward, strafing, or jumping.
---
I would recommend blacksmith/skinning
---
Wow being easy is based on its game play.  I'm talking about the fact that it's a persistent universe is why it draws so many people.
---
The wow style mmo is dying yes. But I do think that games based in a persistent universe could still do well if done right.
---
If you wanna get people riled up make a 2000 word essay on layering. It'll still be boring but you'll at least get some copy pasted replies.
---
Attack speed only affects white hits. It has no impact on casts
---
This makes so much sense. I was leveling a warrior in a private server this morning and having the toughest time tagging named mobs that didn’t spawn often. On the other hand, everyone was farming Murlocs and they spawned instantly. I’m talking about 25~ players constantly tagging murlocs.
---
Maximum efficiency is probably;
---
* Level through all Darn rep zones (Think it's something like 27k or 36k total rep gained if you go at the zones levels, think Teldrassil, Feralas, etc).
---
* Begin the Winterspring Frostsaber grind, you'll get enough runecloth for Darn exalted long before Winterspring rep and as a side bonus you get beads that are used for Timbermaw exalted.
---
But if you have no intention of getting that mount, or grinding out other reps then there's 2 really good grind spots in Vanilla for Runecloth that i used to use.
---
* Hearthglen in WPL and a camp in EPL i can't recall the name of.
---
* Twilights in Silithus
---
Both of those are 54-60, and have packs of 5-10 mobs you can grab and AoE but also spaced mobs to pull small groups or solo and have a really good runecloth drop rate, from memory at least.
---
The elite tiger in STV for the final Nessingwary quest should have a similar ability, didn't do it on a pserver recently.
---
Do it for the dance
---
Still hurts??
---
Most people are aware that “BIS” for tank and healer are fairly subjective. I only a very few instances are there outright winners for BIS (ex: Benediction for priests). But generally there’s a lot of room to apply judgement with negligible affect on performance.
---
Unfortunately, we have people that hear “BIS” and assume there’s zero sway.
---
Added in TBC.
---
The alliance needs 3 gnome rogues of their own..
---
You still do that it's called dailies.  Where you tickle 10 pigs or lead turtles to the water but you're such an important character your're best buds with the warchief.  It makes no sense.
---
&gt; 3. Define “bright”.

You don’t even understand how grammar works at your age, cya.

Oh. Well it was interesting to watch. Not every day you get to see your little tubes in there.

appreciate the video man since i am going to lvl a priest and got a look whats out there already!
---
if I may add a little bit of critic: most people will most likely just blindly copy your macro without knowing what they do **exactly** or how they could alter them for their personal use**.** I feel like a little bit of an explanation is missing, that is, if you wanted to reach an audience who never used macros before.  
---
From a "coders" perspective I am missing some "pseude code" explanation and/or a source to specific keywoards like *help* or *nodead*, let me give you an example of how to explain it so a bigger audience would cope with it:  
---
/cast \[condition1\] \[condition2 (when condition1 failed\] \[condition3...\] Spell    
---
Just writing this on the screen as a video edit or a not working macro ingame and saying a few words about the algorithm would have made it easier to consume in my opinion    
---
wish you all the best!
---
* Dead zone (can't shoot under 8 yards, can't melee over 5 yards, leaving a 3-yard gap)
---
* Newly tamed pets require an enormous amount of food
---
* Ammo
---
* Traps can't be used in combat (this is fixed in TBC)
---
* Gun sounds are annoying so I never roll on them even if they're an upgrade
---
You can't autoshot while you're casting Aimed Shot. You want to cast Aimed Shot right after your autoshot goes off, that way it delays the autoshot as little as possible.
---
Clipping autoshot means that you're delaying it.
---
If it's red, it's dead.
---
I think survival gives more damage due to the +15% agility from Lighting Reflexes.. But requires you to have full T3 gear for it to scale..
---
"Its not an enjoyable experience, I dont want to see people online in an MMO." Get fucked?... okay? Most people enjoy getting fucked... so... thank you?
---
Inner fire used to give priests attack power boosts.
---
Engi is the "strongest" profession, since it gives access to a lot of items that require the profession to use them. The benefits are more  noticeable in pvp and rather marginal in pve.
---
You can never go wrong with alch/herb, though. Great money, easy access to elixiers and potions. 
---
Water form and cat prowl also make it easy to gather herbs.
---
Scatter shot does a good amount of damage, and let's you FD/trap. Its also a great interrupt when someone's trying to fear you or heal.
---
Man you must be fun at a party .....
---
Yea just like all those private servers with thousands in their queues? Those werent successful at all .... ....
---
\*Over the next few months as the active player base increases on the most popular servers more layers will be added and will be abused non-stop by foreign gold farmers on stolen accounts.
---
Lol, trying to shame someone for not playing classic, while you argue that the only way to level/max engi is to have mining...
---
Like 2-4 hours of gold grinding at 60 will easily get you the money for mats to max engi; vs. shitloads of running around trying to farm nodes. Like, you realize how inefficient that is, right?
---
You are really embarrassing yourself here man. 
---
I don't know why you are so attached to this, but you are so off base on pretty much everything you have posted here, its embarrassing. 
---
You don't seem to understand anything about this subject, so take your own advice and "go home." 
---
Was a mistake even posting this here, because its obvious the people who comb this reddit are not interested in seriously impacting the Classic WoW youtube community anyway.
---
Demonstrated that pretty clearly here today, if anything, I suppose.
---
I hope this kind of misplaced confidence in something you barely understand isn't going to be commonplace in actual Classic.
---
You can with Feign Death which drops you out of combat.. And the cooldown I think is worth it.
---
What about a stun mace Combat rogue build? I remember running back in Vanilla while no one else did and it seemed really effective.
---
A lot of it is because there were signs that the dev team was just going to cut their losses and abandon the game for a little bit after launch but instead they completely revitalized the game(or so i heard, i'm still salty about the launch).
---
In terms of pvp? Cause anyone with half a brain could figure that out. FD already makes you drop the target so the meld is pointless
---
"Shame someone" Jesus christ.
---
Honor is phase 2. Bgs are phase 3 so between the two is going to be the golden age of wpvp
---
You can make all the analogies you want it doesn't stop you from sounding like a petulant child.  Fact is, this is not a  product that has been released sale.  The product is literally still being finalized and is not yet ready for market.

Uninstall twitch, delete your pserver install and enjoy your summer.  At the end of that Classic will be there for you to enjoy.  You are the sole problem with you.
---
For crying out loud let it go! You've been creating posts about this for three days straight!
---
Vanilla healing sucked. I loved healing in later expansion. This is from a Druid perspective
---
Ok, alright.... but i'd say the Adderall prescription should be considered cheating. I think Blizzard should ban you for taking performance enhancing drugs.
---
So you're talking first 12 hours?  24m
---
How did this “only first two weeks” stuff become popular? Phase 1 could last almost 4 months if they hopefully pace it similar to the [original content patch releases. ](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x)
---
You really like imp sprint. Surprised I didn't see a single 21/8/22 or 31/8/12 spec
---
Well, I never said it was false information.
---
you dont need mining with engineering but you'll  have to sink a ton more gold into engineering. the amount of gold you need starting of and to maintain engineering isnt worth not have mining.
---
/u/syigamer, you could probably make the offer "$20 and a blowjob from /u/Whiteshovel66" considering how much he wants to suck your dick.
---
Yes, but I expect these to be extremely expensive.  
---
If you're ignoring extreme cost then I would say that Blackguard is BiS.  I think the searing gorge quests are in phase 1, even though they were not in early vanilla.  That leaves you needing 163 cores to get a blacksmith exalted.  This can be reduced by a blacksmith not doing the searing gorge quests until they get honoured from hand-ins.
---
If a guild is thinking about buying multiple alcors, they might be better off planning to farm MC trash for cores and making multiple Blackguard's for their tanks.
---
Sounds like Kara tbh
---
&gt;If you force your lady to either use birth control or have her tubes tied instead, you're a weenie and should be ashamed of yourself.
---
Considering both of those are reversible, simpler procedures, the only reason to have your balls cut off is some sort of weird chivalric pride.
---
I intend to do it this way. The 114 shadow damage is well worth it IMO.
---
So you know when your next attack will be? How is that not useful.
---
Nah, vasectomy is MUCH safer and less invasive than a hysterectomy, unless she's already open for a c-section. Everyone's circumstances are different, but it should be a no-brainer for most.
---
Another reason why dwarf is master race. Stoneform is beast for PvP.
---
They are going to have multiple realms, and they would still have problems like this, unless they added 200 realms or they had... **layering**...
---
So, 10k queue is good then?

Inb4 muh 2^9 billion trillion vanilla ping, spell batching or whatever other excuse you can make up as if those things aren't a factor in Classic WoW as well.

It's the same exact behavior.
---
Huey, Dewey and Louie
---
Isnt layering getting removed a bit after launch? Its mostly used in the beginning so people can actually level and not have the starting zones be absolutely packed with players?
---
That's an outright lie.  No need to be a lying scumbag just because you can't contribute to the discussion.
---
Here's the problem - 1/3 of your DPS is tied to an ability that doesn't scale with any of your gear.  This ability is "pet attack".  Pets get nothing from your stats in Vanilla.  In TBC, they started getting Stamina and Attack Power from you, and then in later expansions got more stats.  But in Vanilla, your pet gets nothing, outside of a few specific trinkets and items that give your pet a bonus.
---
Rogues have a similar (but I think less impactful) problem, with Eviscerate.
---
Don't worry about the stigma.  Anyone who says you're a noob or an idiot for rolling a class is just an idiot.  Anyone who calls you a huntard is either teasing, an idiot, or maybe you are a huntard and need to L2P.  
---
You'll find lots of dungeon groups, especially after 40 when there's a warrior tank, rogue and mage DPS, and priest healer, and they say "hey, you want a bunch of mail drops?"  Dungeons and Tier 1 are where you will shine the most.  Later on you'll mainly be there for tranq shot, but most guilds should bring a good hunter over a bad rogue or warlock any day of the week.
---
People think this is a joke but I actually lost a lot of weight back then. The game was just so absolutely immersive that I actually forgot that a real life version of me existed and thus I forgot eating in real life.
---
Playing tank the dodge bonus doesn't suck.
---
I'm sure nobody's said this yet, but Shadowmeld.
---
Seriously though, you'll get ganked by rogues still some, but equipping a big 2h on a warrior and charging clothies that never saw you coming was some of the most fun I had in early BG's.  Same with aimed shot from stealth on my huntard.
---
If you can walk in alone/not in a group I don't see any reason for that to not work.

Did it the first time. Hated it. Will still do it again lol

Maybe 3 dwarves aka The lost Dwarves taking revenge for getting mugged in uldaman?

---
* If you PVP you can't argue against Int/Stamina.
---
* If your focus is PVE then you want to focus on Agility and Spirit. The Agility scales well at low levels (+crit). You have enough base mana to heal yourself, toss on some hots, and get into Cat form. After that Intellect won't help much, you will get better mileage from Spirit that allows you to regen while you are in Cat form. Much of feral leveling in my experience is managing the Five Second Rule. 
---
* In the end, it doesn't really matter. Play/gear however suits your playstyle and try out different things to see which feels best for you.
---
Did it cost you any good boy points?

---
Yes, they were not on any kind of back schedule.
---
Staysafe makes a pretty good argument for running a crap ton of spirit as a lock so definitely check out his videos.  If it was me I would probably disregard the shadow weave because the reality of having your tailoring up to snuff while being “ahead” of the pack is pretty difficult from my experience (nd, k3). However farming felcloth in felwood or azshara while level appropriate isn’t a bad idea at all.  The mobs are relatively weak and they drop a lot of good stuff.
---
Phase 1 and pre 30-40 zones is good for me as it wont break anything.
---
In a way, yeah. It’s a part of the game. The armor you use is how you’re represented. For better or worse.
---
Absolutely. It's a money maker for sure, you can make your own stuff. Have an alt that is dual gathering, and feed it to your main!
---
A. Better than trying to do quests with 3,000 people nezt to you, GL may aswell just start playing a week late for the crowd to thin out.
---
B. Point 1+3. It IS CONFIRMED temporary. Does 1 sound more fun? Taking 2 hours to do 1 simple quest because you are competing vs. 1000+ people for it.
---
C. Considering they already said it won't last past phase 2. It would be 2-3  months at most.
---
Well, I was 32 when I started Vanilla, and did a fair share of PvP. My memory is still good. And I played as a Warrior.
---
There was a leeway mechanic in Vanilla, you could hit from a distance that SEEM to be bigger than intended, but was still acceptable, visually. Now, on this video...well, the distance is twice than it was in Vanilla. Maybe not a 100% increase, but a SIGNIFICANT increase in range, compared to Vanilla.
---
However, I have seen Druids mauling people from quite a distance, back in Vanilla PvP...but that was a visual glitch and spell batching. Basically, a melee would "fake" an attack, than quickly turn around and run...but use an instant skill, and due to spell batching, it seem that you got hit from too far, outside melee range anyway.
---
But in this video, the guys a strifing quickly...and the melee can hit.
---
I can't swear on my children, but the range is too big in beta. It was big in Vanilla too, but not as big as this video portrays it.
---
That doesn't make much sense, esp. when you're talking about alch as your prof.
---
It's better to put the crafting profs on your main, since they'll be more likely to see nodes/mats. Then send those to your alt, which only needs to be 35 to get to max level profs.
---
If your gathering is on your alt, they won't be able to get any good mats till they hit 60; so it's just really inefficient IMO. I'm doing herb/skinning -&gt; tailor/engi on my main just for BoPs, but well before that I'll be sending all my mats to a druid LW/alch to level up crafting profs.
---
Lmfao.  So only the most important timeframe for the game's success, where most people will form social bonds.  Dear god, the mental jujitsu you people will do to justify Blizzard's actions is baffling.
---
Because you want to instantly log in and get everything done without a single inconvenience to yourself, right? You deserve that as a paying customer. Inconvenience is just a waste of time! They should make sure we as paying customers NEVER waste our time
---
Commenting before this gets locked.
---
It isn’t a big deal, IF it’s only a 2 week situation. But they also told us, in absolute certain terms, that sharding was going to be only for starting zones, in bold text. 
---
Then, we’re told, in the same certain terms, that it’s only two weeks, or it’s only phase one, they’ve kind of bounced around with those two qualifiers. But it could very easily go past 2 weeks, if the populations don’t drop as much as they think they will.
---
Cool, this makes me feel better.  With the limited time I have to play, I probably won't be pushing much raid progression anyway.  At least not when they are first released.
---
I'm not big in warlocks but the classicbis website shows the felcloth shoulders as bis up to stage 3.
---
Considering half the horde is UD and you can WOTF the sting or shaman, it's pretty useless. Dwarf can dispel it aswell with stoneform. And it's in combat so you need to waste a FD for this.
---
Of course in some optimal situation it can work but scatter shot is overall a better spell.
---
I think he meant it's so fucking long you must have spent three days typing it.
---
I disagree. Outside of server launch, Engineering can be leveled in 1 hour at 60 (Assuming you’re you buy all the mats beforehand) and the gold to fund it will be much faster obtained through herbing and selling rather than mining it. In the end, you’re using X Amount of gold worth of mats to level it. Just because you mined it doesn’t mean it didn’t have value. You’re still using X amount of gold worth of mats
---
Same for me. Been since 2010 when I last played and that was on a vanilla PS as well. Relearning the game and early leveling has been fun, and I won't be lost when it actually releases
---
There is a small nuance to this.   
---
No matter how much information is available or experience there is, there are people out there who will be bad at the game. This particular group of people do not want to min/max, learn optimal questing paths for leveling, or bother using optimal talents. It's part of life and these are the type of people that will say the game is extremely difficult.
---
I think it's fine if it's in the form of special conditions within the normal fight that could possibly give you extra loot.
---
Firstly, awesome post. As a future lock I was going to do the same besides hopefully skipping or at least waiting to last the helm slot as I’ll try for shadow power green Lens. Gj mate
---
Doesn’t help when your thread gets deleted within 30 minutes. Then we’re those other threads really even around?
---
Scatter shot is incredible.
---
did you switch the month and day
---
Can I get a tl;dr of this, or some sort of bullet list of the interesting points?
---
Agreed, Agility scales even better at lower levels. 20 Agi per 1% crit is the level 60 conversion.
---
&gt; the only reason to have your balls cut off is some sort of weird chivalric pride.
---
You do realize that no balls get cut off in a vasectomy?
---
Pre raid fury bis is not something if advise people to use in pvp...
---
What would be the best class to play for farming mobs for gold/mats
---
&gt; What class are you going to play if you don't mind me asking, friend, and why?
---
I am rolling a druid. I played druid in classic, played druid in private servers, played druid for many MANY years so I am returning to my roots.
---
Specifically, I am a feral druid. Again, did it in classic with great success to the highest point I could push it, which was right before we hit saph, where I went resto for Saph/KT and was able to bring his ugly face to the ground before TBC dropped.
---
As I am feral, I am feral tank/dps hybrid, with the ability to heal decently well.
---
Tanking is VERY rewarding, you will be highly sought after, and if you have a decent personality, even if you aren't super skillful at warrior early on, people will STILL flock to you. Having a good time &gt; saving a few minutes and dealing with a rage-a-holic
---
TBC improved shaman so much, resto, ele and enhance all got serious upgrades and became viable in all roles in the game.
---
I'm talking about most efficient class, not which classes are capable.
---
It's because you can feign death - shadowmeld -eat
---
Cause those queues lasted 10 hours... considering how quickly their pop died off. Maybe we should really think about that... after a couple weeks queues of 2-3k are gone... 2-3 months later pop has gone from 10k to 7k... and that’s a free server.
---
Yup sure sounds like a smashing success.
---
It’s more about community than anything, dog. Your character is represented by the gear you’ve earned. It’s a part of the vanilla experience. World PvP and battlegrounds are also impacted.
---
Short answer: No.
---
Long answer: Nooooooo.
---
reduce their hp to 0 - frost might help

Could you attempt to work out a warlock macro that would delete soul shards from your fourth bag (if it is full) and cast drain soul rank 1?  
---
Back during the blizzcon demo I spent about 2-4 hours trying to research and try different versions from modern to pservers and case sensitivity, but the macro interface never allowed for deleting items from specific bags or checking if a bag was full or not.
---
I was sad when this wasn't crank dat druid boy :(

I offered to get snipped but my wife wants her tubes tied. Says it will be cheaper since she's always in the hospital and I haven't been in years. Her deductible was met January 3rd.

Realms were created and opened with the same content stack. If new servers were brought up when patch 1.6 was released, they opened with patch 1.6.
---
Well see I try not to make an ass out of myself by assuming shit about other people just because I'm behind the safety of a screen. I was going to let you show everyone what your strange definition of bright was.
---
Why would somebody let it go when it's common sense that it's bad for the game? Blizz can't get it to work properly, look at the streamers showing how it can be exploited. And before you say "BlIzzArD wIlL fIx iT". No they won't. Layering, Sharding, whatever name you give it. Is breaking the game and WILL ruin endgame even if it's gone at the time. People WILL use the "short time" it's in the game, to use it and get ahead. Then all you guys who defend it now, will be bitching about it later.
---
10k pop through naxx .. what a drop off!
---
That's kinda the spec I was thinking. I have criticism of two things though: 
---
1. Why 3/5 Master of Deception and 2/5 Opportunity? As opposed to 5/5 Master of Deception. If you're Hemo, 2/5 opportunity basically only gives you 8%+ garrote damage (since Hemo rogues don't usually use daggers, thus can't backstab or ambush with swords). 
---
2. Would you consider removing a point from improved poisons or improved kidney shot and putting that 3rd point in improved gouge? an extra 0.5 seconds on gouge seems a lot better than an extra 2% poison application or extra 3% damage only when patient is kidney shotted.
---
"*LMAO, rend &gt; HS for almost all warrior content other than MT raids.*"

*HS: 157 dmg for 15 rage, 10.5 dmg/rage.*"
---
Your numbers only reiterate what I said. If Rend is able to tick for all of its damage before the mob dies, it still only barely keeps up with base Heroic Strike damage.  This makes it only worth using when you get into higher ranks and understand rage management, or sometimes in multi-target situations.
---
"*Also I am not even sure if HS is counted as a yellow attack in the hit table.*"
---
It is a yellow attack in the hit table, but I did misspeak a bit in my post I'm realizing after rereading. 
---
"...**since it's an ability it has a higher chance to land on the target.** " 
---
should instead say 
---
"...**since it's an ability and will never be reduced into a glancing blow.**"
---
When you get right down to it, there is a lot of nuance involved in when Rend becomes a situational okay thing to use in comparison to Heroic Strike, but for a new player the difference is likely never going to be enough to make it worth using. The main reason for my post was to inform and discourage the creation of a macro that would always prioritize putting it up.
---
I think one big part of this philosophy that doesn't really get talked too much about is how much open, empty space there was in vanilla. Whole swathes of forest or expanses of desert that, sure, have a few wandering mobs through them, but which are empty of anything that's clearly, blatantly designed for a specific quest or goal. You wander through them because you've decided to make a journey from one side to the other. There isn't something every 5 feet that feels like it was specifically designed for you.
---
You're just in the world. The world is basically indifferent to how you interact with it.
---
In retail, you can feel how each inch of the world was crafted to be interacted with, purposefully. They do a really good job of that, it's a well-crafted world... but they sacrifice the much more important feeling of the world *not* being designed for you, but being real unto itself, and you merely a visitor to it.
---
I have to agree, streamers can rage all they want.
---
These three are exactly why I want classic back. The community makes things fun.
---
How does Intellect increase sustain and reduce downtime? Wouldn't Spirit do that?
---
I picked shaman because the Forsaken starting zone wouldn't run smoothly when I rolled my first character.  The Barrens was fine so I chose shaman and went with it.   Still play my shaman as my main.
---
I will not play shaman in classic.  Shaman were really mediocre from 1.4, when I started, all the way to prepatch of the TBC where they were really improved.
---
Minimum work for Druids because the Priests were doing the heavy lifting.
---
There's really no good enough reason to use wyvern sting over icetrap basically. You give up scatter shot which secures the icetrap anyway, and scatter has way more uses besides it, and the dot from wyvern isn't really useful since it takes up one of your stings
---
There are two ways a hunter pet can be bad:
---
1. It is from a family with no skills
---
2. It is a caster pet
---
On #1, the absolute worst pets are **Spiders, Crocolisks, and Crabs.**  They cannot learn Dash or Dive, and they have no special abilities besides Bite or Claw.  You only get one, you don't get to choose (like a Bear or Raptor).  I go into a full tier list here:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9vogfs/thoughts\_on\_hunter\_pets\_and\_leveling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9vogfs/thoughts_on_hunter_pets_and_leveling/) 
---
On #2, some pets are determined to be "caster pets" and thus have caster stats.  If a wild animal has mana (a lot of Wind Serpents fit this bill) the pet will be a "caster pet".  The problem here is that caster stats are of no benefit to the hunter pet.  So you get less strength and stamina, but don't get anything to show for it.
---
But I'm gonna be a troll. Shadowguard is actual master racial
---
He is right. Priest can't cleanse viper sting lol.  Just cause you were also right that dispel magic can be cast in shadow form, doesn't mean he was not right that priests cannot cleanse poisons like viper sting.
---
&gt;(or the next expansion rolls out and its no longer relevant)
---
Not 100% true; I started very late in Vanilla (1.11 I believe) and only got to try ZG and AQ20 a few times in PUGs before TBC launched.  I still wanted to go run MC, BWL, etc even after I hit 70 just so I could see the inside of these mythical places that I had heard so much about.
---
Alcors is the BiS for TPS with the possible exception of Thunderfury (It definitely is in AoE circumstances I can't remember single target though as the HS spam from Alcors generates a ton of threat) and yeah it'll be very expensive but a BiS list should be BiS, not "well this item costs 10x as much so I'm not listing it"
---
I'll make you bubble-hearth back to Goldshire
---
Not if you're serious about being dps. Especially as melee. When do I pop my cooldowns? Is it the right time to switch stances and overpower, or will I lose the gamble on that one? Do we burst this dangerous mob down or do I run away now to save my previous world buff? Have those mobs been tanked enough for me to start AoE? Shit, I pulled aggro, I better press my invulnerability potion. Oh wait can I stay behind that mob while invulnerable to avoid parries or do I need to go to the tank anyway because it'll still cast on me? Is the tank making enough that in those few seconds or do I need to run away so my threat cap goes to 130% up from 110%? ...
---
So many things that are nontrivial, that you need to think about *while still maintaining* your rotation or whatever priority list you have. Sure, you can just do your rotation and not think about anything else if you're fine with being mediocre at best. Or you can try to be good.
---
Got it ok thank you makes sense! Playing Alliance and didnt know WOTF dispells WS..
---
They don't like it be like it is but it do
---
I want to play hunter for a few reasons:
---
1) have fun in wpvp and bgs with friends 
---
2) pug stuff like MC and Ony, probably not going to try hard like I did when I played retail and push for progression with a guild
---
3) farm gold for my meme spec toon (spriest or Druid tank)
---
Am I going to be able to accomplish these? I also think ranged characters are super dope and aesthetically pleasing
---
If dying is the solution then its not a solution
---
That's literally the stupidest defense to an argument I've ever heard. 
---
It's a bad analogy and you should feel bad.
---
&gt; Without layering for the launch, people will drop like flies because they are waiting in a Disneyland line to do anything.
---
Statement so wrong it's baffling.  First of all, no one leaves a MMO because there's too many people.
---
Second of all, you imply people will just stand there.   Yep.  Wait 10 minutes.  Certainly they won't group up, travel, engage other people.  Nope.  Stand there.
---
This is Blizzard's exactly line of thinking in retail that ruined the game and you people are all too haply to bring it to Classic- the concept that a player not getting what they want immediately is some sort of egregious sin.
---
Yeah I learned that. Never played a priest so this is all new to me. I assumed because the tooltip for dispel is vague
---
deputy of stormwind isn't a very grand title - i always thought of it as just being a low level volunteer
---
Once you add it’s no longer classic.
---
Yeah, it's like taking an alternate route to work in the morning, because the main street is busy...except that everyone else does the same.
---
Sure. If you expand Azeroth with new raids and how zones, how do you make them worthwhile? If you add a T4 raid, then T1/T2 raids are irrelevant. If you add more raids similar to MC/BWL, then you risk gear inflation. Players acquiring too many raid items. Also, why do such raids if you already have better gear?
---
They have a +dodge racial which is nice for Warriors and the +Agi is nice for physical DPS classes. Shadowmeld isdecent for Hunters. And Priests get Starshards, which is good because reasons.
---
Make an all NE RP guild with this name.
---
I put plainstriders in B-Tier.  Bite and Dash is a decent combo, especially for leveling.
---
&gt;Did you play classic? Hahahahahahah
---
"Jesus christ" is right...
---
Have you tried going to another questing location?  How about grouping for an instance?
---
On number 5, everyone should be aware that means pet is channeled in Classic. It wasn't changed to instant cast until Burning Crusade. So although many players have only  known it to be instant cast, not in Classic. So it's going to affect DPS being channeled.
---
Cold blood is not needed at all with daggers, backstab does more than enough damage.
---
+1. Compared to DAOC WoW was uber-casual. People think of WoW being this ultra-hardcore game but the fact that every single class can hit 60 solo within a month was a pretty damn big deal for its success. Your grandma can play WoW. WoW didn't hit 10 million subs because of Molten Core, it hit 10 million subs because grandma could ding off some boars. 
---
This whole "live together die alone" narrative is such fucking bunk. Compared to modern WoW, sure, the social aspects are there for end-game play and that kept hardcore players playing and talking about the game, but grandma didn't care whether Naxx existed. That's why I laugh, I fucking LAUGH when people talk about adding tier 4 to 1.13, that that is the secret sauce that will bring WoW to the glory days, tens of millions of gamers are just waiting for a new raid after Naxx, that's the thing. Delusional. Pure delusions.
---
I have Hyenas in B-Tier.  They're not a wolf, so they wouldn't be able to learn wolf skills.  They can learn Dash and Bite, which is a decent combination.
---
Cats have a lot more flexibility with Bite, Claw, and Dash, as well as the ability to Prowl.  Cats also often have faster attacks, which translates to increased effectiveness against casters.  Birds have screech, which means AoE threat.
---
Looks like you will be making a journey with your dwarf, can't have another night elf swooping on your wife.
---
pretty sure it was meant for people who are already planning on having it done
---
It didn’t have 10k pop through naxx. Shit was hovering at 7k or so pre classic launch announcement.
---
You'll regret it if you don't!
---
Now someone do Rogue!
---
Moonkin Druid here.
---
There are more health risks involved with tube tying though. I figured it was worth the money because of that alone.
---
There are literally people constantly proposing solutions, you just want to see Classic ruined like retail or you're too ignorant to the ramifications of layering.
---
How do I stay hydrated without having to use the restroom constantly too?
---
I am on the no changes side, but i agree that Summoning Stones would be a very nice improvement or both gameplay and social experience.
---
Although I really liked Dual Spec and it made things convenient, it does not really fit to the vanilla feeling. I agree that the respec cost is absurdly high, maybe it should be lowered, but i should be done at the class trainers in cities. Respecing in the middle of stv jungle has little to no RPG feeling to it.
---
You won't get out of the starting areas in 6 hours.
---
Unless you REALLY want to go out at lvl 1.

Do you even know what a vasectomy is?
---
Tauren hunter ftl.  This would make their deadzone even bigger.
---
All good and well till 3/4 of the 5k quit two months in and you’re on a dead server.
---
Rogue has a lot of useful ones since they have such an odd array of things you do regularly. Being able to spam nearest target + Pickpocket or nearest target + sap, lock picking, poisoning/switching gear, etc
---
Omfg im dying lololol
---
How is merging servers once every few years worse than layering?
---
I didn't even know summoning stones weren't in the game lol. But yeah I'd be fine with those and dual spec if it cost 1000g.

It seems like if you transfer world servers you may not be teleported back to original.

Except for AQ gates.

This was a great read man. It really brings me back to the way it was in the early days. Before battlegrounds were introduced, the world really felt alive. Truly the golden age of world pvp.
---
Things that provide only one drop/item for an entire group.  For example, Benedict's Chest, where your whole party gets a key but only one person at a time can pick up the 10 minute respawn chest on the roof.  Similarly, the Kolkar banner quest in Barrens, a group quest where the elite enemy drops a banner that ONLY one person (potentially not in your party) can grab.  5 minute respawn and 5 minutes of killing.
---
They need their own theme song

This comment is underrated

Why did you play? Shaman
---
I suppose it would be more clear as 
---
Why did you play - Shaman
---
But that doesn't mean you aren't a huge dickmunch
---
I know what it means.
---
 You assume a role and you play as that role. RPG's are about immersion, among other things. Anything that damages the integrity of the game and world is a detriment to the immersion.
---
With Transmog you could have a lvl 60 Warrior look like a lvl 10 Warrior and beat everyone's ass.  It would be silly and It would ruin the immersion. 
---
If you deal a shit ton of damage and basically steamroll everyone, you should look the part.
---
&gt;The most fun I had as a healer was solo healing as a disc priest during MOP
---
NO.
---
You need to find a mix between looking good and having great Stats.
---
Yes I noticed on my Hunter I had a bad habit of getting too close as I'm default to want to run into the fray.
---
Mage T1 and T2 are poorly itemized for PVE due to a lack of +hit. The T2 8 piece set bonus is pretty good but you may not collect all 8 pieces, and 7/8 is way, way worse than an offset clownsuit.
---
On the other hand rogue T2 actually is BiS for that tier. It's not a universal issue. The problem is that Blizzard didn't figure out caster itemization until AQ40 and also assumed that warriors would only tank in PVE.
---
Is this feedback about the Intro again...
---
Interesting idea. I never thought to do this back in vanilla. I'll have to see if I can con my friends into doing this with me at RFD while I chase after Ragglesnout.
---
Long post because I'm bored at work and I've read this same thread like 5 times in the last month. 
---
Because Vanilla has been around since 2004, in many ways it's been studied and experimented with to the extreme. Best in slot lists, quest routes, etc. are all symptoms of this. "sub-optimal" "not-viable" are all names for specs that just don't perform as well in the thousands of hours we've played Vanilla WoW. Some serious nerds have literally deciphered the equations from *screenshots* of damage numbers. The autism of this community (in a good way) is rivaled only by the Old School Runescape community. Vanilla is "beaten" there isn't anything new or crazy to learn. There will be a period of rediscovery when classic releases and we see all the stuff private servers have gotten wrong for years, but the game will not be insanely different. 
---
Prot Paladins? No single target taunt, threat generation is lower than a warrior tank, etc.
---
Enhancement Shamans? They just don't occupy the same spot on the dps meter that a rogue or fury warrior will, and have all the risks of melee dps with the payoff being less dps for some utility (windfury is fucking DANK when it procs anyone who says otherwise is on crack). These things are quantified, discussed, and tested thoroughly. 
---
Filling a 40 man raid roster is hard in vanilla, people will take you. But you're causing yourself and the group to suffer a loss in maximum potential. I **encourage** people to play these weird specs, but you have to own them. "Oh sorrry UwU I'm feral dps even though I only do 30% of the damage the rogue does" is gonna be a source of contention between you and anyone like a raid lead or guildmaster. As a guildmaster in classic I'll have one simple rule: All specs are accepted, all playstyles are fair game, but that will have an effect on loot priority unless demonstrated otherwise. You gotta be tough if you're gonna be stupid or fuckin contrarian. 
---
The "worse" specs are all somewhat intentional by blizzard. Boomkin exist for caster dps options on a Druid, shadow priests are a dps priest. Their implementation was just fucked (prot paladins don't have a taunt, and this has been confirmed as a design oversight they didn't have time to fix thematically before launch). These sorts of things aren't just player bias, its a lack of a coherent design when the class was made. If you plan on playing with randoms, be ready for them to ask what your spec is. Be ready for them to turn you away. The overall truth is that while someone on reddit might say "Balance druid is fine" if you don't find him in game and join his guild you likely will be passed up for someone else. The consensus exists because it's just net value equations, X does more damage than Y. I would rather have a mage over a balance druid, I want a rogue over an enhancement shaman, I want a warrior tank over a paladin. It's not because my head is in the sand over it it's because the specs are lacking characteristics and in some cases seem like an afterthought. We have equations for this sort of thing, we have testing, we have numbers. A good raid lead, pvp premade captain, Guildmaster,  will have watched and learned all of this stuff. They are not responsible to make sacrifices because you don't want to heal as a shaman, or want to tank as a paladin. Make the decision and own it, negatives and all. Experiment with new things,  go off the outlined "optimal" spec, it's all electronic currency anyways. You're not refinancing your home mortgage just to spec Balance. But you have to admit to somebody who's inviting you somewhere that's what you're doing, and you have to accept that they might not want to put up with it. 
---
There's no excuse to be ignorant anymore, this data has been available for years and the conversation about it is fucking BORING now.
---
TL;DR Everyone knows what's "viable" and whats not, you choose to play the class and the style, so be ready to be discriminated against by some people. It's a game, so play whichever way is most fun to **YOU**, nothing is permanent with talent specs anyway so the conversation is basically pointless.
---
Your mileage is gonna vary, honestly. I talked to a lot of guys who had it WAY easier than I did, and guys that had it a lot worse.
---
I developed some sort of infection or inflammation; and antibiotics didn’t do shit. Dealt with the pain for about 4 months and then it just went away. There’s still occasional soreness (not on the incision, the actual right testicle), but it’s pretty manageable. Usually don’t even notice it. 
---
Just follow the doctor’s orders, don’t rush anything. And if you don’t feel up to moving after 2-3 days, **don’t push it**. And keep those nuts iced according to doc’s orders.
---
But don’t let this deter you from getting the surgery, it’s 100% worth it.
---
Precisely, which is why this is about Post-Classic.
---
Maybe they just keep releasing new Classic servers instead.
---
Naw, i just hate needles
---
I agree those changes would actually be nice but most don't. 
---
There's a real worry that if they add one thing they wont know when to stop. Also there's a general nochanges cult/meme.
---
Most healers use either Clique or Vuhdo. Healbot as you remember from vanilla won't work.
---
Also Heroic strike.
---
I think either of those QOL Changes should not come. However, I would be okay with only changing the cost of the respec to 50-75% or so of their current costs.
---
Seriously, why is he so salty alllllll the time?  Is the game not fun for him?

Every rogue who is raiding and caring about their dps will be going combat, and in the combat tree we have a talent that gives us 5% hit. It’s called Precision in the 2nd row.

Yet Aimed Shot was affected by Rapid Fire in 2006 and is affected by it in the Beta. Funny how that works.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Dvtqn6FLw) is a video from Vanilla. There are conveniently 3 aimed shots at the start of the video with different buffs. First one is unbuffed, second one has Rapid Fire, third one has Rapid Fire +Imp AotH proc. It's not hard to see the difference in speed, especially when you slow the video down to 0.25.

Duel spec for 10,000g

I wouldn't say its not needed "at all". It's just a nice insurance for an eviscerate to finish the job in case the beginning of the fight didn't go well.

Imp sprint is nice, but I never needed it in vanilla. A vanish always did the trick for me.

But it seems like you build specs a lot around bg's. I only did world pvp with lots of 1v2 etc fights.

They're basically releasing patch 1.12 but meshed up with the Legion client / database back end. Content will be in phases. BG's might be cross realm but we don't know yet since all that's available is test realms.

"1 gold little man, put that shit in my hand, if the money doesn't show then you ain't gonna go"

Though OSRS hasn’t solved this problem, they’ve definitely put in a conscious effort to slow down power creep by having new bosses drop item and gear that fills a niche role in the high end PVM or PVM ecosystem, rather than simply rendering previous content obsolete. Granted at some point, some time is devalued, but doing it very slowly and having the barrier be extremely challenging content leaves these new BIS items so costly that only a few people can really afford the new BIS for long periods of time. So the prior end game slowly moves to mid game content. Another avenue OSRS explores was something called “Ironman” where all gear/consumables have to be farmed by that player. So now trading other players or using the AH. I’ve never actually played wow, but the profession system may limit this. The workaround could be another game mode (optional for all players to choose) where their gear can only be obtained via drop in raid, not purchased. Again since I have no Wow experience whatsoever, this may not be fitting. But it’s interesting to see how another old school MMO addresses new content additions while maintaining an old school vibe. Hopefully blizzard learns from the OSRS team’s model and improves upon it.
---
For bg pvp, look at survival/marksman. Entrapment is some of the best group cc in the game, you have scatter, and deterrence is great when you get focused by melee. 
---
Or you can go with an intimidation/scatter build. That is the best build for kiting and getting out of oh shit scenarios
---
Most people will probably just flood stv and be stuck at 38-40 forever. All for the meme
---
This sort of gets asked every day.  PServers have been around for a long time, and there are still people wanting to play them, so keeping some players interested in Classic takes no effort at all.
---
If they make Classic+, then they can do whatever they want.  It'll be a new game at that point.  Otherwise, they can then add a set of BC servers and let people play those for a few years, and run them in parallel with Classic servers for people who just don't feel like advancing into BC.
---
30 is a bit much but I wouldn’t mind one of each weapon type
---
Yeah like I said there’s room to move some points around. I couldn’t make up my mind on master of deception and opportunity so I went with a mix of both. Opportunity isn’t complete useless since it applies to garrotte as well which will be used sometimes. Sadly you can’t take a point out of the Assassin tress and put it towards gouge since you need those points to get to Cold Blood.
---
1) Yes
---
2) I think there are too many variables to answer this question for any class. But, if there are PUGs, you should be able to get in unless there are tons of Hunters.
---
3) Yes

yikes

True story, my first char was a shaman and I played enhancement, with a 1h! They told me it would be good if I can heal in MC. I think after 1 raid I decided I can't take this shit, I want to be one of the cool guys going toe to toe with the enemies. On top of that I was swooning over all those glorious plate armor mo...shoulders. So when I dipped into raiding the first time I decided to create a warrior, I dont know how fast I leveled, but that warrior was ready to go mc before my shaman had any two set piece out of MC. Never really looked back since.

Its hard unless mageweave/shadow silk is cheap, the levels you can first use shadoweave, farming those mats is way out of your level range. Plus Lock is pretty easy to level with mediocre gear.

What factors would you use on a tier list for hunter pets in raids, dungeons, or PvP?  I did one for solo questing and am pretty happy with it.  My criteria:
---
* D-Tier: Can only learn Bite or Claw as a special ability
---
* C-Tier: Can learn Bite &amp; Claw, or can learn another ability that is not strong enough for a higher tier
---
* B-Tier: Can learn Bite &amp; Dash but no other abilities, or can learn an ability with AoE threat
---
* A-Tier: Pets with Dash or Dive, in addition to another ability besides Bite or Claw
---
* S-Tier: Boars under level 30 (then they're A-Tier), and then any pet with an AoE threat ability AND Dash or Dive
---
What would be your rubric for how to define a pet tier list for:
---
* Raids
---
* Dungeons
---
* PvP
---
&gt;You just want your toy, fuck everyone else...right

---
They’ll naturally get better at the game. It just comes with experience. They may still be bad, but not as bad as previously.
---
But many of those that are sitting and trying to compare old Vanilla vs new classic and such are most likely not in the group of “bad and will remain bad” set of players. Especially if they’ve continued to play pservers for years.

I sure as hell hope this is a bug

Scatter Shot is one of the best abilities a Hunter has. It has no range limit on it, so it can be used on targets in melee range. It can also be used to interrupt spell casts from casters mid-combat.

Feign Death is commonly paired with Freezing Trap, which is stronger than Wyvern Sting since it isn't effected by WotF, Stoneform, or Cleanses. There's few situations where you'd prefer to do FD -&gt; Wyvern over FD -&gt; FT.
---
A common move when someone jumps you in melee is to Scatter Shot them followed by Feign Death -&gt; Freezing Trap. This gives you plenty of time of gain distance, bandage up, and channel a full aimed shot on them. You can do not do the same thing with Wyvern Sting as it has a minimum range.
---
Thanks a bunch and I’ll definitely check that out now
---
All Hail Oscar Gamble.
---
world first posting of this specific comment
---
This is exactly the post I was looking for. Classic WoW gear is fairly linear in terms of stats. It is mostly just flat attribute increases that determine the value of gear.
---
Maybe if people even took the time to consider what was MH and what was OH, but sure, for Alfred Eisensteiner this detail may be important.
---
That's going to be a hard no from me and I'm sure mostly everyone else here. 
---
If you want to respec 30 times a week then go farm. Outside of a raid setting most classes can use the same pve spec for pvp and it will work well enough. 
---
When it comes to summoning stones stop being lazy and walk to the instance like the rest of the group. 
---
Yes, a lot of QoL features that have been added over the years made the game "better" and more convenient. But Classic is a recreation of Vanilla and many of those features didn't exist at that time. And more importantly a vast majority of people here don't want the watered down WoW we have today.
---
With that being said I started playing in late 04 (main'ed a holy priest) and I remember the pain of walking to whatever instance I was running or spending the time to farm gold when I wanted to pvp as shadow. 
---
Farming for gold to respec gave you something to do instead of just afk'ing in the city of your choice and waiting for a queue/summon that you see in Retail. 
---
Vanilla was about being out in the world farming, questing, taking part in wpvp, not sitting in the AH all day while you watch Netflix on your 2nd monitor.
---
This is an older format that isn't used much anymore, so I hope you can follow it.  Let's say that auto-shot has a 2-second timer.  It would look like this:
---
* T=0 - start auto-shot
---
* T=0.5 - auto-shot fires
---
* T=2 - start auto-shot #2
---
* T=2.5 - auto-shot #2 fires
---
* T=4 - start auto-shot #3
---
* T=4.5 - auto-shot #3 fires
---
If you use aimed shot (which I think was a 3 second cast, correct me if I'm wrong), it looks like this:
---
T=0 - start aimed shot
---
T=3 - aimed shot fires
---
T=3 - start auto-shot
---
T=3.5 - auto-shot fires
---
T=5 - start auto-shot #2
---
T=5.5 - auto-shot #2 fires
---
T=7 - start auto-shot #3
---
T=7.5 - auto-shot #3 fires
---
T=9 - aimed shot is off cooldown
---
T=9 - start auto-shot #4 
---
T=9.5 - auto-shot #4 fires
---
T=9.5 - start aimed shot #2
---
T=12.5 - aimed shot #2 fires
---
T=12.5 - start auto-shot #5
---
T=13 - auto-shot #5 fires
---
You start to get in the way of your shots because they can't fire at the same time.
---
OP can be my raid leader anyday.
---
This could be solved if the summoning stones could only be used by and used on characters that are in the level range of the dungeon. For example you could only summon players between level 16-24 to the Deadmines. It would be also nice to discover summoning stones like flight paths so you could not be summoned there if you did not discover it before.
---
I'm just saying, they probably exist and there's probably a significant amount of them. There are probably even more people who enjoy both aspects. Then there are those who just enjoy being able to identify what gear people are wearing, which for me is actually an important aspect of vanilla. But hey, different strokes etc.
---
*Chases 1 mage with 40 people.
---
"Alliance are shitty."
---
I’ll be there on my orc rogue! Need to get a raid going for this lol.
---
Spell crit is almost completely useless. Int and Spirit are okay but extra healing is both of those things at the same time - with the way downranking works, you spend less of your overall mana per cast and you spend less mana per minute if you have higher healing, meaning it is Int and Spi rolled into one. +healing is also the only way to increase maximum HPS as well. It was simply one of the best stats in the game, especially prior to MP5 and before chugging pots for MP was diminished in relevance. 
---
I don't know the exact specifics of the math, but if they crunched the numbers, I'm willing to believe it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrI-UBIB8Jk&amp;feature=share
---
Essentially the closest thing I could think of is the intro to this.
---
Love you.
---
It sounds like taking the most fun part of the game and then throwing it in the trash to me. But I understand it.
---
I like that first spec a lot. Question. How often do you use garrote? I would imagine not often because I don't believe it has a silence like in BC, nor do cheap shot and kidney shot share DR. Maybe just using it on orcs or rogues that you don't want to restealth?
---
I'm not a fan of actual PVP rewards.
---
True, live events were slightly gated when compared progress on other realms.
---
I’d love to know the thought process in making this scene. 
---
“We want him to close the mirror portal behind, but it’s gotta be in a cool way”
---
“What if he punches the mirror after going through it and breaks it?”
---
“Ya that’s awesome, ok we’ll do that.... wait how will they know he punched it if he’s on the other side.”
---
“.........what if.... he puts his arm back through the portal and punches it from our side?”
---
“Ya fuck it, who cares. Let’s go get lunch”
---
They aren’t easy to kill, but not close to a BM’d out pet.
---
If you're trying to level as fast as possible then leveling professions is a waste of time. Time spent leveling professions is time that could be spent actually leveling.
---
For most healers +healing is worth more point for point then int.  Maybe worth wearing stormrage for a intensive FR fight, but realize it drops off nef, so you literally are done with progression fights against fire bosses by the time you get this chestpiece.  Day 1 AQ40 I would be wearing robes of the exalted.  
---
The reason for some of that is that +healing is a really oppressive stat for healers.  Early on there is some parity between int and +healing, but the more +healing you have the better it gets as it allows you to downrank heals effectively giving you back more mana saved then you would have gotten from more int.  There are other gear slots where something like robes of the exalted isn't available, and in those slots you will get a minimum amount of int needed for a fight.  
---
The other thing is, in raiding you have a lot of buffs that increase you mana.  Potential world buffs, food buff, wisdom(A), kings(A), spirit, AI, mark, mana potions, night dragon's breath, dark runes, mana tide/spring(H), etc.  You have practically none that increase your +healing, only amp magic and then only generally on the main tank.  This further devalues int for raid bis.  
---
Stormrage is clearly better in pvp, and I would probably use it on non-progression fights and 5mans where I just would want the higher HP so I don't die to dumbshit or where minmaxing healing isn't as important.
---
If you rush to 60, you can then dominate the opposite faction that much more effectively. You can have \*both\*.
---
&gt; FD already makes you drop the target so the meld is pointless
---
Looooool it's so you can eat/drink.  Cause anyone with half a brain could figure that out.
---
Maybe it’s they who missed out, not you.
---
Hunter pvp question: How do I fight Shamans? I'm trying out a hunter on pserver and really struggling against Shamans.
---
They can mitigate a fair amount of damage with mail + shield and have endless slows (totem, frost shock, weapon enchantment). Stings are insta cleansed, they can heal and they out-damage me in melee range.
---
Is there a consistent strategy to beat Shamans (and not one that relies on rng)?
---
The channel wasn't without its benefits.  It hurts your DPS, but you can also pump out an insane amount of healing during that time.  Changing it to a 15-second HoT made it take up a lot less of your auto-shot time, but also reduced the potential HPS to 1/3 of what it was.  
---
However, compared with Health Funnel, it does more healing in less time, and it doesn't hurt the Hunter's health pool to do it.
---
Classic/Vanilla rejected the idea of class homogenization and the notion that all classes and specs needed to be balanced and have equal viability. It meant that there were interesting and unique classes and specs to consider, and that your choices had consequences and tradeoffs. This meant there was a diversity of specs and play styles and the min/max attitude was not as prominent. Hybrids were actually hybrids. They were jack of trades that could dabble in different roles, but there was no expectation that they would be as good at any given role as classes who specialized in them.
---
The expansions, in part due to misguided player pressure, slowly homogenized the classes and specs. Unique and interesting and different choices were no longer the development goal.
---
Yeah. You kill no adds, kill the goblin boss, princess, and croc then reset. Sell blues.
---
[Because life on the outside ain't what it used to be.](https://youtu.be/KUX30kkjHiM)
---
Even if I just save the mats for max level?
---
1.12 didnt drastically change the game difficulty wise. The itemization and class changes mostly happened in earlier, more mid-vanilla patches, and all of them pre 1.12. There were almost no dungeon difficulty nerfs in all of vanilla, the only real ones were in 1.10 when they removed a lot of the trash from dungeons like scholo/strat to compensate for it becoming 5 rather than 10 man.
---
More layers wont be added... The most popular days will be the first week. After that people will drop off. I also hope they can use some resources to prevent botting. And they don't use stolen accounts. They use stolen credit cards, which does hurt blizzard.
---
I know gold farming well. After I stopped enjoying the game I played the AH for fun. In cata I have Chinesegold farmers that would mail me BoE epics they farmed from Firelands and Id make 2x my money in a week. They used froat DK's with  flight hacks to kite all the mobs indefinitely taking 0 damage. 
---
After that they started duping mounts/pets with the Character Restoration system. I spend all extra hold on those and make $1/1000g selling the pets on Ebay. Sold $20k doing that before ebay banned me and blizz sent me a letter stating if I break their ToS again they will sue me  for selling copyrighted goods. They own all itema in the game they just sinply lwt you borrow them.
---
It depends on your gear. Sometimes you should wait for auto to fire, and sometimes it is better to spam aimed on CD (doing that will mean your auto finishes cooling down somewhere during your aimed cast and is essentially 'wasted' while waiting for the aimed cast to complete).  
---
You'll need to run sims based on your weapon, gear, and buffs. Don't worry, there'll be easy spreadsheets with dropdown menus for this stuff.  
---
If you're not inclined, just wait &amp; cast aimed right after your auto fires.
---
I would imagine the vast majority of people will use Curse simply because it's the most popular addon platform AFAIK.
---
I think he has aspergers. Not joking.
---
"I wanted to see if this would actually trigger someone"
---
Nah, this makes you look stupid as fuck.
---
&gt;I don't want to change the Classic experience too much
---
I don't think you know what those words mean. 
---
&gt;but I think most would agree these are nice changes that vastly improved the game when they were implemented.
---
Absolutely not.
---

It should do
---
Meme specs aren't solely limited to DPS.
---
Shadowmeld can be pretty good.  Maybe not overall as useful as stoneform.  But NE Hunters can meld + cat stealth to ambush players, guard a WSG flag or AB point.  Also feign + Shadowmeld + eat/drink is useful.  NE Hunters also have really early and easy access to owls which are considered one of the best leveling pets.
---
One of the Oogas told Tipsoutbaby last night that he would reroll dwarf female if he went alliance
---
Good luck my fellow human, you will be knee high in shitty diapers and sleep deprived, but in 3 years when they are running around screaming when you get home, it's mostly the same but they say I love you and stuff now which is cool.
---
It's not just mystique. It also gives players something to aspire to, to work towards, to keep playing for. If all the content is just handed to you in participation trophy fashion, the desire to work at your character or build your guild slowly dissipates.
---
Lol people in this thread shitting on combat swords.  Adrenaline rush and improved kick are great skills.
---
Yeah I envy this new generation, having parents that actually understand and enjoy video games must be great. 
---
My mom did finally learn that you can't pause an MMO though, so I had that going for me
---
I like you, that was succinct.
---
Will do! Thank you bud!
---
By the beard of Gimli
---
You don't think there is going to be 40,000 little nerdletts that want to be on Asmongold's server?
---
? Most meme specs are the off specs for hybrids and thus not a healer. Generally the questions about these is for enhancement shaman, ret paladin, feral/balance druid. Unless you mean like survival hunter or arcane mage which aren't optimal but will still probably do more than any of spec hybrid
---
So what? It's not as if we are getting new raids anytime soon so who gives a fuck when people complete them?
---
You don't have to explain to anyone why you will be playing PVE. It's your money and your time, and your choice.
---
Roll horde.  (Seriously, hunters counter Paladins hard).
---
Serious answers:
---
1. Use a low rank of Serpent Sting so he burns his mana on cleanse
---
2. Try and get the drop on him to at least do some damage
---
3. Use a pet with fast attack speed (good against any caster or healer)
---
4. Frost Shock has a 20 yard range.  Stay past 20 yards as best as possible.
---
5. Use your CC.  Intimidation or Scatter Shot, Feign + Trap
---
Oh, most importantly - socialize.  Bring friends.  Shaman is bugging you?  Get 4 guys to camp him with you.  At least one of them will counter him like he counters you.
---
But are they gonna reduce the layering in tha phases? This is something they likely can just turn off serverside with a button. So if the majority of players spread out within the first days (will not happen but for example) they can just turn it off then.
---
Lol epics are the new greens in bfa
---
Druid tank can farm DM W lashers, so idk how much faster you can make gold on a hunter, but that was always very profitable for me
---
It really do be like that
---
I agree what you say in theory and support it.  But then all that goes out the window when you really consider how strong Orc is.
---
Realtalk: why is that such a bad thing? Playing games and having fun with friends instead of taking on a massive responsibility you don't want and don't need, sounds pretty good to me.
---
No changes. Stop trying to turn classic into retail.
---
&gt; If you force your lady to either use birth control or have her tubes tied instead, you're a weenie and should be ashamed of yourself.

Not to mention you'll be trusting your entire life in another person. Not adivisable.

Thats why I hate healing in FF14. You need to like dodge 90%of the shit thrown at you and cant cast while moving so annoying...

* S-tier: Cats. 2nd best leveling pet, best PVP pet (BT) and best PVE pet.

---
They have plans to remove it a few weeks or a month after release. It's just for the huge influx of people that will happen on release
---
I'm saying that you can't do that because they *change* man. The more AP/Strength you have, the more valuable that hit/crit becomes. The more hit/crit you have, the more valuable AP/Strength becomes. You can't just weight them against each other because there's an ideal ratio between the two for maximum effect. You could take a snapshot of their values at a particular state and it'll be *close*, but if you're weighing things against each other by tiny differences in value it'll be totally off.
---
There should be a post for each class coming out
---
Care to explain? Because I'm pretty sure I don't want to have one.
---
Ooh yeah playing God with rogue lives! We had a rogue guild officer and the GM would pay out a bounty to anyone who managed to get the rogue killed in any way. So, of course the first time I ran BWL with them on my dwarf priest (they were progression pushing naxx at the time) I healed the shit out of that rogue during a priest call on Nefarion. Easiest 25g I ever made.
---
Thanks for the advice.  My dad has a horror story, but it seems to be rooted in him trying to do too much too soon after the surgery.
---
Nope.  In my opinion if you care enough to join a group for a dungeon then you can get on the flight path and make it there.
---
Conversely, as a holy-only Paladin in Vanilla I loved the triage required to manage those green bars and my blue bar.  Good times.
---
Amen.  I never played pservers but I agree 100%.
---
To me, it's the high energy, vibrant world of a possibly overpopped server vs (layering) a system that hinders community building and breaks immersion.  Not a hard decision.
---
The BfA beta testers were not happy with azerite and other mechanics, but Blizzard went through with it anyways.
---
A solid mage can easily push 75g per hour once Dire Maul comes out.
---
That's 2s 8c per second.
---
Cost of reagent + 10s cast time = 40 silver and 80 copper.
---
But that only leaves 28 seconds to read your whisper, respond, accept the group invite, wait for you to find the mage, and trade the payment.
---
1 gold is a steal.
---
Well, that for sure is an advantage of being gay
---
I don't get how it's funny
---
If that’s not “Hooked on a Feeling” by Blue Swede, I will be very disappointed.
---
I pity everybody who had to serve as healers before duel spec was added
---
God damn you guys felt that wow didnt punish you enough for dieing?  I feel they punish you to much for dieing
---
One word : UTILITY.
---
Undead master race
---
Dunno what this is, but all I got out of it was that you’re advocating grinding cox
---
Yeah, because OP is doing vasectomy for the sole reason of playing WoW at launch
---
This is just pure awesome.
---
It's so you don't push back your melee swing so you can properly weave in your abilities.
---
I feel You, I was oomkin in tbc, they made them more viable then. I was top 3 dps in my guild and usually had the most deaths per raid because of my threat.. Those starfire crits &lt;3...
---
There was a stastic poll taken here a while back and troll was the least picked race. (Out of all of them) Idk if that helps
---
Silence you fools! Don't inform them
---
The raptors in WC scream when they die and aggro other raptors nearby, never seen it on pservers
---
i like troll more personally, faster casting and a 20% mortal strike.
---
Yeah for as long as Adrenaline Rush lasts. Then you're gimped for the other 4 minutes and 45 seconds.   
---
31 in combat for PvP is too vulnerable to CC and outside of Adrenaline Rush it lacks burst.
---
I dont really belive that someone is going to reach STV level range at 27/8-19 with less then 12 hour gameplay :-&lt;
---
Biggest thing Classic had that modern WoW lost sight of? A cohesive experience from start to finish. Every item you find has a purpose. Even greys are a reasonable source of gold while leveling and keeping your abilities trained. 
---
Things like non exponential stat growth are crucial. Level 60 is a big moment, but it's just one step in a long journey of character progression. You don't immediately become a god compared to 90% of the game world. And some items you had from prior to level 60 might stay with you for a long time. 
---
No multiple difficulties. You were interacting with the World of Warcraft. There weren't easy mode versions of content. There was content that was easy, and content that were more involved. This kind of setup is a great foundation for a vibrant community, because people will organize around helping eachother through content instead of now where the game just hands the content to you at whatever difficulty you'd like. 
---
Dying was a true inconvenience. Now we have so many spirit healers everywhere it's an annoyance if it takes more than 15 seconds to get to our corpse if we happen to die. I believe the longer corpse runs in Classic coupled with the heightened danger from mobs out in the world gave a lot of value to grouping up, or simply saving someone from dying could be a big deal. Similarly throwing buffs out for players as you run by them. You know that translates directly into helping them not die as much.
---
Now? Helping someone is a kind gesture, but doesn't really matter.
---
Things like no flying, further spread out flight paths, no mount until 40 and no fast mount until 60, longer hearth.. etc.. all helped flesh out the world. It makes simply traveling from zone to zone feel meaningful. And along the way, you'll get to see other players, maybe help them, or be helped. Maybe get involved in wPvP. Find a chest. Farm some profession nodes.. 
---
It's so sad the direction(s) they've taken the game in. Further and further every expansion from what made it magic in the first place.
---
Stfu
---
I think something that made Vanilla what it was, and sometimes gets overlooked, is the fact it was just really new to us. There were other MMO's before it, but WoW was still the "first" for a lot of us, and because of that we didn't really see all the underlying mechanics and systems and it all seemed mystical and magical. After 15 years of WoW, countless other imitators and just other developments in video games, we all have a much better understanding of "whats under the hood" as it were.   
---
I went into Deadmines the first time and was blown away by it, it was so cool and new and unique. I'm not going to have the same feeling ever again, because now I understand dungeons and gear and I can go look up the boss mechanics of any fight in seconds and so can everyone else.   
---
First time I saw a horde raid Stormwind? Blown away, what the hell was even happening? How did that Troll turn into a spirit of redemption? Who are all these people? It was crazy. Now I've seen and done that hundreds of times, I can probably go watch one of them streaming it if I wanted.   
---
Finding a small little cave nobody seemed to know about in Tenaris? Ah, nevermind here it is on wowhead with an explanation of what its for and what all can drop frm any of the mobs inside.   
---
The era vanilla came in defined and made it great far more than a specific design decision. I don't think that can be recaptured
---
People who want to clear at the front? A lot of us don't enjoy doing BWL for the first time with ZG gear or MC even for the first time with ZG gear. If that doesn't bug you sure go crazy but you're not gonna get into to a front end raiding guild unless you're friend's with someone at the top.
---
What I meant to say is, I don't want to be reliant on the burst damage of an opener. I don't find the play style fun. I'd rather have sustained damage.
---
Dear u/collateralfun and u/AdministrativeZebra8
---
Please take your weird flirty thing somewhere else, off of our subreddit. Just block each other in DMs and get on with your lives.
---
Yeah people underestimate this 100%. Just about as much as vanilla hybrid players overestimate how many successful groups they’ll be a part of 😜
---
3 female dwraves: Biggie, Fattie and Chubbie
---
I really agree with that! 
---
I do think a lot better balance is possible without ruining class identity and making them so homogenized, though. The devs screwed up, but that doesn't mean it can't be done.
---
I asked this in another thread but does every class have their class levels at the same level?
---
You're constantly watching streamers AND playing on a private server? Dude. You are 100% doing this to yourself. You can't blame a company for announcing a game. Literally every company that makes ANYTHING does this. It's not anybody else's fault that you can't exercise some self control, and your wording is definitely flirting with some shady stuff - for example, blaming a company if you steal from them, because their advertising made you want their product. Or mugging someone and taking their watch, because you saw it and couldn't control yourself.
---
Am I being overly dramatic? Maybe. But you're the one blaming other people for not having self control. You know who else does that? My girlfriend's 9-year-old daughter. There, have a new comparison - you're acting like a 9-year-old girl.
---
Yep, the timing is perfect...having our 3rd child next week and 3 is the number we decided on.
---
I made up a fake new girlfriend to miss a recent family event.
---
This is the quality anwser I needed (Despite how rough it is).  
---
The data might have been available for years, but I'd rather ask it like this and sort out a proper discussion than add a super low effort post going "Where can find datatables - Title". I've also never been a part of the private server/classic community until a few months after the classic announcement, so I wouldnt know where to look.  
---
I'm gonna go with full on enhance then, midmax what I can, and maybe spec resto when the more difficult raids come out, should it be needed. Hell, I'll farm herbs and spread beautiful flasks all over the raid. I sure dont wanna be the " Oh sorrry UwU I'm feral dps" guy. Thanks again for a solid anwser :)
---
Just fucking stop already.
---
Bold.  True.
---
What's the big deal of not leveling together for the first 10 or so levels?
---
I really don't get it. If anything, it'll be best for her so she can actually learn to play the game and solve problems on her own.
---
Hey fury warrior. Yeah you. You too rogue. You think you'd be doing so much DPS without my totems? Yeah that's what I thought. PUT SOME RESPECT ON ENHANCE
---
Personally, I like how vanilla handled it. 
---
Level 30 may be halfway in numbers, but 44-45 is halfway in do earned and time invested.
---
From about level 40 onwards all zones have *some* endgame relevance. Be it with an instance, a profession material or crafting/loot item off a mob.
---
I like this a lot. From swiftthistle and gromsblood to briarthorn and maraudom resistance gear...there was a reason to be in non 58-60 zones.
---
I’m okay with 1-30 not having much interaction with 50-60, and I sorta like how a level 40 with a mount and big bad pauldrons looks like a god from your mid 20s shoulder padless ass. 
---
Due to the change in direction explicitly towards endgame and away from leveling that sense never returned after the Dark Portal opened.
---
Hybrid shadow priests, HotW druids, etc.
---
Healers will try to spec into something that can solo/PvP better as well, it's not just DPS that does it. I mean they're less "meme" spec than like ret paladin but definitely not optimized for max performance in raids.
---
These aren't "QOL", they are major game mechanics.  QOL is for things like autoloot without pressing an extra button, better graphics/system options, and other changes that improve the *quality of life* while playing, not changes to what you're playing.
---
Didn't actually play shaman in vanilla but plan to for classic. Reason is that after awhile you can raid heal in the pvp ele spec so I can have fun with the 2 main parts of the game I like without having to always respec. Also they have wicked cool armor.
---
Would you appreciate the Mona Lisa if someone drew a giant dick on it?  That's what layering feels like to Classic.  I'd rather wait too.
---
The only difference now is that we all have jobs, families and our responsibilities as adults. Going for R14 on a single account would be some next level commitment that would greatly all the things listed above. I mean people like Swifty - no doubt he will get it again, but I don't think I would have the chance to get that R10 ever again.
---
I remember playing and liking hemo
---
(laughs in PvE)
---
They could if the population is low enough. But what if the population is still sky high on your server come Phase 2. And even though they said layering will be gone 100% by then, they keep it on. And you have guilds layer hoping for rare bosses, rare resources, and world pvp.
---
😂😂
---
thats_racist.gif
---
Yeah they clear all these raids and then what? Sit around and level alts until they get bored and leave? This mindset of rushing content that has already been beaten a bazillion times is dumb, I'll stick to slow leveling and enjoying the questing experience. Not to say it's a bad thing if you enjoy progression but it seems kinda pointless to me considering we don't know if they are even gonna expand horizontally yet.
---
I would image all that travel time would take a while? How's the efficiency compared with say, running to the furthest point in the starting area and grinding mobs?
---
Did you just have a stroke while typing that?  Nobody can be this stupid....
---
They'll all level on the first day don't jave to add more layers for them later. IMO they need to create restrictions on servers so that it never goes past 40/60 at launch.
---
Jf the server had 3k horde and Alliance has 1k itll force you to choose Alliance or pick a different server.
---
Yeah, Hunters are S tier wPvP and gold farming.
---
I do kind of prefer that they're the least played race... Less trolls around makes me seem more unique
---
Having camera movement bound is objectively worse if it interferes with your ability keybinds.
---
To strafe and not pitch you lose access to your camera movement unless you use a strafe bound button....in which case ???
---
I can move my camera while strafing (1 key, 1mb, and mouse movement) which isn't even possible with your keyset, I can strafe with a single button press and use the extra button for another ability.
---
Well they are, physically, but they’re called meeting stones and serve a different purpose.
---
TBH I think low resolution CRT monitors impacted whether or not I saw somebody more than shadows/water.
---
It's like one in a fucking million
---
&gt;Opportunity isn’t complete useless since it applies to garrotte as well which will be used sometimes.
---
How often do you use garrote? I would imagine not often because I don't believe it has a silence like in BC, nor do cheap shot and kidney shot share DR. Maybe just using it on orcs or rogues that you don't want to restealth?
---
&gt;Sadly you can’t take a point out of the Assassin tress and put it towards gouge since you need those points to get to Cold Blood.
---
The spec you linked me had 24 points in assassination; only 21 points are needed for cold blood.
---
So, like https://classicwow.live/ ?
---
It's not about having a unique situation. If a person likes to do something then he or she will find a way to enjoy it. That's pretty much where I was going with my thinking. I know you mentioned your other leisurely activities would take a hit, but does that really matter if you're enjoying the game? One thing I do feel for yeah are groceries, which is why I switched to doing it online and having it delivered. This saved me a good 3-4 hrs a week between the trips, standing in line, and transporting them to the house.
---
Oh I'm down for totem twisting and using my utility, I'm super excited for dropping WF totem for my melee buddies, I just dont want to dish out huge respec costs if I need to do it both before and after raids when I wanna play enhance for PvP. The respec costs would be un-farmable at some point. I dont have any experience with vanilla, but if I can heal where we need more healing just by swapping gearsets, I am down for that too.
---
I’m old too and the term app is for mobile devices. PC I would use application or program
---
Add a shadow priest in the group for shadow weaving and boost that up 15% and it’s all over for the bosses.
---
This guy is definitely a mage. Stick around him long enough and you'll have paid him $60k for a beat up Toyota that you're convinced is a Ferrari.
---
&gt;First weeks of vanilla would be ruined if they just launched as they did in 2004? Obviously
---
I don't understand this trait of thought.  They have 100 times the organization, tech, experience they had in 2004.  Surely they could create a system that didn't effect gameplay to sort out their FUCKING TECHNICAL ISSUES that weren't even a big deal in 2004.
---
Privates are overtuned.
---
People are now losing their minds because they tought vanilla was oooooh so haaaard and now they are seeing that it's not that
---
Because MMORPGs are hard right? I mean, I hope these peope never play Battletoads
---
Yeah, cast abilities and kite. The end.
---
I was on my lv 22 mage when someone asked me for a “port to Darnassus.” I said ok, invited him to party, and then teleported myself to Darnassus. When he started raging at me, I said “what? You asked me to cast a Teleport to Darnassus, so I did. Mages don’t get portals until 40 (I think, long time ago), dumbass.”
---
Then disband group.
---
I would never want to disappoint you
---
If it's not about only classic... no.
---
While you are right that the methodology you are describing is the best way to go about it we have seen that bugs from the WoD, Legion, and BFA betas all make it to live even with massive attention and reporting by players. Historically, Blizzard Specifically, has had many bugs that were prevalent and common knowledge in Beta that made it live. I want to believe they have it fixed on their end but have no reason to suspect that they do given their past indiscretions.
---
*0 upvotes, 46% upvoted*
---
Not really :P
---
If you want the crafted stuff for max level then only felcloth shoulders and head are good. If your biggest concern is time then just ignore professions (other than first aid) while you're leveling.
---
Hunters are just as good as dwarf since most bis are not guns.
---
Lol you guys just can't stop yourselves.
---
Right, of course if heals are failing too then it should be clear that the guild needs try a little harder
---
Uh... official servers are official.
---
Lol no. Play bfa.
---
Dwarf.
---
Sorry, this is a troll post.
---
Trolls be good, mon.
---
Berserking is great for PvE and hey, Trolls are just cool.. And when it comes right down to it: I think you should kinda play the race you want to look at for however many hours you'll be playing. If you don't like the aesthetic it can really start to bother you later and, well, that's just no good.
---
Hate to tell you this, but rest isn't needed anymore for the 10 min procedure. I had to ask my doc for a note just to have an excuse to miss work
---
Shadowguard can proc Blackout which I find more valuable than DP
---
Also, Trolls are PvE BiS for all casters. Trolls are the beat race.
---
How are they different?
---
Lol even better
---
No one thinks that. Blizzard will have multiple servers while rhe private ones usually have 1 or 2. No one thinks a private server has more playerd than all of blizzards servers combined of course.
---
I'm about to blow your mind here, but you *don't need to wait in one spot doing nothing for something to spawn*.  You can go to another location, or do something else, socialize, pvp, anything you want!  In fact, it can be a boon to the game since it forces people off the beaten path!  Heck, you might not even get back to thst quest!  Pretty crazy, right?
---
Trolls are sick mate, embrace the male troll with pink mohawk
---
Maybe because Ion Hazzikostas said it himself? 
---
[Interview with Ion at specific question](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=234). This is the start of the question, but he specifically mentions "just those first few weeks" @5:22.
---
Yeah, of course they could keep it forever. It's up to you if you want to believe what the developers are saying, or believe they are lying. I like to err on the side of trust in this team, but thats just me.
---
vurtne is also from sweden and i used to have 100ms in vanilla so probably even less ms than you think
---
1. I never go out of my way to make Shadoweave while leveling unless I can buy the mats for cheap. After I get my mount, if I have a bad piece of gear, I'll try to find some Shadoweave pieces on the AH. They tend to range from 2-10g from my experiences.
---
2. It depends on how you will spend your time at end game. If you have easy access to a group through your guild, most pre-raid best in slot pieces are easily attainable. However, in your downtime between dungeons, it would be worth your time to go out and farm mats for these pieces.
---
3. At 40 after you have your mount is an okay time for farming. I personally rush to 60 before farming specific pieces. Felcloth is a popular material, and Satyrs in Azshara and Felwood are heavily camped, so WPVP is something you should expect.
---
Thanks my b
---
This is a big one for me. So many modern games like BFA and Destiny feature these checklist of things to do per day and per week to get ilv or light upgrades. It begins to feel like a job or obligation rather than a game.
---
Based on?
---
Was this supposed to be in r/shittylifeprotips ?
---
That's been the case since TBC. The term welfare epics basically flooded into existence, by the end everyone had full purples, including their alts and off-specs
---
I want to roll a mage just for RPing, giving people portals in important places and making some gold. What level minimum can I do this in your opinion? I want to raid as a priest so I hope some mid-level is doable.
---
Huh... that's a really interesting, different way to manage it.  
---
......so what you're telling me is my moonkin deserves... nay, nEEDS Hand of Rag? Thank you.

Get ready to no life the fuck out of this just to get to 60 and get your pre raid bis. And then no life it some more to get attuned to all the raids and then no life it some more to raid and get consumables to raid.
---
Y'all will hate me for this but history will repeat itself and only like less than 5% of the population will even experience the end game content.

Enjoy!
---
I remember in AB saying that Blacksmith was clear only for a group of nightelves to pop out of shadowneld and gank us
---
In those 3 times you use escape artist you'd get the snare reapplied 3 times so it's really not that good
---
Meeting Stones are for filling in partial (or just-starting) parties whose members meet the required level range by auto-inviting suitable candidates from a pool of signed-up candidates.  Basically it’s LFG but it doesn’t summon.
---
On my phone cant tell what the hell happened
---
Even dagger rogues open up generally with cheap shot and do the stun combo, only against mages do you ambush.
---
It always amuses me when the PvPers think that the majority of players won’t roll on PvE servers.
---
When its given to you to act on behalf of the State by Highlord Bolvar, and you answer directly to him, that goes well beyond a low level volunteer.
---
I'm out of the loop, can someone fill me in on what "Ooga gang" is?
---
What if his fun comes from discovering and picking precisely what gives the bear value ?

These blizzard drones are falling for the same trap

---
What item are they referencing a tabbard?
---
Playing Classic and having a vasectomy, isn't that a little redundant?
---
Go see what the minimum is for BFA and assume at least that, really shouldn't be much if I'm guessing right
---
friend trolls me saying he got tabard, then it drops for me, and then ANOTHER drops for someone else, hype moments of excitement haha
---
Since paladins not having a taunt was a design oversight that was corrected in the lead up in TBC, do you think there is a bat's chance in hell of blizzard taking pity on the poor poor paladins and giving them a taunt somehow? Even if its a darn trinket or something.
---
As long as it's not a priest, you're fine.
---
I'll be a NE Huntard. I love shadowmeld for wPvP.
---
Thats a readon to roll apure dps class..
---
Well said. I don't have a problem with the game up until BFA. I don't hate LFR, I think it's a neat idea. I don't hate group finder, another idea that I've used and saved a lot of time on.
---
I don't like Garrisons, because they should have been better. Class halls is the improvement there, so kudos for that.
---
But BFA did a couple of big things very wrong. Blizzard has a habit of ditching old design concepts, even when they were good. So no class hall 2.0, and the follower table sucked hard. Inst ad of leaving classes in a great place, which took years to tune it to that, they just reinvent the wheel and simplify the classes to a boring condition. If they were wanting to spend less dev time balancing classes, why not leave them already tuned from a previous expansion?
---
That plus the amount of RNG makes me think they wanted to be able to manage WoW with fewer devs. RNG is easy to tweak by one person. It's lazy.
---
So to me, BFA is where the devs really went another direction. Whatever grand long term plan they were trying to move toward, it's not working. Bad idea. Go back to what worked before, and lose the OCD that makes them want to constantly throw out good design.
---
I mean, my life as an elemental shaman died completely when my guild discovered how effective of a healer I was in tier 6 ....
---
But I will never forget that I outdamaged our main mage in serpentshrine caverns (eat shit, furro!:) ).
---
in vanilla wow, the scarlet crusade tabard is heavily desired haha
---
Is it true nobody will take me if I'm pveing as enhance at 60?
---
Left you a message — think we could be a great fit!
---
Thank you for the clarity!  Will use these terms in future posts.
---
My pleasure! Good luck on the hunt for humar my suggestion is log out there every night he is like an 8 hour respawn. Or you can try and fudge the layering like lots of people are doing to check for him.
---
3female dwarves will be funnier.
---
You don't think you'll be able to form social bonds with the hundreds of people you'll still see running around you even with layering in effect?
---
Most builds can run it perfectly fine if you turn down the settings.
---
I think this time around, there's going to be a decent chunk who will experience up to AQ40, which is where things really get kicked up a notch in terms of time investment. But I do agree, 5% will see in the interior of naxx.
---
You don't get portals until Lvl 40 iirc
---
You don't learn portals for SW+IF or Org+UC until level 40 and Darn or TB until level 50.
---
But if you're going to RP, you should know the Kirin Tor expressly forbid mages from profiting from their magics, so the most you should charge is 20s for the rune.
---
 They have high sustained DPS.  Combat swords is incredibly versatile in wPvP and BG's.  You are just wrong.  
---
31 combat is susceptible to all the same CC that every other rogue spec is susceptible to.
---
Prepare to be disappointed
---
Why would you use outdated information instead of the most recent updates?
---
what is the CCAF for? That's just going right over my head here.
---
Raziya is just a little bit too much of a nerd for me. I really dislike the way he talks and makes his videos hard to enjoy
---
From the original post, it seems there are many items on private servers that make it much easier to play compared to Classic. The respawn timers, drops, and mob abilities do not align with Vanilla as examples.
---
On pservers we used to have the actual devs make github pages so everyone could track progression and get new updates, but it will probably be curse now that it's mainstream
---
Jokes on them. Ooga got repair bills.
---
Tool respawn in dwarf was instant in classic beta
---
Contraception is the one part of life where us gays have the privilege.
---
Lmao ikr I was wondering where the Alliance take on Ooga stays.
---
You're right.  Three trolls using variety of names including ooga, booga, and ... well I dunno the other variations.
---
They're pretty funny.  Sometimes they just sap the person, unstealth, wave, and go on their way.  Most of the time it's a quick death - there's at least three of them and you're stunlocked to hell and back.
---
When in doubt. Pick the class you visually enjoy. Classic is a marathon, you're going to spend a long time with your toon and if you pick one for the racial over other aspects the chances of you getting disinterested or bored with them increases.
---
Also Trolls are freaking awesome. Beserking is great in PvP.
---
Beastslaying helps with leveling.
---
You regen increases and there nothing anyone can do about it.
---
Male* dwarves yes.
---
If you are a dad of a young kid, I understand completely. I get to play every few days for a few hours, so I'd like to play the game and not be ganked the entire time. But to each his own (I'll play PvP although I have a young son)
---
Wait... is the legal?
---
Shadow raptors are also pretty awesome.
---
Honestly with the way they announced how parry is going to work, hunters have become even better than what the other replies are saying because of their threat dump ability. So that’s something else to consider.
---
How do i screw the layering?
---
Nope, layering remains until blizzard removes it then some servers have 6 hour queues... then nobody cares about layering come December 2019.
---
Absolutely! Farming mats or checking the AH while at the office!
---
Realms being merged is significantly less impactful than layering, which effects gameplay and immersion significantly.  What they need to do is be proactive with realms, try to keep their populations up from the get go, and plan ahead.  Realms should be merged long before they die to keep populations high.  I don't have Blizzards resources, but if I did I would easily come up with a plan better than layering to combat population stagnation.
---
Summoning stones would completely destroy gameplay and social experience.
---
It's a persona
---
Didn't they just turn it into Overwatch?  Am i getting my Blizzard Lore mixed up?
---
Catch them afk in wpvp.
---
Have help in BGs or Arena.
---
Otherwise, you won't 90% of the time.
---
I like the first option. Probably doesn’t need to be there for more than a couple days. 7 days at most
---
Could possibly look into this for you.
---
This exactly how I feel about healing.
---
I did both dps and healing in vanilla but eventually switched played a priest main. Healing just feels so much more reactionary and dynamic. When I was dps it just felt like “alright tank has aggro, get in there and start your rotation. Now move out of fire. Go back to rotation.” 
---
It’s why DPS are insanely easy to replace. Sure it sucks losing a super geared one. But losing even an okay heated healer that is extremely competent in their role is usually a *much* bigger deal.
---
Lol 3 female dwarves would indeed be pretty buff aswell.
---
Considering you have to grind to 60, then work with rng and competing with similar classes to get your gear set (unless you are a tank or healer and even then sometimes someone will need on your loot) and then you have to get attuned to UBRS for more of your preraid bis and then you have to get attuned to Molten Core and THEN you have to have people in your raid with the Hyroxy Warlords (spelling?) just to have the douses to even fight Ragnaros.
---
And that is only just stepping in to raiding.
---
Yeah, I'm still calling it at less than 5%.
---
Female dwarves for full disrepect.
---

---
For 1v1 pvp, DP and Wotf are amazing.  Wotf can be good in various boss fights as well, but not mandatory.  
---
Troll is overall better for pve because of berserking.
---
yep, also getting plenty sunlight in the months leading up to it will help if you plan to play 12 hours a day
---
I think your first assumption that everyone agrees that the current implementation is not fit for launch is a pretty contentious assumption.
---
I leveled my OG druid in classic as balance it was painful, this was before boomkin every existing. Lots of fun to play, even do some boomkin tanking in 5 mans. Feral is the way to level.
---
Yeah mainly against Orcs and rogues. Personally I've used it on secondary targets in team fights just to spread some damage around and get the healers tabbing around but its definitely a small percentage of the time. I feel like most people would go 5/5 Master of Deception.
---
I just reread your original question and I missed that you mentioned imp. kidney along with the poisons talent, my bad. You could take a point from imp. kidney and drop it into gouge. That'd probably be the right decision.
---
Do you understand irony?
---
Or maybe you are unfamiliar with the Ooga gang, which is reasonable.
---
Shadowmeld is literally useless for rogues and druids. They would never ever choose to stealth via Shadowmeld rather than actual stealth or prowl
---
Both of those would drastically alter the Vanilla experience.
---
Great idea! I think if I do a more in-depth guide on macros (perhaps at 60), I'll include this. I want to do another one later on down that road which introduces ranking for Greater Heal and Heal, so I'll add the breakdown of conditions in that video.
---
Cheers dude
---
Look, okay bub, keeping the game at 60 means nothing. Once you change stuff, it is a different game. Enough people want Classic the way it is that trying to appease the Classic people and the Classic+ people at the same time is a fool's errand. It's either Classic, or it isn't. And Classic is the higher priority because Classic is a multi-purpose product - preserving the game as it was, allowing those who missed it to experience it the way it was, representing a museum piece and snap-shot of the game's history/origin.
---
If you're going to do Classic+ as its own game and not do TBC servers, just go big. Let's get a whole new level 70 expansion with new raids, new dungeons, the whole shebang. That would excite me a hell of a lot more than "Classic, but actually not really Classic, but Classic enough that it doesn't feel exciting but not enough like Classic that it feels authentic". That sounds like an abomination. I want to burn your post with a flamethrower the more I think about it. No. No. **Nooooooo.**
---
He’d make a damn good Arthas.
---
That would be more like this one.

https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/A84BKATw53w0AsOQ
---
It does well in battlegrounds and can be switched up a bit to your liking.  Not the best for duels or situations where you're alone.  This is more about getting in on the blacksmith fight and being a major pain to everyone.  Elusiveness and Endurance make your longest cooldowns only 3.5 minutes, allowing you to more consistently handle repeated action, like battlegrounds.  It also has improved sprint, which is always useful and my favorite ability.  Blade flurry opens up when you go that deep in combat and it's lethal, but you'll want to run at least one instant poison to make use of that damage hitting two targets (at only one poison charge).
---
Obviously, minor modifications are always an option.  Such as saying forget subtlety all together and getting cold blood for a two target eviscerate crit (though technically I don't think blade flurry crits, it will do equal damage, so attack the clothie next to the warrior.  I can't remember if the nerf to apply armor happened before or after 1.12).
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/BM8HxUAF8Od8NAwA
---
Obviously everyone still prefers subtlety, but as a rogue you can do quite well in many different build combinations.  I would recommend you try a few out for different situations.  I can confirm if you can play well, you can do well with a variety of builds.  And it's fun to switch things up.
---
What was so bad about it if I might ask? I didn't play around then so I have no idea. Did people just hang out at their player housing instead of in-world?
---
It's pretty weird to think that patch 1.12 as turning WOW into "EZ Mode".
---
It's about 3:30 to 10. I expect to hit 12 in 4:00, maybe a bit longer.
---
vs running to a far point of the starting area where 100 other people are going and grinding as well? I think it'll be more efficient.
---
Gnomerigo

Gnomerigoing  
---
Gnomerigone
---
I've decided I am definitely going to play troll! Thanks for all the input guys
---
I find it not worth it in a leveling sense. Too much mana when wanding is super efficient. You actually want to lose some hp while leveling to have it restore back with Spirit Tap!
---
Ugh,. Horde favoritism early in wow. IF and SW are easy to travel and the same continent. Horde got both continents. /s
---
LOL perfect.
---
You may as well wait a few levels and get a group together for DM. Iirc the mask drops inside the dungeon, and you'll have a shot at some sweet gear. You made the trek to westfall, might as well make it worth the effort
---
Combat has almost no utility so you miss out on all the amazing stuff going that deep, and the stuns are unreliable and messes with DR's.
---
What the other guy said. I watched him back during the time he streamed private servers and he acted way differently. It's just a persona inspired by asmongolds.
---
This is accurate
---
I prefer Gnarf!
---
I think he means faction-wide PvP goals.
---
Haha there ya go man, I'm on the same boat. People being anal about racials is ridiculous.
---
It's a stream persona.. like Asmongold.. It's for entertainment. I personally don't watch Staysafe because I think Asmon does the same thing only more entertaining.
---
Amazing. Also, how to shun a customer
---
Imagine... 3female dwarves with the names: Biggie, Fattie and Chubbie
---
Wow the Cata version is cluttered! What lore changes would be made here?
---
No they are not.
---
Is Angwe in for Classic?
---
dwarves for stoneform agaisnt dem rogues
---
DweedleDee DweedleDum DweedleDoo
---
Haha, yeah he can be very extra sometimes, but luckily he annotates his videos well so you can skip to the important bits.
---
No problem brother, enhance was one of my favorites to play, and if you get good at it some guilds run a single enhancement shaman with Nightfall. It's not super common but I have seen it work incredibly well.
---
For the Horde!
---
Maybe because Scatter Shot is a billion times better? Wyvern Sting is an awful ability. It can’t be used in combat, it puts a dot on the target so you can’t trap him, and it’s breakable by WoTF. 
---
Also, why do you mention the medicine pouch when that can be used in combat anyway? You’re supposed to use first aid if the guy is CCd.
---
Please explain how merging two solid instances *one time* is worse for communities than having multiple instances constantly merging and unmerging.
---
"The portal is free, but the boar meat costs 1g"
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the tips!
---
Battlemasters in cities were added relatively early with the BWL patch.
---
This is about Post-Classic. I am aware Blizzard could just release more Classic servers or TBC, but the ides here is to find a better solution.
---
Yo that’s genius. I have to say with this in mind dwarves might be the better choice.
---
The problem with them is 95% of helms look bad on them. Horde have the most problems with looks haha, but I have always played them. Likely going to roll alliance for classic though.
---
Mage easy. God tier gold making and tier 1 pve dps, versatile for any sort of pvp
---
This sounds amazing you should code this, run it through internal test, test it extensively in a beta setting and implement it in 2 months.
---
Dwarves also get a free heal they can cast on themselves. So if they are taking damage they don't need to spend much time or mana to compensate. NE has nothing.
---
Gotta give em ironic 7 dwarf names though. Frumpy, Lumpy, etc.
---
Ah, the old Washington D.C. legalization trick. I like it.
---
My buddies and i got a castle, and I built up 70,000 stone for that.  I played the market.  I did PvP and the PvE.  I did a lot in that game, and the Aurora patch where the castles came around... was just the biggest let down.  Plus they followed it shortly after with a Pay 2 Win box that would drop Thundrestruck trees (which were important) at a very high rate, and the game just died.  The market died because of those boxes.  Trion got greedy and it killed the game.
---
I'm going to guarantee you that not one single person is going to comment on your class and race choice in the game. If they do, they're the type of person you don't want to play with
---
I sexually identify with this post

My personal opinion as a long long time hpally is that you should put points into prot than ret. You're gonna sacrifice a lot of amazing defensive talents that can make you nigh invincible for a bit more DPS. Armed with a shield you can take redoubt and a few points in toughness to make any physical DPS give up on killing you. Armed with unyielding faith from the holy tree and imp concentration aura from the prot tree, you'll frustrate people when their CC is resisted. Furthermore, shaving off 2mins off of BoP and seconds off freedom can provide your teammates with frequent excellent peel. It's better to help DPS by enabling them to do their job without being hindered than to try and kill them yourself. Lastly, Blessing of Kings is King.
---
You'll get more results in Bgs by being an unkillable healer. You can become so tanky that they have to focus you with a majority of the team to kill you or you'll outheal the dmg. They can't kill/CC the DPS because you're healing/cleansing them. So they have to focus on CCing you, inwhich you'll have blessing of sac up constantly up so you can break the CC.
---
Moving in with my gf a week before launch. I'm picturing the new york song thing, 
---
If we can make it there, we'll make it anywhere
---
So it depends on how bad the rogue's latency was, but very likely if he lived in europe in the mid 2000s he had high speed broadband. But it's equally possible, although less likely that he had 300+ ms in that clip too, nobody knows.
---
Darn port is level 30
---
C C A F is what the trolls are saying. It translates to O O G A if you're an alliance.
---
You know how streamers always talk about spergs and how clueless they are ? They’re talking about you.
---
I’d like it to become WoW 2. I’d prefer they twist TBC and Wrath into a more classic experience
---
Shamans never gave me much trouble. If they are close then scatter/FD/trap combo. Then get max range. Frost shock is 20 yards, so you easily out distance it. At this point just kite them, with your pet beating them down. They will struggle to cast with pushback, and won’t be able to catch you.
---
Can do well in battlegrounds.  Blacksmith fights are hectic and you can cause a lot of pain.  Not adrenaline rush so much, but the tree has a few goodies.
---
I've only ever heard streamers say that they do appreciate the oogas
---
hardcore raiding?
---
don't worry about it until lvl 40 ish, at which point only the hardcore-minded will have grinded for as long as you, and they will likely aggregate in a handfull of guild ( speaking of release day here).
---
casual? grab one that's recruiting in the general board / trade chat.
---
Yeah, I loved the Wildstar housing.  I made a jungle entrance to my home, so it looked like Degoba
---
Cool videos man, when was this Silithus footage taken, I assume before AQ40?
---
"Lying scumbag" I'll direct you to look at retail. Go surround yourself with more yes men.
---
You want to find a guild that has a group of people that mesh well with. This is regardless of hardcore or casual. You want to enjoy the time you spend with those people as they will likely be the people you're doing dungeons and farming with as well.
---
I say you join any guild that grabs your attention and has availability.
---
Don't be afraid to leave a guild if you feel like it's not really what you're looking for.
---
Most guilds this time around will be raiding.
---
Oh, that's only multiple months of playtime in which people will decide if they want to play the game or not.
---
I was one of the few people that said LFG, flying mounts, etc were bad.  No one listens.  They just gloss over the negatives.  It's hard to get people to see what they are going to lose.
---
Probably not any more than adding more debuff slots was a limitation in the technical design they didn't get time to fix.
---
Yeah, I'm In beta and the only issue I have with it is the current bug that when you fly next to the edge of the continent like going from booty bay to westfall and you are in a party there is a chance of dismount.  You'll fall in the ocean with message stating all members of the group have to be on the same continent.  
---
This is funny because you can literally be in separate continents in party but if u get too close to the edge...
---
They should put all this advice in the tips during the load screens instead of the useless ones they have now!!
---
We can make characters 12 days before launch?
---
Create 3 dwarve paladins, all dressed in dungeon 2 set, one holy, one ret, one prot and call em the “girls in purple police”.
---
A lot of the code infrastructure is already there for option 1, and if 2 months isn't enough to make a relatively minor change like this, what's the point of the beta?
---
And then the 'fallback' option could be implemented extremely quickly and easily.
---
Ooga gang are 3 very well coordinated trolls that have been very popular because they pop up on streamers twitch channels. They protect horde streamers but gank alliance streamers. Its actually pretty funny.
---
Doubtful. No changes crowd has the right way of it. Making "intended before launch" changes is just another slippery slope. It wasn't an oversight per se, it was more like they couldn't figure out how to make it work with the theme of the holy warrior. A warriors taunt is literally him saying "hey you ugly son of a bitch come get this DICK" from a roleplaying perspective a paladin would not say such things. 
---
If I were you I would save your plans for paladin tanking for when TBC servers launch, which is much more likely than them giving them a taunt in vanilla. I actually ran a paladin tank in TBC/Wrath and it was by far the most fun I've had tanking, besides Death-Knight offtanking. So I'm with you, it's hard serving the light.
---
A lot will be different, unfortunately. Despite what the nochangers and blizzard shills will tell you, truth is that Classic won’t be anything like Vanilla in terms of authenticity.
---
For female dwarves, here are few names: Biggie, Fattie, Chubbie, Bossie, Lousie, Smeelie, Cheezie
---
I'd be surprised about that, if they're fully up to date on how the Beta is currently functioning.
---
this is like the 100th zone you did...
---
what exactly do you expect from low-quality map with hardly any detail on it? What's the interest in randomly putting ''naga, troll, dark iron'' on a map? is there supposed to be a good story behind it?
---
LOL PLEASE! Can anyone read this &amp; say you want this too?! 😂😂😂
---
https://youtu.be/Mh_cLN66zHA?t=215
---
Log out, log onto another character then log back in. I think that's how the big streamers are doing it.
---
I dunno, there is a ton of empty space that is just not being used.  Particularly in low level zones.  Just outside pretty much all of the major cities like, the castle in Undercity, the space outside of Ogrimmar, a lot of the coastlines.  Hell, they could have repurposed old Ironforge for housing.
---
Blizzard is never going to spend a single dollar developing new content for Wow Classic. They have two goals:
---
1. Get the shit they already have working on the modern engine and out the door fast with as little need for GM support as possible.
---
2. Figure out a way to convert Classic players to Retail.
---
If #2 takes too long, they'll do #1 again with TBC.
---
You think you will, but you won't!

I would love to put 3 pages of text on each of these, but no one would read it

Exactly, what paragraphs.
---
It has nothing to do how great it is, not many will read it if it has no paragraphs. It's difficult to read.

I'm pretty sure Kargoz plays alot of hunter and warlock. Maybe give him a try. Chill dude too and usually very informative/theory crafting based
---
The real hack is, you team grind as level 1s, the level 5 boars just outside the beginning area. Skip all the newbie quests and mob of people trying to kill em
---
If implemented exactly as I outlined, the system would automatically turn itself off when not needed, in effect.
---
How'd you make gold by keeping the rogue alive if the bounty was paid out by getting him killed? Maybe I read that wrong?
---
One of more common farm spots is the crocs camp in the Shimmering Flats. They drop a lot of grey items which you collect and vendor in Gadgetzan, which is close by. They grey items do have good vendor value, with full bags of skins and those items you can get up to around 6g per run. If you have skinning you can also skin them as well as move around the edge of the flats and skin what other people killed and not skinned as there are turtle and birds hotspots that are also farmed for similar goals.
---
But with Classic apparently dropping more grey gear/items than on private servers - makes me wonder if humanoids would become a better source of income when getting grey/white/green weapons (and armor) more consistently would give much more gold?
---
Some also don't target mount at 40 but few levels thereafter when green weapons can vendor for way above 1g.
---
Haha DK tank, disc priest. I still have day dreams about crit bubbles, and not having to apply atonement. And actually good divine star. Those were the days.
---
This, but the alternative timeline should also use forked servers.
---
There's no reason to throw out their carefully recreated Vanilla experience.
---
Your idea is straight up garbage, god damn. The people who want to play the Classic content in this game? Who want to keep raiding Molten Core, BWL, AQ, and Naxx? Yeah, they're going to play Classic dude. Okay? Got it? Those people will be on that server. Got it?
---
The people who want to play new content? They don't want to play the old content. Don't insist on making the old content relevant. 
---
Can you delete your post please?
---
To conserve mana, only heal people at the last moment before they are about to die.
---
This kind or response gives me the idea that you don't understand the development side of things.  The product is in finalization.  They are in the bug clearing phase and it is unlikely any actual changes will take place between now and launch with the exception of fixing bugs.
---
Troll is definitely a good Priest race for both PvP and PvE. Plus if you like the look and style more, you'll enjoy your class that much more. Don't play a race other people say is best just because they say so. Racials aren't that important unless you're trying to be a 1% World First tier player. 
---
They only truly matter for the Methods of the world. For the rest of us it's not going to cost us a BG win or cause us to wipe on a raid boss because we chose a difference race. Let's be real, here.

No you can't. You need the MCP equipped to get the bonus
---
The lifetime of the server is probably going to be &gt;1 year, I am sure people will be able to get MC attuned by then.
---
Hydraxian waterlords can come from within MC, people can just rampage through MC a few times and have the rep required for the dousing rune.
---
As for BWL attune, it's a joke. People are going to be running UBRS for a while, so there's going to be an abundance of people who are attuned. As for pugs who make it past the second boss, it's up in the air.
---
The amount of people who do pug raids on retail, or at least LFR is pretty high. MC is super casual in terms of difficulty in the mechanics. (I would dare say ZG is actually a step up in difficulty, as there's less mechanics you can just outright ignore)
---
Time will tell.
---
/ourguy/
---
errr....
---
but what's the point?
---
anyone could poop out a dozen of those during their diner break
---
Haven't checked yet since I just noticed this today but you can probably find the addons you need in the client.
---
for fun I guess
---
I saw swifty laughing at the oogas, and a bunch of the horde streamers laughing and having a good time with them.
---
I think Asmo hates them or gets frustrated over it.
---
Like I said, THIS IS THE SHIT WE WANT IN THE GAME. The community MAKES things interesting.
---
1. DM tribute. If that’s not allowed, then Mara.
---
2. Same methods available to other classes. Herbing, mining, farming consume mats etc. 
---
3.#1 if DM tribute is allowed. #2 if they can only do Mara
---
4. Not much for Mara. A fresh 60 hunter can do 5 lockouts of Mara in an hour. Getting better gear just makes it easier. Better gear would make a different with tribute thou, because getting 5 lockouts is really hard.
---
How about they just let everyone fight it out for early level quests. 
---
I would rather struggle all day to get lvl 5 with 5thousand other people Instead of only seeing 40 people leveling with me.
---
I've always wondered why people added the harm, help, nodead conditions to a lot of their macros.   I understand the function, but not the necessity in the macros it's being used in.  I've seen them used to have multiple spells on one bind, ie help conditional casting a heal, harm conditional casting a dd/dot, etc..
---
Just don't know why I always see the conditionals for help/harm/nodead in macros that only cast one spell (that already has a built in conditional inside the spell itself).
---
Am I missing something else entirely?
---
&gt; If you think every guild is going to be some harcore min/maxing guild you're nuts.
---
If you think there isn't a massive difference in general competence/knowledge after all these years, then
---
Sure I do not dissagree with that, but all this min/max everything, are you going to super end game sure.
---
There are skips to and from dun morogh and menethil, it's not a big deal at all to meet up
---
Yep, Destiny is another game I was super into and the whole daily/weekly rotation stuff felt so unnecessary.
---
Can't wait for Classic.
---
Because the OP doesn’t have the willpower not to watch shitty streamers so he assumes we don’t either.
---
BFA is about RNG and gear resets
---
Dad of twins here. I didnt play games for a long time after they were born. Dont worry though because it wasnt even a thought on my mind. I was too busy. Maybe play on a private server to get the vanilla experience while you have the chance now. I did that right before they were born and had a lot of fun.
---
Lol at the edited date
---
I like these maps. They're just fun to look at. You obviously put a lot of time into them OP and I appreciate that you've done so many for the subreddit the last couple of days.
---
Looking sexy AF is point right?
---
Yeah you equip and then reequip
---
Proof? Cuz otherwise you’re just pulling stuff out of your butt.
---
Ooga, Booga, Chooga!
---
&gt; Dodge: great(ly underrated) bonus for all classes, maybe except the Priest but even they get attacked sometimes - and a dodged attack doesn't push back your cast bar.
---
Can't dodge while casting.
---
I wanna do this with Alliance druids. Root, Cat, bear, and moonfire spamming...can’t run away either
---
Also. Any preference for what race to play? I'd probably pic Orc for horde, but kinda deciding between dwarf, gnome, and even human. Gnome seems the safest, especially if you don't have improved sprint to get out of snares, but just not a fan of the cast time and how they look lol. Humans generally don't get brought up, but I always though perception was really useful against other rogues (and rogue is obviously a popular class in vanilla).
---
You completely ignored everything I said. I’m done with you.
---
keep in mind most fight have very little to no AoE damage in classic. so spot healing is rare... and there's 6-10 healers.
---
but to answer your question, I assume Vuhdo will have a classic release / some addon with mouseover macro.
---
And it costs almost no mana, since you never need to bother using greater than rank 1.
---
Conserve mana yes, but if you are only healing people when they are about to die, chances are, most of them will die before they get the heal.
---
well I'm working on my last one now I'm afraid, ran out of spaces for zones to go lol
---
“Tagging this mob out from under someone would be a dick move, so I’ll just kill him, spit on him, teabag him, and then eat his corpse. That’s totally the lesser of two evils, right?”
---
Again, you can use WS in combat when you use Feign Death, and then you can use Medicine pouch (unless WS doesnt puts you in combat)... But yeah after discovering WS is dispelled by WOTF, im second guessing it, although it would probably still be good vs orcs or something..
---
PI spec is excellent for world pvp and surviving 1v1 you are very difficult to kill. I win almost every fight against locks mages hunters other priests and druids. Have trouble with pallies shams rogues and warriors
---
Less insulting, but I like the ending. How about a alcohol theme? Schwipsy, Tippsy, Nippsy?
---
Fun execution method could be sap and then taking down the target with ranged attacks and grenades.
---
its not very rare but was very cool
---
looks really cool bro, keep those coming!
---
All you need is Grid.  And then I used Bartender for my buttons, but whatever UI you like should be fine.
---
&gt; classic
---
&gt; Just DPS
---
Lol k
---
Only priests dispel for that is a potion or someone else like a Druid or Pally
---
They are still testing and iterating on their current implementation of layering, and have ~9 weeks to make significant changes.
---
As I mentioned, they already have a lot of the codebase needed to implement this:
---
* They're already doing the metadata tagging
---
* They already have per-zone sharding/layering technology, which is also automated/dynamic
---
* They just need to only enable the sharding/layering system in the first couple of zones, and then tell it to emphasise friends and guilds (which they also already have the code for, because that's an aspect of their current intended implementation)
---
This is a minor change code-wise, it's only remotely major conceptually.
---
Wait, none of the traps can be used in combat?
---
Clearing fast is the fun. Once we do that I can play other games. I have been in every type of guild you can think of and for me the faster guilds are by far the most fun.
---
Certain abilities reset swing timers. If you attack every 2.0 seconds and use an ability with 0.1 seconds left before your next auto attack, you'll reset your swing timer so your time between 2 auto attacks just became 3.9 seconds. Using abilities right after auto attacks gives you an extra bump in DPS.
---
&gt;ying a NE I got Shadowmeld, Starshards and Elune's Grace, which I also L
---
If you cleared naxx in the original you were in one of only 23 guilds that did. That's impressive.
---
From a purely strategic viewpoint, Alliance would not have a base that far north.  Horde could possibly have one but then they'd need a harbor in Tirsifal Glades which could get to Ash Hollow for supplies.
---
Well that will teach them to only be close to dying one at a time.
---
Is this south of Un'goro?  I've always wondered what could go there.  Probably the blank spot on the map I desired the most to see.
---
Dont even wash it dont even shower, the smell in itself is nosestalgic
---
This is true, but you might as well just shut it off haha
---
Basically same here. Can’t wait to see you!
---
Yup, you had to spend all your time in your garrison. Capital cities became vacant. Everything felt super lonely.
---
Yeah, when I was younger I used to do the same. After having kids I switched to 2 hours a night, and after a while you don't really even *want* to play more than a few hours. You want to be productive during the day, and then when it comes night time you have your time.
---
nelf is pretty good for defensive bonuses for tanks. Dodge is always useful, and nature resist is one of the better ones in vanilla. Human is better for threat generation, and dwarf many be situationally better.
---
You should start a game studio
---
Yeah I learned a lot in this thread. Dispell is vague.
---
You could try to a make a cousin sounding name.
---
As for me, I'm going to use my original characters name just because I'm not good with making WOW-ish names
---
It was an outright lie, not sure what you expect.  Plus, you love making sweeping gameplay changes without thinking about consequences, for the purpose of immediate gratification and QoL, so retail is for you my man.
---
Thanks for info, I took notes :) Yeah I'll go with Scatter Shot..
---
I pretty much neglect everything you said with one sentence. If you cant understand me, there is no point discussing it
---
No I just dont see a link to anything
---
You never played classic. Do you know flightpath times?
---
Not sure if troll or not but having played classic on an unofficial server I was a solid game and had a good community.
---
I don’t think it’s fair to say that it’ll be the most populated, while we love it it’s not for everyone, but thanks to it’s being tied to retail it certainly will be the most successful because they’ll gain subscribers to Classic while maintaining the diehard retail players.  It ensures FFXIV who’s numbers have been inching ever closer to WoW doesn’t surpass it.  We may even see Blizzard announce sub numbers again after Classic launches.
---
Oh, thought you were just talking about the felcloth stuff. Farming things at 60 is faster than farming things while you're leveling, so just wait until you're 60 to start worrying about that kind of stuff. Just put whatever mats you happen to find in your bank while you're leveling, don't bother going out of your way.
---
Thanks, I couldn’t remember exactly what level it was.
---
Thanks!
---
Healing as a priest during the class call puts a dot on the person healed. It can stack up fast causing lots of damage to the player healed.
---
Well since that's definitely off the table, I'm trying to come up with the best option that's deliverable.
---
&gt;white hit quick enough after the slam.
---
You can't weave slam. No matter what time you cast it within your swing timer it resets your swing. You can't weave it in between. It literally starts your swing timer from 0 no matter what.
---
Because it's a disbelieve that's been discussed numerous times. And as anti-social this might be, some people quite honestly need to be told that they are stupid. It's not nice, I absolutely get it, but it's also the same I act in real life, too.
---
There are scenarios where I'm understanding when people are misinformed and there's situations like this where people spout absolute nonsense and that's when I'll answer the way I did.
---
I liked the poison + bleed assault and then vanishing.
---
The same as you do. Im just using my common sense a little better
---
Not a bad choice for tanks, but I believe it's generally considered that the threat generation from mace/sword specs from humans is overall more valuable.
---
Meh, I made most of my money mining Dark Iron Ore on my rogue. Losing out on a 1g portal wasn’t going to kill me.
---
There isn't a vendor next to the bleachers?  I thought there was one vendor you could use to avoid the trip to Tanaris.
---
Ah. thanks. I assumed since they were typing stuff like "go to retail" , they had also run it through a horde-alliance translator.
---
how is he salty here?
---
I keep saying it to my friends, they need to make it a new time line, have chromie pop up "So that guys this time travel things created a new timeline , who knows in this timeline we might never goto Outlander, instead we might explore the highlands, uldum or hijal"
---
New time line gets my vote
---
Im a tight ass
---
Is it just for cosmetic purpose ?
---
There was some seriously janky behaviour with range prediction in Vanilla.
---
I remember times as a hunter getting the out of range message trying to attack a warrior, move slightly closer and they could charge you and that's jumping from over 41 yards to under 25 yards or under.
---
Same with the Winterspring demon on the hunter quest, out of range, stop slightly when kiting and boom suddenly within 30 yards to get hit by the demon's aura.
---
My latency was under 100ms and I got familiar enough with ranges to be able to jump and land at 41 yards.
---
It doesn't discount leeway being present now when it shouldn't have, but I also don't particularly trust vanilla prediction either.
---
I'm looking forward to finally getting to experience classic and will definitely be maining a hunter. My only concern for playing the class is which, if any melee weapons should I actually roll on? I guess it varies on who else needs it? I don't wanna be *that* hunter...
---
My goal is to help adventurers get around fast in Azeroth. Other than the reagent fee I'll won't charge anything, but I'll welcome tips.
---
I'll read on about the Kirin Tor, thanks :)
---
There is a major quest lul in the time at which I am am going to go for the Felcloth, you think I should spend my time grinding other mobs?
---
- shamans get 6s pushback immunity after being crit. Pets are like you said still greatly useful, but IMO it is something to be aware of.
---
- I heard that a scorpion pet could also be useful, since it can stack a poison up to 5 stacks which somewhat protects vipersting. Never seen any hunter use this though, so probalby not a good option.
---
Now to my  own question: why do hunters counter Paladins. I was considering of rolling a hunter, but was afraid because aside from the million warriors I would also have to face another plate which will also wear a shield on top of that. And can dispel viper + trap from others ( and with sacrifice sort of from himself).
---
The point is it's different, not lesser or greater. People will have their own opinions, just giving mine.
---
well his latency is atleast green, so not to crazy
---
I was actually thinking that these were the last fringes of the original citizens of lordaeron, similar to southshore or hillsbrad fields 
---
though you would need some remarkably determined peasants to survive way out there so maybe not
---
1 Boomkin with the Mages pls
---
Your first option isn't layering, it's sharding.
---
Your second option isn't better than layering in any way.
---
For Horde Orc is probably the better pick (stun resist and blood fury is nice) but Undead is also a solid pick (WotF removes pretty much the same things as the PvP trinket so that allows you either 2 fear removals or you can go without the PvP trinket and go for a damage trinket). For alliance Gnome is good for the reason you mentioned, Dwarf is good vs other rogues/warriors due to the bleed removal which allows a re-stealth, Humans are best for PvE due to sword specialization and perception is useful. Personally I'd go with Gnome just because I do like how they look and escape artist is unreal but all 3 are viable.
---
DP gets dispelled instantly, WoTF is less necessary than people think in Vanilla.
---
&gt;Isnt dps just watching red bars go up and down?
---
I never said it wasn't. I was simply comparing raidhealing to dungeonhealing and what I prefer of the two.
---
Does it make sense for Sand Trolls or Twilight's Hammer to be there? The area was supposed to be sealed off in vanilla so I wouldn't expect people being there before we arrive.
---
It wouldn't be an insult if the name of the gang is "SJW-squad". :)
---
But I like your choice for names.
---
None of which is any indication whatsoever that shaman will be "the most popular class on horde." It literally never has been on any vanilla server that ever existed, retail or private. It isn't even the case on the beta.
---
I have done the PP farm in SM 30 min in CATHEDRAL and 30 in ARMORY, i will make a post about it and put link here soon
---
Honestly it's not a big deal for me personally, the social draw isn't a big thing.  But to answer your question in general, it does hurt the social aspect of the game, since it feels less like a single world we are all in together and part of each other's world and more like people bumping into eachother at Disneyland.
---
What is Stranlethorn Vale?
---
&gt; Instead, lets say you make Karazhan gear the equivalent of T2/T3 gear instead. Well what is the point of doing Karazhan if you already have better gear? 
---
What's the point of doing ZG or AQ when MC/BWL/Naxx exist? Oh right, a single raid will hardly ever provide every piece of gear you could possibly need for all slots across all specs. 
---
Anyone who argues that raiding is pointless unless there's an infinite treadmill of numbers going up hasn't been paying much attention to what content people have already been doing in classic.
---
More like BiS until Bloodfang Hood AM I RIGHT GUYS?!
---
I have run into them twice, can't really do much as a druid against 3 rogues, but its still funny as hell to me.
---
In Europe when I was a teenager they couldn't sell cigarettes at clubs. So they tied together a pack of matches with a pack of cigarettes and they sold it as matches, the cigarette was a bonus.
---
You too mate! Me and a couple of friends started wow as 13/14 year old kids back in late 05. We’re returning as adults with jobs, houses, even kids in some cases! It’s amazing man, I’m so happy they made classic wow into reality
---
Triage is a good way to describe it for sure. Definitely why its more fun than DPS for me.
---
What a waste of feign death.
---
Yeah the weird swell from the hips down was an unfortunate look. Transmog helped [https://imgur.com/zHjqEDN](https://imgur.com/zHjqEDN) if you picked a robe with a slimming pattern. Or pants.
---
Why am i clueless about retail? care to point what i said? ah nothing k
---
I am happy to re-experience the game, but I don’t need to replicate the past. I was a hunter main, so I’ve been there and done that. New class, new name.
---
Wait i heard someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]. Did i hear that correctly?
---
One thing though.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
To the top
---
One of the best things about vanilla was how epic it seemed when you changed zones. It was like you entered a new world.
---
You should be grinding along the way while questing, whenever you need to sit down and grind you should grind at whatever spot is best at the time. Travel time is a big thing, if you have to spend a lot of time traveling to whatever grinding spot then it's probably not worth it.
---
Happy cake day.
---
Dont eat much, train your body for starvation :D
---
I have played on plenty of pservers, you would be suprised how many just afks in a group close to the mob they want. Hoping that someone else in The group gets it. Or just leaves group after a missed tag. Its always one or the other or both
---
Undead. Devouring Plague is tits for shadow.
---
I can press and release right click when i want... what? i lose nothing, i gain 2 buttons and 2 excellent keybindings near where my fingers are at already.
---
Fortunately for you, that's precisely the reason I won't be playing a nelf this time 'round.
---
Lok-tar ogar, brother. *For the Horde!*
---
You could call it sharding, but it's a distinct implementation from Retail.
---
And the second option is meant to be a tradeoff, to avoid the downsides and controversy of layering, and isn't meant to be just purely "better".
---
Because I wasn't aware of the update.
---
But answer the question, how do you know that there wasn't an update after the one you posted?
---
....unless said wPvP occurs in an enclosed area like a cave or instance entrance.  :-P
---
Ahh good stuff. I remember when epics were awesome also
---
Let's hope this is not the case.
---
Downrank. Learn to predict incoming damage and what rank fits it. Learn at the end of pulls to stop healing and let the mp5 rule check in. Your group can top themselves off with food or pull the next pack/ start marking it.
---
Also vitamin D supplements help counter lack of sunlight
---
Correct no silence, use to stop people from stealthing (rupture too). But you also want to use it vs warriors. Get garrote and rupture going on the war and kite in his dead zone so he can't charge you while he bleeds to death, then jump on him with cc and reset.
---
And yea garrote can also be good vs orcs and sometimes mages.
---
I love healing too. Healing the heroic deathwing raid in Cata was some of the first serious raid healing I did. Loved it all. 
---
You have to know the bosses attacks much more than the dps do, and you have to work with your tanks.
---
Used to raid dps. Was much more boring to me than healing, and I never felt appreciated even if I was in the top 3.
---

---
From a business perspective, it has to be.
---
Why? It's better for everyone involved if they figure out how to make Classic+ players interested in Retail. If Blizzard can determine why you don't want to play Retail, and address that concern without compromising the experience for someone else, that would be the best outcome.
---
I think it's worth it for both unless you are trying to get to 60 fastest - then IDK. You can skip Felcloth Boots though because they give Fire damage instead of Shadow. And if you are tailor you can skip Felcloth robe because Robe of the Void is better.
---
Good choice going with a priest.  You are definitely going to want a healing prediction addons like healcomm that will estimate the value of incoming heals(both from yourself and other raid/party members)  to avoid overhealing.  Have your PW:S bound to an easy to reach key(I use F)  as it will be your biggest "oh shit" button.  If a party member drops very low,  always shield him up first before throwing a heal on him.  While leveling,  always be on the lookout for a better wand, as it will provide more than half of your damage as you level.  Your first 5 talent points should go into wand spec in the disc tree.  As far as deciding which target to switch to for healing,  it's something that is going to come with experience as you learn damage patterns and how to predict incoming damage.
---
This is a bit down the road,  but plan to get [Hazarrah's Charm of Healing](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19958) as soon as possible from the edge of madness event in ZG after releases(it takes at least 6 weeks to get though as the 4 bosses required for it are on a 2 week rotation) It is the best healer trinket in the game.  I cant understate how good and important this trinket is.
---
I've been playing Priest on private servers for years and killed KT on both factions so let me know if you have any more specific questions.
---
I loved my paladin tank in TBC. The idea of an AoE tank was just so cool and unique at the time.
---
Are you high? What sweeping gameplay changes am I expecting? By changes, do you mean wanting it how classic was? Which then implies...retail is not for me? Fucking idiot... LOL. Guess I should invest in another border collie to keep all you dumbass sheep in line.
---
I think ele/resto shaman would be even closer
---
Honestly I would love to see that as a high quality blizzard cinematic. CCP just did a fairly self aware but still bad ass Eve cinematic trailer acknowledging how players actually interact in the game and such and I thought it was really funny and well done. https://youtu.be/HIhIMizrkWk

Aww man I love that one

---
I can still remember how small I felt walking into the barrens. Having just emerged from my comfortable little corner of Mulgores rolling plains and lakes, seeing this vast incomprehensible desert really drew me in. Exploring was one of my favourite things about WoW
---
I honestly prefer the way vanilla did it with traps  You could instantly trap with an fd macro as opposed to having an arming time.
---
I always go 5/5 MoD first but I like my stealth. If I’m going combat I then go for 5/5 precision before either sticking to combat or going for relentless strikes.
---
It is definitely not a bad thought to get relentless strikes first as it definitely helps your downtime. I just feel the hit rate is better. Lots of ways to level a rogue and the lower level talents are all good for starting out. Just about your preference and play style. I like the rogue class fantasy and the improved stealth really helps with that feel.
---
what is so hard to grasp about that?  
---
if people that started playing in wotlk are wotlk babies, the people that started playing in vanilla are...
---
You are right, it was rude and that was my bad.  I have gotten frustrated and emotional about the topic and it's showing.
---
Generally I believe the idea that the only other solution to layering is super long queues is completely BS.  A few minute queues here and there for the first few days is probably what you'd see if managed correctly.  I would say that isn't a big deal at all.  That's like... 15 minutes total.  A small price to pay to not implement relatively sweeping changes to the game that could have serious negative effects to gameplay.
---
Also... "every day or the first 3 days"...  Kind of funny way to blow it out of proportion, ha ha.
---
Y a w N
---
Even in those situations, Hunters have a lot of tools to escape. But, they probably won't. They really thrive on open areas.
---
Yeh, except when I originally played I went to school full time and worked part time and still managed to hit 60 and see some raids. If you like a game you’ll find time to play it.
---
Maybe IDK (nvr played Classic) but seems like a good idea to heal in a fight vs castors.
---
Hunters don't counter Paladins. In fact, in a group PvP setting, Paladins counter Hunters - it's the other way around.
---
The Defias are the most down to Earth antagonists in the whole game. They also happen to be far more competent than some players may remember. At a glance they directly control vast swathes of the heartland of Stormwind, and their allies control almost all the rest. Theyre so dangerous a force that they even have full control over what is supposed to be their prison, the Stockades. 
---
I decided to make a video that gives an in depth run-down of both the true strength of the Defias Brotherhood (assets/influence/allies), and subsequently some scenarios that could plausibly allow them to defeat Stormwind in what is a rather unconventional struggle. Hope some of ya'll find it entertaining.
---
Hol up
---
If you comment anything other than completely believing blizzard will fix it and also get rid of it completely in two weeks you will just get downvoted to hell. 
---
I love the fact that its being talked about. I have had pro-layering folks correct me on a few of my points. I also hope i have helped them realize the impact it will have on the game. Its not a small issue. Streamer bullshit is small fries, mechanics that break the game are not. 
---
It is terrible in the beta right now and if blizzard does not find a solution to fix those problems AND keep it in the game longer than three weeks they will be ruining the spirit of Classic.
---
Stormwind roadddd, take me hommmmme, to the placccceee, I belongggg...
---
Check out the weekly(Monday) guild recruitment sticky on this subreddit or the classic wow blizzard forums.  
---
What time zone/faction and raid times are you hoping for?
---
We’re rolling horde for old times sake. But man, I love dwarves, Dun Morough, Loch Modan and Ironforge..
---
Aston got nuked by them earlier today and all he said was 'I've gotta get some of those grenades.' I don't think it actually bothers him.
---
Summoning takes out a big aspect of the game which makes the world seem big - traveling.  
---
The respeccing issue is less game changing but I still think things having a large cost in vanilla also had an impact on the experience that I wouldn’t want changed.  
---
QoL to me would be having the tooltip tell me how many more feathers I need to collect or being able to see what spells are available from a trainer without having to trek back to one.
---
As soon as I hit level 10 I went into battlegrounds to earn the rank of general - obviously so that I could speak in the chat channel reserved for generals.
---
Retail doesn't use sharding, it uses phasing.
---
The second option isn't better.  The only "issue" with layering is that you can swap layers and pick up extra stuff.  You can grind more.  That's the whole problem in a nutshell.  You can grind more shit than someone who doesn't layer hop.  
---
That is a much smaller issue than having to go along later and offer up free realm transfers from dead realms.  The second solution isn't better *at all*.
---
A lot of warriors level 2H fury. Dual wielding has a built in Miss % that will make combat very unreliable until you can aquire +Hit gear at level 60. 
---
Don’t level DW.
---
I feel like you're missing what those 2 things serve in vanilla:
---
Dual spec or respeccing in vanilla served as a huge gold sink. I remember that on the weekends I'd spec arms (from prot) and the first thing I did was farm to cover the expense of the respec. 
---
Respeccing was expensive I only did it during weekends I had enough free time to farm back the gold.   
---
Summoning stones or lack thereof, served as a time sink. You had to walk all the way and without them, that's a lot less time being sunk into socializing (while walking).   
---
IMO those QoL changes are actually going against what made classic is good.
---
Vanilla had a LOT of oversights.  Discipline Priest was, in its early Alpha stages, going to be an off tank melee class.  Some of the remnants of that (like increased threat) still exist in the class.  Shaman similarly had threat increases because they too were once considered a viable tank in the planning stages.
---
don't do it  
---
talent reset cost is made specifically to fuck over healers
---
unless ^^^^^^^^you do this
---
Thats not how your body works.
---
&gt;My mom did finally learn that you can't pause an MMO though, so I had that going for me

You lucky bastard. I can't count the amount of times I was in dungeons and I drew the analogy to a football match, where if you leave you screw your teammates as well.

they're doing god's work.  is there some way i can give them all my money?
---
-classic is the best game ever
---
-classic hasn't released yet but unless they add more content it will fail
---
Real big brain stuff.
---
There is, a hat.
---
These are all great ideas for Classic+. I suggested taking Classic in a different direction rather than BC in a different thread and got a lot of brain dead opposition but I really think it’s a great opportunity to reimagine WoW and keep the elements that made Classic great.
---
It's not about the gold or silver. It's about sending a message.
---
I actually just decided last night I am. Same name and race different class (never do a NElf male warrior again).
---
Going to RP whether I get an RP-PvP server or not. Felt like it was only fitting to relive the experience in some way. Will be vastly different this time around though. Druids and warriors differ a bit but also no patch progression this time so... YAY!!!
---
You will talk to people starting from early levels, make friends...and at some point you will join a guild that suits your social needs.
---
Raiding is secondary, the social aspect is primary. Without a strong social connection (which comes from similar views, not only on the game, but political and social views), a guild will fail. Hence, they will fail raids as well.
---
Use mouseover macros for EVERYTHING that way you don't have to physically target anyone ever. You can target an enemy instead to see their casts and buffs/debuffs which can be vital information knowing when, what, and who to heal.  
---
Something like this is a good starting point that will allow you to check for a friendly mouseover first, friendly target 2nd, and lastly default to self cast.  
---
/cast \[@mouseover,help,nodead\]\[@target,help,nodead\]\[@player\] spell name  
---
You can get very details with macros, like casting on target's target (tank usually) or using modifiers. Pretty much play style based.
---
I pve'd as enhance, depends on the guild
---
Wow, awesome post. I love hearing all the social dynamics around these topics - it really puts in perspective why people have so much love for this game and were so invested back "in the day".
---
Honestly amazing how much the limit in how people could communicate contributed to such tight communities.
---
Also - you should post your description of the battle as you remember it!
---
nah im wc3 baby  
---
you're a vanilla baby tho, beat it
---
Hey I appreciate your response I’ll keep all that in mind. I always wanted to heal but I just never did, but I’m glad I never did because now I have something completely new to do in classic. I’m looking forward to it, thanks again.
---
K
---
Not a bad spot at all but very high traffic.  During peak times on a PVP server... rough
---
But my wife’s gonna be pissed. 
---
Just roll a warlock. 
---
Done.
---
Poop. Sock.
---
It is broken. Have not been in the loop?
---
Venruki and Monkeynews have broken it in particular.
---
Yep there is a vendor in the goblin center, along with the quest givers.
---
No changes
---
A lot of us did during private server launches. And every time it was still a blast (also a big reason why people hopped to new servers as they came out even if there weren't any major improvements from the one they were on). If you're not serious about the game, then wait until a week after launch. If you are serious about the game, you will end up being ahead of the pack anyway. It's not worth ruining the entire game because you were too much of a bitch to wait for spawns for the first week.
---
I hope they continue with BC and Wrath. Those x-pacs were so much fun.
---
That's my point. The update is incredibly easy to find and it would have only taken a second to double-check. Maybe make sure your info is correct before posting incorrect facts next time.
---
You can't prove a negative. Your question is the equivalent of somebody getting in a car and driving away and then you turning around and asking people 'hOw dO YOu KnOw tHeY aRenT deAD?'
---
You can't prove it either way but we can look at the past history and make a pretty well educated guess. Let's see here, a bunch of people got banned and threw an absolute fit about it. They were then unbanned. If they got banned again for the same fucking thing don't you think we would see them bitching and moaning on the forums about it?
---
100% most of these people have never played a pserver they have no clue how populated even up to Red ridge or barrens is. A wrath server came out rather recently that only had 200% respawn times it was unplayable, they kept pumping them up. 
---
Without layering you will not find a mob to even kill let alone a quest mob.
---
And your greater point is even more important, people are going to join up on super servers like Illidan etc.  in those cases their servers, are going to be able to even handle the numbers of people without layering. Off the bat not even Queues will save them unless they are 4k pop limits. The current servers and tech doesn't allow 2k people in EF without issue. 
---
Its kinda sad that so much of wow population is too  narrow minded to realize this.  They literally want to trade play ability, server stability, and server longevity for what so rare cases of wpvp doesn't have issues with layering... give me a break.
---
from BWL onwards it got more interesting as the encounters became more complex (movement; mana burn; target switching; etc). healing throughout TBC was challenging.
---
Don't downvote this man, he speaks truth!
---
Jordan said something on classicast that really stuck out to me. That their goal was to build a world not that you play in but that you live in. Paraphrased.
---
That's fair and I respect your approach to honesty. I don't think it's anti-social, I think we all just naturally approach communication differently. I'm not 100% tuned in to this sub so I may miss a lot of the cyclical conversation.
---
I hope it goes well. Ugh.
---
Then again, we don't know how many high elves there were, and we don't know if they all can be raised.
---
Cool I’ll check those out thank you
---
Melee is about staying on people and forcing them on the defensive. 
---
Caster is the same, but opposite.  Keep people off you effectively, and use your combos when you have time.
---
&gt; That is a much smaller issue than having to go along later and offer up free realm transfers from dead realms.
---
The second solution still avoids this.
---
&gt; The only "issue" with layering is that you can swap layers and pick up extra stuff. You can grind more. That's the whole problem in a nutshell. You can grind more shit than someone who doesn't layer hop.
---
Right, so the question is can they stay on the side of the line of "minor exploits" vs "major problematic exploits" with their current implementation.
---
I'm skeptical at the moment, due to the controversy over the area chest, and other bits and bobs.
---
They cut off the tubes connecting the nuts to your business parts.
---
I would make a huge pirate city there made out of shipwreck as it was in pirates of the caribbean, wouldnt that be great
---
Downranknig is VERY IMPORTANT. In classic you have spell ranks as you level up, as your spells don't scale with your level so you are constantly buying new ranks.
---
With that said you are able to cast any rank of the heal spell, provided you have the mana. In many cases a lower rank will have shorter cast time, lower mana cost and less potency to it. Even +healing power will be "taxed" so it doesn't provide full benefit to a lower ranking spell.
---
So depending on your class you are going to heal as you need to learn the spell ranks you want to focus on, as mashing your max rank heal is reserved for EXTREME emergencies, as it will drain your mana pool fast, and will lead to massive overhealing.
---
As myself a druid, I use healing touch 3-5 ranks. (Yes I have 3 different ranks at the beginning of my bar)  With max rank on another spot and macroed into my instant cast cooldown for that "OH SHIT" moment.
---
Depending on tank damage, you might be using low ranking spells, or higher ranking healing. But generally never spamming max rank because it's a massive mana sink, and overhealing.
---
Look for an addon you like such as grid, or healbot, which has a raid frame. Having 40 health bars to manage is really REALLY hard, and addons which change the layout makes it that much easier.
---
If you are assigned to a tank (if you are a priest/paladin primarily) you heal the tank, and the tank ONLY. (heal yourself if you are going to die obviously, and this only applies to raids) 
---
Raid healers focus on their group FIRST, then the rest of the raid, as generally there's at least 1 healer per group.
---
In 5-mans healing priority: Tank=YOU &gt; dps. If DPS are standing in fire, you are 100% fine with letting them die if the tank is getting hit hard. No other DPS should be taking damage except for the tank with the exception of a few fights. And even then, DPS are expected to take care of themselves most of the times. (If you have some kind of HoT, if you can spare the globals you can use it on people outside of the tank so you can focus) And let me be clear **you can 100% tell DPS to bandage/potion if you are struggling to keep the tank up or call for offheals**.
---

Thanks for your effort ChromedDragon. I really appreciate the work you do. I am a post naxx vanilla content fanboy and to look at this maps just makes me happy and excited gor the future.
---
31/8/12 was really cool with nightslayer =)
---
The problem started with MC dropping all of T1, creating this expectation that each new raid tier would replace all of your gear.  
---
So 1-59 there is no one place to get every piece of loot, you need to do quests and a myriad of dungeons to fill out.  At 60 still some of the best pieces come from quests, pvp, and a lot of different dungeons.  Then randomally as soon as MC starts, the ideal(bad itemization kinda stops some of this) is to get every piece out of that one raid.  I think this only happened by accident as MC was one of the last developed things and was rushed.  The fact that T2 drops off ony and rag support the idea that maybe one raid teir sets was not the original design.  I think if more time was spent developing end game itemization they would have created a system were each raid is only a 1/2 tier or less up, and you would need to goto multiple teirs of raids to complete a single tier set.  
---
So for example:  Put some T0 in mara and brd, maybe bracers and belt.  
---
Then put a piece of T1 in like UBRS and DM, then have some bosses in MC  drop high end blues that were competitive because they were rare slots, maybe trinkets like mindtap, briarwood, and HOJ.  
---
BWL first boss would actually drop a piece of T1 still, this way someone completing the set would need to cover 3 tiers of content to get it all, then bwl would drop most of T2 with T2.5 or something like that dropping off end of rag.  
---
By spreading out the loot over more tiers there would be some holes to fill in, but you could do that by having more hybrid or offspec or niche focused pieces in between.  Maybe increase the value of set bonuses so that collecting a set would be more valuable then mix and matching whatever the highest ilevel you could find.  
---
Obviously this would be messy and screw up vanilla, so don't change classic, but if you remade wow and wanted a slower ilevel process this is the way you would do it while still making it a clear upgrade to go into a new raid tier.
---
Talking about 1v1. Try catching a hunter as a paladin. Hint: you can't. Ret pals that know their stuff will take a while to kite and kill. Holy paladins are not worth fighting because you'll oom before they oom unless they don't know what a dispel is.
---
Omg this made my day. I did have some great dwarves beers though.
---
Defias employee here:
---
I can concur
---
In Tibia, if you died you could drop your backpack with everything in it, an item or two, and usually a level or two (depending on your level). You could mitigate some of this by using an amulet of loss (but it cost 50k, which was a pretty decent amount of cash) to protect your backpack and items, and then by buying blessings which also cost another 50k to protect against exp loss - although it wouldn't completely protect you from exp loss, and you could still lose a level. 
---
If you had a red skull, from player killing too much, you would drop all your items upon death, regardless of AoL, and you'd lose a hefty amount of exp (2+ levels at level 130+).
---
For context, getting from like 130-131 back in the day was maybe 20+ hours of constant grinding on Dwarf Guards, no quests or anything, just slaying monsters, and lags and dcs were pretty common for most people.
---
You could try and run back to loot your body before someone else finds it (or ask a guildie for help or something), but if noone was online that could get to were you were hunting, you'd be pretty screwed.
---
It was common for people to get hacked as well back then (usually because they were using cheats), sometimes the hacker would be 'nice' and just steal everything you owned, but a lot of the time you'd get "rooked", whereby the hacker would repeatedly die on the character until it eventually reset at level 1.
---
So, yeah, going from that to a game where the only punishment is a bit of a run back to your corpse and maybe a small repair bill was absolutely nothing in comparison.
---

Look up the boss fight for Nefarion in Blackwing Lair. During the Priest Call, direct heals inflict a stackable DoT upon the target.
---
It is inevitable that we will be *that* hunter. Weapons buff up your stats by a significant amount, and it's unfortunate that we need all DPS stats (Agi + Int[to an extent]). My advice: if you're rolling with a guild, let the appropriate class get it first. The reverse should be true: you get priority on ranged.
---
Ahh thanks for the explanation :)
---
Crocs?? Don't you mean Basalisk
---
Awesome thank you for that I’ll put that to good use.
---
I'm not saying there's no empty space, but Asheron's Call is vast, and more empty, lots of space is essentially waiting for a quest, or a new portal, or point of interest. If this infographic I found is accurate Asheron's call is 500 sq miles, and vanilla wow is 80. On top of that WoW has a lot of areas that are for specific quests, events, mountains, and things. Especially in the newer continents every ounce of space is used or impassible it seems. I'm not saying it can't be done, and you're definitely right that the lower levels zones have more space that could be used, things that jump to mind are Mulgore and Barrens for sure. Overworld housing in a super popular mmo would be tricky, most people would most definitely get left out.
---
2h is far easier to level with, and whirlwind axe will carry you for a long time (class quest in the mid 30's from memory but it's hard so ask for help with it)
---
Of course it all depends. But if shpri opens and keeps the distance that makes Intercept impossible, then he can win.
---
I don't think that's true man , idk how many releases you've played for wow but they have consistently had connectivity issues and long queues.
---
I've had to wait in queues for hours. Now I didn't play BfA at launch and their numbers have dwindled so I don't think they have these types of issues as much with recent expansions, but if there's anywhere near some of the predicted number of players for classic , there's absolutely going to be bottle necking, especially because of the limited amount of servers classic will receive (vs pas expansions getting all available wow servers) 
---
Not to mention they've never done something like this before, there is bound to be hiccups.
---
Sharding was an issue because servers would literally die because of it , layering (hopefully) wont last very long and imo is only going to be used to avoid the bottlenecks experienced in the past. 
---
I get that patience is a lost principle in the gaming world of today but I promise my issue is not with the grind or keeping vanilla vanilla, I just don't want myself, my friends, or anyone with good intentions that's playing wow to get stuck waiting around or even get behind their friends due to a bottleneck that could have been fairly easily avoided.
---
I think layering should not last longer than literally 10-14 days (14 if the amount of players on release is just HUGE) and if it does, I'm not sure what we as the community could really do, but we'd need to be vocal about removing it because if we want classic to survive into phase 2/3/4 it can't stay in much longer than that or it will have a negative impact.
---
They are good but rushing the deep combat is better.
---
&gt;I'm thinking of rolling a warrior alt come classic for shits and giggles as I love dual wielding. Obviously this brings its own problems when with the absence of hit gear pre-60 and obviously a 2h will be better especially once lvl 30 and in WW axe territory. But, as ill be levelling with friends, i wont be suffering from the typical issues of levelling a warrior solo. So humour me and lets pretend superior 2h builds don't exist for the next 2 minutes and that levelling something you find fun is acceptable.
---
Already acknowledged all yours points here.... and asked people not to bother with replies saying to just go 2h. Appreciate your time though bro.
---
Looks like a solid spec. How do you like vile poisons over improved poisons? Do you find that your poison application is still good without improved poisons? I was leaning towards improved poisons because 1. better poison application 2. I figure you don't always have a damaging poison applied (crippling on one weapon by default, and wound/mind numbing on the other if not facing melee/hunter).
---
Yeah, I mean if they did get rid of it incredibly quickly, like 2 weeks, then it would probably be fine for them to keep their current implementation.
---
But I don't see how the current situation is 'fine' for potentially a couple of months.
---
Sure would be awkward if you didn't feel that way and had kids!
---
Gonna remake some of my chars as alts. Some of em really deserve to be played better than back then. So much to do, so little time
---
I've played one healer or another since Vanilla. Preference of addons really vary person to person.
---
Personally I've only ever used Grid (Grid2 in Retail), Decursive, and mouseover macros (this saves you from having to select your target then selecting your heal)
---
Duelwield just sucks for leveling that's all.
---
I mean... at this point you're just playing really bad feral.
---
&gt; Holy paladins are not worth fighting because you'll oom before they oom unless they don't know what a dispel is.
---
AKA good paladins counter hunters.
---
G to Go
---
through a portal
---
If another class that uses that weapon to directly deal damage and it's an upgrade for them, I'd say don't roll on it right? Because your damage comes from your ranged weapon.
---
Otherwise it would be like a warrior rolling need on a gun/bow, because technically they can equip it and get the benefits of the stats
---
So I guess only roll on it if its not an upgrade for the other classes that use it? Does that sound fair?
---
Blizzard releases classic.
---
Blizzard says they will do 6 phases.
---
The end.
---
Honestly, I'm pretty jealous of all those comments. I can't imagine having to put in effort to drag yourself away instead of having to fight to manage some effort to get into it.
---
✌🏻
---
Good idea. You mean create the timeline that should’ve been. Pre-azeroth destroyed, pre-pandas, pre-confusing ass orc time-travel, pre-second legion invasion again, pre-fake pvp nonsense. Count me in!
---
Thralls eyebrows really threw me off
---
Druids are (in my mind) supposed to have nature-y names!  That's part of my conflict, a warrior should have tough strong name, unlike a paladin or druid.  Glad you'll be out there on alliance, hopefully we'll group together one day, or at least trade buffs in passing.
---
You should just level without talent points at all, like a real man.
---
Again, i acknowledged this in my question. I acknowledged 2h is better... i just asked for advice on how to make this work
---
I played Shaman because I've always had a penchant for classes that have both healing spells and damage spells + enchanting their own weapon + having supportive bard like qualities. Its the closest thing I can get to a Red Mage in WoW. 
---
Shaman Benefits:
---
Tons of utility in the form of totems.
---
Astral Recall is so incredibly useful in vanilla. You can Hearth whenever you want basically. 15 Min CD vs a 60 Min CD. Plus you can still use the Hearthstone. Unfortunately you don't get it until 30, but even still its super useful while leveling or farming.
---
Reincarnation: Self res every 30 minutes. This makes them the best dungeon healer imo. Assuming you don't make a critical error in another 30 mins, no one has to walk back from GY.
---
 Chain Heal and Chain Lightning are the coolest spells in the game. Chain Heal is one of the few (maybe the only idk) smart heals in the game, meaning when it splits from the main target it automatically selects targets with low HP. 
---
Ghost Wolf: You can turn into a god damn wolf. You get an amazing movement ability before anyone else as far I can recall. 40% movement speed is crazy good. Even Hunters and Druids are doing stuck at 30% around levels 20-21.
---
 The downside is that this spell has cast time of 3 seconds, as opposed to instant with hunters/druids. With the right talent you can reduce this to a 1 second cast.
---
30/0/21: An amazing PvP spec that allows you to both support and offer crazy burst. You can also get away with using this spec in raids if you're not assigned to a caster group that would require Mana Tide totem.
---
I want to roll Alliance for a new experience, but Shaman keeps me bringing me back in lol. Just talking about them makes me want to roll Horde again.
---
Hm? White hits do miss more often when dualwielding, however, it's yellow hits that matter. No one's going for white hit cap.
---
At the most fundamental level, the game was better when decisions weren't being made by beancounters. And this holds true for every industry.
---
Honestly 10 of anything is very i teresting in a bg.
---
From crocs it may be bit closer to Tanaris. Also there are guards there so it may matter on a PvP realm.
---
Well hold on, isn't DPS just watching bars go down? It's seems to be a different cat with the same hat.
---
[This](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=warrior&amp;talents=qfrqrrqcrsqlryrzrArBqmqisYqCsyszsAsBqGsKsLsMsNyPyQyRqFqEqzs-tatbtcqHs8s9s_s.qBsZs0s1s2In) is the build i run while leveling i hate 2 handers so i always level my warriors dw the whole way up. Check the bottom of the page it shows what levels i take the talents. But i always start arms to get tact mastery and imp overpower. Imp Demo shout is super under appreciated while leveling but it is a huge boost to the efficiency that you can level. As having used this spec to level and reaching 60 solo in 8 days played on my last warrior i can tell you it is tested and works well. The main thing is to keep trolls bloods, and hp pots on you at all times. But it is more fun to level with the DW if you ask me disregard 2 handers acquire currency.
---
\-Kyliemanogue Main Tank of &lt;Participation Totems&gt;
---
I would definitely not delay anger management, for any reason. It's the only reason I even bother to go 5/5 tactical mastery at level 19. I would probably branch off to improved charge and 3/5 tactical mastery if I didn't need anger management. 
---
I am real skeptical of the dual wielding angle. Simple fact is, your rend can be dodged (at least on pservers, I assume beta). That means it can proc overpower. Do you want a good overpower? or a shitty one?
---
Also, I don't feel that pre anger management, you really even have the rage to do a ton of overpowers anyways. You can't because you don't get a lot of procs, but it's a yellow hit: I dont' think it generates rage, and pre anger management, I am just flat out rage starved. I need better procs more than I need more procs.
---
I will note, I am not sure if hamstring can be dodged. I assume it can, but I have never actually noticed anyone dodging a hamstring. 
---
If you do any video testing, I would be curious to see it, especially if this whole melee leeway makes hamstring kiting useless, but I am SUPER skeptical.
---
&gt; Don't hit me with them 29 billion trillion vanilla ping, spell batching bullshit excuses because Classic
---
No need to be mean.
---
&gt; Assuming a normal 2006 latency of 150 ms, that's 15% of one second while 70ms makes up 7.5% of a second. The two clips demonstrate practically identical melee leeway behavior.
---
An example of how batching and ping could combine to create this scenario:
---
You have 100ms, assuming no clock-correction and 2 sec batching. 
---
You (P1) gauge P2 on batch 1 and there's 100ms latency to server registering.
---
Server receives packet at batch 2, 100ms later.
---
Server creates packet after 2 seconds.
---
Server sends packet to P2 with latency of 100ms.
---
P2 gets gauged 100ms after batch 2 packet gets sent.
---
Total time since P1 gauge, 2200ms.
---
Not a dad but taking myself out of the breeder pool in early September. Ready for a few days off work to sink fully into classic.
---
Is there something inherently fun about missing a fourth of your attacks?
---
What exactly are you “asking” here? The good/useful talents in arms are pretty obvious, but even if they aren’t - why are you asking people? You’re already dedicated to a terrible build, why ask for ideas now?
---
Have to be female dwarfs.
---
Fuck no
---
They are look like crocodiles :)
---
What if Classic becomses way more popular than retail, and the Classic playerbase demands more content.
---
Erm no thanks.
---
No women is ever forcing me to get the snip.
---
I am not asking them to change anything and I know the phases. I am just asking what they did before when releasing new servers out of curiousity.
---
I am still missing your point.
---
Pro tip: participate in one on NASA's 3 month bedrest experiments. You are payed to literally lay in bed and not move.
---
Weird, I had no idea. I ran past a stone in westfall and thought it was just a summoning stone. Didn't click it though
---
easily as long as u dont go up against other premades
---
If I've gotta do it, might as well do it during a time when I can enjoy some nostalgia.
---
False hope is cruel. You lift a person up without the payoff of wind beneath their wings, only for them to fall all the harder.
---
10 points to sub, to get my stealth on.
---
Ghostly Strike because why not?
---
Now it's fiddly.  I like prep so I should probably head there.
---
2 Elusiveness because *obviously*.
---
2 junk points now that actually require you to think about how your build will go.
---
3 SB, 2 Setup
---
Prep.
---
Hemo.
---
Imp gouge.
---
Dodge.
---
Hit.
---
Endurance.
---
3/3 Setup.
---
Heightened Sense.
---
Deadliness.
---
Six points left to see what I feel like doing.  I could finish out ambush and Opportunity, or pick up some crit, or blade flurry etc.
---
Something like that is how I plan to rogue.  It depends if I decide to go full on ambush mode, with prep and opp and all the crits.
---
Awesome thanks for the detailed response. I knew you guys wouldn’t let me down. I’ve been reading up a lot on downranking so imma make sure I get that down quick. I only ever played a warrior and rogue in vanilla wow and I don’t remember having to do that, so having a brand new mechanic to deal with will be fresh. Thanks again
---
Thanks buddy, appreciate the actual response to the question. Ill check out the build
---
New servers, back in vanilla?
---
They made new servers for the increase in population. 
---
No they didn't open new servers and start from square one because that wouldn't make any god damn sense.
---
I will keep the name. It's followed me throughout the years and a multitude of games.
---
Probably yeah. Rogues are pretty decent for flag carry and for killing opposite flag. The problem will be you having no mid control at all, so for every flag you basically have to have your rogue get past 10 players in mid while also assasinating their own flag carrier. That can be very risky and will rely on the enemy being bad at keeping track of their own flag, and defending their flagcarrier
---
8 days played solo seems really slow, is it not?
---
You have to feign death to drop combat to use them, but feign can be resisted so not super reliable in pve and if you are the only person in combat the mob will evade.
---
Not true for PvP
---
If that's in I'll do it
---
It's my choice bro.
---
I dare you to "poop out" even one of the same quality as OP's maps even if you've got a few hours.
---
1. Tribute if it will be possible &gt;&gt; Maraudon ( still 30-35gph vendoring and a whole lot easier)
---
2. depends on the state of the game. Hunters, rogues and mages were able to capitalize on the Zul Gurub release and farm bloodwine/coins/dolls solo which usually are in high demand after the raid drops. 
---
Aside from instance farms it is harder to answer, since it depends on your servers market. Herb gathering, fel cloth farming and other things could all contest to be the most profitable thing.
---
3. If Tribute is possible: hunters &gt;&gt; mage &gt; others
---
Without tribute: Hunter ≈ mage (if dm:e is still up, mage might win this)&gt; others
---
4. Tribute will definitly benefit from gear. Maraudon is usually 5-instances-per-hour capped after a certain minium gear. Zul Gurub farm does not require gear if you are only after bloodwine or dolls
---
Yeah god forbid anybody play anything but the cookie cutter builds.  Having fun is so lame.
---
The only thing I dislike about classic is I just wish a little more effort was put into making some specs more viable back in the day and that didn't start to happen till TBC.
---
Truly doing the lords work.
---
Thanks for ignoring my question :) appreciate it,
---
Fuck you and your shamans and winfury. Fuck you.
---
OOPS did i put poison damage i prefer actually using the poison application in PVP. extra poison application is wonderful i missclicked that one for sure.
---
Yes because the "old and original" characters were dragged through shit piles we like to call expansions. 
---
So my characters died inside and out.
---
Dude its so bad. The beta has only been out for a few weeks and players already have shown how broken it is. Three weeks of this is already bad for the game.
---
That’s not an arms build lol
---
Pve server KEK
---
Interesting that the name sort-of becomes part of who you are, even across several games.  I've done the same with other names, not my dwarf though, that has always belonged to WoW.
---
Solo for a warrior 8 days is pretty good if you ask me. Everyone was exclaiming how i did very well leveling solo and getting to 60 in 8 days.
---
I agree. Different cat with the same hat. I enjoy healing, I find it much more relaxing, and in a way, challenging. The simple gist of a dungeon or raid is kill them before they kill you, so strategy even outside of direct healing plays a role.
---
Cool thanks a lot, I thought you had forgotten !
---
Hey while i got ya here, does your boss offer a benefits package? Looking for a new career.
---
when you're playing on a server with max peaks of 15k, invis is invaluable. I can't count how many times Shadowmeld saved my ass as a warrior. Then down the line when I was geared, I used to shadowmeld for ambushing and insuring I get my charge off.
---
However, as I cleared all content as a MT Prot, I felt like I was constantly compensating for lack of weapon skill. 
---
Classic I will be rolling human, but as I practice as a human warrior, I really do miss having Shadowmeld. I't s a very underrated ability. Being able to dodge ganks with it, was some of my early memories of wow.
---
The only class I really don't recommend rolling NE for is Rogue. That to me is way more of a meme than anything.
---
I, too, am a Seth Rogen fan
---
Downranking takes thought at least and knowing how hard your spells are going to hit for.
---
What healer you looking at? Might be able to point you in the right direction!
---
Have to learn the fights and know how to react to what's happening... then factor in the stupidity of bad dps and compensate for that.
---
Ret paladins take 1-2 minutes to be killed by a hunter while holy paladins take 4-5 minutes. In either case the paladin will never have an opportunity to kill the hunter. I don't think you understand what a counter is.
---
Don't forget the 5 hours per week of mat farming!
---
I think the most annoying thing about hunters is the way autoshot interferes with your abilities, whereas autoattacks don't interfere with melee specials.  
---
Install a swing/shot timer and it isn't a hard mechanic, but it kind of felt like playing a scorch mage where scorch has a 4sec CD and instead of pressing a button to cast it, it is auto cast like I'm micro managing a pet then really playing my class myself.
---
True but not true at release. there are hardly mobs to kill (even 4-6 level mobs) for most starting areas on pserver releases with +200% respawn rates. Now imagine classic... Layer is smart people who don't want it have not started on pservers at release or have but with there dynamic insta respawns (so they don't realize how much it takes).
---
10 druids.
---
My pleasure! Dw gets a bunch of hate or i get flamed constantly for running this build but honestly it is a lot of fun and the quest weapons allow you to be pretty competitive and lets you be an even better tank for your groups while leveling and doing dungeons.
---
&gt;If there was new content added to Classic eventually
---
.... and sayonara!
---
Classy, I like it
---
I'm reading all of them by batches of 20-30 but since I stopped playing at the beginning of TBC there are a lot of references I'm missing.
---
Amazing post, full of nostalgia, real history, and nuance. This is what this sub should be about.
---
I think it makes sense, they are north of the Scarlet Crusade areas so probably mostly safe from the undead. Maybe it could have been founded by the survivors of Arthas expedition to Northrend or something, we know as of WotLK that some escaped. Also I think the western inaccessible part of Tirisfal Glades would be a good location for an updated zone. Could have a port city for the forsaken there
---
&gt;The question is where do I go from here?
---
To your warrior trainer and respec. 
---
There, I answered your question
---
Why don't you think the population is going to grow past the first day of release?  I'm sure it will decline, but the first few months I'd imagine there are going to be many more coming than going.  
---
I just can't understand why they won't just cap the servers at 5k and be done with it.  They can merge them together later, when population declines.  It's like layering but not as stupid.  They can just add a server prefix to the names to keep naming from overlapping like they did in retail.
---
Every single thing about layering and phasing is bad.  We've had it for years, and it sucks.  It's the same technology in retail that is going to be used on classic.  It's terrible.  You gonna have people zoning out of thin air killing rares/farming mats and then vanishing into the either.  You are going to be in the middle of a battle and be phased into an alternate dimension.  Your mob is going to disappear, and you are going to be in a completely fucked situation.
---
Furthermore, The Queue to get on the popular servers is what populates other servers because people don't want to wait, adding layers is just going to make the big servers even bigger, and that will create a feedback loop causing more people to go to that server, making it even more crowded. 
---
I hope I'm wrong, honestly, because it seems super dumb the way they are doing it.
---
&gt;just release 3 smaller servers
---
30
---
Alt timeline: does the alt timeline say anything about levels and being able to faceroll content from the previous expansion?
---
Snapshots: is it impossible for my tbc toon to experience classic content? Oh I see tbc just has whatever version of classic it had when it shipped. One once I’ve moved my toon to tbc, I can’t go back, right?
---
Get this post out of here.
---
&gt; World Record fastest time through Vanilla WoW 1-60 in 4 days 20 hours
---
Ehh doesn't seem like it.
---
&gt; This system is too complicated, just release 3 smaller servers with the same name and then merge them afterwards according to population demands.
---
So having dynamic servers that auto-create and destroy themselves is more complicated then making 3 actual servers and doing realm transfers and database merges?
---
It sounds like you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
They've done server merges before, haven't they?
---
They are also the most sympathetic. I feel like almost every other boss in the game is either Evil Incarnate, or Corrupted by Evil Incarnate.
---
I was in such a cartel on Thunderlord horde. I'll make a few random notes for those lost in the above wall of text
---
- the honor ranking system was complex but simplified by an addon. The honor was not exponential, no cap, you just kept grinding it at the same rate all week and reached whatever you managed to reach, no limit. end of the week everyone was ranked from first to last in raw honor earned, and this is the only metric that advanced you in the actual RANKS (1-14). Some servers you could get 3rd place with 750,000 honor, on others you'd need 1.5 million. both of those players moved up the ranks the same amount for that week.
---
- It was easy on my server, a few hours a couple weekdays and then 8 hours a day Sat / Sun. no big deal at all. 
---
- I did it entirely via BGs, that is WSG and AB. 10-15 random people from different guilds in my group. No point doing AV since your total honor was capped anyways within the group.
---
- One did NOT need to be personally excellent at PVP, at all. Just be on voice, have a reasonable comp in group (runners, healers, tanks etc) and follow standard BG strategies. You were never dueling someone 1v1 needing to personally defeat them. MOST times the BGs would be vs PUGs and you could win them in minimal time half asleep, skill mattered not one bit. Especially since most of the time PUGs would not actually fight back wanting it to be over ASAP.
---
- On the alliance side the grind was immeasurably worse, AND they had long queues for each and every BGs. ours popped in minutes or instantly, 24/7.
---
- it was just a matter of showing up for X number of weeks in a row, and soon you were R13, at which point it was some more weeks for your turn to hit 14 (1 person per week). Up to R13 you just rocket up the charts.
---
- Pretty much no one else on the server approached our weekly honor totals for months on end. Of note one SINGLE dude managed it pretty consistently in AV, he was there 7 days like 20 hrs/day. I imagine afk botting.
---
- there were some pretty famous jagoffs on other servers THAT KEPT UP THE PACE after hitting R14, for weeks and months... thus preventing all others from hitting 14 and enraging the server like nothing you've ever seen.
---
- I played rogue and ran flags with double sprint / vanish, usually handing it over midway to a druid. or stayed in flag room sapping the enemy FC. very easy - I was NOT a skilled player in any way.
---
- to reiterate what you absolutely need is a dedicated group of 10-15, and play a lot on weekends, and be on the "right" server. It's a long haul and in the long run it made not an iota of difference if you lost embarrassingly to another organized group, or got owned 1v1 a the stables cause you suck. ALMOST ALL HONOR WAS GAINED VS PICKUP GROUPS, who literally didn't fight back half the time.
---
I was talking about your 21/8/22 build. Cold blood is not good with that setup. If you are going for a seal fate build that's a different story.
---
Easy, just take the higher item level item and don’t worry about the stats.  They’re just a number on a spreadsheet.  Jeez, haven’t you played BFA?  
---
Shit is beautiful
---
The reality is nuanced.  He could start his own guild and then he could raid as a 0/0/0 if he wanted because he’s in control.  Shadow Priest?  Not overly viable on its own but pair it with a bunch of warlocks and it’s a must have.  Bear tank?  Those are useful as all hell as off tanks and they’re not always going to be off tanking so they can do feral DPS on fights where they’re not needed.
---
Getting to be a bit much tho, right? Pace yourself, dude!
---
&gt; trying to get to 60 fastest 
---
I am trying to look at lvling and quickly gearing as one thing atm, like will its save me time if I do it along the way, or is it still inefficient because I am a lower level.
---
Figure out what is popular about Classic that isn't in Retail that could be added to Retail without alienating the Retail base, and then add it to Retail. 
---
You change Classic, it isn't Classic. Period. And Blizzard has said before they don't care to fork development. If Classic is more popular than Retail for a sustained period of time (let's say, 18 months, 3 months after Naxx drops, Classic is still bigger than Retail), perhaps they should consider changing their strategy, but that seems unlikely.
---
Blizzard is already making some moves - they're doing a level squish with the next expansion, squishing level ranges by half, such that a level 120 is now a level 60 again. That will likely naturally come with a stat squish as well. Blizzard is trying to address some perceived issues. I don't believe that Retail can't cater to the majority of players with this next expansion. They just have to be bold and make those choices.
---
The funny thing is, the name I use is a shortened version of what I used to use for my main. That character became my main in WoW, and now I use the longer version for alts.
---
The only options at launch are questing, grinding and exploration. Questing is best, grinding is second best and exploration leveling is a distance third. A large number of people know about all three of these possible launch strategies, the ideal one is going to depend on how packed layering is and LOTS of people will be following the ideal strat. I'm hoping it's spread out enough that questing turns out to be ideal.
---
&gt;most bug are found by playing the game. 
---
true.  
---
but bugs have to be reported. Which is something they are not doing.
---
&gt;Also, hormonal birth control has some pretty gnarly side effects on the hormones. Tube tying is also a much riskier procedure than a vasectomy.
---
Good thing IUDs exist then. Completely reversible, don't require surgery, very mild side effects (certainly milder than surgery). Only an idiot would get surgically sterilized unless they or their partner have other medical conditions that make it the only feasible option.
---
I guess vasectomy is an appealing option if you want to have irresponsible sex with partners whom you can't trust to use other contraception, but there's a much simpler solution to that problem and it's to just... not do that. For normal people the chance that you'll regret it later (split with your partner and want to have kids with your new one, for instance -- life's long, you know) is too high IMO.
---
Thank god there are PVE servers.
---

Good luck. This sub doesn't take kindly to creativity/non-meta ideas. No fun allowed!
---
Idk, I don't trust modern blizz to do anything.  Just rerelease classic again in like 5 years.
---
Not dedicated to any build,  
---
Only thing i would like to aim for is tactical mastery, nothing is fixed in. I would like to dual wield, im not asking for alternatives to dual wielding, just the best way to go about making dual wielding work.  
---
I find missing 1/4 of my attacks more fun then missing a swing on a slow 2hander, but that just my personal preference. I know its not optimal just what i find more fun.  
---
And im asking for ideas now from other who make like to dual wield whilst leveling (i know there are plenty) and how they found their builds and spec's.
---
Hm, I’ve played on classic private servers for the last 10 years and people who don’t make six figures working at Blizzard and instead in some French basement somewhere were able to merge servers so I don’t see how that’s any less difficult than “fine-tuning” a system that isn’t perfect which is apparent by the beta.
---
When you're fighting common mobs and popping the finisher, the target is either already dead or close to being dead. Adding more combo points at that stage is almost meaningless. Ruthlessness is a raid/boss talent.
---
I really think VanCleef was a better dungeon than anything 90% of MMO's post-WoW offered.
---
Well if it’s any consolation raids now-days, from retail to classic, are on a strict schedule and many guilds don’t go over time outside of the top ya guilds on the last boss after a 3% wipe. Everyone has shot they want to do after or go to bed and be ready for the morning. Even the college kid dominated guilds don’t want to be going more than an hour over time and that’s a rare occurrence if they do go over.
---
The fact that he replies in private messages is so unsettling.
---
Classic would need a minimum of 3 million non-Retail-player subscriptions for Blizzard to consider it a priority over Retail. That is not going to happen.
---
Cheers, you have been most helpful.  
---
Guess i need to rework the disclaimer, it doesn't seem to convey the message well enough
---
Yeah - I think farming the materials for both Shadoweave and Felcloth are quite efficient as you can get them from pretty good XP farming spots.
---
I personally like going Imp Sinister Strike first, for the energy reduction. You'll be using SS until at least level 30 when you can get Hemo, if you decide to go that route… and backstab is pretty meh until you get all the supporting talents for it, which also won't happen until later levels.
---
Yeah I meant like Illidan-1,2,3 and Kargath-1,2,3 and they should add them as the demand rises.
---
You lose their function and they only there for sad reminders of what once was...hey he could work at blizzard then!
---
And the fact he felt the need to share the private messages too. Yikes.
---
If you think your idea of servers popping in and out of existence are a better one than OPs you do not look like somebody who knows what he's talking about either. 
---
The only solution to this shitfest we are witnessing is having multiple servers who merge into one after phase 2. 
---

Yes, but wasnt OPs question about lvling?
---
Ganking lowbies is not a fun part of the game to me in any way shape or form nor is getting ganked by high level players (Which is going to make up 95% of Wpvp excluding faction wars which I also have no desire to participate in).
---
If that's the most fun part of the game for you then great, but you should understand that it's not the most fun part of the game for a lot of other people.
---
Exactly what im aiming for. What were the key weapons you typically pick up along the way?
---
&gt;  It wasn't an oversight per se, it was more like they couldn't figure out how to make it work with the theme of the holy warrior.
---
Sorta not really. The taunt that Paladins got in BC (Casted on an ally, taunts 3 mobs targeting them), was thematically the one Kevin Jordan wanted to give to them, but the tech was not there. That combined with the fact a lot of the Paladin changes in BC were 'pushed back' from their 1.9 overhaul. The reason you gave is why they didn't just give Paladin the taunt that worked with the tech they had. Not that they didn't have one that fit with the class. 
---
Now with that said, I don't think it should be changed, even as someone who intents to play a lot of Prot Paladin, and at MOST it's a discussion for a 'Classic+' situation, but definitely 'no changes' is just the best way to please the most people.
---
People will already have a hard time finishing the quests with all the competition. So I doubt that it will be a good spot.
---
Nobody is arguing that it resets your swing timer. "Weaving" simply refers to timing the slam immediately after a white hit goes off so your next attack (slam) comes out in 1 second rather than waiting on another white hit. It does more DPS than spending rage on hamstring for like 50 damage and the hope of a windfury proc.
---
No, I am personally more worried about the extremes of per-zone population the current implementation will cause. And the knock-on effect of both community and gameplay/engagement that will cause.
---
The current implementation (and their outlined intention) does not appear to be very aggressive, and/or take account of the per-zone situation.
---
So, as far as I can tell, the current implementation will result in the level 1 zones being a nightmare for a while, and also the people at/near the head of the pack will be in disproportionately dead zones.
---
i.e. the first 100 people into Westfall will be split amongst 3+ instances of the zone.
---
Descolace was pretty rough on a particular pserver that goes without naming
---
I’m pretty sure they can all be raised. It’s known that humans have always been the most populated race, but considering it was just one faction of Humans (Lordaeron) vs an entire empire of elves in one area. I imagine the numbers had to be relatively similar.
---
&gt; Layering NEEDS To go.
---
It really doesn't though.  The only argument against layering is that someone will get more resources than you.  Newsflash:  People that play more than you will get more resources than you anyway.
---
There will be a few select no-lifing warriors who have way too much time on their hands :D
---
Maybe for the nostalgia... I named my first character, a Forsaken warlock, after a Chaucer poem. I was on an RP server and had a whole backstory. It was pretty cool. But I was forced to spell the name wrong (thanks Blizz) which was always irritating for my Type A personality.
---
I'm actually pretty solidly in the no changes crowd, I'm just curious if thats an actual possibility. Sure, there are loads of things I'd love fixed, but actually fixing them would open a door I don't want opened.
---
2: Lay on Hands now gives you a 30 second buff that gives the Paladin 50 mana every 5 seconds
---
4: Increases duration of blessing of freedom by 5 seconds
---
6: Your blessings can no longer be dispelled 
---
8: Aura of Sacrifice: 1% of damage dealt to party members within 40 yards of the caster is transferred to the caster.
---
Rank 10 gear is all blue, no epics.  If they had an epic helm they probably killed Onyxia
---
He's Asmonsilver

Layering already works and is automated.  Next.

Ill be sure to post it come classic, and people can have a good laugh at the miss streaks
---
Let me introduce you to Grinding Gear Games lol.

Great point about kiting warriors.
---
I just saw that too.

I mean. He has way more control over what he presents to the public that way, which makes him able to manipulate the discussion. It's disgusting to be frank.
---
I'm not sure what you mean? The bear form quest does not become available untill level 10.
---
You are telling him he didn't have fun.
---
You're better off saving FD for traps tbh. 
---
Scatter is way better (and almost mandatory) for PvP.
---
actually I take it back
---
frontflips
---
Mine said "don't lvl to much without me :("
---
What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you work at Blizzard?
---
Your entire...whatever it is...its built on WRONG assumptions. 
---
Why ? Because until couple days ago, there were almost NO issues with layering in beta. And that was because layering actually WASN'T implemented in beta. The beta population is TOO LOW for the need of a second layer.
---
What happened couple days ago was a FORCED and ARTIFICIAL introduction of supplemental layers in the beta server, without SUPPLEMENTING the population to fit said layers.
---
What happened was similar to SHARDING, because the beta, with a population that is BARELY above 1,000 concurrent players, was afefcted by probably 8-10 layers.
---
OFC it was a shit show. Basically, beta had layers with 100-120 people in it. And that is very close to sharding.
---
Do you remember the stress tests? I hope you do, because THAT was layering...and still, there were probably 500-600 people in an area...and you could see and interact with ALL of them. There were multiple layers, with 500-600 people in them in the stress tests.
---
IT worked because the stress test had thousands and thousands of people, and layering was more than ok, while the beta doesn't have even half population needed for a single layer.,
---
Now, on to the actual layering that WILL, 100%, be in Classic. Your solutions will be disregarded by Blizzard. There is no point in even analyze what you proposed.
---
Layering, on MOST realms (bar streamers realms), will be removed, entirely, in 4-6 weeks. What we DON'T know is how big a layer will be. We know it will be similar to Vanilla....but that can mean 2k or 4k players. And my bet is that the Classic layers will have closer to 4k players, rather than 2k players, simply because once there is a single layer, after the tourist wave, it is better to have a margin for a slow and steady dropout rate. It is better to have 4k concurrent players and slowly go to 3k (maybe 1 years) and still have a damn good population, instead of starting with 3k and go to 2k in one year.
---
The biggest dropout will be in the first 4-6 weeks, big enough to remove layering on non-streamer realms.
---
I, personally, have no doubt that this will happen. I don't see layering, on most realms, be a thing in 4 to 6 weeks.
---
Its taken all of 2 minutes for me to realise this. lol FML
---
That one is pretty frustrating actually. I understand why they're keeping it - it would necessitate balance changes, its still a damn shame that they have to keep a technical limitation. But like I said, it opens the door, so it's gotta stay.
---
At least we're starting out with 16 slots, not 8.
---
Damn, Kid Rock looks a lot different than I remember.
---
The one I just kinda thought up: 
---
You take the same talents regardless. Getting TM isn’t “arms”, it’s a standard fury warrior take, so basically you just want to level as raid fury. Nothing you take is going to make dual wielding and better for you over 2h. You’ll either be rolling 2h fury or raid fury, or some janky ass dual wield mortal strike build.
---
None of those builds have much variety/space to make leveling with dual wield any better than it would normally be, though.
---
Having leveled some alts, I find going through the same content multiple times pretty boring. Playing both alliance and horde extends this somewhat. I wouldn’t be a fan if having to start fresh at each expansion. 
---
I’m really liking the idea of traveling along ones own timeline, slaughterhouse five style. You go back to level 40 and you get the full vanilla experience, with appropriate talent trees skills etc. 
---
I wouldn’t shard the servers so much either. I have to say it’s totally bizarre to me to do raids/dungeons with people from other servers.
---
I originally thought hunter and priest weapons would be in phase 2, but someone kited winterspring demons to everlook guards and got an eye of shadow to drop.  Eye of shadow wasn't put in the game until 1.4 originally, and didn't drop off those demons until 1.5 so it looks like they are lumping all the 1.4/1.5 item changes into into phase 1.
---
I dont think you are shaving single digit hours at all. You are going to be eating more, having to return to town for food more often, making less gold which you could spend on leveling faster with earlier mount or better gear.
---
I mean its not hard at all to hamstring and run a bit lol. Pretty boring just standing still pressing buttons anyway. Kiting you actually feel like a warrior.  I think it makes it a bit less monotonous. 
---
But yea not surprised you dont care about hamstring kiting saving you time when you also dont care about all the time you waste killing mobs w a shield on. Srsly 60% of the damage minimum and you are unfettered. Thats not a couple hours mate. We are talking days.
---
Your "per-zone" problem may not even exist; doesn't get fixed by having more servers; is being tested in Beta to find nice numbers.  The sky is not falling.  Even if it does, who cares?  Wait another week and miss the rush if you are worried about too many people in a zone.
---
Yeah, you're right. Gnome is the best bet for PVP alliance. I just don't like how the gear displays so small on their bodies. I love really nice shoulders on an orc lol.
---
Dont feel bad. Windows 10 calls all programs apps now in their settings menu. So technically you are correct.
---
Rofl its funny how the people who have actually played vanilla in the modern times when 7-10k people log in all at the same time understand this. And then gets down voted by these retail and 'muhh blizzlike' reddit warriors who have NO CLUE how vanilla handles massive populations. 
---
Twillzy you are 100% correct. These people don't understand that humans cannot find level 5-6s mobs top fight without layering or respawn rates.  Layering at least mimics the feel of a high pop server with slow respawn rates and so on.  And as long as its zone wide (which they seem to be having issues with) the only issues are between zones and joining new groups. For +95% of game play you'll never notice an difference.
---
Press X to doubt.
---
More likely you've been convinced it's your choice.
---
But what ever. Do as you please.

---
I'll take that as you ceding the point to me.
---
Just because *you* think layering is bad, doesn't make you right.
---
so you generally will probably want to rock wingblade at 20 with the dagger from scum in WC. There are some good SFK weapons you might be able to pick up too if you do that place for the quests. The BFD quest if you are horde for the water globe is good for outlaw saber. Then you have a little lul for quest items. But you can get out of RFK a really good offhand dagger and an axe off the final boss. at late 30's you can pick up sword of omen from SM and then the Vanquisher sword from RFD quests. Then those will hold you over until you go get thrash blade main hand off of Maura and if you do ST you can get the dagger from the Ancient egg quest. Those will pretty much last you until 60. You may pick up an upgrade out of BRD by chance but until then those weapons will be what you use.
---
I'm a dungeon/raid healer. That's what's interesting to me in the game. Imagine you are doing your PvP gaming and suddenly you are forced to do a dungeon or something. That's why I'll roll on PvE.
---
Man... what even is this sub?
---
I mean, could take a shot at the dragon isles, maybe the southsea islands? Stuff planned to be in classic that was cut.
---
I think I preferred the anti streamer spam guys
---
That's not entirely accurate. IUDs have expiration dates and require replacement eventually. Say you're married with kids but you don't want any more. Sounds like less of a hassle just to get a snip than to have to replace your IUDs and hope they don't attach to your uterus. Happens. Less risk with vasectomy still and doesn't require maintenance. Vasectomies aren't just for people who want to sleep around casually you know.
---
Anyone else see pictures of Vanilla zones and just immediately hear their music in their heads? Couldn't do that with anything past Wrath, that's for sure.
---
I did so much portal fuckery  You'd be surprised how many people would click on Undercity portals in the AV tunnel
---
Spell crit is *exceptionally* useful for paladins, as their crit heals cost 0 mana.
---
It was my assumption dual wield levels went straight into fury. Didn't realise TM was a standard pick-up until 40+  
---
I acknowledged several times in my original post that i know 2h will be better. Im not looking for what best, just how to have the most fun making dual wielding work. Despite it well-known weaknesses.
---
I don’t plan on joining a streamers guild so I have no worry’s about being blacklisted. I doubt anyone is gonna really care that a horde is camping an alliance streamer.
---
How can I possibly care that other people have things I can grind for?  You do know that there is no actual limit to the number of any of those, right?  Literally your entire argument is "they'll get it faster than me!"  You are playing a game that is 15 years old!  Who cares if they get it first?

&gt; Your "per-zone" problem may not even exist
---
Well exactly, it depends on implementation.
---
I'm suggesting a variation of their outlined layering system, not removing the entire concept.
---
&gt; is being tested in Beta to find nice numbers
---
Is it? They haven't indicated that's what they're doing.
---
In order to do that with their current outline they'd need to have a dynamic layer size, which took into account zone hot-spots.
---
So the target could be 3500 people per layer, but it could be reduced as low as 1000, or something, if there are crazy hot-spots.
---
But that seems like an overzealous solution, since their intended layer system is server-wide. Which is why I suggested the modification, allowing per-zone mitigation without changing the whole server's zone demographics.
---
You might still take a crack at the islands off the coast of Stranglethorn, the Dragon Isles, and Vanilla Gilneas and/or Kul'Tiras.

100%. The "evil incarnate" trope often doesn't have any substance. Its something retail suffers from badly imo. I mean how many times can you save the world before its like "okay get in line villain #421".

Vancleef isnt trying to rule the world, and hes not some all powerful planet sized entity either. Hes just a really smart guy that Stormwind thought they could take advantage of, and are now suffering gravely for it. Those types of stories are far more interesting and impactful for me.

Yeah getting killed by a bunch of trolls here and there could be pretty fun and entertaining for the stream, would be a problem if they camped same person over and over for hours though but it seems like they are satisfied after a kill or two :)

See as much as i want to bring MOGAR back the orc warrior i have evolved via streaming and such and gotten used to my new character name too much so i have to rock the new one.

I have no worries about being blacklisted either, because I don't give a shit about a group of tryhards.  There will be countless casuals I can pug things with.

I think when you play the game and realise how bad it is not to kite, you will kite. At least you will need to to not die when you get bad luck and miss 4 attacks in a row .

Or maybe leniency is fcked and kiting is ruined, well see.
---
Yep something simple such as summoning stones changes the dynamics a lot. No point in ever taking a warlock now as mages have more utility. Main reason I use to take warlocks in my dungeon teams was to summon my lazy ass.

I do remember Starman and Gartrar, the two people who I played with the most. Really wish I could remember more, but I quit right before Wrath and I have forgotten just about everything.
---
True, but that is very situational, nothing that is game breaking. You don’t pick NE for it’s pve racials, but the benefit of dwarf racials are not large enough to pick dwarf if you do not like the looks of it. Unless you are crap player that need the fear ward crutch to get into a guild.
---
I believe most top pvpers consider NE hunter to be BiS over dwarfs.. Shadowmeld is great for WSG, AB and wPvP. While dwarf racial is strong you can replace most of its effect using consumables while shadowmeld is not replaceable.
---
Swifty plays a NE warr even if on paper it might not be optimal. Don’t undersstimate aesthetics in your enjoyment of the character. Regardless you can always use shadowmeld to make pvp plays which will make playing NE feel worth it.
---
Not only that but there’s going to be better guilds. We have already seen how “streamer guilds” have turned out on retail. Just because they have viewers doesn’t mean they are good at the game. 
---
I’m willing to get that top guilds will end up blacklisting streamers guilds. No way anyone is going to care about someone ganking the enemy faction.

---
I think phase 1 should be at least 4 months, and as the phases go on they should get longer. The raids require much more time investment and hopefully more people will get to see more of the content if things were a bit longer before the next one lands. (Or bring in AQ war effort and that should slow things down a bit)

I'm rolling Orc. With how prevalent engineering will be, that stun resist will be huge.

You don’t lose their function, either.  Not entirely.  They’re also responsible for producing testosterone, and that remains unaffected by the vasectomy.  You only lose _some_ of their function. ;)

Mine wasnt in vanilla it was wrath a female human rogue with the ugliest face named Sneakysnipe on Laughing Skull server

Streamers get so much help from their community it’s only the natural order to keep balance. Get help and to get ganked.
---
&gt; They haven't indicated that's what they're doing.
---
They don't need to.  I don't need them to.  I don't care in the least about layering being there.  I'm going to get a Classic vanilla-type world with vanilla-type gaming, and I'm going to have fun.  I can't possibly care that they want to use virtual servers instead of having server transfers later.
---
&gt; And I'm not worried about "a lot" of people, I'm worried about it going a wee bit too far into "ridiculous lagging mob" of people.
---
&gt; I don't mind a big population surge where there's people all over the place, as long as it's mitigated to not make the game completely unplayable and/or crash.
---
Well this is exactly the sort of thing layering is designed to fix.  Spun up virtual servers when the demand is too high.
---
And so it shall be done!!!
---
Yeah I have almost every disease and my appendix has been ruptured for about 10 years now

I think you have to wait until phase 3 for bgs
---
I don't understand why Spiders never got any kind of web or poison ability. Did they just think it would be too OP or something?
---
I confused of much the thread sense understanding can’t make imagine.
---
Level 40 is not the real game though.
---
Sure in PvE there's isn't much difference. Human would probably be the slightly better choice. In pvp you also have to consider how strong stoneform is since priests can't take off poisons. It removed blind in vanilla.
---
On what?  Grim and Caen PvP videos are a great example of what combat swords are capable of.
---
Nothing of value being lost was me talking about you leaving.  No one will miss you kiddo.
---
Oh no, I tried Balance several times during Vanilla, i'm well fucking aware I dont but hey, I wont sqaush yalls dreams. Maybe you'll be that one Boomkin who out DPS that Mage and everyone will applaud and chant your name in vent, the Guild Leader will promote you to the highest rank due to all your awsome DPS and utility you bring, dream that little dream baby!           
---

Or...

Harbor that resentment, fester a deep hatred for everyone for 2 years and when they release Classic TBC lay waste to everyone as some kind of astral 5th horseman of the apocalypse "Oh my Mana wasnt good enough!?" Melts shadow priests face with Lunar Strike! "I dont offer viable CC!?" spam Wrath like some weird chicken gatling gun into the fleeing Mages and [scream constantly at your monitor](https://youtu.be/_1n1tHWgf2g?t=116)                 
---
               
---
... You know, either or?
---
It's going to depend on the server and guild community. If you're looking to do progression raiding (IE: AQ40+) yeah, you're probably going to have to play your optimal spec.. but MC, ZG, AQ20, and to even some argument BWL can be cleared with far less than optimal setups. Pugging is very likely not on the table unless you're well geared, but when Phase 2 rolls around and servers likely end up with a much smaller server caps than people are used to on 'fresh' private servers, then a lot of guilds are likely going to just be happy to get 40 people together. 
---
In the end though, the best advice anyone can give is roll the class, not the spec. Even if you're adamant on wanting to play, say, Enhancement.. You're going to get situations where you simply can't (IE: Ragnaros and not being able to have people with mana in melee range of him). 
---
So as long as you can enjoy your whole class, when it's necessary, you'll be fine. That's not to say you'll be unable to play the spec you want the majority of the time.. Just remember even pure DPS have to change specs depending on various factors (IE: Mages having to go frost for MC).
---
1a. short answer: you do not want to use aimed shot immediatly after it comes of cooldown since it would clip (a.k.a interrupt/prevent) an auto shot because you started casting the aimed. Instead you want to wait for the auto shot to happen and THEN start aimed.
---
1b. Theoretically yes, but it does not matter. BWL crossbow -&gt; Nax later down the road. rule of thumb: slower is better. 
---
Example of why:
---
Slowbow: 100 dps, 3.2 attack speed   
---
vs
---
Fastgun: 100 dps, 1.5 attack speed.
---
When you cast aimed shot for 3s with *Fastgun*, you will miss out on 2 auto shots compared to none of *Slowbow*, since it would not have shot during the cast time anyway. 
---
However weapon dps also plays a role. 
---
1c: Non elite endgame farming: mobs will die long before serpent had a chance to fully deal its - mediocre to begin with - damage. Hard pass. Arcane is also not really strong endgame - better to used aimed.  during leveling it is more of a mana question. These abilities do bonus damage so when you have enough mana - use them.
---
One of my favorite pet macros:
---
/petattack
---
/petattack [target=exists,mouseover]
---
Your pet will attack your target - unless you have a different mob under your mouse cursor. Comes in pretty handy if you have added more than 1 mob and want the pet to start building agro on the second one without having to switch targets.
---
Pet abilities can stay on autocast  in pve- if they fix left to right prioritizing. Just make sure to turn growl off in dungeons so that it does not annoy the tank. PvP could be different (eg boar charge. You want to control when to use that 1s root).
---
4a: dont know of any list, as I just make what I personally need. But feign death + trap should be one of them. Depending on of feign death will work in raid boss fights you might also want to make a feign death+ unequip everything with durability to avoid repair costs.
---
Back in the Olden days people thought Paladins where better than shamans but in 2019 horde is better for raiding if you’re a top tier guild.
---
Plenty of guilds are going to be looking for mages because they are an essential part of classic wow. I know my guild is still looking for a few for ours for when we start leveling up and classic. We have posted our recruitment spam in the Classic wow guilds discord. That is a decent place to start.
---
Because in vanilla wow all the players are like low level grunts lore wise and in modern wow you play the role of a well established war hero
---
My original name was Dalaron...Yup. Didn't know about the city, just sounded neat. I've decided to make my "character name" my online handle so most people can recognize me who know me from other locations. But my Character will always be named Dal in my mind.
---
&gt; "evil incarnate" trope often doesn't have any substance. Its something retail suffers from badly imo. I mean how many times can you sav
---
Agreed - the defias storyline also reveals a lot about the current state of the Alliance: dire straits. While the Horde is waxing, the Alliance is waning and I think that is cool dynamic storywise.
---
Night Elves? The world tree was just destroyed along with most of the forests. Additionally with the world tree gone, night elves are no longer biologically immortal. Their new world tree is suffering from a strange corruption.
---
High Elves? Virtually extinct
---
Gnomes? Their ciivilization has been alsmot wiped out and now they are literal refugees.
---
Humans? Dalaran and Lordaeron are gone (as far as most know). Only the Kingdoms of Kul Tiras and Stormwind still stand. And Stormwind is kingless and being picked apart from within.
---
The Alliance is in a really bad spot. Meanwhile the Horde is gaining a foothold and increasing their power and presence. Very interesting storylines for players of both factions.
---
Okay? I hope you aren’t as boring in real life as you are on Reddit.
---
.... Do i smell Alabama?

I played from first week of bc to a few months into wotk. I so much wish I could return but currently don't own a working pc. I'm very happy a lot of people will enjoy the best game ever again

No ball sacrifice required, simple procedure that can actually be easily undone. [Snip snap snip snap](https://giphy.com/gifs/idea-person-vasectomies-hdra3g4bm6fAY)

dodge is a double edged sword for tanks, becouse the hit you dodge dosent get you any rage

Lol sounds like someone was mad about swapping to human for the racial
---
30 sec dot from dagger sucks hard imo
---
I don't consider layering to be a problem.
---
Catch you later Hyrule. I'll be gone Albion, I'm no longer your fool.
---
Cinematic Nightfall looks pretty lame
---
Every slot what what I can remember, I may be wrong...
---
Just make sure kids are yours first
---
Probably, unless you find a good group of bros and fund your own Nightfall.
---
Blizzard please give us a time machine, is it too much to ask about?
---
In that case , how come you didn’t go female troll?
---
I think its a very well crafted dungeon. However what really makes it one of the best imo is the fact you literally spend levels 3-17 fighting the Defias and learning what theyre about. You go from dealing with these seemingly small time bandits harassing a grape vineyard... to finding out they're using every mine in Elywnn and Westfall to supply the creation of a "super weapon" to destroy Stormwind. 
---
The dungeon means something beyond "kill bad guy XXX".
---
Plus you can have it reversed if you go for a clamp rather than a snip.
---
Stripping on the mailbox in IF for gold, best racial ever.
---
10 druid WSG!
---
&gt; Well this is exactly the sort of thing layering is designed to fix. Spun up virtual servers when the demand is too high.
---
Right but their current outlined implementation doesn't take into account per-zone population.
---
So the starter zones are completely at the mercy of the player's chosen faction and race.
---
I just feel like if they're creating this system anyway, why not add a load-balancing measure for the starter zones?
---
No, they still work. The tube from your balls to the cannon is simply severed. Most of your ejaculate is not made up of sperm - that’s less than 5% of it. The sperm you still make simply gets absorbed back into your body as it has no place to go!
---
Ask prior to starting. If something is BIS for a hunter, yeah they probably should get a chance to roll on it even if its just a stat stick. That said I'm sure its up for some debate. 
---
If a hunter shouldn't roll on a Blastershot cause its a melee's BIS and not best for a hunter, same should go for non-BIS stat heavy weapons for them. 
---
I would however concede to any other classes opinion on the matter if it will be an issue. If its a 5 man just find a better loot balanced group, a mage wont care about a sword.
---
You shouldn’t get to report something just because you don’t find it to be a problem you entitled fuck hahaha holy shit you had to have grown up with mommy’s spoon in your mouth
---
SM + aimed shot used to be the shit
---
Fuck the haters, enjoy Dual Wielding.
---
Not sure how many people remember this, but the boss was Lord Kazzak who spawned once a week in the Blasted Lands.
---
He had a massive AoE ability that did tons of damage, and healed him to nearly full health if anyone died from it.
---
Some Horde guild trained this bastard into Stormwind allowing him to feast on a virtually limitless supply of one-shottable noob characters, essentially making him unkillable.
---
IIRC, the devs had to temporarily shut the server down and despawn him as there was no other way to fix this.
---
Fuck those neckbeards!
---
Combat is the way to go you dont have to stealth much as a rogue it just wastes time you can just run up and start spamming sinister strike and be fine keep slice and dice up and boom you're 60
---
Nope.  You have to feign.  And hope your pet doesn't get you into combat or that you don't get hit by anything while feigning.
---
Could be more clear but doesn't need to be as anyone with half a brain knew what was going on.
---
That actually sounds pretty reasonable, especially since you get gold from goldmines in all three Warcraft games.
---
The one who puts duels against keyboard turner mages in his videos?
---
Unless you plan on going super hard in PVP as shadow i wouldn't worry about going undead over troll. Trolls their own shadow buff they put on themselves that is pretty awesome. And as previously stated berserking is pretty fucking sweet. Just play what you want to play, you aren't going alliance so no one is going to yell at you for not being a Dwarf and not having fear ward.
---
Playing a Night Elf first is what kept me in the game. Totally in awe of Teldrassil and Darnassus. I can’t wait to roll a Night Elf hunter again :)
---
I don't report it because I don't see it as a problem.  I report it because 10 people post the exact same thing in the same day.  That's duplicate posts, and as of four days ago, was a report option.
---
Even worse.  Out of combat resser
---
As if any warrior of any spec ever has a hard time getting a dungeon group. An arms warrior is a better tank AND dps in most dungeons while leveling. Holding aggro is the hard part, not surviving. Sweeping strikes and other dmg talents  are helpful there! Also 5 parry is alot better than 10 defense.
---
Just kill the basilisks skin them bank the skins in gadget and continue till the bank is full then go AH it all
---
And it’s not a report option anymore because the mods want posts like mine. Get mad all you want pal
---
that said, this is making me wonder if I should get my balls cut out on launch week
---
Because that would be sharding.  They're doing layering, which is sharding on a complete-server scale.  Instead of getting a little shard, you get the whole world.  It's the same thing.  All they do is give you an entire virtual server instead of a virtual zone.
---
Stoneform is the strongest PvP racial in the game imo. But from a game play perspective, shadow meld is more fun than stoneform. There are so many ways to be creative with shadowmeld, it adds alot different options to play your class that other races do not have.
---
Saving for after work.
---
Aka. the good ol' days
---
There is something called water fasting.
---
Some people do a water fast and some of them drink something the creator called "snake juice". There are like 5 versions of it. Some are water mixes with added nutrients and such, one is piss.
---
Sooo, if you don't want to move and lose like 10lbs/5kg per week, go for it. 🙈
---
Handling each layer takes the same computing power as handling a separate server, so it is not being done to save money at all. Blizzard knows there will be a ton of people that play at classic launch that will not stick around long term and layering is a way of handling this. Its a lot like semi-merging servers ahead of time rather than having tons of different servers and having to deal with all the problems that come from merges later.
---
Now all you need is a catheter.

ohno

As someone who has tried to do this on many private servers. Warrior keeps sucking me back like a bad plague. The only caster that was decently fun was a warlock. I played a hunter on ND and i quit raiding because it was so boring. I made a warrior got it back to 60 and tanked through KT on it. And now i am going back to warrior again because warrior is just bae. I wish you the best of luck my friend, but sometimes don't abandon your roots for a main, and just make an alt for fun. Or run a mage to 60 first then level the warrior so you can feed it awesome gear and such with the ability to farm gold really easily.
---
dont add him otherwise you'll never get to play it after calling in sick tho
---
You and me both, buddy. Except I'll be playing Alliance.
---
Imagine calling moving vs standing still a "marginal advantage". Have you played world of warcraft?
---
The worlds longest fast was 382 days. He lost like 300 pounds. 
---
Immagine how much money you'd save if you didnt eat for over a year.
---
This, you want 5% hit, riposte and bladeflurry talents as fast as possible
---
Just pretend any moisture/precipitation is caused by a resto shaman just off-camera.  All that frost on Saurfang Jr?  *Clearly* left over from a Healing Rain in frigid Northrend temperatures.

Well they are gonna get a chance to play again and see what they missed on August 27th. 
---
Anybody going back to college on the 27th?
---
This is a story from TBC, me on a Paladin and a Hunter that would gank me.  This was his strategy:
---
1. If I attack him instead of his pet, he just maintains distance with Aspect of the Cheetah.  With 0 ranged abilities (especially as Ret), I had no way to catch him.  I had Pursuit of Justice, but Cheetah is faster.  He wouldn't even attack me, just have his pet attack me.  If I stopped to heal, he would stop and shoot.
---
2. If I attack his pet instead of him, he'd just run until his pet despawned, Call Pet and come back.  Call Pet would also heal his pet to full, and he'd be full force with no mana or downtime spent.
---
There was literally nothing I could do.  He just kept harassing me until I died.
---
That is such an over dramatization.  Without them it just makes you sit there and stare at your screen for 10 or 20 minutes waiting on morons to get there.  Theres no "social experience".  So I guess warlocks destroy the experience too?
---
I guess it all boils down to chipping away at identity, whether player identity or class identity.  With dual spec you're no longer "that awesome dps" or "that healer who saved me that one time."  Summoning stones hit warlocks pretty hard.  I used to hang out in BRM instances before raids so I could pop out and help the warlocks farm soul shards to do summons.  Why bother farming soul shards anymore?  You'll get enough on trash mobs in raids to handle the few people who are late or swap in and out.
---
These may seem like mere pebbles on the slippery slope, but I don't think they are insignificant.
---
In a group setting yes, but most world PvP is going to be 1v1.
---
i mean its basically a lose lose for asmon. The dude literally said he is rolling pve server to avoid being stream sniped and camped then gets shit on and harassed to roll on a pvp server. Then people flip out and tell him to not stream if he doesnt want to get sniped and camped.
---
But don't pull two mobs before bf or you ded
---
You do realize with your childish rants you have undermined your entire opinion. Keep calling people names and threatening to leave that is a proven tactic to win friends and arguments. Truthfully mostly just projection when you call other people pathetic and losers. So bye-bye loser.
---
No idea my man but there are various fights in those videos that aren't against mages and you haven't really said anything about why I am wrong.
---
Yes? Mostly we go dick around in wpvp or level alts, that's correct. Elitist casuals infest this sub and it's hilarious to watch you flail about.
---
If there's no dungeon finder then it's not so easy to just find a new group
---
A good Paladin will never be in range of a hunter to counter them.  And the hunter doesn't even need to be good.
---
I played mostly alliance during retail but I’ll be rolling horde this time around.  Looking forward to it
---
Oh yes...
---
Did someone say.. soda POOPIN?
---
OMEGALUL
---
Server: Bonechewer
---
Faction: Alliance
---
Guild: Damage Corp
---
Main: Human Warrior - Shinex
---
I remember that Vis Maior (VM) was the top guild on the server and my guild had a very heated rivalry with Cry Havoc on the Horde side. I also remember helping Megaphone reach rank 14, the only member of our guild to do so. Our guild still has a facebook group, so there may be a rebirth. Either way I can't wait for classic to go live.
---
It isn’t always designed to be actually used by players... the original vanilla designers knew that only very small percentages of the playerbase would get to see some of those end game raids. They put much more time into the things everyone was gonna use and see (classes, starting zones, etc). Now it’s the opposite and there’s tons of reasons for that, but it’s ultimately unwise.
---
Imagine having the foresight to not make unnecessary children in a world that's already overpopulated. Imagine having the willpower to not let instincts and hormones dictate my life choices. If I want to raise kids I'll do what decent humans do and adopt one.
---
I'm having the exact same issue, reinstalled firefox. I'm on a 2700x and 2070 both of which are under 6mo old so it's no slouch of a machine either...
---
The Silithids on the opposite side are pretty good to farm as well.
---
The problem is how easy it is for something to counter that Feign.
---
I really hate this quest line, but I will complete it for the experience.
---
For leveling
---
Thank you for taking the time to test this.
---
Get that axe that causes the spell armour debuff (I think it’s called nightfall) and you could make the argument that you can give totems to melee and increase raid dps with the debuff
---
100% these people have no clue and if they cannot handle layering there is no way they could tolerate non layered starting zones, 7 hour queues, etc. 
---
They prove themselves likely not to be people who can handle vanilla in the first place.
---
I made the best friends back in vanilla, sadly only one of them stuck around.  
---
I was Aseir on Aszune (EU) where I had my own guild called Exalted Legacy. It wasn't a large guild, but we managed to get some really competent people in it (one of them being the best holy priest on the server, called Harmony). As such, we managed to make a deal with one of the server first racing guilds on the server, to play with them. Eventually I stopped playing there, and the core people from my guild went over to Righteous (later named Sora).
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say the class wasn't complete at that point.
---
yours?  
---
and either way shit happens in life, you might want more later in life, with another woman possibly  
---
not like persuade you or anything
---
But the melee weapon is a stat stick so you still equip both until BWL gear I think.
---
A true brojito - name checks out
---
Now you need to fit a flatscreen in an old tube monitor case to be complete!
---
Mmmmm. Not really. Theres always a group spam in world. If you are lookong for targeted BIS at 60 shouldnt be a problem. You also have a lot of other things you can do while looking for a group that would be better than  doing a run that disallows you from the 1 thing you're looking for.
---
That's awesome that you've kept the relationships going
---
Dude, I get that it can be hard as a retail player to understand what the consequences of layering will mean for classic, but it’s obvious you don’t have any clue what the issues are if you think the resource argument is the only problem.
---
You do realize I don’t care? This dudes low effort retorts in an effort to defend a currently broken system  made by a company that is floundering due to terrible quality assurance is equally as pathetic. If that makes me childish by calling him exactly what he is then people like that are going to keep preventing genuine discussion and debate on this subreddit.
---
#WARNING: #FUCKIN' #LOUD
---
I considered leveling a Mage first as an alt and then having the Warrior as my main after the mage feeds him great gear to level in.
---
Maybe fun, I've always only leveled Warriors by scratch.
---
There is a zeppelin from Tirisfal to Grom'Gol...
---
Ok loser.
---
They'll calm down after a juice box and a nap.
---
&gt; They called it the “annual pass”, and it caused a huge shit storm because it was supposed to guarantee beta access **when the beta opened up**,
---
well, no. [*Over the course of the test, we’ll be inviting Annual Pass holders, press, fansites, friends and family, and opt-in beta testers to participate*](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/10009614/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria-beta-live). all the betas had wave invites, why should this be any different?
---
while it is true that mop did not sell as good as the previous exp., that's hardly a beta issue. generally the sales carry the effect of the last expansion and that being cataclysm, it was expected.
---
there was no disaster except for what?! some tabloids portraying it so?
---
&gt; The idea of paid beta access just sets a bad precedent because Blizzard could charge whatever premium they wanted (and they did) for what would really amount to “early access” for a lot of people.
---
they didn't charge anything. they just asked you to pay your subscription. you "signed into an agreement" that you will keep your subscription for 1 year. if you somehow missed a payment you were losing access to diablo. so you could actually get diablo for free, play for a few months and then get rid of it when you decide to take a break. that's a shit marketing move because you're giving the customer the time to get bored with the product FOR FREE.
---
&gt; Smaller, more concentrated and easily maintainable and observable betas are just a much better idea.
---
right, that's why they fucked it all up in bfa and just delete the beta forum bugs they didn't fix. because they applied this almost *surgical* tactical approach.
---
XD
---
Can you recall what the general range of copper/silver looted from pickpocket was from these mobs? Based on your gold earned it definitely looks like it would be lower than on pservers
---
Protip: If your spirit is high enough in game you don't actually have to eat out of game

Retail shadowmeld is the wotlk behavior tho, which is a vanish. Pre-wotlk it is just a stealth  mechanic. And afaik stealth in pre wotlk doesnt disjoint projectiles.

Well the person saying crit is bad for druid healing, knows jack shit. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0xcMxsZZxtckxq is a good crit build and really mana efficient. Go to the druid discord for more info i guess
---
Maybe for top teir but Blessing of Salvation helps ALOT in the early levels and less hardcore guilds.
---
1. I don't play retail.
---
2.  You haven't actually stated anything other than resource issues.  
---
There have literally been zero non-resource arguments other than "when I telepathically invite someone clear across the world to a group (which has been a thing since forever) ... it breaks my immersion when a different set of mobs spawn in!"  Right, so talking telepathically to people doesn't break your immersion, but some mobs appearing does.
---
I get where you're coming from, but you could really do with being less of an asshole about it.
---
This guy is so disingenuous and acts way over the top it becomes silly.   If you used to watch him since the p.server days you'll understand.
---
The lest several years, players went from unknown with the faction, to becoming the "champions" in WOTLK, the General of the expeditionary forces to Dreanor, then literally the most powerful and class leader, chosen to wield the best and most iconic gear..  In short in classic, you get to cut your teeth and prove your worth, rather then be called "Heroes" from day 1.
---
Will be interesting to see how this is all affected by things like Discord, YT, Twitch, etc.
---
You mentioning the bounty of the rogue reminded me of a [Video by Ciderhelm of Tankspot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf1pWQhJdhQ) Excerpt from video:
---
 "In our guild, we like to kill our warlock wherever possible" (at 6:08 in video)
---
... Description of how druid tank used shadowmeld during Sartharion with drakes up fight to cause Sartharion to turn and attack warlock to hopefully kill warlock....
---
 "The only downside was that the warlock used Soul Shatter." (at  6:43 in video)
---
Oh nice Undead Mage
---
Waitwaitwait, honest question: are Truefaith Vestments and Robe of the Void BoP? That means you HAVE to run tailoring to get these then, right?
---
For those who decide to stream snipe, don't get all butt hurt when that streamers fan Bois corpse camp you until you rage and log off.
---
I read all of it and it was amazing man, thank you for the insight.
---
Story, or the EXP? Cause its an epic story.. but the exp having to run all over 5 zones, is probably better skipped tbh
---
Whys this sub so toxic, just asking a question lol
---
The irony here is that without the streamers, they wouldn't be nearly as well-known or interesting.
---
It's a symbiotic relationship. The yooga, streamers get ooga'd, everybody has a good time.
---
Depends... do you collect parrots?
---
Shadowmeld allows rogues and druids to eat/drink while stealthed. Secondly shadowmeld includes a passive effect that increases the stealth level of rogues and Druid by 1.
---
 I watched a Gnome crawl along the edge of a straight razor. That's my dream; that's my nightmare. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor... and surviving.

Can't you just use judgement of wisdom to get your mana back?
---
These are great, I've been keeping up with all the maps you've been making and I really love the effort you've been putting in them. It's what's gotten me interested in "Classic+" content in the ye olde Classic style, more adventuring in Azeroth and following up on some plot hooks left behind without the strict restraints of an expansion theme.
---
The race should have really been called forsaken, not undead.
---
&lt; And Stormwind is kingless and being picked apart from within.
---
Who could be responsible for such a thing!
---
But yeah i do think its an interesting and necessary dynamic. The horde during the time of Vanilla are what, 7 years old, or something like that. Practically brand new. The Alliance needed these sorts of internal struggles to balance it out, but it doesnt feel forced at all. In fact its resulted in some of the best characters/storylines in the lore.
---
What the fuck is this fucking website.
---
Alfougin the Dwarf Paladin, of course.  This time however I will be going holy through Naxx, instead of Protection through AQ40.
---
Split screen games are a whole other story. Livestreaming is third party activity. It's not built into most games. Vanilla WoW was not designed with streaming in mind, therefore the player should never be held accountable for "stream sniping".
---
True but it's a fun goal. I've seen it drop three times, one in vanilla and twice in BC. I got it in vanilla on my Undead Warlock.
---
30 yrs is a long time to wait for a rematch
---
yeah but that isn't something that you need to do after every single piece of gear, its supposed to be an on the fly kind of thing so you can make a decision before that loot timer runs out.
---
Aye captain!
---
The story is epic yeah. Fully agree.
---
However I'm gonna main priest so grinding will be limited. Therefore I'm forced into major questlines.

Mace spec doesn't DR with CS or KS, since controlled and proc stuns are on different DR windows (and KS on its own).

Hahaha, joke's on you, many of us have switched to horde for immunity, good luck recruiting :&gt;
---
Little late to the party - I was one of the guild charter signers for Who is John Galt. Went with Fayenoor and Akhanj. Looking to play again in Classic
---
That's a really good point. My only grip with rolling Orc is that I don't like the Horde capital cities. I love IF and SW so much.
---
Horde is amazing too. I'll roll both, but Alliance first 😎
---
Ya but if we’re talking hard core pvp grinding bgs for rank then I’d assume they know the tricks
---
Just let them play the game, why defend trash like a steam sniper? What filth and scum like that deserve your sympathy, Lmao.
---
been eating stealthed on the beta
---
on bosses? Worth it.

leveling / overgeared - defiantly not worth.

So at best 8.5 Gold per hour ? 
---
Seems too low to be competitive with just killing mobs, I think 15 gold per hour is doable at this lvl.
---
Thanks for doing the test, appreciated.
---
You'll be playing one of the most fun classes in the game and look good at the same time, haha loser
---
Love it
---
I agree with having content not everyone can do as an aspiration/motivator, though I think a better way to accomplish the mystique angle is to do unscripted dev events every couple months or so. Community events always make for the best stories, even to those who completely missed them.
---
My point of contention with raids has always been that's where Blizz stuffs all the juiciest lore content in the game. Which makes a degree of sense from a design and story telling perspective, but it's frustrating when one considers most raiders are there for the challenge and aren't really bothered about the lore. Meanwhile your average lore nerd tends more toward the casual end of things, or at least doesn't often have much interest in raiding. That's my experience, anyway.
---
Ideally, I'd put all the really significant lore content in dungeons, maybe 10-man raids that are more easily accessible, while still keeping the big, challenging raids (and the rewards commensurate for meeting that challenge) as a separate thing.
---
Prove it lol
---
Kewl
---
I agree,  this version of classic will be significantly easier, especially raiding then it was originally.
---
Troll is more universal and probably better for Healing spec.
---
Undead is more PvP focused.
---
TIL OP likes the taste of wiener in their mouth.
---
I've leveled a Warrior before, though it was in TBC and not vanilla and I did so in Arms spec, and found no need to kite. I value your input, especially on the numbers, but I just feel like Hamstring kiting is one of those private server tryhard things that nobody cared about until post-Nostalrius. That said, I suspect it will work at least to a degree in Classic, though I wouldn't count on it being precisely the same as on private servers.
---
Anyway, in your other post you said this:
---
&gt;But you reduce that dmg with armor, so you get less rage per from the mob. So you do less damage because you have less rage.
---
Are you sure that's how it works? I know you still get rage for dodging attacks, attacks that get absorbed, blocking etc., so I was always under the impression that rage from incoming attacks is based on the damage you would have received before mitigation or something.
---
I joined a guild that was posting in the weekly recruiting forum because their stated intent (semi hard core) and raid days fit my future schedule. I'll decide whether or not they fit my needs as we are leveling up and beginning to raid. If they turn out to be unreliable or bad at the game then I will take my talents elsewhere. I plan to approach it from the perspective of 'why should I join your raid group?' rather than 'do you have any open spots?'. To do that you'll need decent gear and decent skill. I think those two things can be identified in pug 5 mans pug ubrs raids. I hope to be getting whispers from various raiding guilds based on my performance in pugs. 
---
Not sure if this strategy will work for you, but give it some thought. While dps may be a dime a dozen as opposed to healers and tanks, really good dps still stand out like shiny diamonds. Just like a talented hunter is a sight to behold despite the common pejorative "huntard".
---
this is assumed, you are all assuming this will happen. 
---
and IF it happened, combine the damn servers... 
---
but blizzard listens to their dumb ass players so they will listen to the dumb ass players on this one too. then the dumb ass players will blame blizzard again. 
---
as usual devs and players over complicate another dumb issue.
---
Good for you - you don't hit endgame until you chain 10 flips.
---
I think I'm thinking of druids actually. Cant eat while prowling.
---
How naive are people to not understand that streamers or any other personalities are constantly playing it up and acting as an exaggerated version of theirself.
---
Negative. It's a click heal support addon. Instead of mouse over macros and all that it just simplifies healing by binding to your mouse and allowing you to heal by clicking. Like Grid.
---
NO HAIR THOT
---
GJ Yor, us chieftains will be following your lead!

Yes, mine.  I have a great marriage and 3 kids.  Even if something bad was to happen, I wouldn't want any more kids, 3 is enough.
---
Who doesn’t love a good brat???
---
Oh man, I'm playing pally in the Beta. So I'm doing all the nonsence quests too, so I hear ya.  Though, I thought I remembered Disc being pretty efficient, SWPain, and wands ftw with MB on CD.
---
+1. People are just letting their feelings and intuition get in the way. "Why can a seemingly worse item be better? *REEE*". It's funny, people talk about how much better Classic is because of the itemization system and how ilvl in modern WoW is the bane of the game because "you just equip the best thing" (which isn't even true because stat priorities exist) and yet turn around and starting going nuts when an item with lower ilvl is better than a better with higher ilvl in Classic.
---
Let's get him boys.
---
Yeah I cannot wait the game is where I belong!
---
That was my position as well.  I played exclusively DPS classes during retail vanilla/TBC and quit early in Wrath.  When I found private servers a few years ago I wanted to try something new so I decided to play a priest.  I enjoyed it so much that I've stuck with it for 3 straight pservers and plan to do it again on classic.
---
real life tip: meal prep the week before classic so you don't waste time cooking
---
Ironforge is the best. Honestly, if my buds weren't dead set on horde I would be rolling Gnome Rogue.
---
One of them should be Karen
---
I thought the onion was supposed to be satire/fake news?
---
I am tired of being called a huntard.  I need some witty comebacks that are applicable to each class.

You hit Strangethorn Tiger for 72

Stranglethorn Tiger hits you for 51

Hey guys,
---
Like many of you, we were very impressed by u/Conpatshe 's IronForge painting and we wanted to have a print for our office. We reached out to him and he kindly sent us the high resolution version of it. We first asked if he would sell the prints but since it is FanArt, he isn't allowed to.
---
To support him a little we sent him a donation and asked for his permission to share this version with all of you, and once again he was nice enough to agree, so here it is!  
---
High Resolution File
---
PS: We are building a platform for PC Hardware and Keyboards enthusiast to buy and sell called kaido.io. We'd like to know what you guys think :)
---
cum and take it
---
Well then I'll start my blacklist with blackjack and hookers!
---
Don't worry, nobody will notice you among the other 50% of the server who are hunters.
---
What i don't get is how these people don't understand that if there are 4 layers of black lotus spawns there are 4 times (layers) of people both trying to gather them and use them. 
---
Its like 80% of these wow redditers don't get basic math. Hello 4 layers means 4 times the number of players. They imagine they will will hop to the 2nd or 3rd layer and it will be wide open and empty and they will have unlimited loot.
---
Because they don't camp, as far as I can tell.  In, gank, /lol, /o o g a, out
---
So what's the point in even having Classic WoW when private servers exist?
---
Any guild raiding with multiple enhancement shamans won't last very long...
---
“I’m going to jump!!”
---
“Do a flip!”
---
I missed these days.
---
“Be a team player, play the spec I tell you to play”
---
No thanks. People will bring dps shamans and dps rets. Not everyone is going to run 100% optimal world first comps.
---
&gt; People are in for a surprise when they realise 5x more people have that tidal charm, that 5x more people have broken tooth, 5x more arcane crystals
---
And there will be 5x the players to compensate?
---
They had to switch it up as apparently everyone else is now in on their game.
---
Yeah when you get a wand, Mind Blast, SW:P + wand. Then tab out 😎 When you come back, the mob is dead, loot, flash heal (or if you're really stingy Lesser Heal) and then repeat.
---
Extremely chill grinding.
---
...Is this what it’s like to be an Asian male?
---
Loved being a minion and running into characters more important than you, especially the characters connected to War1-3.
---
And then I shortly came back during WoD and suddenly I was the leader of a large Garrison with minions doing every bidding I wanted.
---
He speaks exactly like Asmongold.
---
Yea poison application talent is useful for PvP. Since there is no Shiv in Classic, every poison proc counts when it comes to Crippling.
---
And this is very true. I can't tell people how many hours I spent dancing... in moonglade.... in bearform with other druids. JUST DANCING! Sure there were some conversations but many times I was dancing with the other faction just hanging out and enjoying the scenery and talking to people.
---
It was a world you WANTED to be in, not one you felt compelled to because you need to.
---
Sea shanty playing in the background?
---
Let's be real. 50% of your server will be composed of rogues who roll their class to be cheap.
---
Retail can't be saved. They changed WoW into a different game the day TBC was released. All of these ban aid fixes blizzard adds to retail the reason the game is such a mess and why subscription numbers are so low.
---
As long as your guild is not some high tier progression guild you should be fine. As long as you know to not tunnel on DPS and remember you have a massive utility tool kit you should be fine. 
---
You doing 50 more DPS is less important than the rest of your Melee group each doing 50 DPS more. If you come into it with a support mentality you will be way better off. Don’t expect to top charts.
---
Imo, upgrades are upgrades. If it's a better upgrade is a bit subjective. Just be aware that melee weapon damage and weapon procs do absolutely nothing for hunters, so when looking for melee weapons the stats are all that matter. Look up stat weights if you want to be super granular in your decision making. So things like Ravager https://www.wowhead.com/item=7717/ravager from scarlet monastery can be wielded by a hunter, but largely useless when a simple green with +1 agility is strictly better. Hunter melee weapons were known as "stat sticks" for a reason. Also typically dual wielding weapons results in more stats. Especially with enchants. All weapons are pretty sought after and unfortunately a lot of the best warrior/rogue weapons are also very good for hunter. 
---
Ranged weapons are different. Generally the slower the better. Aimed shot damage is calculated by weapon damage and typically slower weapons have a higher range in damage. This gets a little more  complicated because you cannot auto attack while casting aimed shot, so to get the most damage you want a weapon that is slower than 3.0 speed. Of course that's just if you are worried about meters and min maxing. I just mention this because if you get a ranged weapon "upgrade" sometimes you might actually do less damage because the "upgrade" weapon is faster thus you clip your auto shots and lose out on damage... 
---
You can always use Google if you wanna learn more I suppose. Sorry for the long post. I'm bored at work lol! Hunter, contrary to popular belief, is much more nuanced than people realize. Hope I helped!
---

There was a really famous PvP duo, a night elf warrior called Pakmin and a pally, I think human. They did a lot of open world PvP, was pretty cool tbh. Pakmin often stealthed in the plaguelands near roads to charge some people.
---
I was famous, too! Well, not for an exactly good reason: people talked about me, the tauren warrior who was leveling insanely slow. Saw it in the trade chat.
---
That beard 1/10
---
These people are in for a rude awakening if they think the non viable specs will easily get raid spots
---
prove... that I can generate a dozen of low-res image with mob name randomly splattered over it?
---
Sorry dad never threw the ball with you
---
I'll try to. It's not a common name, but it's also not something that only I would think of, so I hope I'll be able to reserve it.
---
I feel like I can't betray alliance but at the same time - undead priest for phase 2 open world demolishing is very fucking appealing.
---
I'm still running
---
No because I didn’t play in vanilla. However I will name some of my characters as I had in tbc
---
"Be a team player, play the spec the team benefits the most from."
---
Counting on the rest to follow the meta just so Dipshit McDouche can meme around and not carry his own weight is not being a team player.
---
Keep clearing them to get the gear.
---
Gotta say I'm jealous you actually got to be a paladin tank in Vanilla.  I put together a defense set for tanking, but my guild wasn't having any of it, would slow down progression.  The best I got to do was Mind Control for Razorgore, because you get almost infinite threat when MC breaks, for the final phase.  I was too much an asset as holy.  Regardless, dwarf paladins unite!
---
That leaves 0% left for anyone other classes.
---
I guess I can use mend pet on my bear.
---

But the one who are playing because they legit love Classic, yeah, they're loving it.
---
your general attitude about M+? being unable to form a coherent , logical argument?

I didn't think of the stealth part, nice LPT I will now roll a rogue
---
Soon bruda, along with Ulduar.
---
Start wearing it now for the full neckbeard no-life olfactory experience
---
Leaf quest will be in the game, pets are unique AKA go chase those rare elites.
---
If a player has 9 hrs on classic and 1 hr played on bfa for the month 90% of that monthly fee goes to the classic jar and 10% to bfa.
---
Not saying they should do it but the 'how' is pretty easy.
---
Sure hope they go to 50bso brd and others can get tested.
---
Would love to farm lbrs on a rogue :)
---
You’ll be even more impressed when I make mine without a beard...
---
I loved your other ones, but for some reason can't get into this one.  I think Uldum would work better as a raid rather than a zone.
---
Boi hes been getting glad titles since tbc and did really fucking good at the beta horde dueling tourney like 2 weeks ago

That is a pretty good spot. The gorillas in stv, 40-41 are pretty good for money as well. Gorilla hairs sell for 20s each and stack 5 times iirc.

It’s a video game. Why you gonna take it that serious?

You poor soul! 😂 I remember this dude on a private server who would always advertise his guild in a cringey weeb way... Every time we shift clicked his name, he was like 10 levels behind the curve
---
I get what you're after but I really suggest improved sinister strike first. But of course, do whatever feels right to you.
---
Haha, i just love this song :p but yes for sure
---
orc is probably the best race in the game.
---
Welcome home!
---
Wait, you're saying streamers who lie about playing vanilla (or were too young to really play) were invited for another reason besides free advertising? There's a 'simply-proof' for you.
---
Need more? How about (most) streamers clearly showing they don't know how to bug test and properly submit. More? They didn't initially invite Joana, who leveled over and over again to make leveling guides in vanilla (among others like him). Another one? They didn't miss any of the streamers with large followings.
---
Why don't you point out how he's wrong instead of "NUH-UH. NUH-UH."  - Saying something repeatedly and in caps doesn't make you right, especially when you're so clearly wrong.
---
And you didn't discredit anyone, don't worry.
---
*Then at least give BoW/BoS...*

When you roll on a hunter weapon and the pally gets upset, just tell them they gave you their blessing.

If you have intimidation stun then you can get a hefty viper sting off to chunk his mana, then use low rank stings for him to keep purging. Try to stay out of shock range and when he gets too close, FD trap, get distance and reopen.
---
Sounds like a bad idea. Westfall has some decent quests, but it’s if I can avoid it, I do. It’ll be great in a group, but solo it’s just terrible in Classic.
---
If the immersion issues aren’t even a little bit jarring to you, then it definitely won’t be easy to make you understand the implications. You probably haven’t played the original game, and so you’re excused for your opinions. It’s just sad that people like yourselves are ‘promoting’ this system, which is so far from what the original game was.

Lol what message? It's about meming and having fun. They're not some angry redditors trying to send a message to streamers.

What progression? All the raids are easy as fuck. You want to start farming them in Week 2 and then spend the next 3 months doing the same thing?

When my brother and me started playing. We didn't leave Mulgor till level 16 because we were afraid we would never be able to find our way home....

I mean to support the 2x per week raiding. If you were raiding 6 days per week it was a heeeeelllll of a lot more

you could just buy an account TBH

It is when you play a healer and realize most DPS don't avoid shit

I don’t own a pc either at the moment mate, I’m just setting aside some money every week to for a new set up. There’s still a couple of months left :)

I plan on bringing off meta players just not more than one per role.

The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few, or the one. Even if you do raid as hybrid DPS you will benefit the raid way more if you are focused on being a hybrid support than tunneling on SICK DEEPS BRUH!
---
Yup !
---
instead of hugging a pillar or some other sorth of LoS so that the would need to come to you. If you let him dictate the battle by running after him open field then you are playing right in his hands.
---
Besides, if the runs far enough away to have his pet despawn you should be able to get OOC and mount / eat/drink for a bit

As a healer for 12 years I can assure you most people are not that good.

STV? More like 29-08-19... this isn't retail mate!

The game is in the journey, my friend.

I played a couple months on a private server a while back as an undead priest and loved it.  So I’ll start with that but I’m sure I’ll check out the alliance also.
---
&gt;There was literally nothing I could do.
---
You want each raid night to take 4 hours instead of 2?
---
There’s nothing less “teamplayer” than “PLAY THE SPEC I SAY OR GET OUT!!!!”

That's just quality role play

how the hell does a hunter farm zg?
---
This is fucking epic. Not gonna lie.
---
How would this concept work with gear scaling? Wouldn’t it cause older zones to become desolate because of antiquated gear or would they keep the gear scaling the same for all the zones and just focus on storytelling?
---
New name. I have never leveled a mage in Vanilla so it’s gonna be all around a new experience.

I could! If i had known that feature existed. I have lots if saved posts but no comments.

You can use them as non-tailor. They are BoE - so you can still farm the materials, just need a tailor to make it.

When it comes from science, it has to be right.

No, you're breathtaking!
---
I was in a secondary raid within the Penny-Arcade Alliance.  They were already clearing AQ 40 when I got to MC.  I don’t want to say they carried me, because I did it well, but they had the skill and experience to accomodate me.
---
Hahaha that’s brilliant, to be young again eh?
---
My first ever character was a Tauren warrior and I remember getting the blue pvp cloak, because it looked cool and it was blue.. it was called “battle healers cloak” or something like that and had intellect and stamina
---
And all of the other awesome buffs!
---
OH FUCK. You reminded me of the BEST reason for NE characters. THEY FLIP WHEN THEY JUMP.

Lol damn.. My first hunter back in 2005 had a Crocolisk because I thought he looked the coolest.  Oops

I know where I am. I know where I was.  I... seem to have misplaced my drink.

The autoattack comments are not jokes. You do not have any attack button to press.
---
Holy shit, do you even know what respawning is?  It's literally a mob appearing from nowhere.

I'll wave from my NE Hunter, Warrior, Priest, and Druid.
---
Worst part about being a mage. When people you don't play with and aren't partied with start bugging you for stuff. Then get mad when you like... I'm not a charity. Nothing worse then logging in a BG just to be barraged by 14 people asking for food and drink. Correction 12 people and 2 rogues.
---
I'm just like. I already gave water to the healers. The rest of you can kill yourselves.

It may be a video game, but it's a video game you play with other people.

It's kinda like when someone is blasting their music on a train. Maybe it's an ok song, but everyone else doesn't need to be annoyed on their trip.

Your point being?

I´m not arguing against Eye for an Eye, i´m just saying that it´s no mitigation because most classes son´t decide whether they wanna crit you or not and even if they did, they probably wouldn´t decide against it.

Right! And Thrall or Velen talking to you like you're on their level. I mean, when I had a quest to go talk to thrall to turn in Burning Blade medallions as a little troll Shamy, I nearly jumped out of my chair with how cool he was.  Now, hes undeserving of Doomhammer and I'm supposed to be the man? common.. I don't like feeling like a mary sue.
---
Let’s be real though. Human males have a bigger stick in their booties.
---
How?! By making you corpserun? That's about as light as it gets.
---
Lets say you have 4.0 attack speed and you are fighing a mob that has a 2.0 attack speed. You will take double the damage if you don't hamstring kite. This is a fairly typical situation. Mobs have much faster attack speeds than 2.0 on private server at least.
---
Not if you’re in the raid with me.
---
Imagine trying to tell people how they need to play the game so you can spend less time playing the game.
---
Like, imagine rolling up to a DND group and suggesting ways to spend less time playing DND.
---
That's true.
---
I would do the easier quests in darkshore first and maybe go to westfall around level 14 or something
---
If you're playing priest (which I will be) I have one very simple advice for you: always keep running.
---
Keep track of where the players gunning for you are. Just keep running away from where you anticipate they will be.
---
This may seem like extremely pointless advice to give, but in vanilla just run speed is considered mobility. You have to keep moving always. Anticipate where your enemies will flank you and move to the advantageous position.
---
You're assuming there was a huge pillar nearby.
---
I was, Naxx 3 days, AQ40 2 days, and 1 day for MC/BWL (gotta get them thunderfuries dammit!)
---
... Jesus fucking christ...
---
There's nothing less "teamplayer" than "I WON'T PLAY THE SPEC THAT BENEFITS THE TEAM, IT'S ALL ABOUT *ME* AND WHAT *I* LIKE!!!!"
---
You’re really gonna be annoyed by having an enhanced shaman in your group? Yikes.
---
&gt; your other ones, but for some reason can't get into this one. I think Uldum would work better as a raid rather than a zone.
---
Your right, This is the first one I wouldn't actually want to be implemented. I've always hated the art style, lore and NPC's of Uldum
---
hahaha amazing
---
Because I'm a super serious man.
---
Ultimate transcendence mode: melee moonkin
---
I mean, they're not bad.  For the most part they'll be just as good as anything else with Bite (and Bite is better than Claw for tanking, because you always have focus for Growl).
---
They just have nothing to offer that another pet doesn't.
---
What aspects of classic wow are you even interested in? Why aren’t you just playing retail?
---
What do you mean, to be cheap?
---
Watch the streamer name not be available on all realms
---
Yea I call bullshit. Maybe normal dungeons lmao
---
[Your raid UI](https://imgur.com/wvAVR0S), enough said.
---
I played Alliance on Sylvanas EU, so Method was pretty famous - Sco, Zeuso, Rei, Pai, Sailog, Korlic, Noema. It helped that I had a couple of friends in the guild, so I remember quite a few names. There was an infamous photo on the Method forums of some players desk, with a conspicuously placed roll of toilet paper. 
---
We also had Vurtne the undead frost mage, and I remember an orc hunter called Outofcontrol who was a real terror.
---
Just take my money and rape me already. This is over.
---
I did... it said it would release with patch 1.12 but with elements from the earlier part of the game, thats why i asked. I figured i would ask, no harm done. But thanks for your input mate.
---
It's almost as though they're testing their first attempt at a temporary measure to make sure servers actually work on launch day.
---
That's hilarious. Another gem too from my brother. When he reached level 18 he discovered he could use his hunter pet to actually aggro the mobs and then, and hear me out because this gets complicated. You can actually have the pet tank the mob for you! 
---
We ran off to the forums to tell the whole server. We felt the same way Prometheus felt when he stole fire from the gods. Clearly everyone needed to know of this new discovery. Good times man, good times.
---
Same for me.
---
I've seen people steal it in the stress test so I'm hoping yo snag it on the 12th.
---
Please at least wash it during that week
---
Noce painting of grim batol mate ;)
---
How about everyone just shows up in some terrible spec and suddenly the raid takes several hours longer? Why is it only some guys who are allowed to play the shit specs? Where do you draw the line?
---
You don't know how to think in the abstract? Yikes.
---
Haha stone form hard counters 2 of your classes.... Oh wait we're talking NE hunter, never mind.
---
It's a reference to "That's the world of Warcraft that you play"
---
Same here, I'm betting we're getting jebaited like we got jebaited by seeing the beta realms whenever they were about to release the BGs
---
Most places where you quest/farm is some sort of LoS nearby. Also if there is no LoS....
---
&gt;Besides, if the runs far enough away to have his pet despawn you should be able to get **OOC and mount / eat/drink for a bit**
---
If you don't want to hamstring kite -  do this : Dual Wield and spam Improved Overpower procs. Dual wield increased miss will make you get so many overpower procs. Even that will be better than sitting behind a shield.
---
Rogues get this too. Every fucker in the city wants their lockboxes opened.
---
Because even if you had a raid with everyone playing the right spec you will still have issues. Stop acting like one Ret pally is gonna he the reason you can’t clear a raid.
---
Good luck to you and all the whispers, “hey do you have twitch, blah blah blah”
---
Melee moonkin. 
---
High armor items with moderate spell damage and a high dmg staff. 
---
Melee people while casting moonfire and using hots on yourself.
---
Same thing happened to me, we just got baited hard haha.
---
Same here. Probably for the stress test.
---
Lol not my sticker just one of the carts at work
---
AV Stress Test most likely - however the PLAY button is grayed out.
---
Yup, they just updated the catalog for the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) app to have it show up for everyone but not playable yet. :(
---
Or people can avoid elitists like yourself and play whatever they want to play.
---
Is there a flightpath in Camp Taurajo on retail?
---
I'll take this as you ceding the point to me,  because your argument was that things appearing from nowhere breaks the game for you, but you forgot about respawn.
---
Nothing layering does ruins Vanilla.  Literally no aspect of it.  
---
* AV
---
* Playing the old world.
---
* Leveling old classes.
---
* Old style talent trees and builds.
---
* Old quests
---
* Etc.
---
This. /cry
---
Hemo is not combat spec which is the point of this thread lol
---
Kinda surprised to hear this. Mostly because I've never asked Rogues for anything. My baseline assumption has always been. If your the type of person to play Rogue. You will also be the type of person to tell me to fuck off.
---
Batching was an interesting one. The original purpose was to help combat poor latency/connections to keep a better experience for players with poor connections. It technically still exists, but batches so much more often due to lower overall latency that it is nearly impossible to get some of the quirky interactions of the old system. 
---
These odd interactions would happen on extremely rare occasions during vanilla, but became well noticed on private servers with low latency. They did give a "good reason", it was the original 2004 design choice, and they are doing their best to stick to those decisions instead of using modern judgement.
---
Warriors get hamstring as one of tgeur first abilities for a reason. You want to just not use the cc given to you because you think its some try hard nostralius thing?
---
Yeah it just depends on your class. Most of the classes wear lots of tier gear for bis. Literally look at any other bis list lol. Warrior tank bis is mostly tier gear too. Contrary to what private servers tell you, dps  warriors weren't overly popular in vanilla. Even high end guilds usually only had a couple. Back then guilds were stacked with rogues, mages and hunters. Fury wasn't good until they got reworked later in the patch cycle so a lot of warrior players were just tanks. If you play fury you just have to be okay with looking like a mismatched scrub.
---
I like using riposte rather than eviscerate
---
Man, such a robotic approach to videogames.  Are you playing the game, or is the game playing you?  I mean... why so serious?
---
Not necessarily saying you are wrong, but you make it sounds like this is a job rather than entertainment.  And you only want to "play" with others that treat this like a second job.  Its just so... sad sounding.
---
Stoneform doesn't counter boomchicken.
---
Stoneform is my faction.
---
I had to download an addon just to auto-refuse all trade requests with non-friends and non-guildies to prevent people from fucking with my city chores.
---
Actually felt the pain
---
If there were queues in 2004-2006 when the playerbase was a fraction of what it is now...then it's doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to conclude that it's gonna be way worse this time around.
---
Shadow Priest and Rogue.
---
Goblin Sapper Charges, an engineering item.
---
I started playing during WotLK so I don't know if this counts. I can't remember the server or what name this person had. I, however, remember how much he/she was helping me out: 
---
In my early days I leveled  an undead priest. When I reached Stranglethorn Valley I've got ganked by 2 rogues and it was really frustrating for me. After my 4th resurrect at my body I encountered some random female gnome mage. 
---
She did say something to the rogues and they stopped ganking me and left. She then proceeded to help me out during my quests in Stranglethorn. The only way how we did communicate was only through emotes, but apparantly they were enough. I think without this friendly mage I would have quit (or at least would have switched to an PvE server).
---
I'm really sad that I never managed to thank this mage. The only thing I can do to honor her is to not attack an gnome mage at first sight. Ohh, and not to gank lowbies of course except they are rogues...
---
That is one of the strengths of Classic that you can gear up doing ZG, BWL, MC through using a combination of gear from them. The set bonuses that these raids provide allow for horizontal progression. I think it is possible to have a lot more raids that are T1 or T2 or T3 if they provide new looks and set bonuses that enable players to customize and player their characters in unique ways.
---
No :( I want to roll Alliance, largely for this. But unfortunately I can't seem to sway my friends who just want WoTF.
---
you actually can kill heal paladins? Even without scorpion?
---
Yeah same here, seemed like a 14mb update
---
Hemo for sure
---
It's pretty annoying actually and I downvote whenever I see it. Talking about stuff is fine but clearly he has an agenda and wants post Naxx funserver custom non-classic content. If Blizz goes that route instead of legacy expansions, it will be extremely disappointing.
---
Can you still buy the book or was it only for pledgers?
---
Just popped up on mine and updated.
---
Overall sure, but is it better than Tauren for ele shaman specifically?
---
Yeah I mean the actual ability, not useful as a rogue that I know of. The stealth boost exists, but it's minor. NE Rogues and Priests probably pay the highest price for their choice, out of any race/class combo. 
---
Still not the end of the world though.
---
I can't argue with that.
---
Good write up man. Enjoyed it
---
Yup just got it back as well, maybe it means access to the AV test but will have to wait and see.
---
Paladins used to have Crusader Strike in the original beta, but it was removed.
---
[Page from the official strategy guide that was written before crusader strike was removed](https://i.imgur.com/Qn5Iwho.jpg)
---
&gt;/u/Cyanomelas Staysafe is the worst
---
How so
---
I generally when doing strict PVP use MH crippling poison because i want to ensure that it gets applied.
---
Ahhh...I've been expecting you.
---
Server: Terenas US
---
Player: Smashdaddy
---
Faction: horde 
---
Guild: short bus
---
This tauren ran rampant in BGs with that hand of rag. I'll never forget trying to kill him on my nelf rogue but almost never being able to because of his pocket healers.
---
They're still locking/deleting as far as I can tell.
---
This is due to a [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) catalog change they just did [so it shows up for everyone with an account, whether or not it is playable](https://twitter.com/Marlamin/status/1139637041820516352).
---
That's the only acceptable class for a Male NE imo... so good job I guess
---
Troll huntah mastah race mon!
---
I'm sure the streamers are raging about their clips getting free exposure on reddit.
---
Spot on!
---
Dwarves are on the same faction as Night Elves.  They won't counter me.
---
Haha, what a clip. Ooga, ooga!
---
Indeed. Very refreshing and cool, but after the third one it kinda grew stale.
---
While I think the point of your thread is good, it comes off with a horrible tone. 
---
Yes, people should play classes, not specs. That doesn't suddenly mean someone HAS to main a specific spec. Just that they're comfortable playing their whole class. 
---
Someone shouldn't roll Ret for example if they truly dislike healing, but that doesn't mean they HAVE to heal the entire time they play.
---
&gt;  If you can heal. Expect to need to heal from time to time if not all the time.
---
&gt; if not all the time.
---
This is the part that clashes and is the reason we have to still bring this up 15 years later. Raiding isn't 'all the time'. Raiding is a part of the game, and yes, at a certain part it's a very large part.. but let's not start mixing PvE entirely as just raiding. 
---
A lot of 'sub-optimal' specs are far more useful when the debuff limit doesn't need to be considered. A lot of the community will either not raid, or only take part in entry level raids (MC, ZG, AQ20). 
---
What will be the specs you play the majority of your time depends on your goals and aspirations, and your ability to make gold for respecs.
---
It doesn't drop combat it just stops you from auto-attacking.
---
Looks right to me. Yours looks different?
---
It's funny that you mention it. This is exactly what I have done. My wife and I both don't want children and I finally decided to make the appointment and I had the week off for classic coming out. Their first available date to do the procedure just happened to fall perfectly on the morning of the 28th. Clearly it was fate for me to level while nursing myself back to health.
---
Server: Terenas (US) 
---
Faction: Alliance 
---
Nodomino: Rank14 Warrior and probable account sharer. If you saw this guy in your BG you would tell all your friends. He was a legend.  
---
Vinkinglord: NOT Vikinglord. Main Tank and badass with Thunderfury.  
---
Magicx: Belligerent Mage and my first GM. He led a bunch of useless scrublords to a full clear of MC at the tail end of Vanilla. I'm talking the ultimate server rejects. BC was about to come out and he decided he was gonna make a guild with the sole purpose of killing Ragnaros for all the baddies who had never raided. Got me into raiding and set me up for an amazing run in BC.
---
Did Staysafe buy the Asmon Twitch starter pack because he is even starting to speak like him.
---
Well you are only after the dolls and - if you are a herbalist - the herbs for bloodvine. 
---
So it is a combination of feign death and eye of the beast + dive/sprint to lure mobs away from the node you want to loot.
---
you can skip through this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iejd-gSEi2I) to get the general idea.
---
I already said that your opinions and arguments are excused due to lack of apparent experience, so I’m just trying to figure out what your deal is. The game you seem to want is already out, you should go play it - and stop trying to ruin classic for the rest of us. Thanks
---
The knee-jerking really let's me know who is low information.
---
Kudos.
---
Just be a nelf priest shadowmeld MC'ing fools off the cliff.
---
All I could find is on the first page Google gives,
---
*While comprised vastly of undead humans, the Forsaken are a diverse faction that include several different races at their biological core.*
---
Also, someone claims dwarf forsaken exist [here](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/7527663003).
---
For numbers, the lore is always blurry tbh. Since elves are close to immortal, they must breed very rarely, so perhaps their "empire" was/is indeed small.
---
My girlfriend and I will also be playing together, her being very new :p  
---
Im sure there are adventures and struggles ahead for both of us sir.  
---
Best of luck to you
---
how come i didnt get a bnet update? :&lt;
---
So, in other words, you want me to tell you that you are right because you are dying to win an argument over Internet?
---
Hey... who cares? :)
---
Please send... For research purposes
---
Yes, both continents, try and see for yourself, its free. Instanced content isn't affected by player numbers.
---
Second fucking bait...
---
Literally happened just now-stop toying with our emoitions like this Blizz
---
NotLikeThis
---
The distract+blink made me grin so hard.
---
I think 3x male nelfs would be the worst actually.
---
My guess is that there was some planned content that they never got around to, like many other things.
---
&gt;This weekend is going to be SO Pogchamp!
---
Someone euthanize me, please.
---
This just made me very sad.
---
I feel like this would make sense to get as many matches going as humanly possible, but I'm 100% wrong.
---
Optimal speed is 3.5 which doesn't exist. Slowest available is crossbow from BWL.
---
https://twitter.com/Marlamin/status/1139637041820516352
---
The point I am making is the meta is for sure now. I’m not saying don’t play the spec you want. I’m saying set proper expectations. You won’t top meters as Ret. You’re a hybrid class. You will be way more helpful to your team not tunneling for mad DEEPS.
---
&gt; You can't prove a negative. Your question is the equivalent of somebody getting in a car and driving away and then you turning around and asking people 'hOw dO YOu KnOw tHeY aRenT deAD?'
---
And you're requesting that people *ALWAYS* make sure people aren't dead, that's what so fucking dumb about it.
---
That was a great read thank you!
---
He's coming back, they are all coming back!!
---
1. The game I want isn't out.  
---
2. Nothing I've said I want is how retail works now.  
---
3.  My "lack of experience" is you not understanding me and has nothing to do with actual experience with WoW.
---
4.  Classic isn't "ruined" because they're adding layering.
---
5.  Your idea of what ruins the game already exists and is called 'respawning'.
---
6.  There is no actual limit to the number of things you can grind, so your other point is not an actual game ruining thing.
---
You haven't demonstrated anything that layering does that actually ruins the game.  Run along.
---
I didnt see this update, so I restarted bnet and no update.       
---
Decided to try restarting my comp and it just updated.
---
Jebaited 
---
Get wrecked
---
Because I'm weird and extremely opposed to paying for services and I'd never given them $0.01 beyond the subscription fee because of their exorbitant prices. I made a one-time exception when I decided to compete for world #1 DPS parses on my Mage but there was no way I was going to do it again. 
---
Fortunately in Cata and MoP there were many [appearance-changing tools](https://imgur.com/b6x9e3O) so it wasn't constantly miserable.
---
No... loot trading was discussed just as much as this, and it wasn’t banned. And we got progress because of it. If WoW forums and r/classicwow banned discussion around loot trading, we might not have arrived at the compromise we have today... which is why I think the decision to ban discussion on topics is dumb and harmful, even if it might clutter up the feed of STV memes.
---
same again we get Jebaited
---
&gt;Troll Shamans with a shield on (specially Zulian Defender) are the coolest-looking race/class combo of the entire game.
---
Wrong
---
Apparently even the snip can be reversed now - it's just not recommended to be thought of as non-permanent.
---
Do we really need 10 posts for the exact same thing?
---
It’s a drawing. So yes, it’s not a straight IG screenshot.
---
Good luck hitting 60 before october!
---
Sometimes I believe people come to internet to read what they want to read and then answer what they want to answer.
---
WHERE did I said A FUCKING BETA TESTING is bad for the game? WHERE the FUCK did I say that?
---
This isn't a [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) app update, just a change for the catalog which it retrieves every so often without showing any update dialog or something.
---
Noooo, why did you edit your post? Now mine isn't funny.
---
What good stuff? the loot is pretty mediocre in westfall. The main draw is that you get to do the leadin quests for deadmines (and the atmosphere, of course), but in terms of actual quest rewards?
---
There are no ranged weapons, whatsoever. There are 3 pieces of mail in the entire zone (barring deadmines). The potions, for some reason are minor potions, when you start getting lesser potions while you are still in elwynn. 
---
For hunters specifically? well, no ranged weapons, and one green piece of leather in the entire zone (and not very good cloaks) leads me to think it's probably bad. 
---
Really, You aren't missing anything of value. Personally, I would show up around 16, quest for 2 levels (which lets you do basically everything: 20 harvest watchers, a couple dozen boars, 12ish gnolls, 28 murlocs, and about 50-60 bandits, and half a dozen vultures), and then lead right into deadmines. (I don't know that it's actually ideal to even do deadmines, but I am certainly not gonna stop.).
---
How many hours are you going to spend farming flasks and consumables for that 2 hour raid?
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20070103090108/http://wow-loot.com/
---
Depends on gear. Once a pvp holy pally gets properly geared no, a hunter will never be able to kill them.
---
My advice as a former vanilla paladin. Play the "right" spec for a bit in the beginning. Establish yourself in your guild, build trust, be helpful, THEN MAKE THE SWITCH TO THE RIGHTEOUS SPEC! All the gear in MC sucks anyway. Really hybrid dps wasn't that viable until AQ and to a lesser extent ZG. Trying to make boomkin work in 5 man gear would be gross! Just play the raiding spec and build a dps set on the side. That's what being a hybrid is all about. If you want to dps play a rogue or something.
---
Hell yeah
---
200IQ Blizzard trolling...
---
I guess I don't see people falling behind as a problem.  IMO one of the benefits with Classic is that it's a marathon, not a sprint.  If you could even call it a race.  In Classic, I never saw levelling as a hurdle, more an experience.
---
It seems like people who got into stress test can play AV, but not sure so far
---
It really isn’t. Classic is one of the few xpacs where wpvp is prevalent. Shadowmeld is a lifesaver time and time again, at least if you play on PVP.
---
Get wrecked. Have fun playing in August.
---
There's still such a thing as hormone production lol. They aren't just dead weight, they just can't deliver sperm to the urinary tract.

Agreed please go on!
---
g o T o RE T a IL
---
This is actually a fucking great idea I've been meaning to do this and just took some time off from work i certainly don't need another child to neglect to play wow in the long term
---
&gt;Someone euthanize me, please.
---
Weirdchamp
---
I'm gonna be honest here ; that sounds to me like you shouldn't bother playing the game at all. It will take you months to reach 60 and even more to get gear in which you can actually compete. The progression won't stop and like people already mentioned, you will fall extremely far behind. Even without all that, a person who can barely afford to play \~2h or even less should take his time elsewhere for your own sake.
---
Same here... Blizzard pls ;_;
---
source
---
No, I'm just saying you should work off the most recent information rather than debunked old info that you failed to fact check before spouting off.
---
My dick got so hard when this popped up for me.
---
Sounds like a good band name.
---
The youth and I’s.
---
LDF/LFR get blamed for the social aspect far more than what really broke the camels back. Moving the capital city, the main gathering point for players, with each expansion. This separated people from each other and broke community. LFD came out in 3.3?, well past the point that the community fractured because of constantly being uprooted. Summoning stones 
---
Shat was the first one and it was a big change. Suddenly all those higher level players were just gone. They were where the portals were, easy access to trainers, auction houses, and banks. There separated by a level gated "gate". Sure you could get a portal to get there as low level but that was going to fix it.  
---
As for the game becoming easier. Sure it did, but only because there were a lot of stupid mechanics that came about because at the time WOW launched the big four were EQ, AC, DAOC, and UO, and so blizzard took a little from each to form their game.  WOW was called easy mode, theme park, and more. Yet the whole genre was moving forward like all games.  
---
Why should people accept mechanics best suited for single player games like long spawn timers, limited quest mobs, and such, when that got combined with hundreds of others all trying to share the same. That turned into a CSR nightmare and caused strife among the players so this as a developer is something you would aim to eliminate as best possible.  Better quest structure, more obvious quest sources, and more, were all about getting people the content. 
---
It still comes down to one thing, its a game. If its too easy then you can choose to restrict yourself in ways to give you the challenge you want but your wishes should never determine what another seems as enjoyment
---
You are the reason I want to avoid streamer servers.
---
I'm definitely not going to haha. Why does it have to be before then?
---
guess I have to hope for that 5k death ray crit then.  /s
---
Do you have any experience if the scorpion is a viable option in group pvp? 
---
downsides: sheep/trap are not usable against that target. 50% less pushback.
---
Upside: dispelling viper + maybe rogue slow is harder.
---
This was while I was leveling in Tanaris.
---
I still had a quest to accomplish.
---
Always buff when I can!
---
Yes but tech has come a long way too.
---
I’m sure there’s better choices of streams :)
---
I really hope they will get ganked so fucking hard on release that they can't fucking play anymore.
---
Never had a reason to quest in STV so no. This will not happen to me :)
---
I'm hoping I can be an enhance healer if it's at all possible. I want to go deep enough to get enhanced totems so the melee group will suck my cock.
---
IF they must- yes stay at 60 and add from there.
---
But they won't because why would they :)
---
I've heard warlock pets will unlearn some of their skills, so you have to repurchase the grimiores requiring tens if not hundreds of gold.
---
So pointing out that that hybrid specs are more effective playing as hybrids is elitist? K bud
---
Are we sure that stress testers won't have access to AV Weekend?
---
I didn't think westfall was bad. Plus deadmines! It has good gear for most classes too. I remember as an 18 warlock, myself and another 19 warlock were able to 2 man the whole thing and it was a ton of fun.
---
Why would he want to paint a bunch of mud huts? LOL
---
Go play with your sticks, savage.
---
I will do longer test after "av weekend is finnished"
---
I remember the Night Elf Hunter Shatuk on Magtheridon. He was my mortal enemy out farming the cultists in Silithus.
---
Much like how you can Blizzard a rogue out of stealth, whether or not you intended to.
---
I liked this cinematic (except the rogues being shit at being rogues) however this version is some how so much more wholesome
---
I guess you are the only one who got the point I was trying to make(probably my text was not well written), I am not trying to blame someone, I am just saying that a 3month closed public beta is actually bad for the game. and lets be honest this Beta is not about fixing the game, they could hire real beta tester, and not give the beta key to top streamers. They are using the beta as a promotion and I believe IN THIS CASE this is a mistake.
---
&gt;You are the reason I want to avoid streamer servers.
---
4weird
---
Seriously. The first few were cool. Posting something like fifteen of them in the last day is a bit excessive though.
---
Weren't those introduced in Cata?
---
Everytime I tuned into towellie pre beta he was shitting all over vanilla with the "you think you do, but you don't" rhetoric. Screw that guy, he's such a doucher.
---
Of course I'm being rude, he wrote a pro-layering post about why we need it and implied that if we don't we're wrong.
---
He didn't do his research, yet wrote a post trying to inform everyone?
---
So I'll ask you again, how do you know your facts are up to date?
---
Doesn't have to be, could take 8 months.
---
There was no layering in vanilla.  Layering is a sweeping gameplay change both for competition, social interaction, and immersion.
---
Not quite. The idea was specifically for one youtube channel.
---
If you have ever heard of TGNwow from the old days, that was the goal, as stated in the OP.
---
that’s exactly why i will go STV
---
Lolol 1 hundo P!
---
Imagine watching more than 1 or 2 matches throughout the weekend.
---
&gt;So what? It's not as if we are getting new raids anytime soon so who gives a fuck when people complete them?
---
Elitist douchebags.
---
I would say from 50 copper to 1 silver 50 copper even. Best loot was money, healing pot and box.
---
At least we all got 10 seconds of pure bliss.
---
Nah, we're only asking for one.
---
Why would you get rid of extra ranged attack distance for humanoid slaying.... The only reason hunters beat warriors and mages so well is because they can outrange charge, intercept, and mages casts
---
saaaame

Totally. I mean, I hope I am wrong honestly. The content and raids are super fun and the feeling of overcoming a hard boss for the first time with 39 other pals is a great feeling. 
---
I just don't people to get their hopes up, ya know? I'm against super hype marketing and such, I think it makes for poor consumers which in turn makes for poor products. But I digress, I hope everyone at least gets a chance to experience the content, but from historical and personal experience I doubt it.
---
Holy fuck you got some problems.
---
Cheers mate, appreciate it.
---
Imagine being this big of a meta whore for classic. It’s fucking classic dude. None of it matters, none of it is hard, nobody cares.
---
Adding a delay costs them money... its unreasonable to ask someone to lose mon

ey so they aren't harassed
---
100% I can't stand him - just wanted to add poggers to trigger the guys who don't take care of their hygiene.
---
There's no way this time it's a clusterfuck sis they're literally hard prepping for it.
---
I bet this showed up for the stress test next week. Nice timing tho...
---
Why would they let us download it if they arent planning on opening it to stress testers?
---
I was suppose to go Orc Hunter, but now I think the consensus is Alliance. Dad is a good name for Nightelf females too I guess...
---
I generally do full ambush if I’m going sub. I know people like camo but I take opp over it.
---
you know im thinking the same thing heres to hoping
---
The real jebait comes when you see that you dont even have the game on the bnet account page
---
They couldn't have defeated Stormwind, they were rioting over pay, not trying to overthrow the Government originally. They could never take over the government because of a serious crutch hindering them anyway, Onyxia. She would have ruled in the worst case scenario, which would still mean a Defias loss.
---
Onyxia was influencing both sides of the Nobles/Masons debacle to stir as much chaos as possible. "Dig in your heels and never compromise" was the mindset she gave to both sides. The second the riots killed Queen Tiffan, the Masons panicked and hid away, convinced they were doomed to face Varian's wrath. Not the mindset of a group set to win so much as realized they went too far and it was now too late.
---
Did they help capture Varian? Absolutely, but he was Onyxia's prisoner truly, the Defias were mere meatshields who could never go back to being Masons after the death of the Queen. 
---
Absolute worst case scenario say Onyxia rules through a puppet Anduin or Varian as Queen, that will be shattered at a set date. When Khadgar, Danath Trollbane, and Kurdran Wildhammer return, Khadgar will quickly recognize the twisted magic and the armies of Dalaran and Ironforge will free Stormwind at the very least with possible armies from Theramore and Stromgarde assisting.
---
Yeah, you are grouping up and engaging with other people. Because that's the only way to get any tags.
---
And sitting and camping respawn points in groups, is exactly what you do on these overpopulated servers. Because that's the only way left to play. 
---
What are you basing your arguments on? You can do it on a p server, right now.
---
Post 1/infinite
---
In fact, forget the blacklist!
---
I have a few friends who were registered for beta (didn't get it nor stress) and they didn't get the pop up at all and they have a WoW account so it definitely isn't just for everyone with an account.
---
The best way to summon toweliee to a thread is to say he sucks. 
---
He’s a shitty player with a weird face who wanted nothing to do with classic until he saw how popular it is on twitch.
---
Agreed, humanoid slaying is not optimal
---
LMFAOO
---
It’s like a DND group where someone starts trying to play another person’s character in order to min-max their own. Good way not to get invited back.

&gt; Nice little preview to how I'll be spending all my free time in a few months! 
---
fanboying some asshat that changes his opinion to what nets him the most viewers? yeah nah ty
---
the same reason they make expansions:
---
To retain players and make money.
---
For them it will be one of three decisions:
---
\- keep it classic
---
\- make classic+ content
---
\- go for TBC
---
they will go with whatever they expect to make them the most money.
---
Because a lot of players will be calling for it in time, and I think regressing to TBC would just be lazy.
---
Classic WoW was an MMORPG. The last MMORPG. After Classic, the RPG was stripped and we were given just MMOs.
---
&gt; So of you can learn to keybind intelligently, mouse turn and jump kite in the year 2019, I think you'll have a blast as a hunter in PvP.
---
This is one of the bigger reasons I wont roll hunter (other than to try something new). I used to be miles ahead because of exactly those things early on (jump kiting was weirdly rare early on, so  many hunters would either run or stop and dps and rarely do both) but now most would be good at them (because, really those mechanics are actually easy and I was silly to be proud for being good at them).
---
Gotta make them bags.
---
He is a weirdo but it's funny to mess with people that feel the need to post a screenshot of their greyed out play button.
---
What needs, dude? You NEED 40 people to put up with your ass, and this is totally not the way to do it.
---
It’s ruined for the people who enjoy a consistent non-sharding/layering/cross-realm zoning etc. And since you’re the kind of player that has no issue with these things, you don’t understand why this is a problem for many other players. Such a shame that you’ve probably never experienced a non sharded WoW.
---
Yea bro that tech is called layering, lmao.
---
Youre gonna have super long queues and mob fighting without layering.
---
Or will have a smooth launch experience with no queue times and enough quest mobs to go around got everyone.
---
If done correctly, the layer size can be set in such a way that there is plenty of players to see on your journey...but not so many that It will cause queue time or fighting others for simple quest mobs 
---
It's like all you anti layering guys don't realize that when people like me come home from work every day and have 2-3 hours to play....we don't wanna spend half of that time in a queue, or in an overpopulated zone waiting for mob spawns.
---
I thought this happened on more than one occasion
---
They weren't that rare. The charge-position-swap thing was fairly common, and so was the problem with interrupting while the cast bar was up but the interrupt going through well after it was done, meaning you waste your kick.
---
It was really frustrating.
---
It wasn't a 'design choice' so much as it was 'the best idea they had to combat lag.' 
---
The modern system with much faster batches has virtually eliminated these problems is arguably closer to the original design intent--that kicks go through when you press the button, that whichever warrior hit charge first would move and the other would be stunned, that whichever mage pressed sheep first would sheep the other mage. THAT is the design intent. 
---
If they had been able to batch that often back in 2004 they would have done so.
---

---
damn ur right
---
replace them with sand gnomes
---
still didnt get after restart, always left out zzz
---
Wow - someone on blizzards marketing team!
---
That's the main reason people seem to want layering. And that's because it would be easier.
---
I don't want it to be easier, I want to wait for mobs, I want to group with people while waiting, I want to talk to people.
---
Not just roll through everything.
---
Yeah, it's kind of funny that people are actually wanting to play pally lmao.
---
&gt;Because a lot of players will be calling for it in time, and I think regressing to TBC would just be lazy.
---
Bold words in this sub... they hard dick ride tbc.
---
Because this question is asked 20 times per day.
---
Blizzard probably isn't going to choose to seriously build on Classic in any way. Business-wise, Classic exists because they need the goodwill and the boost in subscriber numbers from the WoW franchise.
---
That said, I think they could do a seasonal system. Maybe have 2-3 servers go up and be completely "fresh" starting in phase 1. 
---
\_\_\_\_\_
---
If new, "horizontal" content was offered, I think it would need to come with minor balance improvements, fixes to bugs, etc. I don't find think 1-2 new raids or dungeons are enough to pull people back into the game for long enough.
---
&gt; THEY FLIP WHEN THEY JUMP.*
---
*If the RNG gods permit
---
Most of the top private, retail &amp; AWC PVPers (&amp; Method members) have already said they're joining the various "streamer guilds" on the "streamer server" on launch.
---
Especially since many of them are small-to-mid-size streamers themselves (and $$ trumps all).
---
Weren't *those* introduced in TBC?
---
Goretusk livers though.
---
?
---
It doesn't have to be drastic vertical progression or horizontal progression. The world isn't black and white.
---
They could do a mixture of both:
---
2 Horizontal Raids focused on different resistances.
---
Followed by 
---
a Raid with vertical progression (better gear) which will need gear sets from the other 2 raids to complete.
---
I think it’d be fun if they added content but they’d have to do very small upgrades with new content to keep disparities from growing too absurd.
---
I love the idea of adding tiers that are only minutely better for well-established/viable specs but that make less viable specs more so - would be fun to see some shamans in enhancement in tier 4 gear or warriors considering arms over fury for dps
---
NGL it took me a long long time to realize what the Moonkin icon actually is. Not a good art choice IMO lol.
---
Google: "Wow Classic phased content schedule"
---
Streamer money is blood money. They would never accept it.
---
Pay attention. Do better.
---
If you don't hit 60 by October you'll be removed from the server and placed on a server full of streamers.
---
Method pvp players maybe. 
---
But method is having their own guild and pushing for their own records. 
---
You won’t find Sco raiding in Sodapoppins guild.
---
&gt; I just don't people to get their hopes up, ya know?
---
Oh for sure, I don't expect many guilds to see the inside of naxx, as it was in classic, the gear floor requirement is huge, and the coordination for a lot of those fights is pretty high. (Not compared to today's standards but gearcheck and resistances are MASSIVE time investment).
---
The biggest part I want people to experience in terms of content, is the actual social aspects of the game.
---
Screw raiding, screw dungeons, screw bg's, I want people to come to the game because they want to spend time with the people INSIDE OF THE WORLD. If people are going to be unpleasant to be around, they are going to have a hard time. And the ones who are fun and enjoyable to be around, are going to have a blast.
---
But yes we cannot undersell the amount of time sink there is for a lot of the endgame content. Not so much in terms of player skill (anyone who raids retail or even do M+ dungeons are going to laugh at the boss mechanics for the majority of the raids), but the amount of investment to get resist gear, consumables is huge. Retail, you can farm for a few hours a week and be ready for a few night a week raiding schedule. (As I Am sure the majority of the community are casually raiding if they are raiding)
---
We used to say all the time, ‘put down the role playing game and role play with us’ (WoW and DnD, respectively)
---
I'm predicting 60 by januaryish
---
&gt; they just want private server type megaservers.
---
Man that sounds absolutely *terrible*.
---
Believe it or not, some people play certain races because they like the way it looks and that’s what you’re staring at for hours upon hours. 
---
That means more to me than any racial ability
---
Not sure why this is being linked. There are multiple people who DIDN'T get this update that have a WoW account. It's mainly the people who didn't get a beta invite OR stress invite.
---
towelliee &gt; any streams
---
Most epic ranged weapons go to melee tho, the hunter arsenal is very limited, MC for example till Rhok'delar gets added will have 0 ranged weapons for hunters with the exception of Core Marksman rifle, which is worse than pre raid blues.
---
You are my favourite person to read in this sub, your last post made my day. This one made my month.
---
THANK YOU. You deserve a reward my friend.
---
Undead.
---
Still infinitely better than asmongold the douche
---
Towellie is a pussy
---
That would be fantastic! Then have a 10 hour queue while streamers get queue priority
---
Your title and I quote:
---
(REAL unpopular opinion) Classic Beta was a bad idea for the game success.
---
I know what you mean, but I need to be able to be distracted without dying all the time!
---
I think you worded it fine. It's the lack of critical thinking, logic and nuance in others that makes the opinion lost on them.
---
As for testing, I don't think hiring anyone would do the trick. Right now I think they'd need a lot more "testers" since cases like this there are folks who treat it as a demo, the majority, and don't report bugs or issues. 
---
Then there's the issue of needing people who know the game to play it seeing as how many bugs and issues won't be game-breaking, crash anything, leave no errors in a log or notify headquarters that a bug has just occurred. Take an elite NPC that was known to attack everyone on sight in Vanilla but doesn't now until you attack him. If a random beta tester didn't know he wasn't supposed to treat everyone like dirt and attack on sight, how would he know the NPC is broken?
---
So you not only need players, but players from Vanilla and LOTS of them to both play and submit reports and forum/Reddit posts.
---
I don't think riposte is a finisher?
---
4weird - he smashes pussy.
---
God damnit, might as well not even sub.
---
With a class/spec like that you don't need Shadowmeld to go unnoticed by raiding guilds.
---
Not saying you're wrong, but where did you see that all BGs would be cross-realm? I didn't think they had made a final decision on that. Last I had heard they were hoping to leave cross-realm BGs out until a later phase, but it was sort of dependant on overall server populations/PVP involvement.
---
Very interesting! One friend of mine got it and another one didn't. Ask your friends to restart their [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) client and maybe opt-in to the client beta. Maybe that matters?
---
I like sonii or cdew, way better players, way less toxicity in chat
---
No shit. I direct you to my comment saying the same thing.
---
These are all good replies but can some one explain to me what exactly is the difference between a hardcore guild and a casual one? I know about mythic and heroic dungeons in retail wow but I don't know too much about classic raiding. Taking my mage idea what would be the difference between a casual mage and a hardcore raider mage?
---
So you still think we have a chance to get in or?
---
Have you tried out RFK? I think I remember that being pretty profitable? Idk.
---
Strictly Vanilla**?**  
---
No**,**Changes**!**
---
People forget this because they are too used to the weekly reset.
---
&gt; -get an autoshot timer add-on and learn how to stutter step kite so you don't clip auto attacks. You can't auto shoot while running so you have to pause just as the timer finishes.
---
Damn, how did I never realize to install an addon for this and do it consistently? And I always thought I am amazing at hunter mechanics compared to most at the time..
---
Are you 12 again?
---
Not yet, that will be my next location to PP
---
Well, there is supposed to be AV testing today and it's odd that it went through roughly 11 minutes before the "supposed" AV launch (which still hasn't happened). It's probably for the stress test though, that is supposed to happen in a few days.
---
Fuck Karen.
---
I don't think that's usually the case at around level 20+. Maybe below 20 it would be but I'm fairly certain you use multiple finishers beyond level 20 which is when this is relevant. Just from streams of beta i've watched.
---
u aint missing out anything but false hope. im sure it will update for you really soon.
---
As a druid... I can't wait to never being able to close my mouth in catform again.... and impaling gnomes on my horns in catform.
---
corpserun for 5-10 minutes, cant see the mobs so spawn in get ganked by 5 npcs and die instantly, corpse run back again rez timer.  Like why the hell is their rez timers
---
Sure is. It uses combo points which means it’s a finisher
---
In raids thats somewhat untrue, outside of really 2 ranged weapons (Chromag and KT crossbows) you really don't have ranged options, melee on the other hand you have a number, assuming your guild clears content with releases, you will be priority for core hounds tooth, and then either Hakkari WB mahin hand / Fang from ZG, or even a Zin'rhok since most of your mdps will have untamed blades or asscandies by the time ZG comes out. Once AQ and Naxx hits there are dedicated hunter melee weapons (barb and eye) if you don't get the option to roll on the more optimal 1h weapons.
---
Level 10 - 60 is a little too wide

---
it's not a levelling zone

I thought it was Tad Nugent
---
based on what is written in the post?
---
Anecdotal evidence is like citing evidence where the source is the source.
---
You know what I mean dude. Tunneling DPS hybrids add way less to a team.
---
oo thanks
---
Fantastic maps.
---
The way I look at it is, there is obviously a lot of potential to expand vanilla WoW. This is the chance for them to try. If they try, and it sucks, who cares. We will still get TBC eventually regardless. But if they don't try and move directly to TBC, we'll never get additional content for the old games. Which would be a shame since vanilla are retail are completely different games. 
---
So by developing additional content for WoW classic, they would be exploring that avenue. If they avoid it, then there is precedent we'll never get a new content added to re-released content. Which basically makes the re-released content die eventually, or reaches back up to retail itself.
---
It’s massive free publicity. And it is working very well at that. Sorry, that you don’t have the willpower to not burn yourself out with that kind of hype. 
---
I’ve been reading this sub daily for months and practicing my character choices on pserver and I can’t wait until Classic. It is my most favourite game of all time and I can’t wait to play again. Nothing is going to take winds out of my sails until I play the game for myself and decide if the recreation is authentic or not. And I’ll count myself lucky for getting the opportunity.
---
You must be alot of fun at parties, my dude.
---
Poggggggers
---
ZG was already providing gear of a lower power than raids that already existed when it came out, was ZG worthwhile? People are going to raid whatever content you put out for the *one* item they can get from there that's BiS, even if the rest is only an upgrade for the newbies.
---
So why would a level 10 be there?
---
This is the correct answer, you were only automatically flagged in opposing Capital Cities on PVE.
---
Cats, Cats, Cats
---
Imagine wanting 39 players to carry your dead weight.
---
I dont disagree with any of this. Defeat can mean many things depending on the context. The first thing i say in this video is that the Defias arent going to be occupying Stormwind and replacing its government. Its just not plausible, which you've touched on a bit. 
---
What i talk about is how the moral ambiguity surrounding the Defias' formation, and Stormwind's  severe military inefficiency (Onyxia being a big part), could have potentially lead to an even larger power grab by the Defias.
---
I'm more worried that you (and 14 others) can't figure this out than anything in the thread.

No argument here.
---
What are you complaining about here, exactly? 
---
If you enjoy it, play it, if not - do something else.
---
And if watching a few streamers makes you want to quit the game, maybe they are even doing you a favor:
---
Never go shopping when hungry, right? So if they saturated your need for classic and you no longer feel like you are going to play WoW - then that is also a lesson learned.
---
&gt;to promote a game you cannot even play
---
You must really hate movie trailers :D
---
Really hoping they let us into AV, but not getting my hopes up :(
---
What bothers me most about cata zones like uldum, hyjal, twighlight highlands etc etc
---
is that they are purely flying zones. I get the point, that they wanted newer players to avoid those zones, but come on.. humans have ways of making stuff accessible by foot.
---
Cata is just the worst of all addons imho..

Magic word is "1g".

The title reads "Classic Beta  was a bad idea for the game success"

That's where.

There was always a self cast key in the options.

Same here. The “Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic” option is suddenly back for me.

are probably the best hunter pvp builds, although intimidate / scatter is pretty decent from a control perspective, its suited best for hunting down FC's moving across the map.  In most premade groups you'll prolly wind up on defense but for less organized PvP, you should place fairly well, its not uncommon to see a hunter topping charts.
---
You're not pointing it out. You're making demands.
---
I'm torn between full ambush+full stealth and the build I've mentioned.  I haven't fully decided yet.  I really like ambush vanish ambush prep vanish ambush.
---
*vape noise and lack of game knowledge intensifies*
---
So verses other Priest or Locks Undead do better. However, verses everything else trolls are superior. Shadowguard is one of the most under-rated abilities in the game. 
---
Its damage, shadow weaving, blackout procing ability, and so on make its a great ability for both leveling and pvp. 
---
I am one of these people who strongly favor non shadow leveling (you always get 8-10 points in shadow.)  But when playing horde a Troll makes me level shadow (at least 40+) as its so much more powerful than most think.
---
Same! According to that nifty calculator someone posted recently. Woot!
---
How so? If we kill bosses faster we kill more bosses right?
---
Let me innn! :D
---
&gt; It’s ruined for the people who enjoy a consistent non-sharding/layering/cross-realm zoning etc.
---
No one has experienced that for 14 years.  You are really really trying to ruin the game for yourself.  A few hundred people on another shard isn't going to ruin your game.  If it does, well that's just too fucking bad, because they're not going to launch with 50 servers just to make you happy.

Looks good.
---
well still gray so it seems we got massivly jebaited
---
Its 2019, not 2004. People aren't going to be endlessly wandering around Azshara and corpse hopping at level 6 for the "awe factor" while they wait for leveling zones to calm down. And yes, people actually stand still and camp the actual mob spawn point for one tag every few minutes on the populated servers. That is with dynamic spawns as well, classic will have the full 5 minutes spawns. 
---
You cant even argue that people will be moving around in different questing patterns. Everyone and their mother is going to have Joana or Jaime open. 
---
The point of layering is to provide everyone with a better experience, and they specifically pointed out it would be temporary. It is a great idea, and I am so glad they are doing it regardless of how many people cry "but my nostalgia!". Blizzard moved retail to a convenience/quality of life based model. This is an engine based, temporary population control change. Calm down, you will be happy they did it when the servers actually launch.

The damage isn’t too bad if you didn’t run out of mana in no fucking time... I was allowed to try it once instead of feral on Onyxia and I was actually top DPS (admitted the other players weren’t all stars). Trying to manage mana at the expense of dps got people closer, but I could barely stay ahead. Yet, even then you just run oom at some point way too early and fall off hard. It’s hard to get good mp5 gear and even that is just postponing the inevitable with the lengthy fights in Vanilla,

---
Blizzard, this isn't funny anymore. This is the second time we got Jebaited.
---
Exactly right. Blizzard's been putting the cart before the horse since TBC, always trying to make raiding more accessible without ever stopping to think it might not be the barriers to entry but the activity itself which is the problem.
---
I never raided during vanilla, partially because I never got a character to 60, but a good part of the reason for that was I simply didn't have much interest in raiding. I finally tried it out in TBC, running through Kara a few times with my Horde-side druid. It was kinda' nifty, I suppose; cool enough for what it was, but it never really grabbed me. Ultimately I concluded what I'd more or less already known: as you said, I'm just not really into raiding and likely never will be.
---
Thing is, I don't think "less focus on raiding" necessarily has to mean "more solo content." For my money, dungeons are where the game really shines. You have to work with others and be part of a team, but there are still few enough of you that what you do can really matter moment-to-moment.

I need to get my time-off request in. Thanks for reminding me, The Onion!
---
I always thought the way Blizzard handled Uldum was unimaginative... I mean in vanilla we learn from The Stone Watcher of Norgannon claims that Uldum is a research facility for the titans in their continuing efforts to enhance the biosphere of Azeroth.  
---
In retail we got Halls of Origination but that's it...  For being a research facility like Ulduar one would assume it would have a much grander appearance and not just a desert with sphinx-people. The whole "enhance the biosphere of Azeroth" part and the knowledge of research in Un'Goro sounds, to me, like the zone should be more lush. Have it be a "biosphere gone wrong" zone and instance/raid.
---
In what way? Where do I make demands? 
---
I’m pointing out valid expectations. If you think your going to top DPS charts as a Ret you are delusional. You will be a way Better help to your team playing support. Spot healing, cleansing, using utility abilities to help bolster your DPS team mates. Rather than tunneling trying to top charts. Unless the rest of your squad is either way lower geared or really bad you will never be top.  Play ALL of your class. You are not a DPS you are a support hybrid.
---
Is that a /r/liverpoolfc reference in the wild?
---
Doesn't make it right for her to decide what you do with your body, though.
---
This is really good!
---
&gt;How big a dps gap is there really between hunter and the other classes?
---
Hunter is in the top 5 for MC (warrior &gt; rogue &gt; hunter / mage) but falls off from there, by Naxx you are close to the bottom of the totem pole as warrior, rogue, lock, and mage all scale fantastically.

MacBook Pro 13" 2014 here, plays vanilla on 60 on highest (except view distance which is about 75% as I don't like the slight penalty to FPS and seeing less makes the game feel bigger). Just installed BFA to test the client and on 3/10 quality runs at 50-60 fps, completely playable, and looks pretty good.

---
To make leveling easier, hopefully you have a class that is shared with NE's. Otherwise you won't be able to train anything
---
these days its now hunters
---
I mean pluder isle would be a perfect zone for a south seas expansion, but the south seas expansion would have really needed zandalar, kezan, the broken isles and the maelstrom, so blizzard kind of messed that up
---
I hope Blizzard will fill in zones like Uldum, Twilight Highlands, Northern Lordaeron and Grim Batol when Classic progresses past Naxxramas. I know a lot of people just want the game as it was(and its expansions) but I think it will be cool when they just build upon it with the classic spirit in mind. Imagine how cool it would be to get an Outlands where the story actually makes sense.
---
Speech level 5
---
So, "you're healing unless you're the guy" is just pointing out hybrid is more effective? That's telling people what they are going to play.
---
Why would you test ride a motorcylce, that would just make you be in pain, wouldn't it? Masochist?
---
1. Stance dancing is important in PvE and in PvP, when tanking and when DPSing. Anger management is more optional.
---
2. Decent for PvP.
---
3. Can be nice in some DM too.
---
4. It's 440. It's important on progression and/or if your healers suck. Otherwise, getting crit isn't the end of the world.
---
5. Yes, but defense is needed for uncrittability, not for avoidance.
---
6. Troll best threat, tauren best HP, humans best Alliance DPS, orc best Horde DPS, dwarves cool in PvP, nelves can charge from meld, undead look badass, gnomes are hard to click.
---
7. Engi is the only profession giving a lot of bonuses that you can't buy. BS gives antifear trinket that you don't need as warrior. Of course, BS is still a reasonable choice if you want to craft your own armor or axe.
---
8. Think there're quite a few on google.com

---
You are hovering the correct choice with your mouse!
---
I guess it’s to show what the best obtainable gear is before you step in a raid.
---
This is the best advice I’ve ever heard
---
Not really.  It's 1.12+ with phased releases of things like some raids, dungeons, PVP.
---
Your experience with the undead mage pushing Rank 14 is very similar to my experience with an orc warrior on my server.      
---
Everyone knew his name, and when he and his crew showed up in a battleground everything just sort of...clicked. Alterac Valley would, more often than not, be a bit of a shitshow taking a great deal of time to complete, and losing more often than not. But if this orc warrior showed up, it was like everyone snapped to attention and did their best, even if they weren't in his group. His entourage was only maybe two groups worth of players in the BG, but everyone else seemed to listen and, frankly, jump at the chance of steamrolling the other team because, "&lt;Orc Warrior&gt; is here!"        
---
He told  me good job for ninja'ing Icewing Bunker flag while people were fighting down below. Felt good, man.
---
And you would rather take longer and be way less effective doing so. That’s fine. Play how you want. I’m not saying “Don’t being hybrids they are trash”. I’m saying hybrids are hybrids not DPS classes.
---
&gt;Am I right that 1 def = 0.04% avoidance? A very small amount.
---
Yes but defence also contributes to parry, dodge, block etc.
---
No, but Mountain Girl rolls a troll hunter.
---
Is this music ironic
---
I plan this if I play a non human
---
This is for beta I assume?
---
then no portalz for u &gt;:(
---
Does anyone have a handy chart listing hotspots for good gear/weapon upgrades while leveling a hunter? Someone made a really good simple picture for rogue swords on both alliance and horde and I was hoping there was something like that for hunters. I know it probably matters less because I can lean on pet damage but figured I'd ask.
---
Thrall is cool.
---
Portal? 1g
---
According to John Staats it was actually going to be the very first expansion. I'd like to see it.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers actually hail from an island in the southern sea called Plunder Isle, southwest of Booty Bay.
---
Oh so stress testers don’t get access to AV ?
---
I thoroughly enjoyed the part about the fishing hole. I really hope that kind of community interaction occurs in Classic!
---
It’s your 15 bucks dude. I didn’t say anywhere “don’t play hybrids they are trash” My point is set proper expectations and play to your strengths. You will be a better team member that way.
---
Agreed, I do like the aspect of social awareness in the game. You get a bad rep and people will know you.
---
I think BWL will be the first skill check and farm check. Lots of consumes, lots of wipes, it will be tough for many.
---
It is just such awesome content, I hope everyone gets a taste of what they are looking for. 
---
A lot of people are in it for the power grind, and they will be very disappointed if they have a life right now. Takes a lot of time investment.
---
Never played Vanilla, but I assume the gold gets better at higher levels? Otherwise it seems pretty bad GPH
---
I agree with everything you’re saying, and I know that once the hype dies down for Classic, players like you will be the ones sticking around still (and for the longest), so it’s of course in your (and everyone’s ) interests to let newer or more casual players know about implicit things regarding team- and commitment-based games. 
---
I don’t think you came off as harsh, either. I think there’s a culture clash with this nostalgic re-release - there’s nothing wrong with wanting to play casually, hardcore, PvP or PvE, or whatever. 
---
It’s just that inherently, any different group and all the permutations of each grouping means that there are inherently different value systems at play and when those value systems are misaligned - whether through an accident, misunderstanding or whatever - it leads to hostility between different groups. 
---
Again I don’t think you’re being harsh, but maybe you could word this post in a way that sounds less clinical - bearing in mind that what you’re putting across is based on your own value systems of what you want to get out of WoW, and you’re trying to appeal to a group with different values. 
---
This is coming from someone who leans towards very hardcore commitments in games, as well.
---
No, because I grew up..
---
Sub, prep and premed are too strong, but keep in mind sword hemo build is very viable.
---
Nah it's totally the same. I got mine done maybe 5 years ago, and wish I had done it sooner.
---
Just jump in a couple of weeks after launch and those systems will be removed by then.
---
The dark part of it is a side view of a moonkin's head. The left and bottom pieces are the mouth, with the rest of the head the rest of the black part.
---
Again, not very clear at all.

---
hahah im alliance, but going horde in classic as that's where all my mates are going. What class you gonna play?
---
They quite clearly stated that the beta server would be down for the duration of the AV test which just went live.
---
Server: Bonechewer 
---
I remember Permaice the IRL grandmother who we helped grind to Rank 14 on her priest.
---
There was Grueller the warrior who had to retire, because his family needed him.  He bought his closest friends a bunch of “cool” stuff like fireworks and things like that.  We had a going away party on this beech/cave place that’s still a secret (and I’m not telling where it is because it’s still special to me).  It was removed when flying was implemented in cats.
---
There was LatinoPsycho the hunter who I found in desolace and leveled up to about 55 with him before he stopped playing.  My first organic wow friend.
---
There was Chikan who had to get a name change because some asshat reported that his name meant something naughty in Korean or something like that.  
---
Vortmos who took me into his brand new guild when I got kicked from a guild that I was trying out for and didn’t make the cut.  We ended up out-progressing that guild, so suck it Threshold!
---
Durgular!  Omg Durgular, the server Trade Chat troll.  Always trolling, constantly.  Big obnoxious Durgular.  
---
And Czar, the paladin who was the nicest player I ever met.  We pvp’d together, that’s about all I remember.
---
No because mine was a miss spelling by super young me. Also I never got to max in classic so it would be dumb to relive the experience
---
Ah I see now, but I like imp expose, and imp poisons over imp sprint. Cold blood has a ton of instances where it's useful, especially in average gear. I think it's more consistently useful than a snare breaking sprint every 3.5 or 10 min. I might be remembering poorly, but I don't recall snares being much of a problem for rogues. Everyone's too busy being snared themselves by crippling poison or stun locked.
---
I'd definitely take imp sprint if I were doing premade bg's though.
---
1 defense gives .04 dodge, parry, block, chance to be missed and crit reduction. 
---
It gives all of that.
---
So 1 defense actually gives .12% avoidance. Block and crit chance reduction are not avoidance
---
Bonechewer was a pretty dang good server I think.  We were lucky to play on it.
---
No healers, seems legit. IMO, the best strategy would be to graveyard camp the enemy team endlessly
---
There will be no difference in the spec between 2 hand arms and DW arms with of course the exception of two hand spec. 
---
If you want to dualwield I suggest using the tree meant for dual wielding. 
---
If you want to use arms anyway, despite the advice given to you, then just use the standard arms build minus the 4 points in 2 hand spec - pick up imp hamstring and 1 more point into improved parry I guess
---
Making meme specs better reduces the relative strenght of the non meme specs.
---
If you want to play the meme specs you do it for the memes and not to be a top spec.
---
Yeah when I made a character on pserver when they announced the countdown it took me over an hour to get past the few quests. I'm good with not spending hours of my life trying to kill 8 wolves.
---
thats nice. Thats what I played when I was 9 years old. Enjoyable class as a starter
---
Oh shit you're right. It's been about 15 years I thought that they added the GromGol zeppelin later on but yeah that is correct. Tirisfal to Gromgol then just run north lol
---
 No I’m saying in my raid team I don’t see bringing more than 1. Because they bring less to the group than others in that role. When did I say anywhere THIS IS LAW BEND THE KNEE?
---
Well it’s all they can reach, so...
---
you gonna name him Lêgõlås as well?
---
Because survival is sub-par talents for pvp compared to BM or Marks
---
Beastial wrath is significantly way better to have, as it prevents your pet from getting frost nova'd and gives it 50% more hit
---
BoF + Fap &gt; Fap
---
There’s a difference between top spec and viable. Between absolutely useless and useful.

Undead also have a leveling advantage with cannibalize and an additional fear break for tanking if grounding totem or stance dance fails. And a bit of shadow resist for what it's worth.
---
well doesnt seem like it we got jebaited agane

You spelled Stranglethorn wrong several times.

Ahh. I was close

Just subbed a month because I got the same and thought you needed it to play. Wallet just got Jebaited FeelsBadMan
---
She didn't decide!  It's my decision...Is that hard to believe or something.  We had an adult conversation about it.
---
If you really think about it, hunters getting FD is like the ultimately troll.   Think about it.  These huntards are constantly pulling extra packs with their multishot and pets that inevitably wipes the group.  Except them...  They just FD.   They fuck everything up, and never learn their lesson, because they're not the ones paying the repair bill afterwards.
---
&gt; I think BWL will be the first skill check and farm check. Lots of consumes, lots of wipes, it will be tough for many.
---
Yeah first boss is about coordination, second boss is an idiot check, but many are going to fail.
---
As it goes on, I agree, farm and gear check (especially chromagg).
---
I am personally in it, to get back to what drove me to the game in the first place, the social parts. It's the same reason why year after year, I generally spend a few months playing Everquest 1 (yes the original EQ) because nothing draws and keeps you playing, like the people you log in for.
---
(And don't worry about the edit I knew what you were saying :P)
---
Why does every idiot in this sub have to say “I know #NOCHANGES”  right before they make a suggestion for some massive change???
---
That’s awesome!!
---
Horizontal progression could work in such a way. New raids and dungeons are released with gear that has similar attribute levels as Classic WoW. The major difference being the set bonuses. Having new T1, T2, T3 raids with different set bonuses could encourage players to do the new content.
---
There is, in preparation for the end of Wrath, achievements, and titles.
---
westfall is so fucking bad in comparison to darkshore.  every time i see some dumb little level 11 NE hunter running around killing goretusks i shake my head in disgust

Priest leveling, leveling in general, and pvp ganking groups. Not useless.

“Now guys, I know y’all think I’m a moron but let me 100% solidify it for anyone on the fence about me - I’m def a moron”

I’ve actually been wondering the same thing.  I believe it should be available from launch, but haven’t seen it confirmed either.
---
That’s the point. They’re already broken, and they’re gonna stay broken. How is that ok?
---
Answer:  it’s not. Blizz did go in and make changes to classes and specs moving forward to make them all viable, but they did it for TBC, because why bother changing Vanilla when they knew their new xpac was right around the corner.
---
Dudes are acting like I said no hybrids ever... I have mained a paladin for 14 years. When Rets came into our raid in Vanilla and just tunneled on DPS we called them bad. Because they were not helping the team as much as if they played all of their tool kit. Same for PVP.
---
 If people want to be bad at their class I guess they can. If that makes me an elitist jerk so be it.

In EVE Online this is called "making your own content" and it's the reason why MMORPGs are great.

His amount of threads is getting annoying. 17 posts for 1.13 zones when he could just make an album.
---
Onyxia fracturing the Kingdom was her plan though. The Defias were a pawn army to get rid of the Nobles so that way she would be fully in control. The real thorn in her plan wasn't Stormwind, it was the people of Westfall rising up and forming the People's Militia who held the Defias mainly in Westfall. When your only way to get money is seemingly through terrorism and extortion, people will rise up.
---
The Defias start losing men, so they resort to hiring thugs and thieves, most likely more people under Onyxia's thumb. Honestly, Van Cleef probably never fully controlled the Defias. They ended up being too many individual cells operating on their own whims. Van Cleef was in the Deadmines for 2 decades before we kill him, he had minimal control. 
---
How were all the Defias paid? Highway robbery will only get so much, nowhere near the amount they had for all their projects. Clearly the money Stormwind was missing was slowly funneled to them through Onyxia. In a coup, they would be the sacrificial lamb which would see them crushed with Onyxia playing a key part in their orchestrated defeat to give her a better public image.

I got jebaited aswell, saw it pop up and start updating on my launcher proceeded to get extremely excited and my play button is also grayed out. FEEEEEEELSBADMAN

Don't you need to be around level 40 before you can make the Bloodsail stop attacking you?

Edited back :)

My purpose in life is to level ahead of everyone else and kill them in STV. There will be no peace there

You can probably clear through BWL without a single player spending any talent points. That's the type of game you're trying to min-max right now.
---
In a perfect world sure, though honestly we'll end up with WoD servers down this route too.
---
The focus shouldn't be on "I need to collect this 8 piece set to be relevant", there's tons of non-set pieces that drop, that can be perfectly viable with what you are looking for. Case and point: feral druid. Until I am deep in AQ40, I am not going to be wearing tier pieces. And once I enter naxx, still going to be using AQ40 set for hybrid stats.
---
Makes it worse if you decide to roll moonkin, you're looking at AQ20/40 gear at best or a clown suit.
---
Ohh sweet child. You wouldn't last five levels in daoc, Ultima, or EQ.
---
Losing experience and deleveling, losing gear, that's a real punishment.
---
Warlock is a fucking blast! It's my favorite class by far. 
---
Levels 1-10 are OK, your imp does decent damage and sorta helps tank mobs, once you get VW life gets better. Once you hit 14 and get instant corruption life is EVEN better, and once you hit around 24 you get your third level of dots and are starting to get deeper into Affliction. 30+ is a breeze, you just dot up a couple mobs, have your succy do her BDSM whip on one of them and drain life tank the other one / fear kite. Easy to grind 2-3 mobs at a time with little to no downtime. 
---
At 40 you get a free mount which is baller and you can spend a bit of gold on the AH to upgrade gear that doesn't drop out of SM / ZF to help you farm even better, you're balls deep in Affliction now and literally never have downtime when fighting mobs. 
---
60 is great, raid life is easy since you just put up whatever curse you're assigned, maybe a corruption, and then spam shadowbolt and lifetap. Not the absolute best numbers, but you'll scale great as content gets released. 
---
Also you kick ass in PvP. You **can** 1v1 any class, but some classes are very hard for you to fight (Rogue is the worst).
---
Play Warlock it's the tits.
---
Ah, so you're in the lying camp. Cool.
---
I am going to farm every casuals delicious tears in wpvp
---
Perhaps but sometimes feign death resists. :P
---
Did you use customer support?
---
Thanks brudda
---
Aw shit here we go again
---
Damn how did you not become best friends after that? I guess if you were on a pvp server you didn't have too many options there.
---
it's a way of pruning your customerbase. make a bunch of mobile gacha elements, attract a bunch of mobile gacha addicts, have a crappy mobile game playerbase. 
---
old WoW didn't make decisions to cater to the lowest common denominator as much. likewise the loser trolls who spent all day on the General forum whining about not liking things that weren't faceroll easy to overcome.
---
On Stormrage Horde, I specifically remember a Tauren Druid named Popo.
---
I don't remember ever interacting with him directly, but I remember him being in a guild titled _"Popo for President"_ or something along those lines. By the time I hit 60, all of the Horde had abandoned the server, but I would still always see Popo in Orgimmar. He was decked out in epics, and always had a huge posse following him everywhere. When I rerolled my class in Wrath I remembered Popo and that made me pick Druid. I haven't looked back since.
---
I will have the wife do it while i sleep.... wait she will be playing hard too, damn it.
---
Ooga gang had grown. They're multiplying.
---
Man, no kidding ab the cult thing. These are objectively nice QoL things and so far the only argument I've heard is that people are masochists and like spending lots of gold respeccing and time running to dungeons.
---
&gt; Engi is the only profession giving a lot of bonuses that you can't buy. BS gives antifear trinket that you don't need as warrior. Of course, BS is still a reasonable choice if you want to craft your own armor or axe.
---
To echo this, there's a shield which is VERY important before you get thunderfury.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18168/force-reactive-disk
---
Do you boo
---
So Firstly are you going to be alliance or horde? Because that makes the difference because there are two races i would say are good for both sides. If you want to main tank and achieve the highest TPS i use the [DW/Defiance](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=warrior&amp;talents=qCsyszsAsBqGsKsLsMsNqEs8s9s_s.qzs-tatbtcqHIcIdIeIfqBsZs0s1s2InIgqorMrNrOrPqrsgqprUrVrWrXs3sPqtr3r4r5r6) Build. This is to maximize your Threat per second. Now if you go Horde the true threat kings are Troll warriors because of abusing berserking racial ability.  This gives them a haste increase based off missing hp. So doing a full gear swap will allow them to get to 50% hp then putting it all back on and popping bloodrage then proceeding to get hit one time by the boss before they pop berzerking allows them to reach the 30% threshold for maximum 30% increased attack speed. The other race i highly suggest running as horde would be to go as an Orc. Orcs have Hardiness which gives them an additional 25% chance to resist stuns. This is very helpful in both dungeons and can prove very useful in some raiding situations.  They also get a free 5 weapon skill in axes which is very useful in pve. For the Alliance side i would suggest either Night Elf or going Human. Humans have the advantage because of their free reputation bonus as well as the free 5 mace and sword skills. I suggest Nelf because the have the highest agility gains in the game which allows them to innately have the most crit over other races. Crit is very important for DW/Defiance spec. The reasons that DW/Defiance is way better than deep prot is the fact that prot doesn't provide you any added benefits or more survivability. Shield slam is the highest threat causing move on the prot tree but you can out threat it any day by going DW spec. The one drawback to this is your mocking blows you have to swap early and cant use it as a reactive 2nd taunt you instead have to preemptively know you are going to need to utilize it. I generally run BS/Mining while leveling then eventually swap to Engy because engy is incredible for tanking Sappers are your best friends as well as grenades for getting snap aoe threat. If you have any questions about this crazy private server build that we all run for maximum threat please don't hesitate to ask. I am a salty dog that has tanked through KT running this spec on private servers.
---
Because she is plug ugly
---
&gt; but let's not start mixing PvE entirely as just raiding. 
---
I feel like this is where a lot of issues started.
---
99% of the playerbase doesn't raid. Yet raiders seem to end up dictating everything about the game and making the game all about them, because they spend more time on social media. Raids are cool but their coolness is in contact with the rest of the game. The two parts are needed. The leveling is the game most people play. The raiding is the carrot that people leveling want. This is fine.
---
Who was it who started saying that the real game starts at max level? I recall that being a thing even before WoW had that many expansions. Ofc if you argue leveling doesn't matter, specs in leveling don't matter (this was said to me on this sub), etc., then you can see Blizzard reading all that and thinking the leveling and alternative 60 experience can be thrown in the bin, just get everyone faster to raids.
---
&lt;Deadly At Any Size&gt;
---
Luna unit frames is amazing for healing. It has built in click casting and mouse over macros, it has heal prediction, so while you're casting your heal it will show if you're going to overheal or not, it also works with other people using the addon so you can see incoming heals from other players.
---
It used to work that way in Vanilla for a time. I remember killing fish in ZG for the Fishing boss there and not looting them so they didnt respawn during the fight. But I think this was changed later on.
---
It could have just been a placebo effect though, but I recall the fish spawning slower when people didnt loot them.
---
I am actually wearing this today. Neckbeard is already on its way.
---
Healing definitely requires you to concentrate on a wider scope of targets for sure, dps only really get's hard when you have to do damage simultaneously to avoiding mechanics.
---
In blues? I bet not. What you did at the end of the game in Naxx gear on trivial content means nothing. Odd flex but okay.
---
He really does, like everything he says is just parroting Asmongold. I guess he thinks he’ll get Asmons viewer numbers if he mimics him hard enough. 🙄

Now that the hype train is on full rails it probably gets more traction.

Yes you can't go wrong with classic names like Darkagent and Demonwarrior

Sort by new, mate. Sort by new. Just a few posts before yours.
---
Orc/Human and NE/Tauren have the exact same split line in between them, so you could quickly cut one and paste it over the other.

Because they don't adhere to that philosophy, and they believe that their suggestion is small enough that it shouldn't enrage the nochanges fanatics.

You're nearly 2 years off

You're completely twisting my words into something I didn't say. In no way have I said anything that implies that streamers are NOT mainly there for advertisment, they absolutely are. But that does not invalidate the rest of what I've said. Take some chill pills and be open for reasoning - you're really just ranting ;)
---
I bet you're the type of guy that opens chips with scissors.
---
Next.
---
Maybe this has already been covered, I apologize if so, but Druids can't be Shamans.
---
I had the blueish / grayish armored boar from Razorfen. Loved that dude, especially before they did the pet talent trees and pigs had charge.
---
A hunter can farm DM tribute run solo. I heard thats quite the moneymaker.
---
Hunters are one of the only classes in classic who can solo bosses in dungeons through kiting.
---
There are several videos showcasing this in the series called Hunter vs World. (there are many other videos too but thats the series i saw back in the day)
---
Wow dude thanks for the link. He's working on a version for Classic. I'm MOST thrilled by this.
---
I think your arguments are unconvincing. Having two specs drastically cuts down on gold spent respeccing. If you need 3 specs then deal with it, but two are enough for most toons and roles. As far as not bringing a warlock bc they only exist to summon: this is just a garbage argument. If you do damage you will get a spot, people are likely to be less, not more picky the more options you give them.
---
Except, this article is significantly off in terms of timeline. Wow did not come out in 2006. People should do their research before writing articles!
---
Everything is a hunter wpn.  You roll on them all.
---
Never buying anything from blizzard Activision again until they split, similar to what destiny did.
---
Had already given up on getting into the beta and stopped checking. Just happened to check now and noticed the beta was back on the list. Man I got so excited for a moment only to be jebaited.
---
Expected more on queue dodging and pub stomping.
---
&gt; Shadoweave
---
If I have the materials on hand, I will make it if it is better than what I have on.  But I won't go out of my way to make any of these items since they have some uncommon materials and can be obsolete pretty quickly.  
---
The Shadoweave set also require either visiting a special trainer or getting a pattern, so these aren't the most straight forward items to get, but also aren't super difficult if you want to make an effort to get them.
---
&gt; Felcloth
---
Given that most pre-raid BiS lists have a lot of 'of Shadow Wrath' items, I will likely make some felcloth pieces for the slots where they are comparable to the non random enchant BiS items.  Depends on how hard the item is to get and how many materials the felcloth item in that slot takes.
---
Definitely making the shoulders since they are comparable to, if not outright, pre-raid BiS.
---
He is having fun. "It's not about the money. It's about sending a message" is a line from the Joker in The Dark Knight. It also resembles a shit ton lines from a multitude of mafia and gang related movies. It's applicable because it's the ooga **gang**.  It's just part of the roleplay.
---
I really think people are making a mountain out of a mole hill with this issue. Yes, I agree that layering as a whole hurts the social aspect of the game. It hurts continuity of the world itself. 
---
But I also recognize that super long login queues hurt the game. Overcrowded start zones so you can barely progress in the beginning hurts the game. Opening new realms to handle the initial influx hurts the game as people stop playing and these realms become ghost towns, with no mechanism to "collapse" them into other realms. 
---
Its a lose-lose-lose situation, and I think they're attempting to walk the line of best compromise: reduce/eliminate login queues, reduce initial zone congestion, allow people to play together on one realm, allow the realm to be dynamic so it can scale as the community settles/matures. There are also some unfortunate side-effects that happen as a result such as hopping layers to farm certain nodes multiple times, or any other exploit that has been shown in the past few weeks. Hopefully (and seemingly) they manage these exploits and reduce them as best as possible. It just boils down to whether or not you trust the team to follow through on what they said, and if so, I don't think a handful of weeks of layering is going to kill this game... Hopefully, we won't even have that many max level characters by the time layering is removed (as I'm sure the world first crew will be getting it done in just a few weeks). However, the majority of players will still be leveling by the time they've stated they'll have it out of the game.
---
Impale doesn't add that much damage until your crit chance is higher and it will be ~5% most of the time while leveling.
---
I would instead dive to 31 fury first if you are going to dual wield so you can get dual wield specialization, enrage, and flurry which will actually add a lot of dps.
---
I'm pretty sure DFT is BiS for Bears. AP, hit, and dodge are all wonderful stats for a druid.
---
If I was an Alliance guy, I’d be doing the same thing.  I’m a Horde boy though, so it’ll be Troll hunter for me!
---
Can you send me logs? Talked to shelfen and he says there is in fact a delay and it was only visual
---
Does this make the collect 3 objects quest in the Gnome starting zone viable? It's usually skipped on pservers
---
Karen, Bridget and Jessica or some fucky names like that, you just have to delete your character once they kill you
---
Tell me where the hunter touched you.
---

---
"This is how I run my guild" is not in itself an interesting statement, it's going to be read with the implication of "and that's what you should expect and that is reasonable". It creates a narrative. Otherwise, I am not sure the purpose of this post? It's like "you can do meme specs, but I disapprove and will make it unpleasant". OK?
---
We don't care how you, personally, run your guild. There are going to be min-maxed world first guilds that will only do the best possible things because for them that's the only place they can get an edge. What we care about is you creating a narrative that ends up causing issues where they do not at all belong.
---
I.e., guilds that can't learn basic things like not standing in the fire caring a lot about specs or cookie cutter builds. Similar to how poorly playing groups care too much about ilvl in modern WoW when you can beat most content with a lower ilvl and other aspects of your party are more important, but since they are not easy to measure they're ignored in favor of what all the top players are doing.

I even knew some of the players on Alliance as a Horde player.  I was able to carve out a name for myself.  Whenever I came in to AV... I would immediately be given Raid Leader.  Was a great feeling.

It's not that difficult to manage your pet to not pull adds. If you are going through a skip, it's probably best to dismiss first, but you should  pull it back out for the next pull. Pets do a decent amount of the total DPS of a Hunter.
---
That's how dates work not numbers.
---
Yes I know patch numbers correspond to dates, but I couldn't remember the patch number. So 1.12 isn't far off of 1.2
---
&gt; Isnt dps just watching red bars go up and down?
---
For vanilla it's even less involved. 
---
Some classes just spam one button the entire fight. :\
---
&gt; DPS just seems like finding a rotation and doing it forever. I don't get it.
---
DPS rotations did not really start becoming a thing for all classes until Wrath, where Blizzard made a conscious effort to add "rotation" into spells (such as execution phases).
---
it also reduces threat. Rogues have a similar ability called feint, it literally does nothing but reduce aggro on your current target.
---
/r/atetheonion

I was...
---
With all these jebaits I think that I’m gonna log into Classic on launch day and it’s gonna tell me to go fuck myself lmao.
---
In all seriousness I’m happy to see so much interest for Classic
---
I have been doing this before they even announced classic. I am ahead of the game!
---
Yeah, the online chat support. They were pretty reasonable about  it.
---
My computer couldnt render thunderbluff in vanilla, navigating the city was quite difficult without textures or proper models.
---
I used a pet in 80% of dungeons. Cat with prowl + never growl + on passive + only send it when you cant pull with it and it was fine. Dismiss it completely in some situations, mainly before kiting. Was not hard at all to use a pet in dungeons safely if you arent greedy.
---
Yeah, it happened to me, but I actually able to leave message on classic beta forum section, but not play the game
---
Ahh I'm dumb. Sorry.
---
Keep these og map filler zones coming.
---
TIL OP is totally comfortable with their sexuality. Real men play Male Nelfs.

---
first thought it was a bug since it was greyed out, so uninstalled it and now ''Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic'' option is gone. So it seems like Stress Testers is not allowed to do participate.
---
I want a legendary that isnt soulbound and can be taken/lost from world pvp. Maybe it has a week timer if you dont die. Something like that idk. I just like the idea of someone running by with essentially a hot potato of a legendary
---
That kind of "depression" i welcome whole heartedly
---
There's people that actually trusts blizzard to make good content for classic?
---
Now that you mentioned it, probably. :D
---
Idk if it's a good idea but it sounds cool!
---
hits too close to home
---
By retail it will be Ooga legion.
---
I never understod this argument. I'm almost always a DPS because those are the classes I want to play outside of raids but if I had the option of DPS vs heal in raids heal wins every time, in vanilla. Raid DPS is such a one note thing unless you play like a hunter in vanilla so all you do is spam that one button pretty much the whole time. when healing you at least have to adapt to do something. Both have to do the same mechanics pretty much every encounter. I don't understand how healing is just watching green bars and DPS is something different.
---
Me too! When I played the stress test it was just SO nostalgic. I HATE questing in current wow. Hate hate HATE it. SO MUCH. It's so boring and monotonous. Run from place to place and kill everything in one fell swoop.
---
In classic, every battle feels like A BATTLE as you level. Taking 2-3 mobs on at a time gets intense and you really need to start using your entire kit at that point. Especially low low level.
---
Then finding players along the way that exchange buffs with you or group up because that elite over there is 3 levels higher and too hard to solo. Everyone shares a laugh and gets the kill.
---
It feels rewarding.
---
Every level I'm putting a point in. I can't WAIT for that next talent point, even if it's just 1% extra hit. Every 2 levels getting spell upgrades is great too. I don't care that it costs money, it makes me feel like I EARNED this awesome character. Like.. This is MY motha fridgin character. You know?
---
You were so much more connected to your characters back then, especially your main.
---
It was a real mans game. =)
---
Too cheesy...
---
They don't need to "separate the money" as they will know how many active players retail vs classic has and will also know if those people only play one or the other. If they deem it necessary to make new content for classic to keep people subscribed then that's probably what will happen.
---
I think the weakest thing they could do is just re-releasing TBC for classic realms. I'd love to see an alternate timeline expansion instead so that it doesn't have to include flying mounts.
---
Vaselin, wet wipes and a piss bucket so you don't have to shower or go to toilet.

Right there with ya.
---
We may need to go deeper tbh.
---
It all changed in MoP in my opinion. Up to Cataclysm and the killing of Deathwing, you were just one soldier among a group of soldiers. A very elite soldier, but just a soldier nonetheless. Completely replaceable and you could imagine yourself as not being a part of all these groups that did these raids.
---
All of the sudden in MoP, you are part of a much smaller task force in the main quest lines. You are just as important as the people you are talking to. This expands in Draenor where you are the commander.
---
Don't play ffxiv then. About 200 hours of cutscene of your character in diplomatic meetings with works leaders.
---
I don't see why not, you get Deadmines stuff that way. I always want Deadmines if I'm playing Alliance. Otherwise, perhaps not. :)
---
I think they have mispelled "GREATEST ERA IN GAMING" of my life.
---
The rare r/doublewoosh
---
I kind of have a rough flow chart:
---
* Do I need it really badly?
---
* Is it BIS for someone else and not for me?
---
* Does it have bad hunter stats - Str mostly
---
* Do I like these people?
---
* Can I get away with needing?
---
In general leveling I want all ranged weapons priority, so you have to kind of play nice since warriors and rogues can TECHNICALLY use them. Kinda like I can technically use that small upgrade, but it most likely won't give me a huge increase, like it might on a warrior / rogue. 
---
Going to be interesting trying to get things like the swords from UBRS, which are p1 bis for Fury / Rogues and Hunters... Since warriors will probably reserve them, you need to make friends or run with guild. 
---
Also important to realize, you don't NEED full bis - somethings are going to be a lot easier to get than others and be close to as good.
---
That fake deep serious voice is an instant channel changer for me.

Vanilla to Cata here as well. But on Alliance. Looking forward to chillin on the IF mailbox.

P.S. Kala is Finnish for fish

Not Vanilla but TBC. On Suramar Horde there was two huge guilds everyone knew, &lt;Who Is John Galt&gt; and &lt;Built Horde Tough&gt;. Who is John Galt is still around and raiding which is pretty impressive.
---
You have my sword
---
Aw man the form is my favorite part. It looks so dumb! My favorite part about it is how even though your size increases, your mount size does not. I play horde, but I had an alliance alt on retail that rode around a mechanostrider while in moonkin form. Absolutely hilarious. Not sure if you could mount while in that form in vanilla.
---
It was supposed to say Culture but, my phone corrected I guess. I can live with cultural.

On the VJJ.

Mine did that for about 20 minutes and then just disappeared completely

Haha go ahead with your 4 ench shammy/retri paladin raid with a tank who doesn’t work and tell me how your cthun killls go

Yeah, can’t really seem to find it mentioned anywhere, so I suppose it isn’t known at this point. Don’t know if it was talked about on a Q&amp;A or something.

Meshooga. I wonder if he’s a fan of the band as well.

I like cultural better.
---
My initial comment was, they are one of if not the most popular class to play. I made a wide spectrum on what I said for a reason. You're slowly widdling down what I said to make me seem even more wrong.
---
Same for me and my husband lol
---
omg that distact was the best thing ive ever seen
---
Its stats? Some intellect and spirit? Are you drunk?
---
&gt; Then I'd polish it off with a tall, cool Budweiser.
---
I have a desire to fly you to the PNW and introduce you to some local breweries.
---
Okay.
---
So Shaman's are the best shitty dps. The reason is simple, a shaman a group is useful. Unlike Ret, druids, and even shadow priests (where you only need 1 in a 40 man), you can use up to 8 shamans (or more) without a large loss. Now ideally you just want them Resto. Resto shamans provide most everything the other shamans would and are great healers (mana issues in first 2 tiers). Still its unlikely that you'll get 8 resto shamans. 4-6+ is desirable. That leaves 4-2 groups without shaman buffs. For casters while shamans are good (tranquil, mana, etc.) they shine in buffing melee. Meaning if you don't have one for every group its okay. But mana totems are also really good for the healers. 
---
By Naxx you'll be doing ~50% of top dps damage. But you can add a good amount of damage to your party members and that extra damage can make up for this. Think about it in a group pf warriors and rogues if you add ~ 12.5% damage to them you would be equal in damage to a pure dps. Ret don't don't provide this as you only need 3-4 pallies in the entire raid for their respective buffs. Shadow priest... just 1. Druids provide crit to melee or spell spec depending, but its maybe 6% damage per person ... so not as much.  
---
Now this is depending on a few other factors such as threat, rage, white damage vs yellow, etc. Say threat is limiting your casters.. well a tranq totem reduces it by 20% that is 20% more dps each can now do and your damage is similar to 110% a pure dps class. Now threat isn't always an issue and in melee you get WF totem for warriors but this can backfire with all the extra threat you cause them to generate. 
---
Overall Shaman are the best bad dps specs to have many of as you don't lose a ton of dps.
---
Once I thought it would be cool to have an underground zone below the ground level connecting various zones together. Just an idea...
---
I'm really curious to see your oppinion.
---
Please don't say human warrior
---
right in the OOF
---
Someone on Beta should be able to find the Runecloth turn in NPCs if they exist.
---
Unless you are going for like Top lvl playing where every little % matters play what you like look off and feel the coolest on
---
staysafe really sucks.... i hate the way he talks
---
1) Nobody plays elemental in PvP. You wouldn't make a PvE BIS list for arms warrior, SL warlock or reckoning paladin, either. It makes no sense.
---
2) Even if we pretend for a moment that people raid as elemental DPS, the lists aren't correct anyway, it's got out-of-phase items and is missing pieces that would be better.
---
i love how they all popped it at the same timee, so much damage!
---
I'm so excited to play! I never played much WoW, was loyal yo Everquest but dabbled a bit in WoW 10 years ago ish. I'm torn though, most of my friends are going Horde and i think it would be bad ass to be a orc shaman, but a dwarf or human paladin look fun too... what do i do?!
---
It might not be my place to give life advice, but you might consider not playing it. I’m skipping classic only because I’m sure something in my life is going to suffer for it and I don’t want that.
---
This would be a pretty aggressive throwaway account, no?
---
I was just thinking the same thing actually, after checking out the Bloodsail Bay map. Shame there's so much negativity in this thread currently. These posts are a positive element to the sub, and I hope they continue at whatever pace is good for the user.
---
I did this too. I have a whole spreadsheet worked up because I am a slut for organization.

Those that play together stay together.

Great point!
---
Healing in Vanilla is...different. 
---
Vanilla (and up to TBC IIRC) had what was referred to as "downranking". 
---
Whenever you would "buy abilities" you would get different ranks of those abilities. So Rank 1 Healing Wave would cost, say, 50 mana and heal for 80-110 health. Rank 2 Healing Wave would cost 110 mana and heal for 180-250 health, etc etc. 
---
You never "lost" access to these abilities. You can open you spell book and put them on your bar. This offers the player some interesting choices. In some occasions, it's not always better to always use your max rank spell. In some cases you would "downrank" you spell. 
---
The shaman gets a talent in restoration that increases his target's armor by 25% if they are hit by a critical healing wave spell. So you could take your rank 1 healing wave spell, and fish for that crit on your target to give them that buff. 
---
Shaman also have a talent that increases each subsequent healing wave by ~4%, stackable 3 times. So once again you would cast three Rank 1 Healing Wave spells on the target to give them this buff. Then you could cast your second to highest, or third to highest Healing Wave spell. You'll save mana and still heal decently well. 
---
In these situations you would only cast your max rank heal if you really needed to heal someone who was badly hurt. 
---
This interaction allowed players to add depth to their characters. It offered dynamic healing options for the player. However, it does have some obvious drawbacks. 
---
1) This system was unintentional. Blizzard did not anticipate the players playing in this fashion. 
---
2) It unbalanced some aspects of the game. The above example with the shaman is a good one. It was not intended for the shaman to heal in that way. To stack buffs or fish for buffs on the target. 
---
3) While the downranking system added depth to the game, Blizzard had to identify what made healing fun / effective, and then make that work before pulling the carpet out from under the players. So it took them another expansion to finally put that change in. 
---
4) Vanilla is a product of its time. Certain classes are well in certain roles. 
---
Paladins were ***amazing*** tank healers in Vanilla, but they had zero group heals available to them. 
---
Shaman were ***amazing*** group healers in Vanilla. Chain Heal was a "smart cast" and so it typically bounced to the next person that needed the healing most so it was very efficient. However, they ***sucked*** at main tank healing. 
---
Healing Wave is costly and doesn't "get good" unless you have those buffs I mentioned earlier. Unless you downrank your healing waves like I mentioned earlier ;)
---
So is it fun? Downranking adds depth to the way you heal which can be interesting and feels good. 
---
However, it can often trivialize content since you are ***hyper*** efficient with your mana to hp ratio.
---
Theres no mystery we do it xD. Nice of them to make an instance for us to farm.
---
Well most of the time your pet is lower level than you since they dont level up sametime as you do like warlock pets. So having a lower level pet increases aggro range in melee, and if your pet aggros something... everyones gonna be mad. :(
---
That was one reason not to use pet when clearing trash in dungeons.
---
Glad she got beta access and not one of us ..
---
I remember respecting from feral to balance in Vanilla. I thought “well, it won’t be as fast, but I’ll still have fun!”
---
It was not. It was not fun at all.
---
Sorry baby, no date tonight, ive go to raid. You know the guild is short on healers. I cant let everyone down. Thats like 40 people!
---
Where are you going? Babe?
---
Thanks for letting me know. Those values don’t seem terrible for that level range, but seem to be lower than pservers just going from memory. I’ll try testing the values out on pserver later and compare.
---
Or you can actually play well and control the pet
---
You're no changes but you wouldn't mind summoning stones and you think respec costs should be lowered? What am I even reading?
---
Couldnt have said this better myself.
---
Why post farming spots?
---
So it can become over farmed and ineffective?
---
It's not because you're glad since TBC that you'll be good in vanilla PvE it's different
---
Been hearing about this. Do you have any examples of what he was like during the pserver days?
---
It wasnt in vanilla, so it wont be in Classic. It really is that simple.
---
What do you think of this video ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=n5-yNSjlffI
---

---
Most depressing era rofl
---
sigh you're being generous lol
---
I dont agree that Vancleef had minimal control. He orchestrated a way to get resources from all the mines across 2 zones to one particular place. Thats not indicative of someone whos just a figurehead. And when it comes to money he has plenty of it because of the gold mines under his control. This is directly addressed in "The Collector" mini quest chain. Same time we find out the Gnolles and Kobolds work for him. Highway robbery is nothing more than supplemental income.
---
You don’t make Moonkin work. 
---
Moonkin makes you work.
---
im a poly-gaymer-ist, i level up my alts while i prep the bull
---
If you can communicate you will win against random pugs a lot more than 30%. Against premades with proper class comp though you’re likely to get stomped.
---
Not ranting, I am open to reasoning, and I am chill. You're entirely wrong and still made no points.
---
Never really had that problem. I would tame a cat in the starting area and keep it until I could get BT. Pet stayed at level or one level below while I leveled.
---
That worked for me in Ranger school. Skinny people don’t survive.
---
I can empathize with people criticizing the volume hes putting out I guess, but like I've said elsewhere in the thread, the openings from his posts would probably be filled with the same 5 questions that this sub gets lambasted with anyways.
---
Great Video. Short and helpful

What professions are you guys picking on your hunter? Since my hunter is gonna be my main I'm looking for something that makes good money.  On the fence between herb/alch or skinning/leatherworking. Skinning could be good since I'm gonna be killing lots of beasts anyway, but Alchemy seems more usefull and profitable in the end game. What do you think?
---
Yeah, but you can bang that out in seconds once you are ready to run deadmines. In fact, it makes much more sense to be doing the westfall quests while waiting for the deadmines group to either form, or actually get to the instance.
---
I have leveled a lot of humans, and I really feel like showing up early to westfall is always a mistake. 
---
There's just nothing there early, and you do a bunch of wasted effort to boot, like for example, having to "report to stoutmantle", then courier something to stormwind, then go to lakeshire, then carry messages both ways between lakeshire and westfall, then go report to lakeshire about the defias: see how a lot of those things are basically the same step? go to the flight master?.
---
If you show up at 16, the flight costs are nowhere near as hard on your finances, and you can do all the courier quests in a batch. the defias quest chain, the "lakeshire is lonely and wants help" quest chain, the "dry times" quest chain, and the "lewis wants you to prove you know how to work the flight master" quest chain can all be completed in a single batch, while also unlocking all the flight points to do them.
---
Chromie was always best girl.
---
Staff? I think you mean hand of rag.
---
I agree. Maybe have a day between each and use the extra time to flesh out the ideas.
---
I killed C'thun in vanilla as a 21/0/30 Paladin... That's probably the worst example of a fight you could have picked. Being able to burst eye tentacles actually helps on that fight.
---
But the reality is that, before Naxx, no fights are actually difficult enough to require any specific composition.
---
within the last 4 years of my life i have:
---
\- climbed kilimanjaro
---
\- been to florida, kenya/tanzania, sweden, norway
---
\- been in a long term relationship
---
\- tried having a fuckbuddy for a while
---
\- been to countless gigs and a bunch of mini-festivals
---
\- actually had a proper social life for once
---
\- played on ely with a fun guild
---
guess which i enjoyed the most??  thats right my old guild was such a fucking good laugh.  Everything else on the list came with big downsides like cost, effort, emotional trauma, maintenence. 
---
honestly guys dont go out and get friends, its such a pain in the ass.  being invited out to shit you dont really want to go to but are kind of obliged to?  having to chip in for birthday presents for people you dont reeeeally care about that much?  getting beer-fear from hangovers every weekend?
---
stick to WoW boys
---
This is totally going on the wall in my office.
---
It depends on what you want an addon for and your level of programming knowledge.

TukUI and ElvUI will be released for classic, and provide near total UI overhaul. Tuk requires lua knowledge to really make much use of though.

Hahaha calling rng damage burst 😂
---
Alright fair enough. I’ll come up with some better #changes tomorrow!
---
It's really far off. 9 major patches and 22 minor patches off.
---
With wack-a-mole, you hit things.  With healing, you un-hit things.
---
"Yeah it honestly doesn’t matter that much what spec you play it’s still piss easy vanilla content I’m just warning people that if they want to go into it min maxing and being the best dps they can be to avoid this stuff. You can kill any boss in the game with feral druids and ret paladins in your raid, in a loot council guild just don’t expect loot over others and everything will be fine."
---
I don't think anyone cares about what spec you want to play, truly couldn't possibly care less. BUT to say that the meme specs are just as good as the normal shit is misleading people into thinking it's good. Imagine you have never played Classic before and someone tells you "man Ret paladin is really good" and you pick paladin and level to 60 as ret having a BLAST auto attacking the entire way. You get to 60 and now it's time to find a guild...how come no one wants me? I thought ret was good???
---
Yyyyyikes for some reason your comment was the first time that I genuinely flashed forward to myself experiencing this.
---
Arrow fodder...
---
So you acknowledge you (they) all are a bunch of fanatics
---
Bro I went to do that today and the other guy in my position had that week booked off :( I have to wait until the 1st of September
---
You don’t know how they numbered their vanilla patches lol. They don’t have anything to do with dates. 1.2 came out in December 04, 1.12 (**which was 10 major patches later**) came out August 06.
---
They are numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, **then** 1.12.
---
You really couldn’t have been much further away, actually.
---
At least you're not me on a boat in the middle of the ocean for work when i have Classic beta at home lol.
---
HoJ + JoC
---
If she's a keeper, to the nearest electronic store to roll a class in need
---
Only is xLegolasx isn’t taken of course.
---
The vast majority of people first getting to STV are power levelers and they won't care about ganking others. I'm guessing you'll be part of the second or third string of people hitting stv :p
---
How could it possibly be someone is threatened, ah yes i myself as a main tank warrior am threatened by the thought of being out dpsed by feral druids and ret paladins. I'm not saying you can't play meme specs. Look below i said 
---
This man knows.
---
Blood thirst + whirlwind, and he won’t run oom.

---
lol I'm not sure how I missed that, my bad
---
I booked the week of about 20 minutes after the date was announced. Not fuckin around with that lol.
---
Yes.  They're even against changes that would make the game more authentic, like nerfing warrior threat generation.
---
Cringe
---
Yup, I agree sir. Got super excited, then the wtf happened
---
I had no idea what the story is apparently but you make it sound very interesting!
---
What's with The Onion posting this accurate journalism? I thought they were a satire publication service.
---
It wasnt hard true but it also wasnt reliable. Pets didnt have the best pathing or attack range compared to melee and they didnt know how to go behind  the enemy automatically. (prowl is best and having it on passive is wise)
---
It was a whole different ballgame in vanilla tho. Trash mobs ran away, if your pet was on it you better be quick to call it back or it might go and pull extras... considering how tightly packed all dungeons were back then it wont be that big of a gimp if you can avoid wipes easier.
---
And pets died very easily too... they didnt have any aoe dmg reduction so if you had pet attacking in dungeons, many bosses and even trash did aoe damage and your pet takes full force of it. Considering they also have lower health pools than players and dont know how to avoid such things, you would end up controlling your pet alot more than focusing on your own rotation.
---
And it was harder to do with computers of that era... maybe its alot easier now.
---
I surely didnt waste my time trying to manage my pet in molten core with 5 fps computer performance and almost every mob in there did aoe attacks which kill your pet  and mend pet is a big waste of mana. :P
---
As a vanilla hunter i personally dont see how pets usefulness outweights its negatives in raids (or even some dungeons) considering how easily they can die. I always valued arrows more than petfood in inventory.
---
But i admit its been 14 years so things may have changed and without a doubt i was younger back then.
---
&gt; The shadow graphic update transferred over to classic wow is going to dampen a lot of non stealthy classes ability to launch a surprise attack. 
---
Can you elaborate on this?
---
How are you guys who watch streamers all day going to transition into no-life playing classic? 🙄
---
Irony.
---
Where are all the trash mobs in those videos?  There's other people there to help clear the trash.
---
I made many nooby mistakes back then, but my biggest was to never try to build a long lasting friendship with this mage. I didn't put too much thought into it.
---
Well, I still made some friends in Wrath and it was definetely a beautiful time nonetheless. I think the same is applied for this gnome mage
---
Don't forget to name it Lègølas

How are they level 58? Did cap increase again ?
---
I would be livid. I took a temporary assignment to duty to be out on a boat in the ocean for 2 months to help pass the time by and be back before classic releases. And then they would drop that shit on me i would be so far behind on all of my plans that i had set out before doing this.
---
Either way this article is hella funny
---
Never a dull day down here in Florida.
---
Jokes on you, I’m more depressed now than I’ve ever been!
---
I think this fucker booked the week off at the beginning of the year... He must have an inside guy at Blizzard
---
Alright it's clear that Druids needs to be nerfed. Their puns are absurdly overpowered. Also, cool that you're rolling a druid! From what I've heard, they're few and far between.
---
The game was designed to be fun, not make fuckloads of money. At some point they started chasing dollars and engagement instead of fun and thats where we all lost.
---
I personally love going ambush. It’s just the most fun spec to me. I used to do it and try and solo as many bosses as I could while leveling... you’d be amazed the bosses you could solo going full ambush. Just gotta time your Vanishes perfectly and have some good gear.
---
I always struggled to tell the difference between the fat disgusting pig and the boar that's in Elywnn Forest
---
Yeah, my stress test beta thing came back in the launcher, it updated, then play is greyed out...fuck...fuck you blizzard for teasing me with salt in the wound you fuckers
---
"Ranged Weapon Specialization" increases damage by 1% per point, it doesnt increase range.
---
Just don’t play paladin lol
---
Thanks for taking your time to do this. You didnt mention getting any blues from the lootboxes which is something I first noticed. Also the price diff in rogue’s diaries is indeed very noticeable. In your other comment you mention the money loot range, which seems more or less similar. RFD is still the place to be with herbalism included
---
Dude keep putting posts out, love to hear the stories. I never got to be a part of WoW the first run around so excited to experience it fresh this time and hearing some of these stories makes me even more pumped!
---
Now make it into a patch that one can wear on a bag or jacket
---
I had full ret pallies heal 5 mans in vanilla no problem. They were wearing healing gear, and that's the key thing in terms of throughput. Aside from that you just had to drink a little more.    
---
As to MC? It isn't ideal, but depending on raid composition/gear it might not be noticed. Keep in mind you've given up a flat 5% increase in healing throughput (via 5% crit), Imp LoH (which is incredible on tanks), and Imp. BoW (other healers/you). You're also missing BoK which might be unpopular if no other Pally is bringing it.
---
Dwarf looks best in tier sets imo and have better shooting animations.
---
Stoneform is way better than nelf stealth. Whereas nelfs turn invisible to hide like cowards, you can literally turn into rock. Laugh as your enemies break their bones upon your body.
---
Beard.
---
As a dps, healing is way harder, more interesting and more important than dps. Yes we may be looking at the boss more than the healers, but I’ve dipped into healing and the coordination among the healers was really impressive.
---
They'll be fine. That was generally the case before because the debuff limit was 8 in MC and some of BWL.
---
Tier 3 sets are mostly BiS if they match your role (tank warrior, healer druid/pld/shm). The earlier tiers often have better items, but the tier gear is usually a lot easier to get so its what most people will end up using.
---
It's fine. I'd probably take sanc aura and consecration of the alternatives. Talent spec is much, much less important than having proper gear for a role.
---
Admittedly playing WoW has the same effect.
---
See same here, They look a lot alike.
---

---
oh god...
---
Time to get depressed m\*\*\*ers!
---
Oh yeah. Add the wind fury from a shaman and you're laughing.
---
It is, no point in putting points into Parry when "Deterence" already increases it (and dodge) by 25%, which is good enough..
---
Unless you're going for a build were you want to maximize your dodge and parry, it's better to put  points into Humanoid Slaying.
---
Sounds British lol
---
This... So much
---
Yeah, uh... it's a rare nice day today, but I'm sure soon enough it's going to get back to alternating between obnoxiously humid heat and overcast thunderstorms.  Sure, in my part of the state we got beaches, we got a nice river cutting through town, all kinds of shopping, plenty of places to live.  But the weather, man... the damn weather.  I used to work at the beach, and one winter day we walked down the street for lunch, it was a lovely sunny day.  We sat outside, but it was a bit warm, so moved under an umbrella.  Then chilled a bit, so we move inside.  As we sat there, we watched a fog roll in that enveloped everything on the other side of the street, then rolled over our side and past.  By the time we headed back, less than an hour, it was chilly and less than a block of visibility.
---
But on the rare days it's good, it's great.
---
Dad checking in. I laughed too hard at this. He is so fucked. I actually cannot imagine life with 3 infants.
---
Right because block is just shield block value in damage reduction not like in TBC where block became actual avoidance.

Thanks to the user for pointing my last post there was no link to the video. Only an image url.

I checked it straight after and the guy was right. This is fixed now.
---
Apology for messing this up.
---
You use BM/MM hybrid is better when you dont have T3 gear yet, but when you do, the +%15 agility buff you get from Survival will scale your damage better..
---
I doubt that
---
Does anyone else see "Warlords of Draenor Alpha" patch notes if you click "patch notes" next to the Play button?

If not, then maybe I had Warlords alpha test I never noticed 5 years ago? Lol?

Side note put on catch thirty three and nothing on repeat when youre leveling for 20% xp boost

Yeah. Dailies replacing straight up grinding completely ruined the players ability to drive their own story. Instead of waiting for weeks people who grinded hard could get ahead. Now everything is time gated and no matter how much time you put in johnny casual can catch up.
---
Very nice.  
---
gonna be fun to head to these classic dungeons all again.... like Mauradon, Dire Maul.  All in their lengthy goodness.
---
that's pretty neat
---
Druid is generally ~10% if not less of the total population.
---
Of that I am going something even more rare, FERAL. I already have a guild who want me as feral (tank and some damage)
---
Can't wait.
---

---
Is it considered a clone?
---
Ohhh so wrong
---
he's even balder than asmon under that hat

You can manually run the executable but it just gives the same realms not available message when you log in.
---
Good thing depression has been doing that for me already. Classic can cure it and the weight.
---
The heroes we need.
---
Thank you for clarifying, I just wanted to make sure OP new that it wasn't just dodge.
---
Trueeeeeeee dat.
---
Ok but i dont think for pvp I would wanna go survival either way, I would lose a lot of tools like intimidation and beastial wrath.
---
Server: Nathrezim
---
Guild: In Absentia (MY RL Friends and others we gathered along the way)
---
I forget the guild that was "so gud" on our server but there was a Gnome Mage named Obs who was first to 70 after TBC launched. 
---
Tokro was a (Troll?) Hunter that was notorious for STV ganking *CONSTANTLY*. Good times were had. 
---
Shoutouts to the following whom I only got to know in TBC:
---

"Guiness Drinkers LLC", "Body Pull" before the merger with another guild.
---
People: 
---
Arles-Peruvian Mage 
---
Arlengen-Holy Pally (SP?) 
---
Katrin-Feral Druid and about seven other characters
---
Jeth-Ret Pally
---
Tandrister-Priest of all forms
---
Suolucidir-The most entertaining Warlock evar
---
Rorii-Prot Warrior and my fellow tank for a long time
---
**AND MANY OTHERS**
---
Rank 10 gets you the full blue pvp set. Rank 11 is the mount, after that comes the epics.
---
I would imagine it's fairly close, the reason it's usually only BiS for 39 is when you hit 40 you're typically up against 49 BiS.
---
Yes. You and the other hundred people posting this.
---
lol Goodluck being feral in a raid
---
Shit that was the least depressing part.  Spending my childhood on wow was great.  My life sucks now
---
You can get to teldrassil in like 10minutes of travel from the dwarf starting zone if you get lucky with boat timers. Just death skip to kharanos and death skip to menethil harbor
---
I don't, but I think it'd be a fun challenge come Phase 3.
---
Vael might be tough, but with enough consumables it could be possible.
---
What if that era never left?
---
"You guys let the ooga-gang spit in our faces?!"
---
Guess what
---
Yeah, it still would be.
---
If you want to get clever with an "SJW Squad" then you do something like pick names like, say, Sally, Jessie, and Wendy.  So they have normal names, but together they spell out "SJW," which gets the joke in without being so over the top that it's not funny.
---
Similarly, you can't just target male streamers and go "Oh, SJWs hate white males!"  Nope, commit to the bit in-universe.  Make up a reason for every ganking.  "You didn't help that quest-giver in Goldshire because they weren't rich enough for you!"  Doesn't have to be accurate, just something that sounds plausible in the setting.
---
Ah I got confused with Hawkeye, my mistake

Yeah, I always saw Uldum as another titan facility specifically. Ala Uldaman and Ulduar. Not as a huge entire zone like it turned out to be.

Always intrigued by what had escaped from that door.

Is it hard to get into a good raiding guild as a hunter?   Seems like they're overpopulated, and everyone wants to min/max the raid composition, so they invite almost no hunters.
---
upvoted, expected this ref much higher dammit :)
---
thanks Omar
---
I love dwarves too. Never played WoW before though.
---
You need to do 50% dmg to it :(
---
Used to do a 0/25/26 build for PVP, was fantastic. Warrior charges, no problem. Can even kite most melee classes by using scatter/traps/wing clip/counter attack. Will probably roll that again for lvl 60 pvp.
---
Thanks Omar
---
I had the same thought, but people are saying your pet sucks when you get T1/T2/T3 gear cause you (and everyone else) get stronger, but your pet doesnt.. But still Intimidation seems OP which I think should offset the damage gains you get from survival (not Beastial Wrath cause again you pet doesnt do that much damage).. IDK, I'll have to test them both out when I get to that point.
---
Florida was against my will really haha, i've never been to the US apart from that and I wanted to go somewhere remote like Wyoming... but my friend decided to marry his girl from Vermont... in Florida.

Darkshore has much better gear and way more total quest exp.  It's most pronounced for melee and particularly mail melee (there are 2 major soloable weapons quests in darkshore: The first is much earlier than the people's militia (the red crystal one), and the second is much better than the people's militia (the one where you loot relics that naga spawn around, the sword is 13 instead of 11.2 dps and the 1 handed mace is 10 instead of 8.something dps). 
---
As a hunter, if you want a ranged weapon, darkshore has one, (but it's a high level quest). Westfall does not. 
---
Just compare the databases. 35 quests, or 73 quests, for zones which both have mobs leveled between 10 and 20?  One of those is enough density to comfortably get you from 10-16. The other is absolutely not. 
---
It's much more efficient just to do all the quests on the first 2 loops out of auberdine, (up to when you are fighting grizzled bears or trying to kill den mother or the naga), then run off to westfall and you can do ALL the westfall quests in like 150 mob kills.
---
was so happy as i saw the beta option in my client again, updated &gt; cant login.......... thx for the false hopes
---
Lmao, oh yah he really got me! These are two changes that help people do more things because they are not burdened by the cost of respec. A prot tank can enjoy their time off playing arms in BGs and not pay a fortune for it. People can do dungeons that they normally would not want to or have access to if you just get two people to the front door. These help people experience more content in more dynamic ways. So far the only arguments are that "it's supposed to be expensive to respec" and "if they let us summon to dungeons how will we see exploration content?" which results in people not seeing the dungeon content at all because they don't want to have to walk to far-away locations. I put almost 2 years of in-game time into Vanilla Wow. I raided on the bleeding edge. These are changes that still preserve the core game but drastically help the casual player and hardcore player alike.
---
haha well it was an experience!  it was for a wedding though, i didnt really want to go there
---
i hope i can heal as a shaman 30/0/21
---
i dont want to keep respecing
---
Yeah i might have to think about picking up imp LoH, That's defiantly something to think about making myself a target.
---
I really like what you're doing, but I hope they do something more creative with the unused parts of the map than just make more questing zones.
---
Housing areas, open-world battlegrounds, a zone entirely filled with high-level elites and open-world raid bosses. Or even a combination of these things. Imagine a zone with an Alliance housing area on one end, a Horde housing area on the other, and an AV-like battleground in between. In the rare instances that the stalemate breaks and one side wins, they could get the chance to break through and loot the otherwise-blocked-off enemy housing zone (not that the losing side would necessarily lose anything, but for a day or so the housing area would look burned and looted).
---
Same with mine, anyone know what is going on with it?
---
Perfect nelf beard and hair, just change it to purple.
---
You should roll on it if it is an upgrade for you. 
---
You can use 2h and dual wield 1h weapons. 
---
If it's an upgrade for a melee player you should ***probably*** let them have it since the melee weapons for a hunter is essentially a stat stick.
---
What is going on with the button? I have it too and I don’t know why it’s doing that
---
Despite what many people think. Classic is the most casual friendly version of the game. The issue is though. That it is also the iteration of the game that is most likely to steal your soul. So people have a hard time being casual.
---
Stats don’t make broken useless sets viable. They just give a small stat bump to a broken spec design. The fundamental flaws are still there. Tweaking set bonuses can alter abilities and make specs useful. 
---
But rolling 40mans with a ton of warriors and mages and priests is cool too I guess. As long as the rest of you do what we say and play how we tell you too. Get in line chumps and be happy you even got an invite.
---
Cool, my point wasn't about damage or utility though. It was about that frickin: SKRAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
---
The right way to fix this would have been a story mode where you have a quest that takes you through the raids but you don't kill anything. You just go in to scout it out and maybe get a reward at the end. This way you experience the story element and get a teaser of what you might face if you decided to go in and fight. Instead we got LFR where bosses are loot pinatas and you are showered in garbage loot with the occasional epic thrown in.
---
You need to get proficient at kiting. 
---
Shaman lack the ability to close the gap / cleanse snares and slows when fighting. You have multiple tools at your disposal to keep them away from you, and even doing things like soft resetting the fight with traps.
---
Can't wait to see you in my layer
---
Better run your ass to Darn.
---
Yeah need to come prepared to the raid next time and dump the gf
---
I’m running from Teldrassil to the Dwarf starting area! Do what you want! It only costs an hour or less of your play time, which is gonna be a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of your played hours.
---
Iirc you need certain level for certain cloth types.
---
With beta being gated at lvl 40 it should be wool/silk donations, maybe mageweave. If that's available then runecloth is also a thing.
---
I wasn't subbed so I knew everyone else was getting Jebaited.
---
I remember them saying that most new players never made it past level 11 before quitting.
---
I’m talking about live....
---
It is!
---
ah, yeah lol
---
Wyoming is incredibly beautiful. If you ever come back here and have a chance to go to Yellowstone, take it.
---
Grass is always greener on the other side. I'd kill for a date right about now.
---
What era are you from? AQ10? It was 20 or 40 in vanilla.
---
Westfall is pretty crap for leveling. Every Alliance guide avoids it.
---
I remember a rank 14 feral druid, he was always friendly to me and helped me out when i had PVP questions, he was insanly good at dueling and a lot of people on the server knew him. He was a tauren female wich was incredibly rare back then, i even remember asking why you play tauren female and he said "because no one else does" :D
---
You show em'!
---
Alliance = PvE easy mode
---
Took them a long ass time to figure out a good way to present it rofl.
---
Ah yes, my two favorite things in the world. Boku no Hero Academia, and getting my balls busted on the reg by Blizzard.
---
Pretty sure you’re right, I think the technique spread like wildfire after the first guys pulled it off.
---
Meh, I worked it out with my guild that easier shit, I'd play Boomkin and swap to Resto when needed. Worked out well cuz they actually let me use DKP on cloth shit so you know I'd actually be useful and Balance.
---
Man I miss those days. Was also the last time I healed. After that it's always been tank with dps offspec on all characters.
---
Herecy! This video is a timeless classic!
---
I thought the Onion was supposed to be satire?
---
And you entered a new zone and didnt have a loading screen first. And that asshole other faction ganker just kept following you.
---
Out of curiosity, what type of boat is it?
---
Well, I suppose it's possible if you live in Mississippi, that is if I'm rememberin the rotation of the Earth correctly.
---
I think there is a ton of people like us! Pretty much ran 3 nights a week 3 hours a night (give or take) from vanilla thru wrath plus all the pugs and alt runs through content the guild wasn't farming anymore.  I just love to tank, always down to run something.  But I have a wife and a 2 year old now, I good job I get up early for where I cant be on auto pilot.  Hoping to play a couple nights a week, couple hours a night, and catch the "late to the party group of raids" with alts and people like me.  No server first, no top guild on the server, and no "best geared" toon around.  Just a did in some blues hoping to catch an epic.
---
The fuck are you talking about?
---
I like TB's music, especially that part that goes:  
---
Looping: TUM ts ts ts  TUM ts ts ts TUM TUM TUM ts ts ts  
---
naaaaaaaaaa... na na naaaa...  
---
na NA naaaaa... na NA na na...
---
naaaaaaaaaa... na na naaaa NAAAAA...
---
na NA naaaaa... na NA na...   
---
**no NA naaaa..............**  
---
(What is really cool is that you know exactly what part I am talking about.)
---
I'm a lost Vikings baby.
---
NE's have the highest agility for Alliance, which makes them great Hunters and Rogues. Then there's Shadowmeld, which is always awesome for PvP regardless of class. Also, they're the best looking Alliance race with the best mount who also flip when they jump. This isn't rocket surgery
---
Don’t forget Destiny at launch!
---
Gamers shouldn’t settle so easily!  Not okay (and not a good model) to release a half-finished game and improve it 3 years later when it’s player base has been greatly reduced due to a poor launch.
---
i have spent quite a few hours looking around google maps at remote places and just wishing to put on a flannel shirt and drive a truck around.  I love huge deep pine forests and wide open spaces by mountain rages &lt;3 
---
here in the UK there is no wilderness left... you're never more than about 10 minutes walk from the nearest road or franchise pub.  It's fucking tragic this country is the most beautiful place on earth and it used to be pretty much just 1 big forest and now look at it...
---
So much yes. Gonna see if it's possible to get their armor.
---
It’s technically only a wipe if everyone dies. Hunters/rogues preventing wipes since 2004!
---
I spy someone who didn't rock vanilla
---
Love it. And that's spot on.
---
I've tried to balance it out by pushing myself to work harder than ever the next few months and then reward myself by chilling for a week.
---
This is the actual pro tip
---
I’m at work but when i get home i can post my spec.
---
meeeeeeeh it depends heavily on the girl.  most of them are extremely dull and/or shy so you have to do a lot of work on a first date
---
i had a few nice dates with a gorgeous irish lass last summer.  she was smart too... real wife material but unfortunately she was moving back to Ireland so we only had 3 dates
---
apart from that it's been pretty shite
---
I see Deku I up vote.
---
If you’re in no rush, I would make the trip to Elwynn forest right away ! I’m sad I don’t get to level there, being as I’m horde lol.
---
This is perfect because I’m wanting to join the seedless grapes club in the near future.
---
They are literally 13 levels above her in this clip and if you watch the whole VOD this is like the 6th time they kill her in 10 minutes. She's just bad and they are great tho right?
---
You ever been? The sluts and beaches are incredible
---
Hunters out in the open are incredibly frustrating to deal with for most classes. Hunters are fantastic peelers and can fulfill offense, defense, and midfield roles in bgs.
---
Aspects, traps, and stings offer a lot of utility and counter play. Cleanse-happy healers find themselves quickly out of mana as you spam r1 viper stings. Warriors and Rogues suddenly lose damage as scorpid sting saps their strength and agility. Snares for days. Cheetah to kite melee - when they stop to shoot, cancel cheetah and laugh as they waste even more time.
---
Track Humanoids allows you to make calls for your team in WSG. Seeing the enemy in real time on your minimap is great. Track Humanoids also allows you to be constantly aware of your surroundings in the open world.
---
Even with poor gear you can still be an absolute menace as your most annoying CC comes from talents. You are one of the best equipped to deal with elusive druids, even those that pop free action potions. Scare Beast, Scatter Shot, FD+Freezing Trap burns precious seconds off of FAPs. Forcing a druid trinket early is a big play. 
---
You are anti-stealth. Being able to Mark a Rogue or Druid flag runner from the GY, as well as sending pet to break their stealth is intimidating and frustrating.
---
Once you get gear, your burst damage suddenly 1-2 shots priests and mages, put everyone else sub 50% within a couple of gcds.
---
You go imp poisons only once u have the appropriate set bonus from t2
---
Of course I am! I'm obviously not _only_ here to call out people when they make shit up, that's just a bonus! Classic is going to be great, this team of Blizzard seems to listen and will surely work out the kinks of layering before launch!
---
Imagine being such a piece of shit that you celebrate 3 level 40s ganking and corpse camping a level 27 mage. 
---
Grow the fuck up holy shit.
---
This mage is arcane :)
---
wow i havent been to uldum since start of cata... kinda got a bit nostaligic right now
---
simply making the area shouldnt be much of a problem, filling it with content though would. quests arent ez to make
---
This pleases Slaanesh.
---
That doesn't require walljumping. All you need is slowfall.
---
I was so salty before, when I got passed over. Now that I'm unsubbed I can watch and see the salt mine and enjoy it.
---
For some reason i feel this is so true for me right now...
---
Playing on a PvP server for a PvE game where there is no risk of loss isn’t brave or being a tough guy. So no it doesn’t make you a wimp. Now if someone wants say you are for not rolling on a PvP server, tell them to come back when they have played on actual PvP games with full loot where there are real consequences.
---
Nice! I loved your content there, it’s a shame HoTS kinda died. 
---
What are your plans now as far as content creation?
---
When i wake up!
---
God what id give to have been able to see that guys face when one day he arrives to work and the management be like "hey fam we are making classic"
---
After our ret pally killed C'Thun as the last man standing with a Judgement crit, I will never shit-talk ret pallies ever again.
---
If it's not your thing there's no shame in it. There are loads of us who don't get much out of world pvp since the majority of it is ganks/you have zero chance of fighting back vs someone 15+ levels higher. (We're just not as vocal about it.)
---
I enjoy the open world for PvE/Questing/Dungeons etc. When I want to PvP, I queue for a BG and enjoy myself. PvE is just do what you want, when you want to. You don't get your time wasted with corpse runs when you're trying to do something else.
---
It's not wimpy. It's just another style of play. Fuck anyone who tries to brand it as lesser.
---
I don't really recommend Consecration because you won't be AoE grinding and you won't be wasting mana on throwing it down all the time.
---
I will also be wearing the same clothes for a week straight from launch day.
---
Are you going because of the owls? Or you just like the area?
---
Sorry I'm just thinking as a hunter haha.  I've never really leveled there, I've always brought my ally toons to Elwynn
---
I was in both stress tests but don't have this in my catalog :( anyone else?
---
Counterpoint: can’t kill myself if I have gold to farm for epic riding
---
I think you'll be fine. The thing is, everyone is gonna be leveling at the same time, so you won't be getting ganked by 60s.
---
I never said summoning stones have anything to do with bringing or not bringing warlocks.  Also, I don't disagree with you regarding the convenience or gold saved from dual specs.  See my other post in this thread regarding player/class identity.
---
"Grow the fuck up holy shit" is quite a reaction to one player killing another in a video game. Somehow the other streamers that got ganked had fun with it. 
---
Go play retail with Fandy if it bothers you so much, dork.
---
Holy power is too good to give up
---
To be fair, 1.12 came out in 2006. And that’s the version we are playing—phases content release or not. (I mean technically it’s 1.14, but you get it).
---
Cheers from Mom's basement.
---
Its too early to suggest things like this
---
Hmmmm interesting.  Any good guides you can recommend?
---
You know your mouse is hovering over Orc for a reason. Let the Hardiness consume you.
---
Vanilla is all about work.  So it's clearly the best pick.
---
Joke's on you, I've been doing that since vanilla ended!
---
Thank you, it most definitely is!
---
I really hope post-naxx content is community driven like this. That would be hype as fuck.
---
Sorry but that’s terrible advice above. You should definitely play if you want to even with limited time. 
---
Sure you won’t hit rank 14 or be in a cutting edge raid guild but that doesn’t mean you still can’t have fun. 
---
I played back in vanilla and some of best times I had were landing at Tarren Mill to see half the server stomping each other in world pvp. You don’t need to sink massive hours into the game to enjoy it.  I’d personally rather spend two hours in a rolling battle between TM and SS than watching tv or something equally mundane 9 times out of 10.
---
Sounds like Montana is right up your alley too
---
Sadly I checked and have that as well lol
---
Ya exactly! My issue is that running through STV is hard enough at 19 which I was then and then some asshole 60 has to kill me after I barely escaped a damn gorilla and forces me to ghost run for 10 minutes just so he can do it 3 more times. Wtf ,coward. I’d never do that it just seems cowardly.
---
So it's still recommended to go to westfall? Just after I finish Darkshore?
---
Is it better to just never go to westfall at all? And just continue through to whatever is after darkshore? I've never been that far
---
Gl, but keep in mind that Blizz said 1.12, and it means 1.12, warts and all. No point in beating rotten horse, except if just for "what if" fun.
---
I mean just level quick be slightly ahead of the pack to first 60 and you won’t be getting ganked as much. Or just roll PVE
---
Honestly its probably better for you to go to her. Darkshore is the best zone for leveling on Alliance. Westfall is more fun with its quest chain though.
---
Horde just get Barrens, and then more Barrens. And a bit more Barrens after that. At least its safe lol
---
Im saying if someone births 3 of ur children it doesnt mean they should tell you to cut your dick lmao
---
yes.
---
what are you taking before that? Imp Evis?
---
Give me all the flying buttresses.
---
She ain’t a lady if she’s under 280 (tons of solid granite)
---
No humans are dumb in game, I like how troll hunters shoot their bow but I think tauren and orc look cooler for all the classes they share with troll.  Best looking though is human or dwarf Paladino's in full tier 2 armor (only exception I make for humans because that set is bamf)
---
Woulda been a nice touch to have the crystals on the left and right be purple and orange.
---
To piggyback on this: I remember in plaguelands when I leveled during wrath of the lich king, there was a pvp flagged area where you fight over towers. It was a ghost town, of course (level 60 zone when level 80 was max). Was it used at all during vanilla? are there any other good world pvp zones for pve servers? 
---
Or is it just waiting for battlegrounds to drop, or running around pvp flagged and hoping someone likes his chances?
---
Appreciate the link
---
WoW originally had you lose exp with spirit rez but that was before I started vanilla
---
I don't understand why blizzard fucks with us so much, like we got it we did not get beta and never will but to tease us with an updated client and saying oh yeah guys the menu will only appear for stress tests is a joke.
---
Ever want to see what happens when I man-stag bangs a living rock lady???
---
Classic plus in the spirit of vanilla is a great idea. Then we get the dummies who go "No ChAnGeS, WoW ClaSSiC ShluLD be a MuZeUm PIeCe", and want the server to restart every some years so they can play the same game ad nauseum.
---
He cleared them himself? and most of the DM tribute run trash dont need to be cleared... just run through and feign death.
---
I recently watched the tribute one and he showed how to get to the boss.
---
it sucks. unfortunately dating has evolved (or devolved) into this social media hookup culture. new person every night on tinder ect. I'm of the impression that a good foundation for a romantic relationship is one built on a friendship, not a one night stand. this is unfortunate for me as I literally only meet new women because they're my friend's wife or girlfriend :(
---
Nope gotta change it to Daddy
---
I agree. Such basic statistics. They should update every 10 seconds if it was available
---
Do you know what repair bills and explosives have in common? 
---
They're cheap!
---
LF 6 feet+ of rope and a ilvl 385+ tree. M+4 chair.
---
&gt; Grow the fuck up holy shit.
---
Or you grow the fuck up and realize that this is just a game and they're allowed to play however the fuck they want on a PvP server everyone playing there made the choice to play there. You stupid fuck are the reason there are no more PvP servers.
---
&gt; A mistake by modern judgment? Certainly. But I'm fine with Blizz taking care to implement gameplay mechanics exactly as they were even if current player computer/connection/skill/addons have rendered it obsolete. 
---
My own view is that it's confused thinking to believe that implementing 2004 gameplay on 2019 hardware without changing anything else is making the game "exactly as it was". It's like running an old game on DosBox at 10x speed and saying it is "exactly as it was". It's not. You've made a massive change that affects every aspect of the game.
---
As I have been saying since day one, a lot of people here shamelessly equivocate between "exactly as it was" and "exactly how pirate servers had it". Pirate servers players used to exploiting 2004 batching with 2019 hardware demanded that Classic be like their pirate servers, and for whatever reasons Blizzard gave in. But that decision is going to make the game less like real retail vanilla, not more like it.
---
Alliance 3/5 Poisons, but Horde with windfury go 3/3 Evisc or Ruthlessness.
---
I always go Ruthlessness until T2.5 set bonus also buffs Evisc.
---
A is the answer. Ruthlessness is more effective DPS than Imp. Evis and Poisons are garbage in a raid. Horde never use them on your Main Hand and Shadow Oil with spellpower buffs is better everywhere else.
---
People thought I was crazy when I liked it when the mana constraining gameplay came back in Cataclysm.
---
Yeah, vanilla is not the most perfect game possible. Some stuff are kind of meh. AV included.
---
Dwarf guy
---
Big guild
---
Never leveled
---
Emerald Dream Private Server years ago?
---
To be honest I see them not bringing in the original Av as a mistake. With the exception of cross realm bgs, which were added at the end of classic, blizzard has gone out of their way to reimplement old systems that existed for the majority of classic.
---
There is a fairly strong argument in precedent for them to include the old Av. 
---
They must know we’d rather that, than something closer to retail.
---
My bet is they don’t have a source for old AV, else they’d give it to us.
---
OP is right though, this AV is gonna be a mess ,we a bunch of 58s and just rolling through, zergs all over. It's everything I feared tbh
---
Vanilla usually gets pretty close to 50/50 due to the different faction metas and geographical advantages, so in vanila it should be able to settle itself out pretty well.
---
In the dogshit xpansion TBC (If they are doing it) they need to absolutely enforce 50/50 because otherwise it will end up as 80/20 H/A due to alliance just a useless faction in comparison.
---
As a Brit, 5 minutes of sun is exotic to me.  
---
Oddly enough, been all over the US and I always have a soft spot for florida.. I must be weird :D
---
Vanilla PvE is easy though lol. You dont have to be "good" for pve in classic
---
i'm gona run tauren shaman cus tauren get war stomp, a hard cc =)
---
There are tons of open world pvp areas for pve servers. If you want to just flag and it’s on. It’s the lowliest ganks that’s dumb. On the Pserver I’m on if you go to Redridge (major quest him between 13-20) it’s non stop getting ganked. Off the griff , in the in , trying to do fishing quest. It’s relentless.
---
WoW wPvP system is honestly not the best imaginable. It does make world feel dangerous at times. It does promote faction rivalry. Often, though, it only makes world feel annoying and ridiculous.
---
I'm only rolling PvP server because PvE server is somehow "easy mode". But part of me thinks it's stupid to view the random unavoidable death as a "hardmode feature".
---
How to pick *your* poison is a very psychological/philosophical question.
---
I guarantee only 1 or 0 rogues would bother with Shadow Oil and Flask of SP on every server. Just so much effort for little gain.
---
Yeah, that's why a lot of us who played private servers were upset. It's okay big streamers were fine with it so its fine in Blizzard's eyes.
---
Honestly man, if you're strapped and freshly moving out of the parental units, best advice is to hold off and save up for a better laptop that will get you better value for your buck, and last longer.
---
Or finance a nice $1000 laptop on sale/clearance for like $30 a month.
---
Its really not much fun. I was in one that lasted over 1hrs and then when it was a complete standstill zerg I quit. The next one was super imbalanced 40 Horde vs 20 Alliance ...yeah, not very fun.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.11.0
---
This is much closer to the TBC version, than the AV which was in the game for the majority of vanilla.
---
Imo, they also shouldn't have cross-realm battlegrounds, as that was also a feature that was added at the very end of vanilla.
---
Maybe that's why your life sucks now
---
a fucking boomer
---
I will if  at all possible. I even took a day off to try to get it. The problem is it was such a  standard name that I am worried Itll get nicked. 
---
But come on, a dwarf warrior tank named Fortress. I have to!
---
Good hunters always have a place because they bring excellent utility.
---
Pro for alliance- have thr only good looking race in the game
---
Con for alliance - ..but they have the worst racials
---
I did this on a pserver and named him Flip  
---
then I got an owl and named him Flap
---
I’ve found I don’t want to do that. I’m loving the cooking, fishing, mining and skinning. I’m only level 21 and I have 100g but this will put me behind on leveling.
---
200 fishing
---
200 cooking
---
140 mining and skinning
---
130 first aid
---
I make bad ass food, have lots of free action potions . I’ve been all around and I’m having a blast aside being ganked. I have only been attacked by ?? Players not once someone within even 10 levels.
---
when the beta first started i got so pissed at soda unbinding his F6 key, meaning, when he ran into an npc that was bugged he had to "THIS MOB HERE IN THE BARRENS NAMED SOMERANDOM SHIT IS BUGGED WHY IS IT LIKE THIS" 
---
Instead of just simply, selecting that mob, pressing F6 and writing what was wrong. 
---
Thank GOD Joana got beta access, i feel like no other streamers play to beta test the game...
---
Lol, this subreddit isn't as friendly as the NMS one is why.
---
Yes, Not thought about it. thanks for the advice
---
Perfect! Thank you! This is the interview I remember hearing this from but couldn't remember how they worded it, or if they had made a final determination yet.
---
Those towers were added in one of the last vanilla patches, so it wasn't used for a long time. I played on a PvE server, and it was pretty hit or miss on whether there was any PvP going on for the towers.
---
You can tell that some of those designs carried over into TBC, where there were similar PvP objectives in the zones.
---
I defintely go to westfall every character. I like it. But like I said in another post.
---
Westfall consists of killing 20 harvest reapers (save hops, oil, and okra), 28 murlocs (save eyes), 12 vultures (save meat), 24ish boars (save livers and intestines), 60 bandits (for 4 quests, including the bandanas which are trivial to collect enough of), and 12ish gnolls (paws).
---
And that's the entire zone, except for captain sander's treasure, which you probably do while killing the 28 murlocs. 
---
If you intend to run deadmines, you should show up in westfall to do the main quest chain, but that requires you to fly to stormwind, lakeshire, and back again a bunch ANYWAYS, so you might as well do all the courier quests at once, because one of them is needed for the centerpiece deadmines quest that gives you the big blue leather chest or mail pants.
---
I can stop shitting damnit.. damn you intestinal resection :(  
---
I'm a casual now..
---
The biggest hurdle on a PvP server is leveling a Warrior.
---
They are targeted specifically by every class while leveling.
---
Yeah I mean ganking just adds a little extra frustration, playing a PVE server couldn’t hurt then.
---
a sunny place for shady people
---
That's why it's even worse lol, he's able to do the wrong spells in vanilla
---
Cant you toggle pvp on and off while in the world or is that a burning crusade feature.
---
\-because now it's an awesome game that keeps getting huge free updates? The next update is going to incorporate VR and better multiplayer.
---
Well it really only is “what if” fun right?  It’s not like any of these wild changes people suggest are actually gonna make it into the game. But for some reason these raging fanatics go ape shit if anybody suggests anything and want to violently defeat it. It’s crazy to think people who like Warcraft want to go on a Warcraft reddit and talk about Warcraft. Instead this sub should just be an echo chamber of constant regurgitation. 
---
Some of y’all are crazy and really need help 😂😂😂. 
---
BRING ON CLASSIC I CANT WAIT
---
I will start Mining/skinning. I will skin everything and vendor it (not AH) until about level 30 when I'll drop skinning and pick up eng. By the time you're at 30 you start hitting so world PvP so eng is very useful. Also some decent gold making .
---
Herbalism isn't a real money maker until end game. Same with Alch.
---
It's not a little gain at all. Shadow Oil and Dragonbreath Chili can easily be double damage over poisons.
---
&gt;My bet is they don’t have a source for old AV, else they’d give it to us.
---
Just like they didn't have source for 1.12.1?
---
I am pretty sure all serious computer tech companies keep catalogs of all their updates/changes, so I think its very unlikely that they don't have it.
---
2% extra damage is not better than 1 cp + 25 energy.
---
Yes, Norway and Sweden, those exotic location.
---
ah, so those aren't even in 1.12? ok, thanks. Good to know.
---
We know.
---
yeah meeting a girl in a friendly context first would be great but... it seems that girls under the 'getting awkwardly old and desperate' age don't even leave their houses in my city.  it's rare to meet one that is single and not hideous/obese/a feminist
---
all the 'wife material' girls ... get married when they're in their early 20s and they're out of the dating pool and start making families and actually living adult lives.  the rest just seem to try to party and keep looking for the next trade-up until time catches up to them i think
---
The streamers are idiots
---
What are they including from earlier patches that was different in 1.12?
---
I'd love to do a road trip with a dog and some music :D
---
No you misunderstand.  They didn't even think they had 1.12.  It is taken as fact at this point that 1.12 is the earliest version of WoW they have.
---
Look up vanilla hunter Twink guides. They were well represented in every bracket so the BIS for each slot is well researched and available.
---
Maaaan you guys get a hurricane season, and that's wack, but I remember being in Florida and it *barely* started sprinkling rain. People were scrambling to pull out waterproof ponchos, some even put on parkas!! I hope this doesn't sound rude, but my family and I were laughing pretty hard. How can people who live in the path of tropical hurricanes be so afraid of a teeny bit of rain! It actually made the blistering heat feel bearable, we didn't want it to end!
---
i'm going horde but damn i love iron forge and this pic
---
I’ve you’re on a pve server you can but not on pvp . You are auto flagged
---
That's not even what I'm talking about. Raids in vanilla are easy. Also, their fucking lvl 40. It's completely different than 60 so you literally dont know what the "right" and "wrong" spells are to press because your basing your knowledge off lvl 60 shit
---
If I saw a message telling me there was a faction imbalance I would quickly pick the biggest faction there is nothing worse than playing on a server where your faction is alot smaller
---
Yeaaah no life again !
---
My Son was born two months premature out if nowhere.....the day Legion released...... I had the week booked off for Legion launch to level a Demon Hunter. Never ended up touching it until the BFA prepatch.....
---
Kids man, time vampires.
---
If you're PVPing you want a big slow 2H. 
---
If you're raiding you'll get better stats with 2x 1handera
---
Even when I’m fishing it’s like boom pop dead wtf! Why I’m a lowbie fishing
---
They'll be in 1.12. I think they were added in 1.11 or so. I just meant to say that because they were added so late in vanilla, we didn't get to play with them for more than a few months and even then, they still got deserted quick.
---
Yeah cuz getting all over-passionate about a fictional video game faction isnt edgy and cringey. 
---
Cool it down, neckbeardo
---

there were two rogues, both called lolumadbro that ruined general chat by being the biggest trolls lol

darkshadowsxx was famous rogue as well
---
Id like to see you do that considering pets die to almost every aoe any boss/trash can do (especially in raids). so either you have to waste time and mana using mend pet or keep reviving it and wasting food on it.
---
Neither of which benefit the dps in the long run.
---
Controlling the pet isnt as easy as it sounds... its easy on retail but in real vanilla it wasnt, the pet did nothing but dps from the optimal direction and if you want it to you couldnt just ask it to strafe like any melee dps could.
---
You had to use the stay, follow and attack commands, there was no "move to"-command to make your pet move to a specific spot like on retail.
---
So how exactly are you going to control your pet? eye of the beast?
---
Exactly, this is why I’m struggling I do want harder than pve BUT I’d like also to be able to walk around and enjoy the scenery
---
Same. What a tease :\
---
&gt; They didn't even think they had 1.12. It is taken as fact at this point that 1.12 is the earliest version of WoW they have.
---
Thats what they said, but a lot of people me included had absolutely no doubt they would have the source code, because not keeping your logs up would be extremly unprofessional in tech in general.
---
They claimed they didn't have it, but then they had it all along with gained traction.  And I also guess the only reason they cba to do classic is because it works on the retail engine.
---
My best friend had a 60 Druid in Vanilla and he was Rank 11 or 12.
---
He sometimes played Balance for fun and it was amazing to watch him go, he rarely actually used Moonkin form though.
---
How about just going and liking OPs video? I don’t need the upvotes nor do I care about them
---
I got tired just reading that list
---
did you know racecar spelled backwards is racecar?
---
Oh god fuck that. I did it on the beta while it was quiet and still took 40 minutes
---
I didn't click it just assuming it was lol
---
Most of the streamers were not "fine" with it. They just didn't full on tantrum about it. To be honest I think they should have though. Most of the classic community actually prefers this AV. I know from Down Vote experience.
---
AV has left such a bad taste in peoples mouths. They just wanna beat that pussy up and leave it forever. Personally I think it's a huge mistake. Being able to farm shit like Unstoppable force and, the rings in one week end. Really undermines all the other content. Make it work or leave it out imo.
---
Old AV needs to come back. What needs to change is how players earned honor in old AV. The main reason Blizzard changed AV was because players were complaining that the honor rewards were so low. AV would last so long that you often wouldn't receive the completion bonus. Honor kills from other players gave such little honor. Honor kills in general didn't award enough honor compared to winning a battleground. In Old AV the diminishing returns from honor kills often resulted in players earning almost no honor for kills. The honor for completing objectives in Old AV was also too low.
---
What if players received a big honor reward for every 30 minutes they were active in old AV? You wouldn't need to be present at the completion, but could instead receive a substantial bonus for being active. Of Blizzard reworked the honor distribution and gains in Old AV, then it would have solve a lot of its issues. Old AV had some of the best PvP fights in WoW. It felt more like a World Zone than just another battleground. Blizzard should bring back Old AV it was a defining aspect of classic WoW. Award players with a bonus every 30 minutes for being active, and rework the honor gains from objectives.
---
As somebody who currently knows pretty much nobody who's going to play WoW besides my brother, is there a website (subreddit) that serves as a guild recruiting forum, or that has general advice on how to pick the right server, etc.?
---
they actually are trying to send a message to streamers though lol. https://clips.twitch.tv/AthleticEnticingSkirretTakeNRG

And there’s barely anything to them, no lore, no ideas just a map with some random words

---
wow... really? Xrealm pvp? This is really making me reconsider classic...
---
1. There should be a pet tab in the Character frame UI when you're a hunter and have the pet out.
---
2. You get three pet stable slots, but it's better only to have two at most when leveling as you'll need to train skills for your pets. Don't recall the levels or price, I want to say 50s and 1g?
---
3. Yep, you have to go to a stable master to switch out which pet is the active one.
---
4. Leveling cooking and fishing is a big plus for a hunter for exactly that reason. Gotta keep those pets fed or they'll turn on you. Check classic wowhead for possible meat vendors in the NE area.
---
I'd expect either the old pet add-ons to come back or people to make new ones on launch. Unit Frame add-ons should also have varied ways to show pet happiness.
---
What, people flipflopping opinion based on the hive mind group thought? *That’s absurd*!
---
dude welcome to wow, you get ganked so you level up and gank the next noob. PVE is so boring, its not the true wow experience without the threat of death
---
What’s a jebait?
---
Warriors are unfortunately the worst class at solo pvp in the game. They're the most gear-dependant class in the game, one of the least mobile, and are wanting in the utility department. Paired with a decent healer they're unstoppable, but on your own you'll end up being kited for days by most classes. 
---
If you want solo world pvp, I'd suggest Mage, Hunter, Rogue, or Druid. 
---
Unfortunately, as a warrior in solo world pvp you're at an inherent disadvantage. You can mitigate this with better gear/engineering/various trinkets, but it'll be an uphill battle.
---
I honestly didn't know AV in Classic would be like this. I don't have access but from what I've seen on streams it's pretty much a zergfest. Was expecting the original AV, that massive battle that would last for hours. Kinda disappointed...
---
They're ganking for because she's a retail baby who is only playing Classic for views. Fuck her.
---
They sent her back to retail where she belongs.
---
I don't care what anyone says, Uldum is a fantastic zone. Great questlines.
---
I want very badly to be invited
---
but i really dont want to go
---
Yeah I remember being proud of my level 10 raptor that I just got, then immediately going into Orgrimmar and realizing he was a little baby compared to other people's raptors.
---
My finest hour as a tank. WotLK. Naxxramas. Loatheb. Raid dropping like flies. Finally all dead but one healer and me. Then the healer dies. Then I finish off Loatheb. Standing alone amongst the bodies of my fallen comrades I pull out my jumper cables and... \*BOOM\* I res a healer! 
---
I was so proud. The cables hardly ever worked for me normally. :D
---
Good thinking. They can do their awful dance after a gank
---
I agree. Many people in the BG chat are already complaining that it's just a boring zergfest.
---
Don't blink after I intercept k thx!
---
By 1.12 the towers are in the game, they won't be added until later phases of classic, however. They just weren't widely used by players even in vanilla. Blizzard added them, along with the Silithus objectives, in an attempt to resurrect world pvp, which had largely died out after battlemasters allowed players to queue for BG's from cities. 
---
The feature was more or less a flop and not really used by anyone.
---
Sick of them? Nah, I'm half wanting to through my art schedule to the wind and start doing mob and environment concept art for them. I'm loving these.
---
Hardly, I'm looking forward to playing a proper hunter again.
---
&gt; Not getting decent gear till level 20 dungeons
---
Does anyone get good gear prior to 20?  That seems a little silly.  You don't even get a spec until 10, and you don't even have anything that makes you special by that point.
---
&gt; professions being impossible to level unless near max level
---
I am so confused.  How are any of these points specific to fire mages?
---
thats being a part of the problem though.... as you say there is nothing worse.... something should be done
---
Great work, as all the others. Are you gonna give BC zones a redesign too?
---
I heard blink would be disabled in PvP since alot of classes would be too slow
---
Why not Troll? Superior race.
---
can you elaborate, why is that?
---
Consider seeking professional help over your irrational rage over a fantasy race in an MMO.
---
You know! When you've been tangoed.
---
its called "the wall" and most women hit it around 32. It's when looks run out and personality is a requirement all of a sudden.....
---
It's no surprise to anyone though.  We all know 1.12 AV is the worst Vanilla version.
---
The hell youre talking about reagents?
---
So tailor and mining was usually a good profession match for mages
---
Mining you have to go into the lava zone where most mobs roam in clusters of 5 or more making it impossible to harvest effectively 
---
Mining gave stamina boost
---
Tailor gave good early game twinkish gear
---
Yeah I was wondering the same thing....
---
Forgot name yes ! Reagents
---
They were originally but stuck out a bit too much so I colored them to match the rest of the crystals.
---
There is no haste gear in classic. Just saying boomkin crit for lyfe
---
I was in his guild on the pserver days before he became a streamer.  He was... different from now.  It was basically a /pol/ guild during the 2016 presidential election.
---
The best advice I could give you is to not blindly trust anything anyone says. A lot of people on here are going to mislead you, whether intentional or not. You really need to experiment with some things and see what works best for you. There are obviously mathematically correct answers to a lot of this stuff, but some things come down to preference and playstyle.
---
1. I found tactical mastery to be a must for tanking. Being able to switch stances and bust out an ability really quickly is awesome. You have enough rage to activate berserker stance and intercept, you can switch to berserker stance and activate the rage without losing your entire rage pool. It may not seem that useful on paper, but seriously it makes massive leaps when it comes to rage conservation. I would argue that going all 5 points and getting anger management may not be worth it, but having 2/5 for the 10 rage to intercept is definitely worth it imo. 
---
2. It's okay, but I just found other talents more useful.
---
3. I think a lot of people are sleeping on this talent. I specifically remember that even if the stun didn't work, it still activate bonus threat generation. I will definitely be testing this on release. I totally plan on speccing this for everything. It is stupidly powerful the tankier you get because revenge activates like crazy and can become a serious source for damage, as stupid as it may sound. 
---
4. Defense cap is crazy important to prevent crushing blows. Getting a crushing blow every now and then happened to the best of us because getting the defense cap is really hard. But the closer you are to the cap, the lest burst damage you're going to take. It is definitely a high priority and not something to be skipped. You see a lot of these talent trees not taking that +defense at the top of the prot tree because your ultimate goal is to be totally naxx geared and have enough defense to already reach the cap. All blues and greens gear isn't going to give people enough defense at the start.
---
5. Yes.
---
6. Troll or Human
---
7. All professions are solid. Engineering offers the most unobtainable items, though.
---
8. None i'm aware of.
---
9. Priest alt.
---
What happens when a rogue crippling poisons you nonstop from 10 feet away? How do you kite that?
---
Can't decide between Hunter and Warlock as my main, I'm going to mainly wPvP/BG, solo gold farming, dungeon group PvE and casual raiding, can anyone give me advice on which one to play that suits my style? My main concern is Hunter's dead zone and it's hard to find dungeon groups, will it be a problem as a hunter?
---
No, you can't mount while shapeshifted.
---
&gt; Mining gave stamina boost
---
Not in Vanilla.
---
something i love about l-hope is the /who. The fact that they show you the overall playercount is awesome, i think its a real shame blizzard dont have the balls to do that. 
---
Simply pressing o or writing /who and seeing that there are 13k people online on a pserver on a friday evening is amazing.
---
Afaik only AV test server.
---
horde racials stomp alliance in both pvp and pve
---
Yup lol
---
This seems very confused.
---
Just because the lvl 60 is an asshat doesn't mean you have to be one too. As to you being the fountain of truth about the true wow experience.... lol
---
I can't really justify any points into Murder.  20 points of damage atop a 1000 point hit just isn't worth 2 talent points.
---
Trying my hardest talking my SO into playing
---
ok.
---
Always others got the problems. Blame the others. Got it.
---
In the entire History of WoW I've only played a hunter and only to PvP. Is this "feature" of melee leeway going to stay in for classic wow's release or is it a "bug"?
---
Gen y.
---
Are you talking about the melee leeway? If so, there are plenty of ways to slow/stop the rogue to get range.
---
And I though female dwarf's dance was awful.
---
And why would people use a Flask of Supreme Power every raid for a few % DPS boost? Especially when a dead rogue deals no damage it's better to use Titans Flask and keep people alive and doing their job.
---
It didnt ? Are you sure,I looked up a old guide and mining and tailor was a mage professions
---
No.... Intellect is the most important stat for an elemental shaman and the most important secondary stat is spirit for mana regen. I swear its like everyone here started playing in WotLK or something and don't remember how old classes we're stated out.
---
They're literally mocking people who complain about streamers
---
please do so brobeans
---
What do you mean? right now is the most depressing era of my life
---
I really enjoyed this read and certainly brought back some memories.
---
Thanks for the effort put into this post my friend! 
---
FOR THE HORD!
---
here are the reasons why everybody gravitates towards the horde:
---
1: Alliance gets shamans, horde gets paladins. 2: Horde ret paladins are stronger than alliance paladins (only blood elfs gets seal of blood which is the best DPS buff), and for shamans I don't think there is much difference if any between the 2 factions. Horde would still probably have better ench shamans tho due to orc racials. And with the addition of both classes on both factions, their unique raid meta-game vaporizes (in vanilla casters are better on Alliance because of paladins, paladins are probably the best scaling healers.) While shamans  makes melee stronger and offer other kinds of utility on certain bosses. So alliance and the horde actually plays differently in raids.
---
2: Horde has straight up superior racials in both PvP and PvE (thats why humans got a free PvP trinket in wrath, to try to balance it out). 
---
3. No geographical advantages for alliance in TBC, in vanilla Ironforge is extremly well strategically located (very close to blackrock mountain for instance, ogrg closer to Dustwallow/Feralas etc). In TBC both factions end up on Outland, in the same areas, share the same capital. And if one faction gets a higher population, contesting that continent (which is tiny and also has flying) is an extreme pain in the ass, which is why faction based servers became a thing. Where you have like 90% one faction and the other faction being dead on the servers, because is just a huge downgrade from having two massive continents that are both generally controlled by each faction.
---
"Depressing era"? I had so much fun playing WoW, I regret nothing and wasn't depressed at all.
---
Lol I levelled as balance in vanilla becuase I had no idea what I was doing.
---
It's hell. It's pure hell. Don't do it.
---
Yeah that's what I hoped for, I didn't expect that version of AV where the mines littered the field and npc elites were everywhere, but the npcs that are here hit like wet noodles so theirs no real barrier to just zerging. I am very disappointed
---
Months ago.
---
warlocks had early skills like firestones and added threat on searing pain suggesting to me that they where meant to be a melee tank class at some point but they never gave enough other skills to make it viable
---
Pretty sure that:
---
A) That didn't happen, and
---
B) You don't know what a vasectomy is.
---
You do barely more damage than the tanks and have unpredictable threat generation, sometimes able to overtake the tanks by pure rng. You bring buffs that are marginally better than restoration shamans.
---
So no, you're not exactly wanted. Which is why Nightfall is great because you can justify a raid spot and warriors don't have to gimp themselves for that axe. If you really want to go above and beyond, you learn how to totem twist. Which is very mana intensive. But your melee dps will love you...
---
...Except that in raids a lot of dps is held back by tank threat generation, so whatever potential you COULD bring out is capped by what the tank can pull out.
---
Really, you're just stuck between a rock and a hard place. And this doesn't even take into account that you have to also compete with gear with pure dps classes, who won't be happy that the meme shaman gets their desired loot.
---
So realistically, your best bet is to play with people that don't take raiding super serious and don't mind a few meme specs. Raiding in vanilla isn't hard, it's just tedious. Be a social whore and make friends and they'll love you either way. Your ability to occasionally delete trash mobs will both terrorize and impress. 
---
Also, the best argument you can try to make is that whatever bonus dps the other classes get should be basically added to yours since you're bringing the big boi stuff 😂😂😂 (though 30% extra ap from windfury totem means fuckall)
---
50% really?
---
from the twitch emote ''Jebaited''.
---
It is typically used when a streamer is tricked or believes their chat when they say something completely incorrect.
---
Well mine is still here but cant hit play. Well even if i get it wont resub for only that.
---
are you just guessing or did they actually say that sometime
---
I'm talking about when he was farming dungeons for his stuff so not 60 but 40, how could I talk about raids when the beta is locked at 40? And yes I do know, and it's certainly not by spamming regrowth that you will heal effectively, he was oom way too fast and regrowth build needs crit. For leveling you use two HT ranks and it's enough.
---
For those wondering how long the wait is: www.iswowclassicout.com ;)
---
Didn't know that! Does it reduce target's armor or something?
---
I went from bouncing up and down telling my wife the good news to sulking in my chair in 12.32 seconds.
---
What about at server selection stage? I doubt people would change once they've created a character and logged in...
---
Just have a little 47% A / 53% H next to the server name?
---
Although I can see that just compounding the problem....
