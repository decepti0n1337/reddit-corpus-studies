So each point of weapon skill reduces your chance to miss. That is how you get hit from weapon skill. Then there is also the 1% added from that special condition outlined in the post.

Here is some hit table confirmation results based on testing on the beta.

I love that you stated it at the end there. Good stuff lol
---
I haven't subbed yet.  I had the money to do so, but for a couple hours each month?  That's just not something I cared about.  Do it around the same time I'm going to be paying to secure my names and the first days of launch?  That's Drake meme level move.
---
I have 2 mains and 4 alts across both factions and i dont even feel like playing anymore...
---
I understood completely. JerkPlayer is free to do what he wants with Vis'kag, but he must also accept the consequences of being kicked from the guild.
---
Blizzard can’t afford to lose people left right like a private server can. The cost to run a private server is fractions of what it costs blizzard. So when classic winds down to 10k players blizzard will be shutting down parts left and right, while a private server will be happy as hell to have 10k players.
---
 The 3 day gift sub that ends July 29 have nothing to do with this. They are just not ready to test a 15y old game for the third time.
---
They don't need to add abilities to vanilla wow.  We had enough abilities.
---
If they want to make it fresh, they could add more Talent trees and go down a path similar to RIFT: Planes of Telara or Guild Wars 2.  A horizontal progression that gives player classes more variety without increasing their power.
---
Even at higher levels, fury tanking is absolutely viable, and the increase in leveling speed makes fury the best all-rounder spec for speed and versatility pre-60. You can play whatever is most fun to you, however!
---
Gathering professions to 40 are absolutely great (or even to 60 and 60 mount). However, if you plan to MT or OT raid content as a prot warrior at 60, you will need engineering. Getting by without it (especially as an off tank, ESPECIALLY as an off tank dedicated to AoE tanking) is going to be really difficult.
---
That being said, if you are actually coordinated with your guild (which you will be as a tank), they will have people of every profession all working together, and you will be a cog in a machine rather than a survivalist herbalist/alchemist.
---
Basically, play what you like until you can't anymore, then ask your guild how best to help out.
---
&gt;the ability to destroy earlier expac content
---
This has literally always been the case. Shit you can walk into Molten Core with fresh 60's and it's quite doable. When people were doing naxx you could clear BWL and MC in like 2-3hrs. It was a complete joke.
---
I actually do appreciate this comment. That’s true - I do want to make friends and socialize a lot. Maybe lock is a good pick purely because everyone wants summons and stones. Frankly, maybe I MYSELF want summons and stones because sitting around waiting on people to get to dungeon or raid all day and dying due to no lock rocks. I’ll have to consider this. This is one factor I hadn’t thought about yet: what is going to be higher quality of life and better for friends and guild mates. 
---
Thanks!!!
---
I reckon that's a Peter Lee painting. No particular reason why.
---
I was viewing this through the lens of new guild members/PUGs that are there to fill the raid. I would hope that these concerns wouldn't exist for consistent guild members, but your point is till valid.
---
When I was a baby, Warcraft had just come out and it took a while to get from place to place in game... My dad would sit me on his lap and we'd watch the gryphon fly together. Still one of my favorite stories to hear :)
---
The idea is ok but there's no possible feral build where you would bother with powershifting and be able to spend 13 points in resto. OOC (11pt bal) and LotP are core talents so yeah... none left over.
---
Druids are the only viable hybrids save one welfare spriest and possibly a welfare Enh shaman or two needed for totems.
---
Ferals can go Hotw spec for 5-mans, pvp, grinding its very good 1/29/21. Its bad for raids, but you cannot have everything.
---
As someone who chose to resub because I could dabble in 8.2 and get to experience the stress test, feels bad.  
---
Especially because the first date delay brought it right up to the point where I can play one of the two stress tests days.  
---
And now..rip.
---
Will I be accepted into raids and wanted as a Discipline Priest?
---
Class fantasy, man. I played lock during my hardcore phase during MoP/WoD (before they massacred my boy) and before the Demon Hunters took it, we were the ones who sacrificed everything! (I mean, not really, during MoP and WoD we were just high APM parse jockeys but whatever) 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you're willing to put in the work, you're more useful -- but you don't get the benefits of your own class as much as Mage (in my opinion).
---
Good luck!

I would hope that even the nochanges people could differentiate between bliizzlike and vanillalike.  Just because this is possible with the base code, doesnt mean that is represents a version of the game that everyone wants to recreate, as no one in 2004-06 knew about this bug, and if they did almost for sure it would have been changed by the devs at the time.
---
Why do you care what a PUG does with the loot once they've won it? Just give it to them.
---
And if a new guild member tries to sell the loot, just write the loot off and kick them.
---
This is satire right?
---
Goblin rocket helmet is a great choice for cc while you kill 1 thing off or want time to heal.  But good engineering items are a one off, because of harsh cooldowns.  I had all the handy engineering items back in vanilla, and most of the time they were just best in PvP because you could surprise people with them.  Another thing that's nice is the stealth seeing goggles that actually can help you see rogues in time before they strike.  Especially if you are a stacking it with Hunter Track Hidden.  I think you'll need a bag full of engineering items and you'll want to slot them all on a vertical bar off to the side so that you always have access to what you want to do with them on the fly.  Otherwise you won't always have time to make the decisions to use them at the right time because some require you to have them equipped.  Obviously you might not care about this as a rogue, but items like gnomish cloaking device allow other classes to conveniently get to places solo.  It is one of my favorite items in WoW.
---
&gt; Then JerkPlayer tries to sell Vis'kag to Yakelam for gold because items can be traded for 2h.
---
/gkick JerkPlayer. Problem solved.
---
'Valestraz' got my blood boiling
---
Wotolk-WoD, lock was my favorite class. God damn I wish we could go back to demo where you become the demon and affliction where it isn’t about little bitch unstable affliction spam stacking (destro doesn’t feel bad imo, it’s somewhat retained its soul).
---
If you wanna raid Warrior. 
---
If you are playing just to play, shaman or druid.
---
While babies wont remember - they will be highly influenced by those early years.
---
I don't care at all. It sounds like the OP does, though.
---
Ya I already have my vacation set... I hope it doesn't get pushed back. But if it did I'd think it'd be for a good reason
---
Mage is sooooo much more newbie friendly IMO.
---
1. Conjured food and water is super super useful
---
2. Can pull from far away, which means less chance of getting adds (rogues get a lot of value from a stealth opener)
---
3. Polymorph &gt; Sap
---
4. Portals
---
Mage is only "difficult" (aka to get 100% value out of) in pvp.  Leveling and group pve content is great with mage.
---
Possibly. 
---
There is merit to the idea in general, but I cannot think of a specific rogue example.
---
Here's a [youtube video I found]
---
(https://youtu.be/-6hPZessUIY?t=192) that is an example of a farm that MAY be possible with good gear and skills. The guy claims that this farm is not possible with a rogue (as he states that the only class that wants the blackstone ring that can solo it is hunter), but there is at least [one video of a guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqns6ILw-6g) soloing princess as rogue and claiming that you could do it in pre-BIS. 
---
Honestly, I would look at the priest run very carefully and decide for yourself if you think you could do it with a rogue. I know little about rogues.
---
Theres a new blue post about crit aura buffs getting reduced by a flat 3% if you are not within 10 pts of weapon skill. I'm not kidding!
---
Don't use shit like Addons which tell you where to go if you want an authentic experience like the people who played at Vanilla launch.
---
&gt; it's allowed on ND but very few do it
---
It's surprisingly difficult to do it right. Guilds can practice if they're that serious about it, but it's not something you just pull off without carefully organizing the whole guild around it. It's doable but it's harder than the Onyxia fight itself. Gotta make sure everyone dies except the exact people you want to lock in, and none of those can die. Meanwhile everybody has to completely stop DPS at a very specific point so that Onyxia is nearly dead and can be finished off by a hard wind, which means anyone who doesn't stop DPS probably ruins the entire thing.
---
I reckon it'll be in Classic and a small minority of guilds will make it work, but most will just do Onyxia the normal way. For those who can do it properly, it's a pretty serious advantage, but it's nowhere near as broken as the fact that having the patch 1.11 PvP gear available as soon as the honor system comes online means that people who can spend 12h/day for months ranking up will have gear that's comparable to AQ40 loot by the time BWL opens. Compared to that, getting a few extra Onyxia kills per week is relatively benign.
---
not yet, I'm working on more right now, takes much longer than you would think. much, much longer. I can convert a specific macro if you need tho.
---
It's actually linked to weapon skill? Wow that is insane. Not too big of a deal for a tank though since they will never be in zerk stance.
---
You can grab edgemasters handguards and get +7 axe/sword/dagger on a Tauren.
---
those are not resources, those are combo points
---
Yes, I’m sure you did and that build is fine for a hybrid healer but you didn’t read his question at all. That has 0 points in balance, and he wants to be a moonkin which requires 31.
---
No..? Just get a few 60's to help and you'll be fine.
---
I’m having a baby August 16thish. My birthday is the 26th. I deserve this wow.
---
You know, it IS possible for you to enjoy playing the game and let others enjoy playing their game too. They paid to have a good time. Nobody is forcing you to grief.
---
where have you been, dad?
---
Will those jump and bugs work in real classic? I imagine many people will right click report those who abuse the bugs
---
You are over thinking this.  Make a rule that works for your guild and follow through with the punishments for violating them.  Just like anything else you make rules on.
---
Hotw is better initially, the tankiness from feral talents is irreplaceable until you have enough + healing,
---
Escort quests are never a "good time".
---
If you have to ask....
---
.....you pass the test of basic humanity.
---
Kind of too complex to explain much in text. Get feral charge, cheap shapeshift talent, and 4/6 pvp set asap. Learn all the jumps and hiding places. Get a mage to pick for you in there’s too many defenders. 
---
One slightly more subtle trick, is to make sure you “protect” your cat dash when you are indoors and can’t use travel form. If you’re slowed while dashing, sure you can shift out of it, but that’s the end of dash. So dash only after your opponents have blown major slows, or dash only after you have abo or freedom/fap up, or only when you’re out of LOS. A great way to escape the flag room when it’s busy is to fake going out one exit, feral charge somebody near the other exit, and then as soon as you get around the corner, hit dash.
---
Why not? Having an extra thunderfury in your guild raises the dps ceiling on so many fights that require multiple tanks and taunt immune bosses.
---
I usually don't have the energy to do anything after I FAP
---
Anyone have any recommendations for someone with a budget of about 1500?
---
Holy crap! I knew that stache was bis!
---
Please level with skinning to inject more gold into your servers economy.
---
what shenanigans in social media are you speaking of? Not sure I know what your talking about
---
I literally am making my set up now. I recently got a 240hz 2070mq razer laptop. So I kinda went full blown with Razer products. I do some FPS games as well. I was gonna go for a ultra wide but I got the 25” Alienware ( 240hz refresh rate and 1ms response time 😂😂😂) instead since it fits my desk better with the thousands I have put out on Razer shit. Smh. I have been playing on a 15” laptop for the last few years so It will be an upgrade for me.
---
My razer was getting 350-400 FPS on max in classic, and with a raid of 40 or so people in storm wind I was still above 240 FPS... this is my main game so I kinda overdid it with all of my purchases.
---
It depends on tbe fight. Nefarian, I'm below the priests and pallies. Vael? Tied with tge best priests, double the pallies. Solo heal moam so your priests can spam mana burn. Cure poisons and decurse as needed. Keeping HoTs on tanks so if they dip, swiftmend is an instant heal that puts holy shock to shame. NS+HT for 3-4k,basically lay on hands for less mana and 1/10th the cd.
---
Lmao nice post! I have 3 small kids and one more on the way spring next year and I still find time to game so anyone starting a family and playing wow it’s possible! Just make an excuse that you’ll stay up with the baby so you wife can sleep. You’ll get some nice grinding time in and your wife will love the extra sleep, win-win!
---
It's utility which is nice but raids take 40 people so the likelihood your raid wouldn't have at least 2 or 3 hunters to buff with TSA is ridiculous. Hunter DPS was always good enough on its own. Anybody getting that salty about no TSA either never played with good hunters or just hates the class.
---
Just kill him if you don't like what he's doing.
---
&gt; Sigh... It's not (just) about the head. It's about the items. A guild using this exploit once, doubles their Onyxia drops for the week. A guild using this exploits two times, triples their Onyxia drops for the week. And repeat, until you clear Onyxia for the last time with the people still not saved, probably with 20 people or so.
---
That guild would not do so well as they gear like crazy first reset and then get a month ban where they get no drops at all. This is blizz we are talking about, not some pirate server people. This might work within the code, but that doesn't stop them from banning.
---
I'd guess this ^
---
Curious that they actually have the BIS lists down- rather than just T3 you see the eyestalk waist cord, dark storm gauntlets, and rime-covered mantles.
---
I second countdown to classic. Not really faction based, but they have developers on there and talk about instances and stuff,
---
You could try sapping the guy being escorted so he sits there for 30 seconds at a time, over and over and over...
---
If you aren't going to be a raider, making gold is pretty much the only other reason to take up a profession and then buy whatever gear you want outside of BOP crafted items.
---
Engineering would be a worthwhile casual player profession if for no other reason than the fun things you can make.
---
There is definitely a small increase to the time-to-cast when manually clicking on names. Comparing it to a GCD was an exaggeration but you definitely save time not clicking on a name before casting a heal. I remember seeing ehps increases when I swapped over
---
Yep, same here. It wasn't uncommon at all for the first person or two to ask if they could reserve something as well, which I was usually willing to do so long as it wasn't some weird request that would possibly make it so others wouldn't want to join.
---
Get skinning and vendor the skins.  It’s kinda like looting a mob twice.  Then grab either mining or herb.
---
If you’re on a PvP server I would recommend mining over herb.  There will be a lot of folks using engineering.  I would just stock pile your ore for the first month or so.  Putting it on the AH right off the bat ain’t going to net you much money.  No one has any.  Wait until some currency is generated in the world before you try to sell.

&gt;https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0
---
&gt;Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns.
---
Before this it didnt trigger any diminishing returns wich was a bug.
---
After that it shared diminishing returns with scatter shot.
---
&gt;Show me the patch note saying that scatter and trap should share DR
---
Show me a patch note indicating that they fixed the "bug" of scatter shot and freezing trap sharing diminishing returns.
---
The benefits of leeway to melee have been overstated quite a bit, and granted the duel tourneys were all low level but you still didn’t see any melee in the final rounds.
---
At the same time, the way melee range works has made hamstrung kiting a lot less useful to warriors, the mobs seem to be able reach you forever.
---
Resto is for 3 hit. I value that more than 5 crit. Resto is for 25 percent armor buff. I value that more. Resto is for 15 percent faster healing waves. Resto is for 20 more life and mana from 40 mins ankh. Resto has 5 percent more spell crit to get you more melee crit from the elemental buff. It also has niche uses like 18 percent better healing waves and clutch ns heals.
---
shaman are a very bad melee class at 60, enhancement isn't good for anything besides leveling tbh. 
---
That said, resto is extremely sought-after for raids, very powerful healing in 5 mans and raids, and elemental is a top tier pvp spec. The biggest downside IMO is that you don't get really ideal gear for elemental until aq40 is out. OTOH, guilds will actually give 2.5 tier gear to shamans, as the set bonus is a huge boost to chain heal on top of it having great stats for ele pvp. Any premade will adore a good shaman player.
---
&gt; There is definitely a small increase to the time-to-cast when manually clicking on names.
---
No there isn't. You do it simultaneously while you're performing other actions and you literally lose 0 efficiency.
---
I'm not talking about why not get a thunderfury, but that it's kinda useless doing this only on garr since well you need 2 parts. So it only owrks if you do baron too or got very lucky with baron drops
---
Even if both people dueling had eng wouldn't you say eng vastly improved warriors compared to the  other classes?
---
Were there templates other than BiS? 
---
I wonder if this is a level 60 to stress test or if it's just for internal tests.
---
This too**
---
Game changer for heals. Especially with an mmo mouse ❤️
---
I was referring to clicking on someone and targeting them if you were not using a mouseover macro
---
HEIL GRAMMATIKA!
---
the numbers do matter, though. what kind of a bizarre statement is that? lol. we know the exact vendor price of heavy leather. we can easily do the math. we don't have to guess
---
someone actually did the math on this sub a couple months ago, and determined that the extra time spent skinning mobs pre-heavy leather and vendoring the leather actually makes you *less* money than spending that time just killing more mobs. i used to think like you, and assumed - without doing the math - that skinning and vendoring made some solid extra cash in the early levels. but it doesn't 
---
you are right that it *is* worth it to skin heavy leather and beyond, but anybody who grinds mobs for a few levels in their 30s is going to have enough gold for their mount just from vendoring grays and AHing greens (assuming they don't waste it stupidly)
---
i never really played classic, so ill probably stick with bfa 🤷‍♂️
---
Whether it's ready or not. Just like D3.
---
As much fun as it is to hope, I would keep the expectations grounded. 
---
The way I see it, for Blizzard to undertake this is basically a big slap in the face to the entire modern WoW dev team and philosphy that has been going on for several expansions now.
---
I genuinely believe it would be excellent game play, and successful. But I just don't believe Blizzard has the company philosophy to undertake this anymore. It would basically pull a 180 of every expectation I've had of them since around Cataclysm.
---
More or less on the same page as you. OP is saying this is ret DPS though when some he is healing. 
---
Really shouldn't be too hard to find real meters to post with bottom of the pack numbers instead of healing numbers. This post is just picking reddit fights for the sake of picking reddit fights.
---
&gt; Everyone wanted flying
---
Huh?
---
Flying was just a thing added in TBC. Who was "asking for flying" in vanilla?
---
Idk what dungeons you're planning on doing, but Gnomish Battle Chicken which can buff melee attack speed by 5% for 4 minutes, and iron grenades/dynamite for big trash pulls are two things that definitely can't hurt.
---
Why would anyone even want to go on an RPVP/RPVE server anyways?
---
Man, all these dads here... I'm just glad I get to exprience what I missed out on back in 2004 because I was 4-5 years old.
---
No its more optimal to have offtanks and healers do keep up annihilator and nightfall debuffs. Bringing a hunter for nightfall is a waste
---
Haha, true. 
---
Back then I was on a Barton 2500 overclocked to 3200, Radeon 9800 pro, later upgraded to x800xt. My one buddy was rocking some impressive hardware on a 27" LCD doing 1600x1200 and I was even super jealous of his setup.
---
Man, back then high end GPUs were $200-$300, those were the days haha.
---

---
I am not entirely convinced that intellect creeps up in value in prolonged fights. In short fights, intellect is very valuable because it will let you cast spells longer, ideally for the whole fight. In longer fights, intellect loses some of its value because having the regen necessary to sustain your mana is much more important than starting with a little bit of extra mana. 
---
[This self-admittedly outdated spreadsheet for priests seems to agree that the value of intellect goes down as the fight goes on](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l2o5WhYf18AsprwRoLYvuaSP96Y2xxJE743xXyenfHk/edit#gid=1037853740):
---
It weighs Int at 2.322635135 in a short 2-minute fight and at 0.4351 in a 15-minute fight. 
---
The other stats valuable to a holy priest are weighed as follows:
---
Healing-/spellpower: 1	
---
Spirit: 0.8275 (1.1775 with T2 3set Bonus)
---
Mp5: 3.5	
---
Crit: 8 
---
Stamina does not even get a number.
---
(Again, note that the author wants you to take any stat weights with a grain of salt and that the author calls his own weights wrong and outdated.)
---
Oh, is that what happened to me? I really should've read those quests.
---
I honestly doubt. Runescape is not expansion oriented, so it's much easier to build new content and make the game progress, even as old as it is.
---
Wow is xpac oriented, so it's very hard to make new content, fans would be outraged if there was a minimal change in any of the lore.
---
As sad as it may sound, I think Classic will live for less than a year until players get bored and just go to other games or back to BfA or next xpac.
---
Blizz is probably expecting this, tho, so they might have something in store.
---
A need on loot, to me, stipulates the intention to wear the loot. Needing something with the intention of selling is not okay IMO.
---
Yes this worked and you don't need raid gear or to even be max level. And the lower levels do not need to tag mobs at all. I used to run friends through dungeons to level them up fast.
---
Nah, 0 to 6 months is easy mode.  Can easily raid or w/e.  About 9 months is magic, it varies wildly but the kid starts sleeping through the night and goes to bed at 7am.  You will never get as much done as you will during this period.   At 2 they start dropping naps.  My eldest was completely done at 1.5 and youngest at 3 yrs can still nap, really should.  Once they get to kindergarten it gets better as they have regular bed times and wake times.  For us its 8 30 pm to 7am.  But yeah 0 to 9 months is magic but dear god its hard.
---
Maybe they are doing their internal testing on the beta realms now?
---
boomkin has off heals and focus 90% on damage. ret pally. the list goes on.
---
I guess that makes sense, mana pool only matters for bursting through a fast fight, when you think about it. Regen (spirit/mp5) becoming king for longer fights.
---
Cool spreadsheet, I’ll dig into it more. Good find!
---
Its not uncommon to have multiple garr bindings and no baron bindings or vice versa.
---
Why wouldn't they? I'm sure there is a good reason not too I just don't know it.
---
It's not going strong just because some actiblizz fanbois are still playing retail. 
---
It didn't die when I stoped playing your right I got off that ship safely. Everyone I know who played quit by cataclysm. The longer they stayed the less likely they are to come play classic with me. That tells me all I need to know.
---
Whatever you want, probably
---
BFA had very few bugs at launch, it was just not a great game. I played through the night with no issues. WoD had one major issue, the garrison creation quest, which created a major bottleneck and led to cascading issues. Other than WoD they have had pretty solid launches since Cata.
---
Come on blizz!
---
Weird they would use BiS lists to raid test. Unless they are testing mechanics and not dps/threat.
---
Only took me until I unlocked flying, although I'll never cancel my sub.
---
Vanilla devs literally confirmed that this functionality is not a bug.
---
Right. I just don’t know if I can justify it to be a healer and have little mobility.
---
Because you've removed all incentive to actually play the game for a number of players.
---
Honestly, don’t have a clue, wasn’t part of the beta, just being a troll.
---
Joking aside, this is terrible advice. Bonding and positive interaction are really important even before verbal skills and memory persists throughout life. Google reactive attachment disorder. there was also a study done where a mother did not show any emotion to a baby and they get uncomfortable and stressed out, and prolonged stress can cause brains to develop improperly.
---
You aren't playing the game, you're *testing it*.
---
Hence Beta *test*.  Stress *test*.
---
It's actually hilarious how obtuse you are.
---
&gt;I really dislike that warriors are the only viable progression main tanks.
---
Yes. That's how the thread started. That statement is true. I'm actually completely mystified as what you are arguing about, as I was reinforcing that statement. Ferals are great non-progression tanks and they are great off tanks. This is a well known fact I have not disagreed with. Ferals are not good progression *main* tanks.
---
&gt;bosses are good for and bad for druids, as well as demonstrating *that while not the best*
---
Ok great, so we're done. My point has been made and you've provided your concession. Thank you.
---
Just to prove a point, here's a list of pre-Naxx bosses you would never use a Druid as an MT on *for progression* under any circumstances unless you want to purposefully handicap your undergeared raid:
---
* Vaelastrasz
---
* Broodlord
---
* Chromaggus
---
* Nefarian
---
* Sartura (pointless)
---
* Huhuran
---
* Twin Emps
---
* C'thun
---
For Horde, add in any boss that has a MT fear mechanic as well.
---
You are correct.
---
&gt;One in Scholomance (Ras Frostwhisper's room) - used to be that this was the only one
---
They added the BWL alchemy lab in 1.8 just so raiders could easily craft their flasks there instead of doing useless scholo runs at that point of the game.
---
But scholo is the only alchemy lab pre BWL and it crafts all flasks even post BWL so anyone can run in there and use it with a 5man.
---
When it's ready^^^TM
---
&gt;For every amazing/nail-biting/exhilarating PvP experience you have (and those ARE fun) there will be 9 times you'll be corpse camped/ganked.
---
My experience was always the opposite. Closer to 9 positive experiences for every one bad one.
---
Undead
---
Ah. Got me good.
---
Pallet town
---
I’m going to be in The minority here I think but for me it’s Mulgore and Dun Morogh.
---
Like I said, it's a intended functionality...
---
But that does not mean blizzard had in mind for players to abuse it like this..
---
Don’t put stickers on the paint.
---
Are you trolling? I literally can't tell
---
Crafting is iconic in classic wow.   You will become known for what your professions are if you actively use them.  
---
Lots of high end guilds accept social members that just help out with 5 mans and mats. And then bring them to content that's on farm and deck them out as they are gearing alts.      
---
Theres lots of room for people that arent into the big raiding scene.    
---
Id suggest being a casual member of a functional guild rather than *one of the 60s* in a social leveling guild where people just ask for help with low level  dungeons all day.
---
This is probably the internal raid testing, and they accidentally made it public briefly. BiS gear is likely because they don't want to require as much skill and practice from the testers but also don't want to fully cheat while testing mechanics.
---
Back in 2004 it wasn't called Classic.  So technically Classic can't be 'back' as we've never had it yet!
---
.... In order to *test* you have to *play*.
---
Strongly suggest 3/3 hit talent as it applies to HoJ in pvp (very important) and will help with farming dps.
---
My first child is due in three weeks and I really have absolutely nothing to expect and this honestly really helped me in a weird way. When I think about having a child I think about how much work it’s going to be and how important of a job it is to be a good father (or mother), but I took this as a reminder not to stress myself out and try to enjoy myself throughout the process. With that said I think I’ll grind until my eyes bleed.
---
But it really doesn't.  If two people need a heal each, I select player A with my mouse and press a heal hotkey (and since my right and left hands can operate independently and simultaneously the delay between my right hand clicking my left mouse button, and my left hand pressing a hotkey is quite literally a tiny fraction of a second.
---
So I've cast a heal on player A.  Now the 1.2s (depending on haste or whatever) GCD is swishing and doing its thing.  I select player B in preparation to heal them.  Guess what?    **The exact same GCD is still in progress**, rendering any fractional time lost between click and hotkey utterly moot because I have to wait on the GCD **anyway**.
---
Since healing is largely about efficiency, the only time a mouseover macro is arguably useful is for **emergency heals,** and even then the benefits are marginal.
---
In fact, mouseover macros can actually **reduce the control you have** because during the chaos of a fight you are depressing the RMB to pan the camera around to notice and steer yourself out of harm's way, and you accidentally happen to mouse over the wrong target before casting your heal.  By clicking, you get **solid confirmation** that you have the right target selected.
---
Yeah that's right Blizzard, hear that? Shut the servers down! This guy says no one will play.
---
Teldrassil.  The first character I ever created ended up being my main till BfA.  For me, the music and ambiance hooked me right away.
---
  I didn't know wtf fear ward was, but I knew nobody else got those sweet Starshards baby
---
Source?
---
Save your gold
---
&gt;No one said people wouldn't still play the game.
---
Who? What "dev"? Your uncle who works at Nintendo?
---
The reason OSRS crushes RS3 is because they actually improve the game and didn't just let it stagnate on the original 2007 build. If Classic is going to beat retail long term I think it needs the same.
---
I've healed before, and generally speaking, if there aren't multiple people in need of healing at any given time, then you're not in an emergency situation and **therefore it doesn't sodding MATTER if you lose a few milliseconds from healing conventionally.**
---
Dun morogh. 
---
It's hard (as compared to many other zones like elwynn or mulgore), but there are vendors EVERYWHERE (the mortar team at the entrance, kharanos, gol'bar quarry, steelgrill's depot, brewnall village).  So bag space is rarely frustrating. 
---
It's pretty easy to get away from people as there are multiple paths around the zone, unlike say, durotar which is a giant tunnel and you have to backtrack extensively to get up on top of the harpy tunnels.  
---
It's quite easy to find nodes, as they contrast well with the white of the snow. 
---
Also, if you want to do darkshore, it is quite important to run to loch modan anyways for the bear meat recipe, of you cannot do anything with the bear meat from darkshore.
---
The one big issue is how you respawn in coldridge if you die anywhere in the back third of the zone, which is really annoying.
---
Given your dodge about my question on whether or not you actually bothered to read what you replied to, I'll take my leave.
---
And ultimately it will be replaced by blue once ZG drops. 
---
It's not even close to the Mage or Priest ones, which are huge upgrades over their respective blues and are actually BIS at least until T2, and even then only if you're completing a necessary set bonus.
---
Flying mounts were the main selling point for many players. People were talking about it all the time in vanilla, there's an NY times article with Jeff here he talks about people being sad and upset about only getting flying in Outland and not on Kalimdor.
---
Here's an [article](https://www.gamesradar.com/top-7-things-youll-love-and-hate-about-burning-crusade/4/) before TBC was released 
---
&gt;
---
Players have dreamed of soaring through the skies on their own flying mount since the dawn of WoW and thanks to The Burning Crusade, those dreams will come true once you hit the new level cap of 70... You can immediately jump right into exploring areas unreachable by foot and poking slow levelers from above.
---
I think we had no idea how it would effect the world. At the time it was like "HELL YEAH WE FLYING NOW BOYS" but we were just ignorant to what it would do to the sense of exploration and game feel.
---
Okeydoke, have a nice day.
---
I think priests.  Shaman are awesome but mana tide spec is not that awesome.
---
Countdown to Classic. It’s the only thing keeping me sane while I wait for the release lol
---
You can’t sap someone for 30 seconds.
---
&gt; Flying mounts were the main selling point for many players.
---
That doesn't mean "everyone was asking for it".
---
Amen brother
---
Sounds like you've never played on a PTR w/ templates where they give you max gear at max level. This content has been out for 15 years, it won't cheapen it for anyone. Those beta testers for sure will still play it just as much.
---
Literally everything they've ever said about their internal processes and planning.
---
Or grab them and have +12 axes on an orc.
---
Sap the NPC.
---
Sounds like you're comparing a game which is entirely about the destination to one that's about the journey.
---
A+
---
There's no reason they can't eventually add Blood Elves or Death Knights to Classic. Outland and Northrend areas could still be heavily based on the expansions.
---
WE MAY NEVER KNOW
---
Tauren music is the best music in the game and it has the coolest capital city. My guild still questions why my hearth is Thuderbluff
---
Teldrassil. Beautiful area.
---
Mulgore. Beautiful scenery with the rolling hills and mesas.
---
My only complaint is there are far too many apex predators just wandering around.  The ecology couldn't support that many wolves and mountain lions in one place.
---
No wonder there are so many kill quests.
---
Thank you. Data seems to line up with PServers, only changes being the Crit Suppression and 1% hit bonus for +5 weapon skill.
---
I'm not comparing any games at all, I'm talking about Vanilla WoW. Which is both the journey and the destination. Enabling a small sample of players to test something for a small amount of time doesn't ruin either of those.
---
Do you think it’s possible / how long would it take  monthly for someone with only cata (maybe mop?) to farm gold for a sub?
---
The Defias Traitor is an NPC.
---
What are your plans for the podcast once classic is released? Will the show continue? Will the name change? Just kinda struck me at work while listening in on today's episode. The fact dawned on me that theres a chance my favorite Aussie will no longer be screaming in my ear giving me emotional whiplash on what class to play. I'd love too see the show become like a weekly update on what's happening in our wonderful fantasy world.
---
&gt; Sounds like you've never played on a PTR w/ templates where they give you max gear at max level.
---
????
---
Few additions:
---
There are two types of fear physical and spell, the spell one can me dispelled by a priest or paladin. 
---
Fear Ward is only available to Dwarf Priests 
---
Tremor totem only available to Horde and it pulses every 3 or 5 seconds
---
Berserker Rage is only castable from Berserker Stance 
---
Warriors have access to a talent - Death wish 30 sec fear immune on a 3 min CD
---
Paladin bubble 
---
I am not sure if blessing of protection removes physical fear on a target.
---
Some class PVP trinkets remove fear as well as a profession trinket.
---
Well this sub is called Classicwow, you know.  It's going to be populated by a lot of people who aren't into retail. 
---
Would you walk into a vegetarian restaurant and accuse people dining there of circle-jerking against meat?
---
&gt;*links literal farm content naxxramas*
---
I give up
---
Lol I love the intro.
---
&gt;I can probably click three different party nameplates in one second without really trying
---
This might be the most interesting flex I've seen on this sub yet
---
Delayed with no date mentioned with Classic being little over a month away... biting the wire on that.
---
This went from a reasonable, good natured proposition to "hahaha guys classic is the best and retail players are dumb" super fast.
---
That aside, I'd be happy to be wrong, but modern runescape does not have the numbers that modern WoW does, so it will be much harder for classic to overtake it. If it does, that's cool. Blizzard has the money to develop both and retail still pulls in more than enough to develop it. My ideal outcome is Blizzard supports more classic style content while continuing to update retail.
---
I like that post saying they arent ready to test a 15 year old game for the third time
---
Sure, you can say that, which means it is dead to you, not to everyone else. So stop saying it’s dead for everyone.
---
When was this recorded? This is actually interesting
---
I imagine the fear that locks give is a spell, what could be an example of physical fear?
---
WoW has been pleasing 90% of the playerbase on decisions for 15 years. That's why now those cumulative 10%s have grown to such a large number.
---
And I’m a Nigerian prince who has a deal for you.
---
Probably Elwynn, as unoriginal as that may be. Elwynn is a beautiful zone, and Westfall is my favorite zone in the game. Just crossing West from the gnoll infested forest on the edge of Elwynn into the sparse desert of Westfall was a magical moment. Helping Blanchey get her oats and assisting the many farmers who’ve lost their lands, only to travel to Sentinel Hill and be sent on a deadlier mission to stop the rogue Defias Brotherhood and villainous VanCleef from toppling Stormwind and the alliance was an incredible experience. Roaming the arid land, watching for the ??-level Dust Devils to jump you when you least expect it... what a zone!
---
But seriously, f*ck those level 60 Warlocks that troll their own faction by summoning infernals to kill lowbies and NPC’s in Sentinel Hill
---
hes LIVESTREAMING farm content naxx, look at his vods you spastic.
---
Intim shout is the main one. Can't dispel it.
---
To be fair Druid’s flash heal is down ranked healing touch, regrow is used sparingly if HoTs are needed.

I'm doing both.  You should too.
---
Looking for chair recommendations. Not interested in a $1250 Herman Miller though
---
With the patch we're going into and all of the gold-making information available I don't see why getting your mount is a big deal anymore.
---
I might actually slow cook two pot roasts on Sunday and just eat that shit all week during launch. It reheats so well and so quickly in some gravy.
---
I'm not planning on min-maxing and just want to enjoy the leveling and lore side of things, I want to go horde.
---
Whats the best in terms of most fun leveling experience?
---
I know that's quite opinionated but just want something with a strong story
---
That's exactly my mentality. If the stress test is going to be Aug and Aug 13th is when we reserve names, I might as well sub for the stress.
---
Personally, I fully support blizzard making as many changes to classic as they like as long as it still feels vanilla and old school. The game has had a *lot* of improvements since vanilla, for example the group finder tool (the premade part not the automated part) is a vastly improved version of the original meeting stone system.

---
Warrior fear is physical, warlock and priest is spells. Warlocks also have horror from Death Coil I think that one is only hard countered with the immunity spell.
---
I know some bosses also have physical and some have spell based fears.
---
Don't agree.  
---
Void you get 6 sp, and trade 12 int for 14 vit. 
---
Truefaith you get 8 healing, and trade 11 spirit 5 int for 6 mp5 and 14 vit.  6 mp5 alone is worth way more in itemization than 11 spirit and 5 int.  
---
Ultimately though you won't be replacing truefaith for a long ass time.  Earliest would be T2 but only to complete the 3pc or 8pc set bonus. 
---
Aside from that the first clear numerical upgrade is Frankriss. 
---
You will replace robe of the Void with Bloodvine from the ZG pattern.
---
A man of culture, I see.
---
To RP and generally i prefer the community on RP servers to be a improvement my favorite moments in classic was not molten core exc but large scale RP events we organized cross faction. A rp server is not for everyone though.
---
Most gaming chairs (~$300) work out pretty well. I use a DX Racer and can sit for 12-14 hours with no pain. Most say Bucket seat style race car chairs aren't great for gaming but having used one for 4-5 years, I can say it was worth the investment.
---
Thanks!
---
1) Expect a challenge. You WILL die, it doesn’t matter what class you play. The mobs are all hard, aggro each other, and run away into dangerous areas when they’re low. I’ve been playing WoW since 2005 and I STILL die at least once in every zone
---
2) Have fun. The best thing about Classic (compared to current retail) is the community and group play aspect of it, as well as the fact that leveling wasn’t a race but an experience. Getting lost, wandering into zones too high level for you, grouping with strangers for dungeons and making longtime friends with those strangers makes Classic what it is; an incredible game
---
That’s some details speak right there. You probably love BFA huh?
---
I have debated doing Enchanting / Engineering.
---
I got my little brother a DX for his b day. It’s good quality and all, but I think he found it to be a bit too tight of a fit. In my research I really liked the Secret Labs with a cloth weave, but haven’t pulled the trigger yet
---
This is assuming you don't start rotating alts into play.
---
Do you have a text version?
---
Priest is the more flexible healer, Druid is the more flexible class.
---
Lot better itemization for Priests than Druids.
---
Druid has no OOC rez, which hurts them in 5 mans.
---
Less competition for loot with a Druid.
---
You can't gank nPCs, that is a PC only thing
---
29 is my absolute favorite because it’s got enough skills for interesting combat and takes relatively little time to level so there’s generally a good population. Also the balance is okay, it’s really only casters that are super lagging behind. 
---
I’m planning on making a 29 shaman (can’t decide between Tauren and orc though!)
---
What I like to do is get a Pot Roast from Costco, two brown gravy mix, add water and some banana peppers. Once it is soft enough where you can slice it but it doesn't pull apart, take it out. 
---
Get yourself some steak rolls. Cut em in half. Put mayonnaise on one side and dip the other side in the gravy juice from your crock pot.
---
Holy shit that is amazing. Great hardy sandwiches.
---
It would be nice to keep classic as classic and flesh out all the side stories that are vaguely mentioned or not even told in game that took place up to vanillas conclusion. 
---
There is so much content untouched from old wow.
---
Staples hyken &amp; IKEA markus.   
---
I have the hyken and its amazing, but I believe it isn't comfortable for tall people 5"11+.
---
There is a 1 day old sticky with 500 comments for this exact topic btw.
---
I am still keeping my fingers crossed.
---
Per the post you effectively get 1%, not 3%.  
---
&gt; This means that the so-called “hit cap” is in effect 9% rather than 8% for a player with 300 Weapon Skill fighting a level 63 monster with a Defense Skill of 315. With a Weapon Skill of 305, such as from Sword Specialization (Humans) or Axe Specialization (Orcs), this hit modifier is no longer in place against +3 level monsters, provided that you are using the appropriate weapon type to gain the passive bonus. Needless to say, this makes +Weapon Skill very good against raid-level monsters.
---
What's on first who's on second and I dont know is on third
---
Must of been luck of the draw for me then. Mine fits me great. The nice thing is there is so many competitors, you can find one that fits you perfect.
---
Baby coming september 1st pog
---
You dont have to play or like vanilla. 
---
I see the old but this spec is trash post. 
---
Modern has total balance and it is available for you to play now. 
---
Can you just let vanilla be vanilla.
---
Children start forming attachments long before toddler age, and they can understand speech long before they can emulate it.  If you intend to no-life it with babies, make sure they spend lots of time on your knee and that you spend loading screens playing with them.  That said, babies don’t leave much room for gaming since you pretty much have to sleep when they do, since they most certainly *won’t* sleep when you do.
---
Protip: kids love open world farming...
---
Teldrassil for Alliance and Mulgore for Horde.
---
Okay, I’ll check that out. My current is the staples $100 model. Don’t know the name but the arm rest padding is starting to give out :(
---
Mine S Tier list said to convince my girlfriend to play with me who's never played wow before
---
Yeah, gonna have to continue digging but secret labs seems most probable for the time being
---
Check out MSI. I didn’t know about them until I moved to Japan and saw an ad. I bought a laptop and it runs like a dream (and was extremely cheap). Awesome company, great product, 10/10 would recommend. Just make sure to remove some of the excess programs (like DragonCentre). They don’t do much except take up space on your computer
---
Play a priest, druids are for champs.
---
Ya it's pretty ridiculous. Hahaha
---
It's bad game design because I, as a paladin, am forced to wear cloth and sit in the back lines instead of swinging my sword for great justice. You can try to defend blizzard all you want, but they messed up big time with the Paladin in classic. Even the guy who designed the class says he deeply regretted how it turned out.
---
Not typically (unless you were creating, or helping someone make, a twink)
---
If Classic is truly successful (like 5 million active players), you’ll see them alter retail back to what Classic is.
---
I feel they’ll leave Classic to what it is, but try to capture those players in Classic with a new Retail expansion that squishes levels back to 60, emphasis on community, removing micro transactions, etc.
---
Microtransactions are a big thing for Blizzard, but  12 million concurrent subs is more important to them.
---
I tend to agree i have never considered the name of a server as part as my server decisions type population how balanced is the server and usually before i permanently set up a camp i create my bank character and take a look at the auction house. Of course on a new server  what type of server is all that will initially matter.
---
Troll animations for anything but 2handers are meh to me so I’d go with Tauren because they got cool animations for all the warrior weapon types.
---
You can drop character and be a normal, decent human again.
---
&gt;Death Coil I think that one is only hard countered with the immunity spell.
---
What do you mean by that? If you mean fear ward I'm pretty sure it has no effect on death coil. I don't think anything that interacts with fear works on deathcoil.
---
The most ironic part of this statement is the lack of understanding that on FRESH PROGRESSION for NAXX you are the superior tank as a feral, you are entering naxx in FULL BIS compared to a warrior who will be entering in T2.
---
but regardless, i linked one of the progression vods just for you, maybe it will blow your mind how different(hint: its not much different) it is.
---
Doesnt explain why it would be available on the Beta realms. If beta players got access to the Alpha realm that would make sense but this was patched into the beta realms for some reason.
---
Taking 3 weeks PTO on launch date, starting a new role with a new team when I return from that lol. Gonna take discipline to remind myself that I have an amazing opportunity in front of me and can't squander it on this stupid game. First impression will be key.
---
Yes. I'll groom mine to healbot.  Perfect timing!
---
Always do your own accounts man it’s what’s best.
---
Agreed, but what's the next step after TBC? Release every expansion until it laps itself? I love and can't wait for wow classic but the longevity of the game worries me.
---
Ditch the account that got hacked and start a fresh one. Make the password nice and secure, too.  
---
You sure you're friend didn't just steal your character?
---
I literally huh-huh'ed just like Butthead lmao
---
Why do they have to die by breath when they leave the raid instead of just jumping into the conveniently placed eggs?
---
My only regret is that I have but one upvote to give
---
Yeah I’m positive of that. He played and leveled a rogue to 30 then quit and never even tried to play again
---

I had twins and a few weeks of leave was me and my wife taking turns while the other slept. Ugh.
---
For sure, those smiles are gold.
---
3K was the high population servers and it was for all zones of the server, not 6 starting zones. Do you really think taking the total concurrent users of a high pop vanilla server and forcing everyone into 6 zones is going to result in a great gaming experience when everyone needs the same resources to level?
---
Not if you make it yourself.  Why so down on the faith my guy?
---
Do you...
---
... like cherry pie?
---
I still to this day remember a undead Rogue that ruined my day doing this over and over all day long. Qtip was his name and if i ever come across that name in classic i am setting up camp. It is weird that i still remember names of opposing faction players and guilds from Vanilla but not any other expansion.
---
Bubble, Iceblock, Grounding totem, maybe well timed feign death and vanish?
---
I was in a Latino/Spanish guild in aprivate server, idk if they are rolling on classic, si encuentra avisa
---
It still costs that much. You could have had 500g instead of the mats.
---
It does not run on the BFA client, it's a seperate installation. All WoW versions now share what they can, my Classic client folder is 700mb because most of it is being used from my Classic Beta folder for example, I forget how big Beta is
---
Also fear does not break easily to damage like it does today. A warlock can stack full dots on you and by the time the fear breaks and you run back to the warlock, you may be at half hp or lower. The dot damage is small and incremental enough that it does not always break fear like it would in retail.
---
That would spawn dozens of whelps which would likely wipe the remaining players
---
Investing anything into an account that isn’t in your name is pretty dumb. 99% chance it won’t matter but still dumb.
---
The problem I find is how you're going to consistently get together with 4 other nerds to do this. Chances of someone outleveling the rest is very high.
---
When did osrs release and have they added any patches to it since release? (never got into rs as a kid).
---
Everything in WoW costs gold if you want to be a downer.
---
Not really that game breaking aq and bwl can be cleared easily without using this and it's not useful outside of ony.
---
I choose childless forever.
---
That list is nowhere near a full staff of software engineers, but you have to remember that Classic WoW is not about just turning on old software, they have had to REBUILD the game in simple terms. The hardware that the files use to run on is long gone and the files would not run on the new hardware. They have been working hard on fixing issues and will need to have software engineers working constantly as each patch will need help in order to work. Software Engineers are not going to spread their time out between games, they are going to have a team of engineers that only work on Classic WoW. It will not be anywhere near the size of a team that works on Retail, but it will still be a team of multiple engineers working to fix the issues. 
---
I picked the jobs that I know will be working on Classic WoW at all times, there are over 55 listed jobs at Blizzard, from interns to cinematic producers, each with their own pay. And I did not list every job that I can say will be working on Classic, because it would have been a list. 
---
The fact still is the same, a private server costs only fractions of what it costs Blizzard.
---
Ahh yeah, thank you. I hadn't really thought about needing different gear sets.
---
AV
---
I'm pretty sure WotLK Ony also just straight dropped helms.
---
The correct answer is exactly what they did last time because population exploded in burning Crusade and then went up again greatly and Wrath. World of Warcraft is the kind of game we're the only thing stopping players from burning themselves out is players choosing to play in moderation. We've been through this once before already, it's going to happen again, players will get burned out before the end of an expansion and there is no stopping that, there is nothing blizzard can do to stop that
---

Dwarf Priest.
---
Yeetus the fetus
---
They're also assuming that boss armor can go down to 0.   There's NOTHING to justify that belief.   It's just an assumption.
---
I think 10 months. March till January when TBC dropped. But not confirmed chnage in 2.0. So could have been longer after vanilla. Regardless 10 months is a long ass period of vanilla
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
It makes it so you don't need to target a player to heal them, you just hover the mouse over the player/party/raid frame. It makes targeting faster because you don't have to select players by clicking them, but it also allows you to keep the same target while healing which can be useful for enemy dispell or interrupt or just watching the debuffs on the main tank.
---
Ah ok, yeah the abilities that make you immune to literally everything in the game make you immune to deathcoil yes.
---
I'd say pvp racials are more important
---
Now that’s what I like to hear! Good luck my friend!
---
Raid bosses in classic have -4.8% chance to be crit btw.
---
So what's the reason Blizzard doesn't employ countless hours of free labor but instead internalizes all 40-60 testing?
---
Ayyy just wait for TBC servers!
---
There is an endless supply of beef.
---
hope they don't delay the actual launch... I've taken time off work T_T
---
Atiesh isn't bis though...
---
So do you have these vurtne videos to compare? Or are you just completely full of shit in order to bullshit your agenda?
---
That's just it. Go in blind.

If you have questions, socialise and ask people in game. Good chance to form relationships and make friends with other like-minded players that way.  
---
There will be at times people say JuSt GoOgLe iT, but that's a big factor that killed the social aspect of WoW. Hardly anyone needs to talk or socialise as much any more cause they just make it meta and use all this third party software/websites and stuff. And Blizzard otherwise implemented all these automated systems to take out the thinking and communication aspects that were good for the health of the game and community.  
---
But don't let that discourage you, find the players out there you can bond with. Adventure together; Explore together; Save Azeroth together.  
---
Have fun!
---
They will just pretend that they were for vanilla all along.
---
Checks, just in case............play button still deactivated *Queue Hello Darkness My Old Friend*
---
very excited to get a holiday hat
---
Sometime **before** character creation. We don't know past that.
---
They used to do it for the PTR back in the day during vanilla. Everyone would try to get into the PTR just to make a fully decked out tier 2 charecter.
---
Tips was saying Trolls are the new Orcs for threat generation. 
---
Man this is driving me insane.  For PVE TANKING, troll, orc or Tauren!!!!?
---
Shadow priest
---
Whelp that verifies that level 60 content is being tested. Im sure we all could have assumed as much. But we know now. BIS templates for their internal testers.
---
If you're playing WoW while your kids (baby and toddlers) are still awake, you're just a bad parent.
---
You should be engaging them all the time at that age. Reading, playing, wrestling, eye contact, talking etc.
---
The first 5 years of a child's life literally mould the foundation of it's brain for the rest of it's life. The way it gets wired, some of the predispositions etc.
---
If they're old enough to play with you then go for it, if not then wait until you put them down for the night or schedule an hour for your "hobby time".
---
The bottom line is, interacting with your young child should be the #1 priority to ensure proper and optimal development. 
---
I don't turn on a game console or my laptop until my 3 year old is napping or sleeping, or if the wife takes him to a park and I decide to hang back.
---
If you want good storytelling and lore, join Alliance. Horde has nothing to offer lther than tribalism lorewise.
---
The grudge is real.
---
Classic is the BFA client. Addons from pserver that use 1.12 clients won't work.
---
Just because Classic doesn't use the assets from BFA doesn't mean that it doesn't use the same infrastructure.
---
Dude, if he has a kid in November expect him to be pre raid BiS sometime in July of 2020.
---
You haven't got facts. You don't know shit. You claim parry haste is somehow gonna blow up the tank, but you have no clue how much damage bosses do. Losing a bit of crit does not invalidate fury tanking at all. Even if every thing works out the way you claim threatwise, with less crit, more parry,  the combination of flurry and thunderfury procs still pushes way more threat at the very least, and you will always be able to fury tank the previous raid tier with gear from the first.
---
We also STRAIGHT UP have a video of a dual wielding tank in vanilla, on nefarian of all bosses. She doesn't parry and blow him up. This game is unfortunately going to likely be a lot easier than people think.
---
Keep Classic separate. It should be a museum that always exists and shouldnt be modified.
---
I want TBC servers, but they should be STANDALONE. No xfers or anything from Classic. Make everyone level from level 1 if they want to play TBC. No transferred economies or anything like that.
---
I think they should do all 3 server types. Classic - TBC - WOTLK and keep them all siloed off from each other.
---
&gt; If you think age brings maturity, you're very young
---
lmao
---
No kids. Only a cat. I think I'm in the clear.
---
Dungeons/crafting/pvp. Even casuals can raid, though.
---
You’re just addressing an issue that’s always been around.
---
Corrupt loot councils, which is imo worse than one single player wasting their egpg. Simply say it’s not allowed, if anyone breaks the rule they forfeit their epgp gain for 2-3 weeks, as well as the person who received the loot. If they get mad they quit instantly, big whoop. If they truly didn’t mean to offend, they’ll stick around.
---
I just want to play vannila nothing more nothing less if I wanted constant updates would just play live.
---
The world in vannila felt like it was real and was perfect for facilitating my own adventures giving it almost unlimited repeatability for me.
---
Is this Families you speak of a new game?
---
It is possible to keep your crafting up high enough that you can make gear relevant to yourself as you level. It just takes a pretty big time investment. Just because that time investment isn't worth it for speed levelers and people only interested in endgame doesn't mean it's not worth it.
---
On my original vanilla main Paladin, I really enjoyed working on my blacksmithing. For example, I had a full set of Green Iron and it was an upgrade at the time (and I would always find buyers for Green Iron stuff on the AH). I never got into end game stuff enough to make anything high end, but being a miner/blacksmith was an important part of my character and an important part of the classic experience.
---
I guess what I’m getting at is at some point though the best gear is only attainable in raids?
---
In particular for long dungeons like WC, I would help lower levels with my 60 fury warrior by murdering the place for them.  The warrior was my alt, with a sword from MC and some blue gear, so not very geared.  Scarlet Monastery cathedral was about the extent to what I could solo run without the other person contributing, but I was able to help lots of people by smashing low level dungeons so they could knock out the quests.
---
Back in the day they gave away 60s with full epics on the PTR to test new content.
---
Well let's listen to the "facts" from the shit pirated server theorycrafters.
---
Someone in 2006 tested Ironfoe.  3200 swings, and came to the conclusion that it proc'd about 2.5 proc chance%, but then he just says that seems wrong.  4% is a good round number.
---
I hate the bug-like abuse of game mechanics people have develop for this classic experience.
---
Vanilla gonna suck if we have to abuse raid lock outs and camp offline with world buffs to be top tier players.  It may be vanilla code but it’s not vanilla spirit.
---
Isn’t losing 4 seconds the worst case scenario, not best? It feels like in a vacuum this actually does work, but I completely agree in practice it’s never going to.
---
T-0.01: both 1h magically land at the same time
---
T0.0: swap to 2h
---
T1.5: Overpower
---
T3.0: WW/any ability 
---
T3.5: 2h lands
---
T3.51: swap to 1h
---
I’m not positive this is how it would work, so tell what’s wrong here.
---
In practice you should clip on average 2 seconds of 1h autos assuming you swap at random when overpower is active, and probably .5-1 second of 2h autos. Plus the gcds though those could be mitigated by performing an extra attack before swapping.
---
It's not that there's no money in it, it's that crafting is a bigger timesink away from leveling than gathering is.
---
Man I remember when I thought and said all the same shit you're spewing before I had my first.
---
You're in for a rude awakening, even with 12 weeks off, a baby mama that doesn't game and takes care of the baby and thinking babies sleep 16 hours a day (lol).
---
My son was born 2 weeks early on the DAY legion released. Guess when I ended up playing Legion? When I was unlocking Nightborne in BFA.
---
I thought the same thing you were saying when Legion was coming out, I thought the stars alligned for me too.
---
You will be in denial for a while, but one day it will hit you and you will mutter to yourself "I was a fool"
---
It's just my personal experience but I never really saw any guides on stuff like this until at least 6 months in. Some of this stuff is info I have never heard before because people didn't fully optimize until private servers that I never played on.
---
I guess it could just be that back then I was bad at finding the information.
---
"Brb, smokes."
---
Idk blizzards heyday was full of them taking mechanics and ideas from other games and improving upon them. Don't see why they would follow in Runescape a footsteps by creating wow classic and simply leaving it at that.
---
The trash farming has been going on for years. I see nothing wrong with that. 
---
The onyxia exploit is bad though.
---
No problem. Another thing I just realized is that it would fill a lot of people's bags with onyxias head. So the quest would always have somebody trying to hand in
---
It doesn't matter that much, since you can fill it with mostly people that don't need the gear. Getting 3-4 kills will more than make up for missing some loot one slot.
---
You want to dps, play rogue.  They won't be too overpopulated to find a raid spot.
---
Play shaman, buy nightfall, find a guild that will let you dps. Live your best shaman life
---
Well it does fill people's bags with a ton of onyxia heads. So depending on how that turn in work, it could change other raids a bit.
---
If you roll an alt warlock once the economy's established enough, buy yourself a set of +spellpower greens for leveling. The ability to run around dotting everything, then run back to loot the corpses is wonderful.
---
Teach me the ways of the huntard!
---
That seems like an abusive invasion of privacy that should be outlined in laymen terms. 
---
Oh well. We sign away a Small right every day in this Information Age.
---
Mulgore and Dun Morogh are tied for me. I love both races equally.
---
I love the wide open-ness and rolling plains. I love just grabbing 10 quests and coming back with em all done an hour later.
---
The dorfs are different, I actually dislike the terrain but I love the cozy feeling you get when you enter the inns and the snow mountainous area has its own beauty.
---
I absolutely hate teldrassil, as I do for all the night elf zones. Horrible terrain, quests bore me, and I feel like im about to fall asleep with the purple color hue everywhere.
---
Very few people at Blizzard have access to things like sub numbers and financial information like that. Its mostly the CFO and top executives and they can get in real trouble with the SEC if they leak that stuff without a official filling. Not to mention that information is worth a lot of money because if the insider trading you could do.
---
To me, it sounds like it's going to be a shit show on the day of release.
---
The pirated servers are complete shit.
---
Mine are 11 and 16.  Is this still an option?
---
Just having a second gathering profession and selling all your mats gives you pretty good supplemental income and takes almost no extra time, which is a lot less than an hour here or there. Just gathering what you run across when you adventure and then crafting whatever you can isn't going to make you very much money, because your professions won't keep up with your level without extra effort. 
---
If you're serious about trying to make money from it, it can get pretty involved. Besides just keeping your professions up, there's tracking the auction house, figuring out what's going to be profitable, figuring out if it's worth it to buy mats for certain recipes, etc.
---
Except Westfall... or Silverpine.
---
I'm rolling tauren purely for looks 
---
Had an orc I'm vanilla and always regretted it cosmetically
---
The only issue I have with the 2 hour window is if the player buying is using gold they purchased for real money.  Otherwise if they can make a legitimate trade it seems fair.
---
Don't forget Orc Rogues. They are just terrible human beings, too.
---
Yeah, it's not really about saving time though. Much more about freeing up a keybind (if you'd like to use Mouseclick)/mental clutter and also allowing you to maintain a target while healing other people if you're wanding an enemy or would like to keep your MT selected for convenience.
---
so is that a no?
---
this is difficult to do so who cares, i've seen plenty of people try to do normal stuff which is a struggle as is. If it exists, fawk, but we are talking as if everyone is amazing. NONE OF U RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
why?
---
2 is ideal
---
&gt;amage to a fear targeted isnt per chance on damage to break, but rather once a fixed amount is done, the fear breaks. This was changed endlessly during vanilla"s course
---
I was really hoping this was a private server bug, but alas, it's legit
---
Thank you for this.
---
Honestly good for you dude fuck that warlock douche bag if he wants to tank let him and inform the healer to let him.  especially when he life taps per pull at no health to not heal him it’s makes it more fun to fuck him.  And definitely make him learn his lesson.
---
Skinning mining while leveling, vendor all levels, keep all mining materials on bank alt, drop skinning after you get 60% mount and start using the mining bits to level engi. Most of the good engi trinkets are a bit higher level or need 225 and up (req lvl 35) so it works out pretty nicely. I’m probably going to do the same but skinning/herbing then pick up alchemy
---
For me, there is literally no mechanic they could add from BC or Wrath that would make me hate the game except LFR. There are some that I like more than others but nothing was added in the first 2 expansions that made the game bad.
---
Fake, show account characters and lvls...
---
In pve this is absolutely true. would disagree about pvp though because ele shamans wreck a lot of other casters and people don’t like to lock on alliance. Plus HOF is op as fuck on melees, especially warrior, + escape artist
---
Nah. No problem. I dont care either way. After all, it's only a video game. I'm sure Blizzard will do a great job.
---
This was literally the best thing I’ve read in 2019.
---
I strangled my social life with a belt a couple weeks ago so that I'd have more time for WoW.
---
&gt; A lot of people are wired to receive pleasure when they cause other people grief.
---
Assholes.
---
Assholes are wired like that.
---
To be fair, at low AP it’s not easy to notice the difference between 0.1 second difference in weapon speed normalization. 
---
A group of good beta testers looked at the numbers and speculated that they were a tiny bit off and did a good job testing and documenting it, it was then fixed the next day (probably a DB change that requires a “restart”. 
---
That’s exactly what s Beta is for.
---
The entire Van Cleen clan could not make it past SW’s gates. What a bunch of morons.
---
perfect timing for the 3 free days to expire and you'd need to sub to 'stress test'
---
pathetic blizzard.
---
If the child remembers that or not, if I would have a family I wouldn't give a single damn about WoW.
---
Keep them downvotes coming, just my opinion.
---
True, but that was a combination of timing (TBC came out not long after) and the struggle to get 40 competent raiders together. Most guilds that struggled to progress in vanilla did so not because of "meme" specs, but because half the people in the raid were just bad at the game, regardless of which class/spec they chose. Top guilds at the time were usually okay with bringing a few meme spec'd classes, as long as you knew what the fuck you were doing and came prepared, it was fine. The top guild on my old server cleared Naxx with a couple ret pallies, feral druids, and shadow priests.
---
lmfao
---
How is the successful launch of the game on the target date not a victory? Since when is setting a goal and meeting it not a win?
---
I am excited for Children's Week so me and my boy Speedy can be reunited.
---
turn slightly so that the mob is more to the front of you than to the back.
---
Warlock is far easier to level, plus the free mount.  Maybe worth leveling first then you can funnel stuff to the rogue when leveling.
---
A lot of those surveys make it look like a lot more than it really is though. They are split into alliance vs horde to accommodate the counts for paladins/shamans. When you add everything else up (basically double them since all other classes can be played by horde &amp; alliance), the number of shamans (and paladins) compared to the rest are pretty low.
---
The answer is going to depend on what you mean by casual. If you can’t/won’t join a guild and commit to raiding then your BiS gear will come from a mixture of (a) dungeons, (b) BoEs from raids you buy, (c) reputation rewards, d) high end PvP ranks, (e) crafter gear.
---
Or to put it this way: nothing good in this game is free. No weekly gear, no gear from doing anything easy, no catch up gear, no soloable BiS gear.
---
to be fair, everything was both requested and argued against, it's just some voices were louder sometimes, or some of the devs happened to agree w/ them, it's not like there was some huge overwhelming majority of wow players that drove every decision
---
You're gonna stop to kill every single mob you agro?  Gl
---
A solution to something that isn't an issue? Seems kinda pointless
---
There wont be such a difference between healing as shadow vs holy.
---
Why do you need addons in Elwynn forest or durotar exactly?
---
Classics back'
---
&gt;so do you believe that it's possible that Vanilla WoW would end up more popular than modern WoW?
---
I don't think that's much of a stretch at this point. Classic only has to be something like 1/6 as popular as Vanilla was to be more successful than retail is atm
---
Here you go:
---
http://classicmaps.xyz/sandbox/
---
Ofcourse you cant Test infight weakauras but it should Cover Most Basic settings!
---
Why mage.... Whhhyyyy should have made a rogue or warrior but nooo
---
Blizzard will more or less be forced to switch the purists for a more semi-hardcore / casual audience once they run out of classic content. Classic is too niche to fit into the modern day video game market for a long period of time. You're right about WoTLK but its better to have that than retail. ..I really dont want DK's tho.
---
I actually forgot about the free mount. Another in the PRO column for Warlock. You might be right.
---
Still doesn't change thr fact that the addons are completely different and incompatible
---
You can heal as shadow through AQ40 at least.  You won't be top notch, but as long as you have separate shadow and healing gear and you play well you can do just fine.
---
annnnnnnnd.... layered!
---
i cant tell if this is a troll video or not
---
Yeah I just mean 1-2 hr avg weekday. With some weekend sessions wk10 should be attainable for the avg non raider.
---
Yes. What video am i lookikg for?
---
Don't want that Gravestone Scepter from BFD?
---
/join lookingforgroup
---
Funny that you compared the r/classicwow community to vegetarians, the irony. So hating on retail wow is now a cause? A ideology? My point is, how can you hate something that you havent even tried yourself? If you have never tasted olives, how can you say that they taste like shit? Your mommy never taught you this?
---
Maybe EQ classic or w/e it's called is the reason?
---
People should also be careful on YouTube, they might come across old footage of Naxx boss kills and it will cheapen the journey for them ;)
---
I can't give you any real numbers for a number of reasons.
---
1. I didn't have beta access past stress test so I couldn't test any of these dungeons myself.
---
2. The xp per hour will vary based on your clear speed.
---
3. private server comparisons won't be accurate since beta dungeons were giving more xp and the elites were easier to kill there.
---
Sorry I can't provide any more information than that so this is pretty much all built around information from locations like classic.db and streamer vods.
---
But you still kill him after the defias dies right?
---
it typically doesn't really save time since you'll be on GCD anyway. But it is nice for being able to keep your current target, which can be useful
---
&gt;all retail specs are just spam.
---
No.
---
A solid team of 25 people could clear MC and Ony eventually. And I mean before BWL drops. Then of course ZG and AQ20 are meant for 20 person teams. Razorgore should also be doable with 25 people, but I think Vael will stop you in BWL. 
---
This is all assuming you never pug or raid with another half sized guild.
---
Is this just because of the sword/mace spec, I would think Night Elf would be a solid choice due to the avoidance but it probably doesn't matter for raiding since you get so much avoidance from other means.
---
Your Solution is too complex. I am a developer myself and often times, of the solution to a problem needs to be detailed that in-depth, then there is usually a better solution.
---
If someone wants to sell the piece, it's on them. As a guild, you are more than welcome to establish rules about loot trading. If you receive the item, you need to equip it right away. If you don't, you get kicked. EZ-PZ, no complicated solution required.
---
Wait, this isn’t Zug Zug at all!?!
---
Yes, that was exactly the point I was making. I was saying Classic uses the BFA engine and that pserver addons wouldn't work on it, I have no clue why you're repeating what I just said.
---
I don't think there is a massive overhead on using layers, seems like something that is mainly done on data. They could just make 3 times as many layers at the start and merge them over the first week or so, most people wouldn't know the difference.
---
honestly something i never thought about, thanks for the info
---
Some of the exalted BG gear is cool. Although I dont know if you need rank to buy them as well or just the rep.
---
Just set up a streaming video camera pointed at your monitor at home and use 4g mouse and keyboard to control the PC while watching your stream. EZ-PZ
---
my naga died on me finally after 5 years, awesome mouse.
---
got it in NA too, was really looking forward to being able to play around with it a bit without having to waste money (not going to sub for a stress test for a day, and retail is just awful)
---
The Boondock Saints &lt;3
---
Can't see it, but if you look at Mekkatorque's left goggle you'll see a guy with a green face and red eyes (lol), and four up from that is a dude with an Alliance full face tattoo, so I think you're middle of the pack on cringe haha.
---
(Not an expert)  
---
Heard that most endgame tanking weapons are Swords. (Which is why humans are op tanks with their +5 sword.)
---
Orcs:
---
As such, +5 axe skill is more for damagedealing builds.
---
Bloodlust, 50% reduced healing is too damaging for a tank.
---
Taurens:
---
Taurens stamina buff is decent. However it will ''never'' really come into affect, as if you're below 5% health, your healers have fucked up. (which hopefully shouldn't be happening.) So that trait is kind of unused.
---
Stomp not really helpful in raids.
---
Trolls 
---
Berserking is basically 10% attack speed. (up to 30 if low on health. But this is harder to guarantee.) This is fairly decent and the only trait which will make a difference as a tank. Basically popping this at the  start of the engagement and this will help stacking up the threat more quickly.
---
(My 5 cents)
---
I responded to the wrong person :)
---
Thank you very much for reminding me that this is very horde specific lol.  I guess it hadn't crossed my mind since I was originally only making this for my guild but I should probably indicate that in the post.  Thanks again and I hope this can be helpful to you regardless of which faction you play.
---
Hey, thanks for the reply I’ll def check it out. When I got my Paly to 60 back in the day I immediately rolled a Priest and started all over again.
---
I know that's not exactly the answer to your question, but I used Clique which let me bind heals to mouse clicks over the party/raid member unit frames. This is more useful in my opinion since looking at the unit frame you can also see the char's health bar so you only have to keep an eye on a small area of your screen
---
I remember doing that in SM. It was just the right size where you could pull the whole instance at once. The biggest issue was the instance lockout timer. Thankfully the different wings were on the same timer. 
---
I remember trying full instance pulls in ZF, but got frogged one to many times to be worth it.
---
&gt;(joking aside though the first few months after childbirth can be magical - although everbody needs their own space from time to time the foundational strength of a family starts from childbirth. Your kid is more important that WoW and should always be the first thing on your mind).
---
you ruined it
---
\*look of confusion*
---
&gt; I have full time housewife that doesn't play video games to take care of the baby.
---
It's like you are from the 1950's
---
Basicaly, more open development and kit for creating your own classic server, with guides for GM commands and creating new content.
---
unbirthing is porn of people(etc) fully getting into other people(etc)'s vaginas
---
no
---
No, but you can force them to grind mats for you
---
That’s a linen-wrap of Orc poop used as an effective method of distraction. You can’t see but there’s an axe-wielding Orc already mid air about to decapitate these silly humans.
---
Put it back! If there are no tangents to read how are we going to kill the time until classic releases?!
---
&gt; I think the voting system is incredibly smart.
---
Uh, no, it's incredibly terrible. If you let vote people for features, they will vote for convenience(LFG, LFR, flying, "easier" combat, etc), even if it will hurt them/the game in the long run.
---
&gt; They didn't have 15 years worth of hindsight between then and now to see what worked, what didn't, and most importantly, why.
---
Neither will most WoW Classic players.
---
Another trick you can use, run forward and when the mob is going to hit you, jump, do a 180 turn to face him while in the air, get hit, and then turn back 180 before you land and keep going your way (while mounted of course)
---
Personally, I hate the way gnomes look and how short they are. That reason alone is enough for me not to roll on gnome. Plus, the human perception racial will be a great help against rogues. Undead rogues are already pretty capable of giving Ally locks a tussle.
---
Also that human rep bonus is so nice. 
---
The only downsides for me regarding human is that I'm just not a fan of the human casting animations.
---
Basically if you can stand looking at a gnome for 200hours. go for it, but I think human has some competitive advantages.
---
dude seriously great post I was afraid you were going the other way with it.
---
Does angone know what class &amp; specs are possible to play PVP and PVE without respec?
---
So to clarify, the combat log list displays the re-applied effect in the logs ?
---
On Pservers it only displays the cast of a debuff when nothing is on the target etc.
---
The difference between nelf/human warrior is about 5x bigger than the difference between gnome/human mage, if we're talking raid dps.
---
I'd bite into a cactus if I could get my original screenshot folder with all my vanilla stuff back.
---
 So many friends and memories lost due to a faulty hard drive.
---
I've always hated in game holidays that just mirror real world ones, terrible for immersion and are pretty uncreative 
---
I'd love an in game holiday that commemorates an in-universe event like the battle of mount hyjal
---
For ally gnome gets the int buff and engineering buff so it is best for horde the races are pretty equal for mage.
---
I kind of like the idea of a disc/holy priest running around the battlefield causing pita's erywhere, unkillable with disc mana efficiency and shields. Sounds fun.
---
Tauren 2H overhead slam is my favorite. Also watstomp is good. Plus more HP? But mostly that overhead slam.
---
That’s exactly what happened to me. Had a not so great Dell computer in which I had to upgrade some stuff to be able to raid. Eventually whole thing got wiped and so did all my screenshots. Deeply regret not backing them up to this day but moments like this make it feel more special.
---
Place Anywhere Settlement Mod.
---
Perhaps you should play shaman for a bit and deside for yourself. No human on earth will tell you what is fun for you personaly.
---
You're not wrong but that doesn't change the fact that the xp per hour here is insane and well worth the travel time.  The youtuber Hakurai served as inspiration for me to make these notes and even he suggests running all the way here in his alliance guide.
---
Link to his channel here.  [https://www.youtube.com/user/Domeran/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/Domeran/videos)
---
You literally just described my experience of playing as a Tank all the way to 60 just recently on a populated Pserver.
---
People would literally get all the way to 60 and not know how to poly, remove debuffs, how to trap, when to aoe and when not and zero understanding of how threat actually works.
---
For anyone who thinks that Classic will be a walk in the park.. trust me you are in for a treat, not to mention that Classic relies entierly on grouping up with people and if your group is playing the game as if you only have one thing to do and that is to dps as fast and as hard as you can xD.
---
It was literally painful.. especially with the fact that I was the tank and I was doing all the marking/corner pulling/using my skills properly/watching the group mana etc still it was a shit show xD. Do not get me even started on how the runs were like when I joined as a dps and the tank is clueless...
---
Didn't think there was a children week in classic
---
With the right timing, is it possible to character spin so you're facing the monster while jumping when it hits you so you have 0% chance to be dazed as you run?

* Improved Shadow Bolt
---
* Shadow Weaving
---
* Shadow:Word Pain
---
* Nightfall
---
* Gift of Arthas (every single physical hit does 8 more damage, which adds up)
---
* Hunter’s Mark
---
These are the 16 best debuffs for a boss. Wouldn't you rather remove Hunters Mark and add a debuff that gives all casters mana back on hit (on a chance) which allows them to spend mana a hell a lot more? Also, healers can wand the boss during chill periods to get mana back.
---
It's a very strong debuff in early raiding when mana is still an issue.
---
Are you literally retarded?
---
That’s just the pro-layering folk at work. Anyone who seemingly challenges layering as less than perfect is immediately met with ridicule, hostility and downvotes.
---
Gnome racials are objectively better, but it's a really small advantage overall, one that would impact your game less than not liking your own character.  
---
If you like the gnome models, gnome is the best, if you don't, not worth rolling a character you won't like for the racials alone.
---
Escape artist is a much better racial than perception, BUT for a mage it is not nearly as clutch as it is for rogue/war/lock, since blink removes roots and pvp trinket can rrmove slows.
---
The best racial bonus human mages get is 10% more rep. With all the rep grinds in vanilla, that really adds up.
---
Vael is actually doable with meme specs. On any server Vael has always been the free loot / half afk boss fight. At least for the guilds I've been in
---
**[EU-Eng][(RP)-PVP][Alliance] &lt;Crab Bucket&gt; is recruiting mature players for Classic!**
---
We are a 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **(RP)-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
*Note: If RP-PVP servers are not available on launch, we will play on the PVP server.*
---
**Raid information**
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent single bid, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
Please join our discord "Crab Bucket" qN9ywMy or write Perpo#9044 for further information.
---
We are still mainly looking for holy paladins, fury warriors, mages and resto druids.
---
Feel free to contact us.
---
Our full current demand status:
---
Paladin (Holy): High
---
Mage: Medium
---
Warrior (Fury): Medium
---
Druid (Resto): Medium
---
Priest (Holy/Disc): Low
---
Warlock: Low
---
Progression or on farm?
---
Curses, don't forget curses.
---
Id say tauren &gt; orc for tanking alone. It pretty much comes down to the health buff vs stunracist, but the thing is as for stuns, there aint that many in the high-end of raids. Therefore id pick the tauren over orcs.
---
It's good for me because I was going camping during the test
---
Problem is that the amount of information there is to know about Vanilla WoW is actually quite abit, all the little bits of things that you need to know to play the game mechanics well.
---
There will be a really large amount of people who are either misguided by modern WoW or just people who dont understand how Vanilla works and the result will be in a way an actual 2004 experience for some.
---
The availability of information out there is the same as saying why is isn't everyone fully knowledagable with maths or chemistry because all the information is actually out there. Obviously Vanilla WoW is not nearly as complicated but its still quite abit of info and its availability doesn't automatically means people will be educated and knowledgable with it.
---
Yes. Easier while mounted but can be done on foot as well
---
sorry to tell you, by the time u hit 60, he will be questing in crossroads still.
---
You sir... are a nerd.
---
That is a lot of speculation for a topic where the real answer is: we do not know why they did what they did.  Your guess is as good as anyone else’ m8.
---
Wow will run on a toaster
---
1. After Naxxramas is released, do you want any other content released? 
---
Maybe in the distant future. For the time being Classic should stay classic.
---
2. Do you want TBC: Classic released? Would you want the current Vanilla "Classic" to remain separate?
---
Separate servers for TBC that allow you to 1 time transfer/copy your Classic characters would be cool.
---
3. Would you want new content released, splitting away from TBC, essentially making an "alternate" WoW timeline/expansion series?
---
I am open to the idea but this seems very hard to pull off outside of going off of old content / taking newer content as sources.
---
4. Would you be interested in content based on existing Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdom zones (Hyjal, Caverns of Time, etc)?
---
Sure why not.
---
 5.   Would you be interested in new content that doesn't raise the level cap and/or doesn't increase stats on gear, therefore just being new content for the sake of having new zones/dungeons/quests to explore with minimal stat advancement?
---
Yes!
---
 You are happy that release date wont change? Well it wont change no matter what, people booked time off work, the issues of postponing release would outweight the broken game by a lot so that stays no matter what.
---
 You are happy with the news that they possibly have serious issues with their game engine and how it runs with 5 weeks left until launch?
---
The 5% extra int is nice but hardly a game changer. Lets do some quick calculations-if you managed to reach 1000 int (which is not possible in Vanilla but its a nice round number so we'll use it) you will get +50 int from the racial.
---
50 int gives you 750 mana and for mages &lt;1% spell crit (I think from memory its 59.5 int per 1% spell crit)
---
As you can see its nothing that significant, its just nice to have. What you should be considering is the other racials such as escape artist VS diplomacy (+10% rep is godly). Also one major consideration a lot of people skip is what are you happy looking at your screen? You will be playing the game for a long time, you may as well be happy with the look of your character.
---
I played on guldan! Defiasfist in awesome mega ultra super. In vanilla I thought guldan was pretty good. In BC is when i took some time off and I know guldan went to shite
---
Thank you for allowing me to, very generous of you.
---
And pve.
---
Interesting guide m8, I’ve got some food for thought though.
---
I believe that uldaman kind of sucks donkey dick in terms of xp/hr (I could be mistaken) so it may be better to skip it all together since it’s so out of the way. 
---
Also, what are you reasons for skipping RFD? When I was planning out a route I was thinking I’d grind in cath till ~43, go pick up mounts and grab the RFD quest that rewards the blue sword+neck from SW/UC and do 1 run of RFD on my way south to tanaris. There is an easy kill quest that you pick up right outside, and there is an escort quest inside. The dungeon is also super easy to exit once you’re done.
---
It released in 2013, and started as no changes whatsoever but that didn’t last longer than a year. The game was stagnant and dying since then it’s turned into what the game would have been from 2007 to today if the very unpopular changes from 07-11 never happened.
---
I am horde player. But still out of all zones I like Dun Morogh the most. It's just really well made zone. Looks absolutely great and first time getting to Ironforge is just breathtaking.
---
Mulgore is definitely on second place.
---
i was under the impression its like a online character tool. cause i dont have a acuatl abo i cant find my character in the battlenet account. maybe it was created by me some time ago with this dressing room. anyway i found it again in the internet, so nothing much wrong.
---
the irony here is that I'm pro-layering over sharding starter zones.
---
Raiding does NOT equal Classic WoW.
---
Play the thing that you will enjoy the longest. 
---
Leveing, PvPing and PvE is fun on both classes but its a matter of which mindset you prefer to have when playing? Do you like the strategic approach of a rogue or the hybrid way of offhealing/ placing totems.
---
escape artist is nice for pvp because you can use the net without fear of backfire. it being on a 1minute cooldown means its almost always up for everything.
---
5% int gives quite a bit once you have somewhat decent gear both in terms of mana and extra crit %.
---
+15 gnome racial is also sleeper op
---
the spawns from engineering (battle chicken / arcanite dragonling etc.) gain levels based on your skill in engineering, +1 level for every 5 skill points meaning that 315 skill for gnomes spawns a level 63 instead of the usual 300 cap for a level 60 spawn.
---
perception really doesn't gain its power until tbc arena, in vanilla human mages are basically playing without racials.
---
Wow might even run on a hand blender
---
lolol jo der! hallooo was geht ab? :D
---
Tirisfal Glades.
---
Easy on the eyes with dim coloring.
---
Jump right into intense scarlet crusade and scourge plot.
---
Edgy undead are funny.
---
Best race in WoW.
---
I definitely remember getting run through dungeons by kind strangers. I also remember begging my guildmates to run me through Sunken Temple at 40 for some reason. Those guys had the patience of saints for putting up with me. Still I've always been good at paying it forward so I remember running random folks through things all the time for funsies.
---
The premade groups system is probably one of the best (barring the ilvl and cross-real nonsense) systems they've ever put into the game. It effectively solves the problem LFD was made to solve. It should've been added in TBC but instead it took them until Legion.
---
Thanks for the detailed response. It just seemed to me like that was a significant upgrade that would last until SM. It does appear that a trip to BFD would be well out of the way of your route, so it makes sense.
---
If tou are looking tp buy a monitor for WoW i would recommend buying a 2nd monitor instead. Play on one, and keep references, guides, Discord, videos etc on the 2nd.
---
Sounds like 1960's man talk mixed with drip of modern day neckbeard
---
As others have mentioned:
---
If you like the idea of mouseover macros I highly recommend you check out the add-on clique. It lets you map your spells to different click combinations, for example mouse1: greater heal rank 10, shift + mouse1: greater heal rank 6 etc. 
---
You can limit the function to your raidframes and you don't have to fill your bar with different ranks of spells.
---
I recommend clique to every class that has skills that are used on members of the raid because it's the fastest way to cast a spell.
---
The setup is pretty easy: you open the clique tab in your spell book and click on your spells with the combination you want to use - done.
---
The normal one or the hungover one as featured in this episode? :P
---
No problem. I've mained a warlock throughout my WoW life and I also had to pick between warlock and rogue. I actually decided the opposite and will be doing a warlock first then a rogue as an alt. 
---
I think either way, you won't have regrets. Both are pretty fun and have their own strengths.
---
Yes, all of the events.
---
Well the answer is much more simple than you think.
---
Do NOT play Warrior or Rogue if you want ez mode leveling.
---
For ok leveling experience play Priest or Shaman/
---
For quick and easy leveling play Mage or Hunter or Druid (not as fast but pretty damn easy to level)
---
During progression it was usually the free gear boss... the suppression room itself was the hardest thing in BWL before chrom in my exp.
---
Knee highs?
---
Instapots have pretty good specs.
---
It probably wouldn't have even happened if it weren't for the oQueue addon back in MoP basically laying all the groundwork down.
---
Which leads me to wonder if something like oQueue could be created and become extremely popular in Classic...
---
That only solves one meal. Surely you'd give your baby a fishing rod so it can feed itself in future.
---
As a shaman, if I'm the healer and some good healer (cloth gear, +heal stats) drops, I'll definitely roll on it. I also won't throw a hissy fit if someone else wins the roll.
---
Now, if some cloth drop gears with say high int and I have a lock and a mage in the group, I'd pass. Their restriction to cloth means it probably makes more sense for them to get it. That's generally how I conduct myself unless an agreement is reached before the dungeon starts.
---
There's a lot of nuance when it comes to loot distribution. I'm not looking forward to the headache that was being a level 38/39 shaman and having mail drop in SM.
---
What problem did the game have that flying and LFG solved? Because as far as I’m aware, many many many people are hyped for classic because they do not have either of those things which means the “problem” must be either overshadowed by other positives, or there is no problem solved by either of those.
---
Additionally, hindsight does not matter in a voting situation. You either give Blizzard full development autonomy which would allow them to benefit from that hindsight if they are smart, OR you hand the reins to the players. Let’s say the classic population votes for flying: what should Blizzard do? If they don’t add flying, then they will be seen as patronising and “you think you do but you don’t”, and if they do, then it reintroduces a whole host of problems that everyone here as discussed ad nauseum.
---
To be honest with you when I was initially writing these notes I just wanted to do Uldaman for the mage class quest but this is also a good opportunity to complete the Nifty Stopwatch questline as well as the Uldaman Reagent run which rewards free restorative potions that some will be using later in molten core.  (Uldaman reagent run also unlocks the alchemist specific quest to be able to make Restorative potions.)  
---
There is also the Skull of Impending Doom questline that begins down there as well as being able to get the flight point for Kargath for when you need to come back here for BRD and/or LBRS.
---
As far as skipping RFD there just aren't many quests for that dungeon so rather than moving from Uldaman it seems more efficient to stay until you reach an acceptable level to start running Zul'farrak.
---
You are more than welcome to run RFD yourself but as far as time efficiency was concerned it seemed like a waste.  Testing could always prove otherwise though so I'd love to see other opinions.
---
Can't sit to be crit, thus no 25% damage from enrage.
---
Parry chance is 14% in classic, not 5.6%.  Parry haste will make tanking without a shield a good deal harder, as attacks from the front hastens the bosses swing timer when parried.   This one makes it a bit dubious to take your shield off.  Certainly not impossible though.
---
Bosses on the pirated realms use their abilities on cd, and some abilities don't even work.  Bosses AI will be more advanced in classic.
---
Crit suppression.  You will have between 3- 4.8% less chance to crit in classic.  Depending on gear, stats, talents, and buffs.  This will hurt your ability to proc flurrym which will again hurt your tps.
---
World buff stacking will be much harder.  This is a big one, as they largely rely on this exploit.  Blizzard could very well patch this, if it gets abused too much as well.  In fact, I look for them to do just that.
---
Final and most importantly, the fury prot build was only ever useful for increasing clear times for guilds competing on fastest clear time.  So, even if it worked as well as it does on the pirated servers, which it won,t it won't be used by most players.
---
Wasn't TBC postponed?
---
Ask a millions times what race is better on this. /s
---
I don't think its that straightforward, there is some kind of multiplicative calculation that goes on with expansive mind and raid buffs.
---
one of our mages on pserv gained about 700 mana and 1% crit after faction changing.
---
This is why i love reddit
---
L58 Rogue LFG BRD occasional biobreaks 4 baby
---
You buddy shouldn't level as a prot warrior. I think the best bet you guys have, if you're hard-locked into those classes with those builds, is for him to gather them up, you frost nova them and set a flame strike on top of them, then just run around with arcane explosion and blast wave them when they are close.
---
The only job your warrior buddy would have is to spec into and spam piercing howl, so you can still kite them relatively easily as fire.
---
Seen dumber stuff work. Good luck to you two!
---
Opening a TBC server would be a terrible move business wise, as you essentially are letting people know that the game will either stagnate at some random expansion, or continue along and just be the same wow as current retail but more than a decade behind in patches.
---
It makes a lot more sense for them to either adopt an OSRS model, or to rework/finish all the vanilla content we knew was in the works but never made it in. It will depend on how classic fares a couple of years after release. If there is demand, you bet they will happily undertake new things for the dollars.
---
Teach him WoW so he can farm gold for you during your 3 or 4 hours of sleep. That's like the only valid reason to even have a child...
---
Just had my first kid on July 2nd. I lay him on my chest and lean all the way back and play with him there. He's a great kid
---
Get off this sub. Get off the internet. Read nothing about Classic. Going in blind and making whatever choices you make blind is the best. No regrets.
---
Beta
---
This post delivered more than the OP lol
---
Not really what should I play related, however I was wondering what level people avarage reach within 7-10 days by playing 10-15 hours a day.
---
Farming is what comes easiest! If you take a break you're not affecting anyone but yourself.
---
I'm going to be safe and go the r/inclusiveOr route and just say:
---
Yes. 
---
In all honesty I don't know the difference of those two yet. Give me a few more episodes and I'll figure them out.
---
I can’t remember, is brewfest in classic? Arguably the best music in the game and it just gives me good memories when I hear that song lol.
---
I'll have to direct you to Dhoy1's comment for that answer.
---
You admit that was PS though, do we know it functions multiplicatively or additively in classic? Also any buffs you give to the gnome apply to the horde races besides kings, so best case scenario it applies the 5% after all other effects, buffing all effects by 5%. If you have 100% bonus int, expansive mind would give 10% int. The numbers you are coming up with seem bugged or irrational PS math. I rarely take shots at PS but this is a really esoteric one, who could know for sure?
---
But why would you want a child at all if all you're gonna put in is the absolute minimum participation? Wouldn't you want to be present especially in those early days? 
---
I totally get wanting to game, I'm a gamer as well but.. I dunno. Do yall just not give much of a fk about your kids? 
---
This is making me super sad :(
---
Back when blizz wanted to make great games, and the money just came.  Now they just want to make $, and the games are tertiary at best.
---
I really hope tbc classic happens.
---
I think you're right, maybe not super overcrowded, but we'll see definitely more locks than back in the actual vanilla.
---
I'm curious if the internal Blizzard 'BIS' lists are actually actually correct of if they just chose the highest ilevel for each slot.
---
Trash farming in BWL aslo worked on blizz back in the day. I vividly remember doing that with my guild. Also MC trash for crafting reagents.
---
Shut up with this BS. Go preach shit somewhere else. Let us focus on Classic and not IRL retarded topics.
---
up to 40%+ actually. Trolls are insane.
---
It wasn't immediately obvious at the time but WotLK was the being of the end.
---
Dual spec, flying mount being free, welfare epics, LFG, phasing, easier dungeons, daily quest grinds, non linear raid progression.
---
This was all problems being introduced in WotLK.
---
Prove yourself as a skilled player. Make friends. Endear yourself to the people who run raids. Be useful in other ways.
---
Or just have your alt be a hunter and level it casually
---
Classic WoW PvP balance is nonexistent. That's what the #nochanges posters claimed to want, the whole unbalanced, unfinished, underdeveloped mess exactly as it was.
---
Personally I would be all in favour of 1.13 coming with a patch's worth of judicious changes to help the struggling classes and specs, that would be fine by me. Removing automated totem-stomping by pets could certainly be part of such a patch. But I don't think it will happen at launch.
---
So in answer to "why is this allowed", "because that's how it was in vanilla and by default this is vanilla".
---
Nothing wrong with Dual spec, id be for that in classic.
---
Other stuff, sure id say that took away from the MMO feeling.
---
Ravager, the best a soyrior can get.
---
yIkes
---
I have no idea
---
Yeah I'm about 80% sure it was, I remember the Easter egg hunt, the summer bonfire thing, Thanksgiving, Christmas, new years and I know I'm missing a few others but I deff recall there wasn't any mega prizes like mounts or gear it was always just little gimmick stuff.
---
Ouch
---
Friendly reminder to never fear in dungeons unless you know how to juggle.
---
The joy of stealing tags from people that don't accept my group invites. Don't want to speed it up for both of us? Fine, they'll just have to wait until I'm finished and the mobs respawn before they get a chance to complete the quest.
---
It would work on the first boss you kill in any raid. The problem with the other raids is that once you've done it on the first boss, every 4-8 man group in your guild is now locked to a different raid instance, so they can't then go and clear any other bosses. I don't think that a group than can clear MC is going to think that killing only Lucifron 6 times a week is a better option than clearing the whole of MC.
---
Onyxia is a special case because she is a single boss instance with minimal trash before her, a convenient AoE attack that can be used to kill everyone (although that's more of a convenience than a necessity), and no complications in nuking her down the last 1-2%. I don't think there are any other bosses worth farming with this exploit.
---
yeah, roll a d3
---
True, but those were not stress tests, they were PTRs. Testing new patches, not stress testing the capacity of the servers.
---
Hunters are not brought to raids for their dps. They provide lots of other utility like tranq shots, kiting mobs, etc. hunters will always have a spot in vanilla raiding and if you really want to play one you don’t have to worry about that. You’re not gonna be able to compete with mages rolling ignites but you are needed.
---
I put warlock curses up there. Or do you mean the mage ability to dispel curses?
---
I do think, if you go true bis with pvp gear, you'd likely be best off with 2 pieces of the epic set and 2 pieces of the blue set, so you can pick up that 23 spelldmg bonus.
---
Gauntlets are a shoe-in for epic, because those are a lot better than the blue ones (+6 strength, +16 int)
---
Chest has +4 stength, + 8 int
---
Legs have +2 strength, +5 int, +2 spelldmg
---
Boots have +3 strength, +3 spelldmg, +3 int.
---
I'd also kick the chest, as legs and boots only need rank 12, so you can save a rank.
---
so, compared to 4 pieces blue set:
---
* 4 pieces epic - +15 str, +32 int, -17 spelldmg
---
* epic legs and gauntlets - +8 strength, +2 spelldmg, +21 int
---
* epic boots and gauntlets - +9 strength, +3 spelldmg, +19 int
---
* epic chest and gauntlets - +10 strength, 0 spelldmg, +24 int
---
Either one of those looks good to me.
---
man people dont really treat the devs with much respect do they. 
---
I'd much rather they build it right and have it polished than have a shitty release where the servers are down
---
Oh, man, that brings back some memories... Rappin' the forums was... EPIC
---
This. I will be waking up 15 minutes before launch and playing for 24 hours straight. Pls blizz no server ded.
---
This is the truth. 
---
Though I’d personally recommend druid or priest for a new player, simply because their leveling is stronger than the others on the list
---
A new player, but one with skill in MMO games and video games in general, and following a guilde, can get to level 60 in the range of 7-10 days played time. I Think the record to 60 (which will undoubtedly be broken in classic is something like 4 or 5 days played time).
---
I leveled a priest to 60 on a pserver a few years ago and it took me about 10 days played time. But I did every dungeon at least 1 since I get bored of questing and grinding. I could have done it without the dungeons in probably 7 or 8 days played.
---
So if you know MMOs and how to game, and follow a guide to some extent. 8.5 days at 12.5 hours a day will be 4.4 days played roughly. Which will probably land you somewhere in the 40s or 50s.
---
This all also depends on skill, how good your guide is (if you use one), and what class your playing. As well as a number of other factors.
---
Hardcore bro.
---
human is bis.
---
1. not a gnome!
---
2. has a capital city (actually has multiple cities).
---
3. has spirit + to boost evocation which is just as insignificant as the int bonus.
---
4. rep bonus to get you cheaper mounts and some grind for later phases.
---
5. larger model means more eyecandy real estate for gear.
---
6. you dont get escape artist but if your a big pvp player youll have engineering anyway which will certainly close the gap on any awkward matchup.
---
7. perception can be very useful if used well(this is very skill reliant).
---
8. many will feel compelled to roll gnome because its "better" youll have a slightly more unique character.
---
9. when given the option to gank a human mage or a gnome mage  a horde player will be much more likely to gank the gnome.(this is a hidden survivability racial.)
---
Mulgore for Horde and Teldrassil for Alliance. I just love the peacefulness and serenity in both zones.
---
This is hacks. The real trick from vanilla wow to avoid being dazed is to continuously run away while jumping up and down. If you get dazed anyway some scumbag GM troll is fucking with you.
---
it could very well be a private server bug, but none the less its still a racial you have that humans don't. i still stand by my original statement that as a human, you are basically playing the game without any racials.
---
im concerned about some of the balance issues you raised.  melee classes are already over represented, and now they are basically short range not melee classes, i feel that casters will be in a bad spot. and secondly, i think people underplay the ally/horde balance problem. the anecdotes of ally getting destroyed every bg are troublesome and if every streamer and influencer apart from asmongold is horde alot of impressionable teens are gonna follow them and the population imbalance could be drastic. i feel the no changes crowd might doom the game if the conventional wisdom of horde = pvp stays true.
---
I did my time goofing around at low levels back in the original game. These days I get the most enjoyment out of being max level. Going to enjoy speeding to 60 and running dungeons with buddies to gear up for raids.
---
I love these doomsayers. OMG layering REEEEp classic, OMG spell batching rip classic, OMG leeway rip classic, OMG lockout exploit rip classic. 
---
These people don't realize that a large part of classic player base doesn't visit this subreddit(or any forum) and have no idea or care about these things. 
---
And even among those that know about them, only a few are willing to abuse these things. 
---
After all why would you cheat yourself out of the classic experience with insta-gratification exploits? It's just like ruining a single player game with console cheats. Why?
---
TBC wasn't the problem with arena because the classes were not yet homogenised, it LED to it though. TBC imbalance was a major sticking point, druids where ridiculously OP and frequently led to 45min long games. Not exactly fun... It was the serious imbalance in TBC arena that force all classes to have a stun, a stun break, and interrupt, etc.
---
End game PvE is not 5man content, neither are duels, you don't get BiS gear from 5 man content, you don't get BiS gear from duels. I would have no issue if arena was side content but it wasn't, it was end game progression. Imagine if when you get to level 60 all the BiS gear was from running a harder Strat and MC/BWL/AQ where mediocre gear. It would be an outrage, yet in PvP it's somehow fine that we all play in a sand pit to get BiS whilst the war between Alliance and Horde is a background thought.
---
This makes a huge difference.  I know there’s a distinction for people who see their toons as individual toons, but I see mine as my avatar of myself in the game and if it doesn’t look right I really don’t like it!  I first rolled a Tauren when I got the game in Vanilla and struggled for years with him because he just doesn’t look right compared to my troll.  All this time and he’s still only level 98.....
---
You could play a slow levelling class. Like a paladin, seals up, start auto attacking, change a diaper and come back 5 minutes later to see the killing blow and loot
---
All the features share the same flaw they just make the game easier, the sense of achievement was a big part of playing vanilla.
---
Going into the world grinding mobs for one hour to get the gold to respec might seem stupid, but it made the work seem worthwhile. Was the 50g cost in Vanilla to high?, yes it probably was, but that does not mean it should be completely removed and you should be able to respec anywhere when out of combat.
---
Warrior is literally impossible to level, amirite gice?
---
Every raid needs at least 2 hunters, sometimes 3. Content cannot be cleared without them. No need to worry my dude. If in your heart you are a beast-taming bow-shooting Huntard, be one with pride.
---
There are many ways to support your raid even with not the most useful classes. Farm mats or provide other things that are useful. It’s a game after all so play what you have most fun playing
---
I am going to take my time lvl slow keep up on all my professions including fishing. I look forward to walking into Southshore again and the old Menethil harbor it still annoys me the boat goes from Dalanar to Stormwind now. Also really looking forward to doing the warlock mount quest again. As far as raiding i am in no rush been there done that maybe after a year i will get into some casual raiding the nice thing is there will not be a rush and i do not have to worry about a expansion making everything obsolete.
---
Found the snowflake
---
So there isn’t to my knowledge any references. I played Druid to field marshal and it’s pretty self explanatory. You run in circles, be unpredictable, shapeshift out of things, and develop a sense of when to turtle. You’ll eventually just get a natural instinct to what to do it’s like driving a car there’s no deep science to it. I know at higher levels like established team vs established team you would start to develop wonky techniques like running in circles mid field ect. 
---
The only thing I do remember is before it got nerfed I basically was wearing a full epic set with a green chest piece called green whelp armor in battlegrounds that would put people to sleep for like 30 seconds when they hit you with melee attacks. I believe that armor piece was nerfed well before 1.12 though so it won’t be any use to you.
---
Definitely level alchemy and herbalism so you can stockpile swiftness potions and free action potions as they make you quasi immortal assuming your team is competent. I remember a specifically competent team had a really good Druid that basically required us to have our mage equipt a ton of pve gear, spec (presence of mind?) that thing that gave you an instant cast and deepish(?) fire spec to one shot gib their flag carrier.
---
When people say that warrior is hard/slow to level, what do they really mean by that? Why would it be harder to level up that class?
---
I'm new to wow and thinking of playing a warrior, but this leveling thing is always listed as a con for the class.
---
Well its not, and what exactly does that even mean? I've played since day 1 and some of the behaviours that crept into this game due to certain types of player is pretty sad. Anyway, it's quite clear what side of the fence you sit on when it comes to whole loot reserving nonsense.
---
Shut up hero
---
You should see my poop sock collection.
---
Escape Artist is far better than WoTF.
---
Quite some time? Gee whiz the standards on this one am I right fellas? Guys?
---
Please don't do my research another time, you are very bad at it. Very good at taking stuff out of context though, ill give you that.
---
2nd paragraph starts out with "Longer term", you seem to ignore that completely. 
---
3rd paragraph starts with **"We're still looking at how we can best deliver an authentic classic experience at launch, and in the weeks and months that follow"**
---
Obviously they weighed their options and found layering to be the best one. They make absolutely no promises in that post what so ever. Other than there will only be one Kazzak, which lines up quite nice with layering only being there in phase 1.
---
Rouge are overpowdered
---
You really can't trust the records off of private servers, I played since day 1 in vanilla and first of all they got a lot of things wrong. You also can't quite trust records from vanilla since we start with patch 1.12, and itemization and things like that is different.
---
That being said I think you should be able to hit 60 if you can put 10-15h/day into it, try to get ahead of the pack (most ppl will probably not be able to play as much), so you don't have to compete for killing-/gathering quests etc. Probably postpone professions, except first aid, until you are well ahead.
---
You'll be fine 👍
---
Well you can just join a guild together (there is many already with discord &amp; forum) and just hop together on a server as guild
---
For RP reasoning - Deathchargers Rein's (my community also has a rule that if you have one specialist/rare mount aka drop mount you aren't gonna be getting say a tiger etc - Scarab Lord pursuers call that early etc - though i suspect my community getting more than 1 or 2 depending on server options will be hard)
---
Other than that I guess I'll just pick up misc horses and the paladin Charger when its available.
---
You’re forgetting that fear ward can be infinite if the player /sits right before the fear goes off. The fear will be ineffective and the fear ward buff won’t be consumed either. This is very strong in PvP as well.
---
2005 resolutions, that fov is tasty
---
I assume you mean fear and CoR/CoA.  And yes.
---
Guardians Favor, 2nd tier in Prot right next to the hit talent. Increases duration of bof and reduces cd of bop. It's only 7 points in prot to get and is the absolute key talent in pvp. Any build, which goes into pvp without this talent is already at best only decent for pvp.
---
Of course, there is no winning. There is no build, which can do absolutely everything very well. Holy reck is the best one there, because you get good pve healing, good pvp healing and good pvp dmg. It's bad at pve damage and farming.
---
The secret ret is decent in pve healing, decent pve dmg, good farming, bad-decent pvp healing and bad-good pvp dmg (depending on gear selection). You can do everything with secret ret, but if you go with an item build, that allows you to do everything, you'll be mediocre at everything. Secret ret spec is a reason, why paladins are often ridiculed. It's a build, which tries to do everything, but can do nothing really well and thus often falls short. I know its lure, because it really looks decent at everything, but decent simply doesn't cut it against good players. In 1v1 pvp you can be easily kited because you lack 16sec bof, at healing, you lose 5% crit, which is very significant unless you are naxx geared, at damage you are missing the hit talent, which hurts your dmg output.
---
Then play a hunter if you try hard enough you will find a spot just make sure you are effective at kiting and understand your roll. The truth is its often difficult to find 40 people to raid on the same nights so just proving you are reliable is a big thing.
---
I like the way your guild is organized it’s very nice! Good luck brother!
---
Ah, female undead. I see you're a cultured person.
---
180 noscope
---
The stealth detect is not useless and rogues do give mages a challenge, I agree overall that if I could switch the racials around I would. I also acknowledge that expansive mind is 5%, and unless bugged even in the most charitable case it would be no more than 7% or 8%. 8% of 400 is 32 int, 480 mana, half a crit. That's the amount of int a gnome has in full T3 with atiesh and AI buff.
---
Full tier 3 with atiesh
---
gnome highest int mage:

---
376 mana difference while holding a legendary weapon and gear that lets you say you beat the game.
---
add in 25% bonus stats from kings and ZG and then buff that bonus by a further 5% and expansive mind still isn't 500 mana now that it would be providing 6.25% increased int in the best case scenario (maximum charity here). I might be missing some other int buffs that stack like headmaster's charge +20 etc, but I think my point has been made.
---
That's less time for them to fix things the stress test reveals. This is NOT a good thing.
---
They sleep, scream, eat, poop.  That’s about it before 6mo
---
Lucky you, I'll be playing at 11pm! Although I am quite excited, I missed most of vanilla as my daughter was born in 2005, but now she will be playing next to me at launch. Can't wait :D
---
Greedy fucks did this on purpose to avoid people using their free time to play the stress test.
---
I bet you totally say that in equal measure to all political statements, not just the ones you don't like.
---
Im gonna roll a dwarf because they start out with a gun. Plus i don't feel like doing the menethil death run.
---
That actually shows a bug. Weapon enchants shouldn't show on the character select screen.
---
Warlords had a lot of people return thinking it would be TBC 2.0, it really wasn't. So there were high queues, but ingame most of the issues came from the Garrison's being broke and preventing progress.
---
So at least we won't have to worry about that second part, queue's we'll have to wait and see.
---
I leveled one up as protection in vanilla because i was told i couldnt i did the same thing with holy priest i guess i enjoyed punishing myself at the time holy was not to bad just slow prot i ran into a few tough spots.
---

Snowflake? That guy is the snowflake. Fuck PC, fuck snowflakes
---
Do you know on what version macro's Classic will run at? The site keeps mentioning changes prior or after patch 2.3, etc.
---
Yea it is not hard just things die slow i do not believe died much at all all n the warrior there was times where i could not even kill quest mobs without pots and a short prayer many many deaths.
---
raids (other than naxx maybe?) need hunters for tranq shot. So they are useful.
---
Eh in p1 lots of classes won’t find a ton of dps upgrades in mc. Like for locks most of the gear in mc is a dps downgrade compared to just random greens with +shadow damage
---
That leveling idea actually sounds like an interesting system. Idk if it would be good or bad but it's definitely interesting
---
Was the mucus part of the colic? I think my two week old has colic as she seems to be having stomach pain/discomfort and cries a lot after feeding
---
I'm pretty sure the raid testing is done with invincibility on. Definitely on latest Mythic stuff anyway.
---
You also get a nice epic cloak, ring and weapons from AV exalted
---
Please no rotation event stuff. This really bugs me on retail; Hey, wanna replay BC dungeons? Sure thing, here's a system for that. Oh you're on vacation? Have fun waiting 2 months.
---
Lemme play when I want to. It's hard enough to get people to come to a raid on a certain time, don't make em consider some sort of raid roulette aswell.
---
The other Ideas sound nice though.
---
I don't know where people get the idea from that forcing crits on you via /sit is necessary for reckoning to work.  It didn't work that way in vanilla and it was still a great build.
---
When a rogue opens up on you, you'll likely a full reckoning bomb before you are even out of the stunlock. And holy reck easily has the sustain to stay alive until a full reck bomb is ready against most other classes.
---
That /sit crap is really only something you did in world pvp and alterac to build up reck bombs against weak NPCs, deliberately taking crits against mages is pretty folly anyway.
---
Were you able to "Enter world" ?
---
Pls do, I‘d be much interested :)
---
It's not really a flex, I don't think my mouse control is even really that good. I was considering it an example of an average click time.
---
Can't decide between Tauren or Troll Hunter.  
---
So my goal is to raid at 60, and I know that Trolls ultimately have the best racials due to bow skill and berserking. BUT since the only time a bow really is used is when you get Rhok'Delar at the end of MC progression and use it until the get the crossbow in BWL it's not a very big deal. (I think it only changes your hitcap from 9 to 7%). And doing the math on berserking it's not more then 1% increased DMG overall roughly speaking.   
---
So the reason for why I don't want to play Troll is Taurens 2 yard longer range and the fact that the starting zone for taurens will be much easier to get through. If I play Troll I'll have to quest in Durotar (and can't go to Mulgore since you need to do the hunter quest in Durotar if you are a Troll) which has many more annoying quests to do when there's a lot of people and there will also be more people in durotar than in Mulgore.  
---
The things that deter me from playing Tauren though is the Troll racials and the increased area of the deadzone if you play Tauren, I also plan to make a Tauren Warrior in the future and personally think it's nice to have a few different races on your characters instead of all your characters being the same.  
---
TL;DR  
---
\- Tauren Pros: Longer Range, Easier starting zone on launch with less people.  
---
\- Tauren Cons: Larger Deadzone  
---
\- Troll Pros: Racials, diversity in my character roster when I make a Tauren Warrior later.  
---
\- Troll Cons: Flooded starting zone and harder quests to do with so many people.
---
Agree RE: The Classic Casual.
---
holy crap, I didn't know there is a mechanic for daze. Is this work in 8.2 as well?
---
Yes, but with Push to talk  
---
Only Raid leader and class leader will speak, and maybe tanks and healers
---
I think the key is in doing all the quests at appropiate level. Night elves are exalted by the time they reach 60. If you start out in NE zone and level like a night elf would, you would be exalted at 60 too?
---
previously the company year after year told fans that they didn't know what they wanted in calls for vanilla content, so I'd say they've enjoyed making us wait for over10years now.
---
Who is the third party?
---
If they delay character creation and then give us a "you think you do but you don't" speech on AUG26. There will be much fire my friends.
---
There's fucking with each other then there's just being a complete fucking bellend.
---
&gt; I joined a leveling guild which just happened to finally get enough 60s to run MC.  They had a few extra slots so I actually got to do my first MC run at 59.  I told them I didn't care about loot, I just wanted to be there.  I'm sure I did pretty much diddly for damage in my leveling blues/greens.  I also had no idea what a damage meter was. 
---
That right there is vanilla in a nutshell
---
I think you're heavily overestimating the 5% stamina racial for tauren. 
---
Think of your HP as a pool of water, the water being your health.
---
As you take damage, it leaks out water. 
---
There are two pools, one with 5% more water than the other.
---
When one pool is completly dry, the other pool has incredibly little water left, barely covering the bottom of the pool, that is the health you have extra. The only time this saves you is if you go down to sub 5% health, and at that point, you're probably already dead, or your healers are to blame.
---
Sure, it might save you on very rare occasions, but then there are other things that are the core issue. At the end of phases, healers will have such good gear that you never go down this low, if you do you probably have wiped anyway, so the racial does nothing.
---
For PvP and openworld its different, since people are not usually there to heal you, there the racial does alot more.
---
""Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns.""
---
Explain how this means it shares it with scatter shot. They also have patch notes for mage polymorph beeing affected by DR, does that mean frost nova DR's polymorph? Obiously not, what that mean is that the trap DR with itself, so you cant trap an enemy, wait the trap CD and re-trap before the enemy even got out of the first trap.
---
"Show me a patch note indicating that they fixed the "bug" of scatter shot and freezing trap sharing diminishing returns."
---
Ehm how about the fact that they reversed it and NEVER EVER made it work that way again? What about the fact that Scatter and Trap are in different CC categories and NOT A SINGLE CC from a different category DR's a CC from a different category.
---
I killed my teamspeak server to move my clan to discord and tbh its just gotten worse and worse with the audio quality and stability over several months we now used it.
---
It feels like Discord cant keep up with the vast popularity of their service because weve often experienced audio quality going to crap and/or servers just disconnecting us. 
---
I miss the teamspeak server in stability for sure.
---
Would be great to have for people who are a bit out of the loop. Like me.
---
Elwynn because it's good looking and theres lots of going on
---
They have a guild that gets to test all raids for them. They are top 50 world or something because of it. Can't remember its name though
---
But osrs isn’t classic runescape. Classic RuneScape was the bees knees. Osrs is more like tbc. The first big expansion they had.
---
That's a really nice UI mate, what addons you using? The action bars &amp; the top panel specifically.
---
I thought that everyone picked this up while levelling like in die originally, but I levelled as a prot warrior in 2005 so maybe I got the mechanics earlier.
---
P.s. I'm a sadist, clearly
---
&gt; A CC can ONLY DR another CC in the SAME CATEGORY.
---
Wrong, since you seem to like the fact that they changed it back after 1.12 i can give you some examples of later CCs with different categories that shared DRs.
---
Blind and Fear shared DRs in further expansions and then got reverted back.
---
Same with Banish and Cyclone, then with Blind and Cyclone. 
---
And also Sheep with Disorient.
---
I prefer having pretty much all my ranged offensive spells as mouseover macros. Problem on classic doing this however will be macro space. On private servers you have the addon supermacro which gives like 30 extra macro slots. Guessing that macro will not be converted to classic. Without extra macro slots there simply isn't enough space when playing something like a warlock with lots of skills. An addon for classic that just gave you a huge amount of  macro slots would be fantastic.
---
Guys, divorce papers are not that expansive, just puttning it out there
---
Can't wait to level in Teldrassil again with that beautiful music score and that first deadmines run again with friends.
---
It's pricey though. Nearly 500 mana when you first get it. A great spell but not always available when you most need it.
---
Used discord through every raid. It's more than fine.
---
He’s being sarcastic man, what’s wrong with you
---
Oh disconnects are a nogo in a raid. Do you use Nitro or just a free server?
---
I think BGs were still not based on gear/skill at all.  I remember popping in on my geared out hunter and just running around destroying people for fun.  If not there was always the option to make a new arena team and spank some people in the 1500-1700s before it got more competetive. The only thing change I really didn't like happened back in vanilla (which classic will do again) which was battlegroups for BGs which made it so I almost never recognized anyone on the other team (I understand why they did it though).
---
NEVER EVER Dual-Wield while leveling!
---
40 man raids? With Nitro or free server?
---
Tauren for pve, Orc for pvp.

Pantheon is still a long ways off.  I plan on enjoying classic and possibly even TBC before pantheon gets released.

Im all ears. Approx 90% of the quests Ive done on Horde side are war for territory, being either:
---
-Centaur
---
-Quillboar
---
-Harpies
---
-Raptors
---
-Other horde/alliance races of different factions
---
-Troggs
---
-Hyena folks (forgot the name atm)
---
Only good stories in Horde side are always undead related
---
Alliance storylines:
---
-Defias &amp; masons guild 
---
-Missing Diplomat
---
-Kurzen's
---
-Abercrombie and other spooky quests in Duskwood
---
-Whole BRD, including Onyxia attunement
---
To name a few, im still unveiling Alliance quests after so many years as Horde
---
well on bosses with fire immunity it is a clear choice
---
The first zone I ever saw in the game, the music was awe-inspiring alone. It just felt very... Lord of the rings-ish
---
First 3 years will affect a human the most even that you dont remember it, ignored babies strugle in life as adults. The first 3 years you learn more stuff than ever again and is kinda the windows installation stage.

Understandable, I cant play bulky hunchback characters anymore, wich are all horde except UD
---
The idea that WF is better with a slow wpn is a myth.  In fact, while leveling a faster weapon is better with wf, because slower weapons have a tendency to overkill.
---
What's BiS for mage staff in classic WoW then?
---
They cant heal themselves and are super gear dependent. When other classes get clever abilities to fix puzzle of a pull warriors get overwhelmed easier. If you're not stupid you'll be fine.
---
This! Speedy on my Human Paly main and Mr Wiggles for my Dwarf Priest alt.
---
I wonder why would you want to have Atiesh teleport you to Karazhan if there's nothing there until TBC?
---
I was struggling with Shaman till about lv18 then it all clicked. Still playing Paly tho.
---
r/JhinMains is leaking
---
Pve players are automatically worse in pvp due to spec / spending their time killing mobs. The gear had advantage only in terms of dual trinkeyd and other bs. The thing id that tnc made pve hear obsolete with resilience, and nah, there were no world pvp in tbc, jsy stupid ppontless skirmishes which mean nothing because the gear segregation = no skill. Also hp increase made fights generally boring garbage as even in vanilla 1v1 could easily last 10m.

Yeah, except that most classes will just immediately re-snare you (except for stuff like nova on a cd, but then the next frost spell will slow you again). With frost trap they don't even need to do anything for you to be immediately resnared. In contrast wotf provides immunity for 5 seconds after.
---
Wouldn't say orcs are better at PvE tanking.  Axes are very limited as far as tanking weapons go and eventually if you get thunderfury it is useless.  The rest of their racials are worthless in PvE for tanking as well.  Taurens at least get 5% health which could help (or just trade the itemization of that health for extra DPS stats for threat via gear choices/enchants).  PvE DPS though orc all the way.
---
This assumes you are casting constantly and can already select your next target while still casting/waiting for the gcd. While this is probably the majority, it isn't always the case.
---
If you look up most common pre-bis list (any google top result), you can clearly see all the required "Pre-BiS" acquired from quests as well from dungeons and craftables.
---
In Dreams for ring
---
Corruption of Earth and Seed for Thrash Blade
---
For The Horde! For your first Pre-BiS trinket (also part of Onyxia attunement)
---
Heroes of Old for Shard of Afrasa 
---
Just to name a few. There are plenty of more, but they are different for some classes. Besides a couple of blues, there aren't a lot of "Pre-BiS" items from quests. They are often only placeholders and not pre-bis items.

That depends what do you want, but for DPS, faster weapon is the way for sure!

He will be black listed and you will have no problem with that anymore and you can move on
---
You move slower when moving backwards and faster in every other direction.  So it makes sense to turn and strafe in order to backup.
---
Um... ok... bye!
---
How. In the hell. Is a level 24 helmet better than the Raging Berserker's Helm from Armory, for a fury warrior?
---
The leveling and the PVP mainly. But I'm gonna raid aswell if I find a guild that fits me.
---
Yeah, enemies have always had a chance to daze when attacking from behind and still do in retail. Only time I've seen daze other than an attack from behind is from specific attacks that daze.
---
Free. On pserver, so world wide.
---
Had literally no issues from lucifron to Kel thuzad.
---
Stormx on YouTube. The GOAT.
---
Is there a way to do this without creating an account?
---
Why would it be more easily reachable with a mage?  Also in regards to Maraudon there is more xp/hour there than you think depending on where you farm not to mention that some classes will very much want to have the Scepter shortcut unlocked for solo gold farming there later anyway.
---
Discord is amazing. Barely lags. Nitro is not needed.
---
I love the irony of 'Merked' being dead.
---
I will buy shitload of instant ramen noodles, toast, and a few gram of weed
---
Maybe this needs an own thread but, just ho good is the blue pvp gear? Originally the pvp stuff was at BWL level but then the AQ40 raiders wiped premades with epic pvp gear. After a few weeks of whining Blizzard upgraded the gear to match AQ40.
---
This is where we are now, the game is realeased with the upgraded pvp gear right away in phase 2. Now just how good is the full blue set since it also got a buff and is actually possible to get unlike the epic set?
---
Lmao Alex claiming the stress test was cancelled not delayed and he's "right again" after being wrong about classic wow tokens and cash shop to name a couple things.
---
A sociopath and a tool.
---
rogue always dictates when the fight begins so you might as well just play like perception doesn't exist.
---
perception does very little for you outside of arena or duels when you know that they are around and cannot escape, most rogues will expect you to let them have the opener in a duel anyway.
---
escape artist on the other hand... its always up because its such a low cooldown and made better by the rather extreme use of engineering these days (nets from both your own backfires as well as enemys).
---
5% int vs 5% spirit regardless of how it works out is a no brainer.
---
+15 engi(+3 pet spawns) vs 10% rep, something that actively does something vs something that saves a few hours grinding rep.
---
check out the mage discord and see what happens whenever someone mentions human mage, it just turns into a meme shitfest because they are literally useless.
---
Raging Berserker's Helm isn't a quest reward.
---
I've had beta since 4 days after it's release and I've never seen anyone higher level than the cap online. Or seen anything about it, you sure you just didn't get trolled ^^,?
---
Only thing I could think of is xrealm BGs were they just haven't changed the name of the internal alpha servers.
---
The point of PvP zones is that the flow is dynamically controlled.  So what I mean by that is, in a zone lke STV, a heavier presence of "your own faction" might allow you to quest faster/safer but the inverse might mean that you can't.  
---
Thus could result in you logging out, pvping, or moving zones which is the intended purpose of PvP servers. Imagine camping a farm to control a rare spawn you're farming for a super valuable rare drop. On a PvE server, you couldn't do anything against me standing there. On a PvP server, you could kill me and force me out.
---
Safety in numbers... most of the time.
---
Read about it 2-3 days ago here on reddit. At work atm so I can't search for it.
---
Yes, it is +3% hit overall. People today, the ones that are supposed to be "more informed" are as clueless and less informed as the ones 15 years ago.
---
Critical hit is indirectly affected, because landing more hits = landing more crits.
---
The weapon skill doesn't ADD critical chance, it just adds more hits, but the way the attack table works, a player with equal gear and + 5 weapon skill will land more hits, more crits, and will glance less.
---
Overall, +5 weapon skill is INSANELY strong.
---
I mean, if you think of them in another light, holidays are usually the peak of suicide rates. I'm sure for some people in game holidays that mimic real ones are a little piece of happiness for em. I can't really relate on the basis of family and holidays, to me they're just another shitty day on earth like any other, but I can relate on a basis I've wanted to put a fucking bullet in my head and I really don't think I'd have made it to now without gaming honestly.
---
Grounding totem can absorb a near unlimited amount of spells in vanilla (from TBC onwards it's always consumed upon redirecting any spell, where as in vanilla you have to actually apply direct damage to kill the totem, and it will keep redirecting spells until it dies with only a small cooldown between re-directs), as long as the spell has no upfront damage component (ala Immolate, which deals damage and applies a dot). Since totems can't be be dotted or debuffed. it simply re-directs and then reports an immune.
---
such as enemies that cast curse of agony or corruption. Grounding totem can block that all day long, all you have to do is save your interupts for their shadowbolts or immolates.
---
During EVERY stress test for the projected 2 hours of the test I have been unable to make it past the character creation screen with the error of "login servers offline" bur go off about how they've overestimated.
---
I'd like something like FFXIV's Party Finder. It's basically a billboard where everyone on the server can advertise a group for anything. Party leaders are able to set criteria for who can join, and posted parties are organized and searchable by type of content. The game  will also automatically notify you later if any parties meet your search criteria.
---
It enhances the social experience instead of degrading it like fully automatic grouping. You still have to talk to people to form a group, but it's a huge quality of life feature. And in addition to helping people find dungeon groups, it also helps people organize and find social events no matter where they are in the world.
---
Meaningful player interaction.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/moo_uk/clip/NeighborlyOriginalPeachANELE
---
lol yes it is
---
But you can use that argument for any other race then as well, and you're even ignoring war stomp. Most Racials are only situational at best, and you look for the ones that fit you, your role and/or class the most. You are ignoring the fact that "HP" is active all the time, unlike other racials which are 100% situational (blood fury, stun resist, axe skill, berserking, wotf). HP is very important!
---
If you're going to tank, you might as well pick up that extra HP with the stun. Why? Because it gives you more EHP, no matter how small the bonus is. It's the same way you would use that mongoose potion as a dps or arcane elixir as a caster. It all adds up in the end. There is no 2nd choice here.
---
The goal with this is to be spending as much time in dungeons while leveling as possible yes.
---
As far as party composition is concerned my group is currently a druid tank, druid dps (cat or boomkin currently unknown), 2 frost mages, and a priest healer.  This isn't an absolute perfect setup but you could do this leveling method with any combination of classes as long as you have the normal comp of 1 tank, 1 healer, and 3 dps.
---
If you want to see more information on group comps for leveling this way then I'd suggest you watch Hakurai's video here.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9frydWyhL8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9frydWyhL8) 
---
The gold generation will be higher than regular questing as the average loot value per mob is higher in dungeons compared to mobs in the open world.  Combine that with the much more frequent greens and cloth means you are generating more gold than a traditional questing route.
---
I am excited for the leveling experience. My favorite thing about wow is grinding and low level dungeons with friends, and in retail you level so fast that an entire chunk of the game is minimalized. A close second is the more expansive gear stats, I am leveling a paladin and cannot wait for that sweet strength with Mana per 5 2 hander.
---
Gonna have to downvote this just in case it gives Activision any ideas.
---
Bought an HP Omen x35 last year, and an 65" OLED TV this year. I think I'm set :-)
---
wonder who's BiS list they are using ....
---
WF resetting the timer is still an improvement to overall DPS because you're essentially just getting a shorter swing time on your regular white hits. It only basically kills the idea of spamming hamstring to purposely fish for it.
---
As far as Ironfoe is concerned there's already loads of questions about what the proc rate should be, but both it and HoJ are known to increase DPS in vanilla so there's no reason to think that the timer resetting kills any builds.
---
Youtube is worst(on the phone of course) .
---
Completing grinds that matter. Getting an item that is BiS and never changing it, knowing every item I have equipped in every slot. Completing a rep and knowing I've already reaped the rewards from it.
---
Is this just a stealth brag about having a leveling partner? 
---
Just go ele/resto so you don't compete on melee gear and you're good.
---
Blizzard is bleeding what precious little talent they had left. An IP doesn't mean anything if it's in the hands of morons.
---
I'd suggest you do mining/engineering until you have everything you need from engineering. Then unlearn mining and go Herbalism - since herbs are more valuable to sell imo.
---
Will edit this when im at my pc
---
Meeting and leveling with other random people that are just here to do whatever springs to mind.     
---
       
---
The main thing I hope I don’t come across is influencers turning the average player base into a stress filled min max hit 60 and bitch why BC isn’t out yet massive echo chamber.
---
I was listening to a podcast today and someone was saying that according to a test in 2006 where a guy did 3200 swings, ironfoe proc'd 2.5%.  But then he just dismissed that test, and assumed the 4$ value on the private servers was right, because it was a more rounded number.
---
You are completely right, however my previous experience has shown several times where the tanks drop down to low health (5%ish), where the healers manage to get the heals off. It was common and again depending on gear-level and such it would mean a difference at the early stages of the game.
---
I might be affected by my healing buddy playing the "how low can he go"-game in 5mans though....
---
But non of this really matters if you go insane by looking at a cow / orc for hours on end :p
---
go 10 points into prot and enjoy 50% stun resist.
---
With layering the troll con of flooded starting zones will probably become negligible.
---
I'd however recommend orc instead of troll if you wanna roll horde.
---
You can't really use totem buffs effectively unless you are 11 points resto. The range on your totem is awful without it.
---
funny that the question comes up now, i sorta did this for my gnome mage. i went through all quests from vanilla-questing and added them to the wowhead character creator from 1-60. im currently in the process of creating a google doc with some nice visuals but the data is already there:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRPgMNYzIsr-2MpX8BuIC9sE19jsWG70B4au1AU83hDRXd3mNgi0xBBFFDTo0DSKpVvpOTW538CYfN0/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRPgMNYzIsr-2MpX8BuIC9sE19jsWG70B4au1AU83hDRXd3mNgi0xBBFFDTo0DSKpVvpOTW538CYfN0/pubhtml)
---
You shouldn't play a warlock if you roll Alliance and rely on fear to carry you through every fight.  
---
Otherwise, it's a top pick.
---
Killing blows are usually somewhat overkill so that 5% hp boost isn't that useful most of the time. 
---
Berserkerking is really good. When you'are tanking, your HP goes up and down all the time, so you get that 30% attack speed boost every fight.
---
yah, I am not going to be the bitch that bring shit to the raid to give away to kiss ass, so I get carried.  I am not a ret paladin.
---
Thank you
---
Not exactly, **Prior to patch 2.0, characters could only earn titles through the honor system and could not alter which title was displayed.** The Elder title wasn't added until Wotlk anyways, sad times https://wow.gamepedia.com/Elder_(title)
---
You can't accomplish everything with this. It's absolute crap in pvp damage against anything that isn't melee. 
---
For solo farming, it also isn't great, it's good for aoe farming. So it's good for farming, pve heal, pvp heal, but crap at pve and pvp dmg.
---
It's more of a pve build similar to holy farmer, just with focus on aoe farm instead of single target farm and the option to be a good healer in pvp.
---
Also taking the 5% crit in ret is baffling. You don't use anything, which would require you to crit. Put those points into improved judgement and pursuit of justice.
---
Purchased a 31.5 inch 1440p monitor for classic and loving it so far for gaming. I don't think I'd want anything bigger.
---
Depends on how much pvp you do. If you want to take it seriously and have an edge on people who don't have engineering then take it. It's too good to pass up, as it'll help close gaps and have decent trinkets too. 
---
If you're not going to take it all to seriously then don't take it
---
Hire someone to create an account for you maybe? Literally takes as long as writing a comment :D
---
So I will only benefit from the totem on the ground even though I have a weapon buff? And the weapon buff will only be useful if I out-range the totem?
---
What if there was an official serverside world-LFG channel that you automatically joined on reaching 60, but was opt-in before that? You can still opt out of other channels, and this would be the same. The upshot being that this auto-join at 60 function would serve to get people who didn’t realize there was one into the channel for endgame.
---
I agree about spam, though, but at least a «global» system is better than no system or having trade as the only viable option.
---
You don't necessarily have to "go bigger" with one monitor. You can keep with a 24" monitor and just get more of them.
---
I've used this setup for a few years now. [My quaint setup](https://imgur.com/a/V5mA4xf)
---
I want to be a man baby
---
Well I'm that kind of person who, if already got something from a dungeon, asks if it's ok to also roll on a piece of gear. 
---
And in many pserver groups most of the people did the same. We are all enjoying a game that used to have a nice community, and I want to be a part of that and not a greedy bastard who is only interested in himself. 
---
I always used to be that way. Even passing on raid items I would have needed. The game is more fun if everyone enjoys it imo.
---
"WHO THE FUCK WAS THAT?? CRUSH HIM?! WHAT THE FUCCCK!!"
---
I said it in another topic:
---
I am for no changes at all but this should be adressed. Otherwise it becomes the common method for a lot of guilds like it did on private servers.
---
I bet way too many people will take this seriously.
---
Not actually brag even though I do see the brag value now. 
---
Ele/resto is not gonna struggle too much with mana, or do I just wait for the mobs to be slaughtered by my personal warrior?
---
&gt; Easier starting zone on launch with less people.  
---
Flooded starting zone and harder quests to do with so many people.  
---
 
---
You shouldn't consider these pros or cons as you will be playing your character for hundreds to thousands of hours, and that zone is not even 1% of your playtime. If people can level in the human/undead starting zones, so can you in the troll starting zone.  
---
  
---
You're thinking about getting the crossbow in BWL, which is 1000 hours in, but also putting so much weight on the first 4-5 hours, it doesn't make sense.  
---
I'd say go troll. A cow with a bow/gun/xbow looks weird anyway.
---
32 for shaman for windfury totem
---
30 for affliction drain-tanking warlocks
---
33 for voidwalker demo locks (w/ improved lifetap but also 2/2 master summoner)
---
40 for final talent fury/arms warriors
---
23 for aoe leveling frost mage
---
Rogue is whenever you get vanish I guess
---
Hunter is anything above level 10
---
Priest is whenever you get your first wand
---
Paladin is 20 for seal of command as ret leveling or 30 for Divine Favor for what you'll actually be doing at 60 ;)
---
Druid is 10 for tanking, 20 for feral, and 30 for nature's swiftness healing
---
How are warriors doing agains hunters in a duel?
---
That is just factually wrong, flying mounts were always on the most wanted feature list.
---
Server names have not yet been announced.
---
We can safely assume the 13th August is the latest we will know.
---
If you truly want to avoid streamers someone made a website and posted it on this sub a while back: https://www.avoidstreamers.com/
---
Wait unt we have more info and then check that website as it updates.
---
I remember opening presents under the tree in Ironforge in vanilla.
---
Every class is useful in Vanilla, play whatever you want.
---
Ofcourse, hes long glad he has a pocket healer 
---
Chain lightning pull and then let him finish off.
---
Maybe /Cheer a bit every now and then.
---
Ps: make sure to let him die every now and then just to make sure who’s in control here
---
Its interesting really, one could say the racial is better early on in Classic when healing might not be so great, because of mana issues and what not. However, the more stamina you get, the more health you get from the racial. So for solo play, and play outside of places where you dont have a healer, the racial also gets better and better.
---
People can talk endlessly that the 5% racial is useless, at the end of the day, i just play what looks best, and if it has some racials that are nice, thats a plus. A tank is a tank.
---
I am still a little undecided on a PVP or PVE server. Please plead your case for your choice!
---
That's really not something one can answer for you. 
---
Ask yourself, why you play classic. Do you want to relive the epxeriences of the past and the nostalgia of playing your old class? Go ud mage.
---
Do you want that nostalgic feeling, but experience soemthing new as well? Go warlock or paladin. And if you decide paladin also remember what that means in classic and what you wnat do in the endgame. Paladins are very stigmatized in classic to only heal in pve.  Their dmg and tank specs have serious problems and will be less optimal than other classes in pve.
---
I may add for warlocks, the normal spec at 60, DS Ruin involves just keeping Curse of Elements up and spamming Shadow Bolts with LIPs on hand in case one crits which is entirely different gameplay than what gets you to 60.
---
And make him BEG for ress &gt;:\]
---
It’s so fucking cool when you see members of a rival guild and get revenge for what their friends did, or know to run and hide because of the beef you have ongoing haha this is totally missing from current wow and it is hands down what made the game great.
---
I have some extra tinfoil I can sell you.
---
Obviously you could yes.  The quests just make it faster.
---
You shouldn't treat the shareholders as idiots, they aren't stupid, and I'm sure they have an awareness of what the playerbase wants. They want the players to be happy, because that is what brings the money in.
---
What happens when you turn and strafe at the same time, is your front is technically being hit while you are running away if I’m wording that right. You have to try it out to fully understand it.
---
Obviously most people wont stick with it if after naxx it gets stale regardless of what this subreddit wants you to believe. I was always against playing on private servers but there is one coming out that includes reqorked outland and northrend while keeping them lvl 60 zones, includes the unreleased azshara BG (at least their own version of it), will include karazhan, hyjal, new dungeons, retuned bosses, rebalanced classes, incetives to world pvp etc etc etc.. not gonna lie that to me sounds a lot better than classic, it was just announced. Would i prefer to play on official servers? Yes but if they are moving on to BC or never add further content i rather play the other one. Im still gonna ülay classic hoping that they go in a direction i would like but i will play the other one more because it looks like the more interesting game. 
---
Just to clear things up i am one of the people who always asked for classic, but im not one of the guys who thinks classic is perfect. I want to play a wow with classics philosophies but i dont care if its 100% classic or not.
---
They could still introduce that stuff without balancing around it though
---
There's definitely not too much hit on that item set.
---
This is used very often and does work
---
Sink all the gear into the warrior. 
---
Level as Enh, only use rank 1 earth shock to interupt. 
---
Otherwise any and all mana should go to keeping the warrior healed to there is no downtime, and on putting down Windfury totem at 34+. 
---
Warrior should spec arms and at lvl 30 you Will be chain pulling with Sweeping Strikes and Cleave spam (WF totem comes at 34) 
---
The shaman Will also be meleeing with WF wep up, throwing a heal to the warrior when needed to keep the chain going. 
---
You Will spec down into improved Windfury totem, then jump over to resto to spec into more effective mana on heals and totem cost decrese + totem range. 
---
The shaman Will be the gear box, the battery and the fuel that keeps the warrior going.  So again - any DPS gear and SPECIALLY weapons go to the warrior.  Shaman should take scraps. Spirit is nice.  Warrior should focus on AGI for crit, then stamina. 
---
Support your warrior. Keep him healed and keep your WF totem down. 
---
Id use Stoneskin at lower levels when you dont have WF totem. Just to reduce incoming damage. 
---
This would be the absolute optimal way to duo with a warr/shaman.  
---
Ive Done this afew times from the shaman POV. It may look boring on paper but its satisfying knowing you are blessing this warrior to ve capable of doing these feats that he would have no chance with alone. 
---
Its really satisfying seeing mobs get smacked by Cleave with Sweeping Strikes and a WF to follow up is almost 100% going to happen since th clear Will hit twice and sweep them both for an extra hit. One cleave = 4 hits over 2 mobs. 
---
Sorry for format - on mobile.
---
Introducing large new continents will always spread out the players, thus reducing interaction. Don't get me wrong, I really like Northrend (especially compared to Outland, ugh), but I really cannot think of a good way of implementing any new continent without taking away too much from the others.
---
The question that has to be asked: What purpose does this new area serve?
---
* Personally, I do not believe that we really need more content for the leveling ranges. There is enough already and the areas foster interaction between players. If the average number of players per server would be increased then additional parallel content makes sense because then the additional population can spread out more evenly among the zones.
---
* For max level, we do not want all of them bundling up in the new zones, deserting the old continent. So maybe some new recipes with certain mats only being available from northrend would work. Of course the new recipes must not be better, but equivalent (and different) to everything that already exists. Thus, there is a reason to go to the new zones, but also to go to the old zones. As with the previous point, the average population of servers needs to be increased to avoid players spreading too thin across the world.
---
Teamspeak users in denial are just looking for excuses not to install a new software. Lol
---
Your name seems to really suit you :) Being a chump and all.
---
No, none of them are actually. They became that way much later.
---
That's not true.
---
A) Windfury has a 3 seconds "cooldown", this means having a faster than 3 seconds weapon gives you a chance to miss out on windfury procs
---
B) Abilities can proc windfury, the slower the more damage that proc does.
---
Dont leave. Let him die. If he wants to tank let him. It's easier to finish a dungeon without one DD or look for a new one. 
---
Same goes for heal. If the tank pulls before I have max mana he dies. Period. If he flames me I /ignore.
---
Being suboptimal in raids doesn't make them unpalyable meme specs.
---
If you're at all as concerned about privacy as you say you should already be using things like Ghostery and Ublock Origin.
---
You start every leveling spec with this
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/05002
---
Then there are choices.
---
Deep affliction designed for drain life tanking with a succubus out that looks something like this going up affliction before touching demonology
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/35022505100011051-23500521001
---
Or standard voidwalker tanking while you wand, going up demo after 2/2 imp life tap for 2/2 master summoner then up affliction to 5/5 shadow mastery then unholy power 4/5 in demo to get up to 59
---
You had plenty of decent replies on [your post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ceeyyk/interesting_warlock_soul_link_levelingpvp_build_i/). It wasn't a good idea and won't really benefit anyone who reads it, why should it be given lots of upvotes and therefore increased exposure?
---
I've made 10 posts here and they have an average karma score of 1.7 - that's not a problem, they were questions that received useful and helpful answers and didn't need 200 people discussing them in detail. If you come up with a ground-breaking build for your warlock you'll receive a ton of upvotes, but suggesting a levelling build that doesn't start to shine until 50+ will not get you positive karma.
---
this :)
---
that would be perfectly legal, that's what alts are for.  So I think it was the 15 year old you thinking too much about that cute girl next door
---
PVE is really cool if you are not into going questing and fighting any opssed faction's ennemy at anytime, and just questing/farming..."calmly" I would say\^\^ in the other hand, if you want to pvp in the open world, you may not find ennemies as easily as on a PVP server, so it cold be frustrating to see an annemy, and not being able to fight him if he doesn't want to
---
I personally will roll on a PVP server, just cause I freaking love crushing other players (or being crushed lol).
---
The world feels way more dangerous, and it could lead to way moreand exciting World pvp events (that's an assumption, hope it will happen a lot though).
---
As well, on a PvP server, when you only want to quest/farm, you may be ganked by a rogue, and be pissed beacause you did not want to fight this time.
---
I also think that the most experienced/skilled players will be on PvP servers.
---
Both choices are nice though, you just need to consider that leveling/questing/farming wil surely be harder on a PVP server, and that world pvp may not occur as often as being on a PvP server. Ithink this is the major factor that you should consider ! 
---
Anyway, enjoy :)
---
But just like how every priest leveling spec is locked in to the same 10 talent points until you hit 20 and go up shadow, lock leveling specs are locked in until you hit 17 where you're going to start putting talents where you please.
---
I prefer priest tbh. It was my second character and it was breath of fresh air from my hunter. They level fairly quickly and easily. You can heal everything (every 5 man dungeon, and even some raid bosses) while specced as shadow. You're always going to be getting invites/whispers for dungeons. Getting a raidslot will be easy depending on your skill of heals, but honestly not very many people will pass you up. You're an absolute unit when it comes to PvP, shadow priests scare me in 1v1s. Cons? People will say leveling takes longer, but once you get your wand and your rotation down it's pretty laid-back. You can solo elites easy with mind control. I dunno man, priests are just fun to play imo. 
---
Druids have travel form which is super nice for leveling. Tbh I don't know too much about druids personally, I  never played one in vanilla.
---
No, with 305 skill you have a 6% chance to miss a raid boss and oyu get 3% from talents. This has been confirmed and tested in beta many times over.
---
Your numbers are from pservers.
---
It literally is considered a subset of vore
---
Yeah, it's called effort. But hey, you can always bitch on reddit, that will surely solve your problems!
---
I am not. 
---
It is just that it is not worth selling it for a bis list.
---
I feel exactly the same. Can't decide between warlock and prot warr. I think with my limited playtime warr is probably the better choice
---
Noooooooooopeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  
---
This is data that was confirmed by Blizzard less than two months ago. Stop bullshitting me.
---
Couldnt care less if someone has my email adress - but then again I am not afraid of UFOs either.
---
No, because ultimately what you play shouldn't be decided by what other players do, but by what you want to do with that class.  
---
The leeway system has been tested internally at Blizzard and confirmed to work as it's supposed to in 1.12 ( and it wouldn't have been put on the not-a-bug list unless thoroughly tested, I can absolutely guarantee that ).   
---
What you're used to from private servers and what you see in videos is ambiguous data, because in one case it's guesswork and in the second case you cannot 100% verify which patch it was and how/if pc/internet/server specs impact that mechanic.  
---
The only people who can offer a clear guarantee that the system works as intended is Blizzard themselves after comparing the clients behavior side-by-side, and this testing has gone through at the very least 3 engineers ( defect management and qa engineers ), so you can be assured it wasn't just someone saying "yeah looks good".  
---
Now, if you feel it's not a good implementation or overall system, that's a different thing. You want a change to the mechanic, one that a lot of people seem to agree with, and that again ultimately is down to whether Blizzard wants to divert from keeping every mechanic true to 1.12 or not (slippery slope and all).
---
You should read what they do, it is not your email, they store more than that :)
---
nope, that started in AQ20 and AQ40 in vanilla

If you allow cookies at all, your privacy is being sold every time you visit a website, man.

You're blowing registering on a website way out of proportion.

Maybe for certain stages.

You definitely would need to test with damage on for a huge amount of it though.

haha! You could say that :)

Nice pics!

What is the addon you used thats under your spell bar at the bottom?
---
Thanks.
---
All I said is that it is not worth it for a bis list, nothing else.
---
There are plenty of lists on google docs, discords and shit. Companies that does the same, but they already have your info.
---
Not in vanilla.

&gt;Since Patch 2.4, all glows are visible on the character selection screen.

To not completely drown the wetlands.

A majority of addons that work in current wow will work/be ported to classic. Some already have been.

I think it will impact class choice for a lot of people. Hunters got hit the hardest so I wouldn’t be surprised if many Hunters reroll to a melee class. 
---
Leeway will also affect race choice. Tauren Warrior seems to be the new meta over Orc.
---
There are actually many of these tests from vanilla but with different results so it's hard for pservers to choose.
---
Right, like how he chose Eyes of the beast instead of Imp Aspect of the hawk. Why must people who make classic guides be so clueless?
---
Jesus, is wow your job?
---
Pick which one is pleasing to the eyes to you. Racials are nice but aren't going to keep you out of a raid. Regardless of where you start leveling to 60 is going to be a while. I wouldnt think about mc or bwl. That is so far in the future man, unless youre planning to no life it to 60 it's going to be one hell of a grind for a while. Choose the race you don't mind looking at for months on end. Learn your class, get along with others, and you'll have no trouble getting into raids
---
It's why I'm going NE over Dwarf for my hunter even though dwarves have stoneform. I think they are cooler looking, plus hearing the gun animation would drive me literally insane.
---
Aren't those *always* proved to be faked. Like they break the rules ingame then try to pretend something they did outside the game is the cause
---
It takes two to argue, brother.
---
I'm not saying you should use that BiS list. I haven't even looked at it. I'm just saying you're being silly - but that's your prerogative.
---
&gt;Bring back the old developers and let them make Azshara Crater, Emerald Dream, Karazhan Crypts and everything else that was originally planned 
---
This.
---
Colic is a symptom defined as "crying for 2 or 3 days". It's not an affliction in of itself. For our kid the crying was caused by the bowel issues and having trouble breathing normally.
---
Once we switched away from wheat (spelt is okay) food and started feeding him goat, soy and rice milk the colics went away.
---
Will try for the R11 one, but will have to see what the brackets are like and will probably get the AV one as my first epic mount.
---
You are welcome to attempt it.  I'd be interested to see your results.
---
You can also, while running, jump, turn around to get hit and face forward again before landing. Never had an issue this way :)
---
Thats the only thing I entered, they can have my cookies on the house
---
My thinking is that the only thing that matters is how you perform against other players in the raid using the same class and spec. I will play a warlock for example and not going to compare myself to any other players dps wise other than other warlocks.
---
I agree the one coc you chose from this guys bad clips wouldnt hit. 
---
But this is the one i ment where he only hits 1/3

Retail died a long time ago. It killed the whole Warcraft franchise with it. I hope they cast rebirth.
---
Lying id bad? mkay.
---
Doesn't the mind control helmet only make the controlled unit kind of your "pet" or follower without any abilities you can use on your own?
---
I didnt count how many quests did this guy take, but if its like 20 thats like 4-5 hrs more grinding.
---
Yeah it works on the beta
---
Man this is really a  anilla experience... EU second class citizens
---
Sockets? Level 85? Ugh
---
As for raiding there are two standard specs.
---
SM Ruin is Shadow Mastery Ruin which involves going up Affliction for Shadow Mastery 5/5, and up Destruction for Ruin. At first this is the better spec and for all raids there will be one SM Ruin Warlock in the tank group because SM Ruin locks keep out an imp for blood pact.
---
DS Ruin is Demonic Sacrifice Ruin. It's the Demo/Dest alternative that non-tank group locks will switch to eventually to use Demonic Sacrifice on their Succubus to get 15% more shadow damage instead of 10% (along with no need to manage a pet).
---
You may notice that the Affliction tree of SM Ruin and the Demo tree of DS Ruin together look like the voidwalker tank leveling spec just without Demonic Sacrifice itself - because both focus on efficiency.
---
Estimated SM Ruin

ppl talking about skipping mobs that are directly in your path? GLHV
---
There is no mage portal to stonard until TBC and even then you would need to be level 52 to learn it.

This is lore friendly though - who else gets ganked by the blackhand orcs??

Search before you post.

[tier 2 shaman Tauren](https://imgur.com/a/h3wx81B) is one of my favorite tier sets:race combo for vanilla.
---
A. Keep Classic servers up.
---
B. Make TBC servers.
---
C. Allow transfers from A. to B.
---
D. Tell the players that want new content to go play retail.
---
This is the only way. Classic+ is an abomination.
---
Reddit bro - :( il three you and upvote
---
I play because I enjoy the game. I'm gonna no life classic because I love it. I don't give a damn about tears.
---
Nope
---
If I pick mage for it AoE potential which will turn to be less fun/more restricted than expected based on those old videos/pservers then it's a direct impact of actual Classic mechanic on my intents on how to play the game. Migh have to make it more *bearable* with a druid main in the most edge case scenario ;)
---
How dare you disrespect Simon and Garfunkel like that. It’s called *The Sound of Silence*!
---
To have the experience I have now and be able to go back. It took me a year and a half to get to 55, by which time BC was out. This time I know what’s up and am not 11 anymore. I legit killed boars in the forest to level up because I couldn’t find quests anywhere. It’s going to be awesome.
---
Oh, thanks 😁
---
PvP is like the earth on WoW classic and trust me you don’t want to miss that !
---
80% of my best memories about that game were in PvP.
---
So happy that site is back, i used it a lot and will do again
---
Best info for Rogues
---
Hmmm okay. Well.. okay.
---
Work on that math bro
---
There are many, many people who are very good at PvP, but do not have the time to no-life 18hours a day for 3months to rank14, so they acquire their gear from raiding for world and instanced pvP.
---
Raiding on PvP realms is even more important than on PvE realms, because you can do all raids upto deep BWL with very mediocre gear. Like devilsaur set is not even level 60 and most will wear it until AQ40.
---
But in PvP there is no such thing as too much gear.
---
As warrior for example you will want Onyxia neck, Ragnaros belt, quickstrike ring, Blastershot Launcher etc. etc. even if you go for rank14 (which most dont as I mentioned).
---
What's a Darnassus Artist?
---
Right!?
---
Yes - raiding is extremely active on PvP realms.  And yes, you’d need to respec out of a tank build to be effective in PvP as a warrior.
---
You can enable Priority Speaker in Discord for specific people i.e. Raid Leader which if they're talking it essentially mutes everyone else.
---
"fucking tryhard going Orc for racial and not looks like Undead, fucking omeganerd weeb fuck pepega idiot"
---
I play PvP realms but never care about world PvP and don't engage in it when it can be avoided.
---
But fuck, I'd never play a pve server, with it's dead non dangerous world.
---
I'm the carebear pvpers will look for and attack, but that's *fine.* It's always been so.
---
Right? I have put in my PTO at work and kinda cleared out everything for that week and made sure everyone knows I'm essentially MIA for that week. The idea that they would change the date I didn't even really consider. Now I'm scared as fuck.
---
I made the switch from TS3 to Discord in the earlier years of ESO and when I get a response to join a group's TS3 it makes me cringe.

Thank you I appreciate that comment. I do very much love my kids!

I have used this with organized PvP in ESO.

---
so you say guides like this for instance [classic warrior guide](https://mmoauctions.com/news/wow-classic-warrior-guide-best-builds-for-vanilla) are going to be useless?  that's a shame... some of them are really well written :(
---
It was tested on beta by a streamer they got 25k per hour in rfc did a 12 to 16 in 2hr 30 min.  Compare to Joanna 12 to 16 of 3 hours.  For most people the m most efficient way to kennel will be dungeon groups, unless your extremely fast and get ahead of the pack questing would take over in the later levels.
---
Raiding and this time actually have a clue about what I an doing. I Remember my guilds first MC. I   was level 58, a paladin in ret spec and avoided combat so I could ress people that died. I was so happy when I got that spinning gnomelooking 2hander thinking this item was amazing. I never specced holy even though I healed through MC, BWL, AQ and Some of Naxx. I did not know what consumables were outside manapots - So I got carried mega hard and yet we ended up as the #2 guild on Defias Brotherhood EU. 
---
Bonus info. That guild was randomly formed in the Inn in Goldshire where I happened to pass by accident and not really knowing what a guild even was.
---
So definitiely Looking to make new meaningful interactions with other players.
---
I'll scratch Classics' back, if Classic scratches mine.
---
Your self buff is stronger (longer duration and 2 extra attacks instead of one) and will overwrite the totem buff.
---
Yes
---
I'm surprised how many people can't strafe backwards hop while camera swiveling.
---
Everything you do takes a lot of time and sometimes effort. 
---
This means that everything you achive feels very rewarding.
---
I'm just so tired of modern games where you reach endgame in a week and you get all the gear very easy and fast.
---
And a minor thing, I just love to make myself a cup of coffee and just slowly grind towards a goal. Feels like work but in a job you love?
---
&gt;Why do people seem to think there's no money in crafting leveling gear in vanilla?  
---
Because people won't have the money to buy that gear.
---
Good video. I'm getting more and more convinced that Classic has the mechanics right but people are getting somewhat desynchronized image of the actions in the game - where melee attack isn't tied to the attack animation and a mage dies seemingly out of nowhere as none of the mobs in question did the animation.
---
Honestly that's how you get people into raiding. Make raids big enough so that they'll take anybody and give people who have no right to be there a spot and maybe get them to improve/have fun and do it more as a result. People complained about 2/3rds of the raid carrying the last 1/3rd, but if we're being real here that last 1/3rd were the most fun players despite being the worst players.
---
Today's raids are so tightly tuned often times one person failing a mechanic is just an instant wipe, which obviously is going to breed contension and overall make actual raiders seem "elitist" to people who aren't on the same wavelength due to never having raided. It's easy to see how the raiding scene is slowly dwindling down year on year in retail.
---
As in pre-raid BiS. Doesn't matter, just needed to tweak each item to get them to ignore raids. Seems weird they're have no pre-raid built in though, I'm just picky.
---
Correct answer.
---
All aboard the XP Gain Train! Choo Choo!
---
5. Lock and barricade your door. As soon as you're busy, that's when someone needs you. They will have to take a back seat, waaaaaay back.
---
Well, you're clearly part of the toxic community that currently litter the private servers. There's no need to be annoyed or be insulting - i'm not advocating for the change per say, i was asking for viewpoints in order to enhance my own, even potentially change it (which has happened through authoring this thread).
---
I appreciate your passionate, but there is no need to insult me.
---
Indeed. I believe they made it an aura on the pet, so you could not dispel it anymore than you could Devotion aura. Although it of course if you get rid of the pet, it takes the aura with it.
---
Human +10% Rep gain is BiS racial for people with responsibilities.
---
TBC would absolutely be the correct answer in my opinion.  My absolute favorite version of WoW (Vanilla is very close though).
---
Orc, man. Base 5% stun resist for anyone, 25% more if Orc. Plus that DELICIOUS Blood Fury ability. So good. Axe Skill on top of it. I wouldn't worry too much about the range increase. 
---
Taurens are by far sexier though. So beefy.
---
Galaxy brain; I bind tar party 1 2 3 4 to mousewheel up down, shift up, shift down. Then arena habits
---
Forsen's viewers are especially immature, so I'd stay away from the server he is rolling on.
---
You will always love your own. I don't even like kids. Not to mention my youngest most likely gets it from me because I have Bipolar, so I can't blame the little guy for that. But, we planned on having 3 kids, and after him we are *definitely* stopping at 2 lol
---
I think the idea is that you're running slightly "across" the path of the mob following you rather than running directly away from it. Because you're constantly adjusting your path this way you don't end up running straight away but in a very slight arc until the mob resets.
---
Damn son
---
Elwynn, Westfall, Redridge, Duskwood combo is elite tier
---
This is true.  If you want to target by clicking on a unit frame, the 'target' part happens on the 'un-click'. However, you can change this with addons (clique, vuhdo, healbot, to name a few) or use mouse-over macro's.
---
Maybe they originally planned on releasing Kara in vanilla
---
Man, you keep ruining your punchline by adding clarification at the end.
---
I would actually live it if blizzard decided " we need to make raids 10x harder to compensate for no server/client lag in raids " and suddenly rag went unskilled for the first 5 months of classic
---
Delightful. Too bad I'm not officially in the beta, and I'm not going to pay a Sub to Stress-Test it for a weekend. Glad to see updates though :)
---
Tauren fun for a while, but if classic takes off, the community wants leeway removed, devs crack and start doing patches...
---
devils advocate: how would you feel about playing a tauren warrior without leeway ?
---
I know this was meant to be dry and "bad" on purpose, but it still missed the mark for me.
---
I'm planning on leveling a mage as well, with skinning + herbalism to start. Vendor all skins while leveling and save all herbs and cloth from mobs. At 60, drop skinning, pick up tailoring for BIS crafting. Assuming I have enough herbs to level alchemy to max, drop herbalism and pick up alchemy.
---
&gt; Imagine being this paranoid, would be able to visit 2 pages tops on the internet. Like being afraid of flies while living in the forest :P
---
Imagine being this careless about your personal data.
---
I had no issues tanking SM without Consecration, but maybe it's a problem in later dungeons.
---
PvP realm just means that there's an additional element of danger and excitement when you are out in the open world.
---
It doesn't really impact much whether people do BGs vs. Instances.

---
So do we get an update about the happy reunion?
---
I wish a classic server would take up the task, though probably not worth the risk of being shut down.
---
That’s awesome man. I’m just thinking about the travel back and forth to a mage trainer in IF. I think portals only open up in your 40s ;(
---
Lol no
---
How can you know you prefer it, you dont know what classic with new content could be, it could very well have most of the good things from TBC while leaving out the bad parts.
---
Decent World-PvP and social interactions between players.
---
I'm hoping it will get Blizzard back on track.
---
As far as I'm aware that is how DEing works. At least on private servers. I haven't been in beta or really been checking in on that.
---
But I think this way would likely be the best way to go about it honestly.
---
Thanks for your input!
---
&gt;Blind and Fear are both in the Disorient category so right off the bat you are wrong.
---
Fear is in the fear category, not disorient. Fear got put together with disorient in WoD and they shared diminishing returns before that.
---
&gt;Cba reading the rest tbh.
---
Yeah, its been clear that you are unable to face the fact that you are wrong.
---
This would be pretty funny as people are calling for a week 1 rag kill, only to not even get passed some of the easier bosses for weeks. Meanwhile no one can down a single boss in naxx until they have AQ40 bis gear. They come out with a blue post "I thought vanilla was easy?"
---
There are beastlored vanilla screenshots of Maexxna and Magmadar, both having the magic number 3731. 
---
There have been done calculations from retail vanilla videos, using baseline abilities like a 100 rage execute or a rogue's Kick or a Bloodthirst with &amp; without Crusader up; all of these different encounters pointed to the aforementioned 3.7k, some with 3k (such as KT). So there's a wide variety of bosses, such as Loatheb, Chromaggus, Firemaw, Anub'rekan, Thaddius, Vek'nilash, Eye of Cthun/Cthun, Razuvious, that have all shown to have 3.7k armor (I can't link the bugreports with the calculations here, but I can PM you if you wish to verify yourself).   
---
Even without believing in the warrior/paladin/mage classification this is a variety of bosses from various different raid tiers, so 3.7k is clearly a baseline of sorts. If there are bosses with higher thematic armor, then they're a rarity.
---
Or father ted
---
How can you not see that you will end up beeing bored? What happens when you are BIS on every single class in both factions? Are you saying you will play this game for 50 years? Ofc not, there will be a point where you get bored.
---
I never hear anyone talk about my realm! That said I was Alliance scum.
---
Thanks!!
---
Not true, its in their best intrest to make the game we want if they want to keep their players and keep making money.
---
Do you mean tier 0.5? Tier 0 is dungeon gear and is progression gear.
---
ZG has a very limited amount of gear outside of the raid, as does AQ
---
I'm so sad about that to be honest. Warlock definitely has some other tools in their belt, but they are so crippled against horde.
---
I havent played a bunch of the classes, but I enjoyed rogue levelling. You can stealth your way past camps to get to named NPCs to assassinate, you have more safety on a pvp server, its maybe not THE fastest especially considering you are starting from scratch along with everyone else but I would not call it boring.
---
Used discord for multiple years in raiding. It DOES lag, audio quality is somewhat ok, sometimes you get a guy sounding like a robot. You have total server outages, but luckily those are rare. Have had it happen during raids 5-10 times. Those lasted between 5min up to a hour or two. When someone got in and others couldnt.
---
Because OSRS is one of the most played MMORPG still today, EQ is not.
---
The totem is meant to buff other people, your self buffs will always be stronger
---
Not an expert at all. But from what I've gathered engineering can be a bit useless on a druid tank since you can't use the items while in bear - form.
---
Got that info from skarm on YouTube. Might want to take a look at him. He seems (to me) that he knows what he's talking about
---
Your masking the assumption that someone who doesn't setup a group efficiently and isn't coordinated is somehow going to be efficient out in the world grinding quest, this most likely will be faster even for a non efficient group
---
Press right mouse and A(+W/S) or D(+W/S) simultaneously.
---
Honestly if you ever play games you'll do this automatically after you've been dazed 3 times.
---
Alliance Edits (based on memory, I dont have beta, anyone who wants to expand or correct level ranges here comment):
---
- Deadmines = 15 - 20-22
---
- BFD = 20 - 24-26
---
- Stockades = 22 - 26-28
---
- Can still do WC and SFK if desired as well without the quest notes.
---
- Can mostly do the rest as is minus some quest diffs from capitals.  When in doubt check IF, SW and DN
---
For deadmines make sure you get the outside quests from storm wind in the bar in dwarf town, as well as the quest from Shoni by the well near the tram exit.  Also quest in westfall to unlock the defias brotherhood quest for van cleef, and the quest to get bandanas.  (If I missed any or anyone wants to give proper names and details feel free to comment with edits)
---
For BFD there are quests in Darn, not sure if through a chain as well as a chain in Ashenvale.
---
Stocks continue from quest item in Deadmines as well as from a quest atop the tower in westfall for more bandanas, there are also I believe 1 or 2 more but I cant remember (ones to kill like Kam and such)
---
Everything else should be close to the same minus things like the source of capital city quests.  Example being an SM quest is in SW at the cathedral vs UC for horde.
---
You killed it.  Thanks for sharing.
---
The game doesn't have to last forever.
---
Don't you ever claim IF as your home gnome scum! That privelage belongs to a proud and respectable race!
---
TBC already made big mistakes, making old zones / gear useless, making new content a separate new continent, flying mounts, resilience (imo).
---
This post warms my heart. I can't explain why though lol
---
PvP realms are exactly the same as PvE realms. Calling something a PvP realm is a little misleading because the "PvP" in the title is only emphasizing WORLD PvP. 
---
Battlegrounds, PvP rankings, PvP gear, etc. all still exists and is sought after in both. The only difference is PvE server players don't want to be bothered while farming materials in contested areas........................... (yes that's a silly shot at PvE server players)
---
Meh, it's just timing the hit correctly. But strafing is much easier and consistent.
---
Would love one for rogues
---
how are you fucked? I know you're excited man, but any delays mean improving the experience, not denying the game to anyone.
---
Reddit is a tiny fraction of the base
---
Just because raids have a dedicated spriest doesn't mean that they aren't a meme spec. They do subpar damage and the fact that they rely on debuffs is a real drawback with a 16 debuff limit. If you have less than 4 warlocks, you might as well bring another warlock for the imp shadow bolt procs. You would not take more than one shadow priest to a raid, and you can replace that single spriest with a healing preist spec'd into shadow weaving.
---
Just to add a pro to the list. They are extremely efficient when leveling with a healer. So if you have a buddy that is planning on healing, enjoy pulling 5 mobs at once.
---
I think I've settled on Alliance, as I was Horde last time around and I'd like to change it up.
---
I am leaning towards Mage, again, though the spellbatching and leeway seem off to me. My criteria are:
---
1) I want a class that is viable in PvP.
---
2) Decent chance of getting into groups
---
3) All-around good for solo'ing, making gold, etc.
---
I also played Rogue before and enjoyed it, it's good to have stealth on a pvp server, but im leaning towards Mage because its the start, so having portals, food/water and all that utlity will go a long way. And I figure my levelling spec will be pretty good at PvP as well, I dont have to swap too often even at 60. Thoughts?

Which is not always true. Most good gear at p1 comes from dungeons or random greens, for SOME classes.

He's absolutely right. For pve at least.

Dwarfs are proud people who were nice to take in allied refugees but it is sad that there are some of them who are still xenophobic.

Troll's racial is by far the best for tanking and dps in the PvE scene. Haste is ridiculously good for TPS.
---
No life the game hit 60 farm low level players
---
Hey Yenko! Of course I remember you!  That's awesome that you guys have kept in touch.  I remember Holl, Aimzz and Lkaturpants too, good people.  I don't remember seeing Brutality, did you guys stay on ZJ or move to another server?  
---
I raided with Secretfist when TBC came out, most of their members were old Transcendence guys.  They were a really hardcore guild and while it was awesome raiding with them, wow became more of a job than anything.  We min/maxed everything and it seemed to take the fun out of the game eventually.  I got burned out and quit raiding shortly before the end of TBC.    
---
Secretfist disbanded and I quit wow for a while.  I made some new friends IRL and they played wow so I rerolled paladin for wotlk and ended up being the MT of their more casual raiding guild on another server.  
---
I loved playing my rogue in vanilla and TBC but I actually fell in love with tanking and have decided that's what I want to do for classic.  I'm going to roll a warrior tank and would like to tank some vanilla raids.  I'm aiming to be more casual this time around, since I have a family now and won't be able to devote nearly as much time to the game.  If you need a good tank though, hit me up, it would be fun to get together on the same server and start up a new guild!
---
Convince them to go PvP. If you are mostly playing together you will mostly outnumber your opponent
---
Actually looking for, and finding, groups of nice people to head to, say, Uldaman. Or any other dungeon. Not so much deafening silence in PvE content. Finding a nice fun guild. 
---
Also back in the 2000's I wasn't into PvP games but now I might try to get rank 10 or something.
---
PvE Upsides: You won't be ganked when lvling. Pretty easy lvling without stressing about being killed/ganked/jumped by 500 people.
---
PvE Downsides: You cant gank, no world PvP (unless you flag yourself for it).
---
My own takes on it really.
---
&gt;joking aside though the first few months after childbirth can be magical
---
Tbh ganking noobs in stv / getting ganked by some noobs in stv is also magical.
---
I think a lot of people are going to be shocked at how low prices are (compared to retail), but more shocked at how time consuming gold farming is in Classic (outside of a few classes/grinds).
---
No dailies.  No extravagant amounts of gold for completing quests after 60.  Lots of competition for mining/herbing nodes.
---
Classic is a true grind in every sense of the word...that’s what makes the game so great.  You work for EVERYTHING...nothing is handed to you.  At the end of the day when you’ve bought your epic mount, or got our first epic, you feel a sense of accomplishment.
---
Yeah... you gotta take my opinion with a grain of salt as well. I don't mind the game being broken or unfair. If it puts me at an Advantage or disadvantage. The game used to be that way just considering different pings. Some Players just had better conditions than you. 
---
But the game was still sooo much fun that I couldn't care less! 
---
If the game Needs to be broke and unfair to be fun - I will let it be exactly that :D
---
But who knows... Maybe the second I start playing I will feel the same that the mechanics just feel different to the way they used to (if my Memory is even correct in the slightest :D)
---
whoOoOoOosh
---
Without spell batching: ZOMG OMG NO SPELL BATCHING DEAD GAEM OMFG U SUX BLIZZ LULUL!1111
---
With spell batching: Emulating, artificial, u sux blizzard lululu!111
---
The prices in retail wow don't seem all that bad after a week of questing and gathering at max level and you've hit 100k gold
---
Very cool
---
Do you use photoshop or some other program?
---
It's almost as if there are more than one person in this sub...
---
I'm looking forward to the slower pace questing. No addons (I know they exist) to tell you where to go and what to do, actually reading quest and enjoying the story. Dungeons actually having a challenge and requiring use of CC's and such instead of the pull all and aoe which seems to be the mind set lately.
---
So why not half way!?   Reduce by 50%.  
---
Keep the batching but tighten it up due to low latency.
---
Well, this build has all of it.
---
Less sustain than affliction.
---
Higher Mana Consum than affliction.
---
And most importantly killing mobs will take minutes.
---
I'd give this build a solid 2/10.
---
G.I.M.P, the free alternative.
---
Not as a ret pally. A ret pally *needs* their flasks and buffs to do even somewhat close to an unflasked, unbuffed warrior, rogue or mage, which affects the whole raid.
---
In a casual guild I guess it isn't a huge deal but it does bring the raid down pretty hard since the ret pally is actually dead weight in that situation.
---
Just play on a PvE server with your friends and flag yourself
---
Your ISP streaming the game, for one.
---
They made gold gaining easier and easier each expansion as a catch-up mechanic. With the release of the WoW token during mid-WoD the gold inflation seems to have leveled out.
---
My dad spent my childhood playing this game, from when I was 4-17.Can say we missed so many opportunities because he was preoccupied with WoW:/
---
Exactly!  Back in those days the large majority of players never saw the inside of MC (or any of the 40 mans for that matter).  I was so stoked just to go to the raid and see that area of the game.  It was glorious!  Most of the screenshots from MC that you see were from that first trip, I wanted to remember it!    
---
There weren't a lot of pugs for MC until TBC started getting closer.  I saw only a couple early on but most of the time they failed massively and often only managed to down one or two bosses.  It took a lot to organize 40 random players to work together.  I was able to make pugs happen later on when I got 15-20 regulars and then we just filled the leftover spots.  We did MC every week up until TBC came out.
---
dont need to click on a user but mouse over them or their raid/party icon and pressing the macro will hit that target ....
---
That would most definetly change the classic feel and gameplay. All those complaints are to change how it feels.
---
If the majority of the playerbase for classic wants the game not to feel like it did 2006 then maybe blizzard should change it. But exactly the missing spellbatching was what always felt so wrong about how the game feels on private servers for me.
---
Sounds like you will need to make a solo toon on a pvp server. Some people enjoy it like you describe others that same thing cause anxiety when they are looking to relax and punch a wolf in the face.
---
My friends all want PvE but I'm sure ill roll something on pvp myself a few weeks in
---
While it is great to vendor, many people are going to be needing it to level LW and make greens to DE for enchanting.
---
Just be sure if you list it to take account the AH cut.
---
Am I reading it right that 3rd column of DM is like 2nd column for Stocks?
---
Going to need a million snowballs for raiding.
---
Why would the bindings be P3 rather than phase 1?
---
When my oldest was born my wife and I were playing FFXIV and Wow interchangeably. She was our main healer in both and went to raid night for 14 2 hours after he was born and for wow the next day. You guys adapt so insanely quick its not funny.
---
&gt;Since beta has revealed the efficiency of dungeon leveling
---
Did we get some new information on it, or has it just been revealed to be a plausible way of leveling?
---
Wow.
---
Nope.  TSM has already said they will not be porting a Classic version unfortunately.
---
The only reason I like PvP servers is mining/herbing/farming and being able to kill the competition.
---
i remember almost every server had their own forums! guilds had websites! i miss that.
---
Yes, but he gave 11 significant digits. That last 0.00000000007 hours is 252 nanoseconds.
---
Not to be nitpicky, but a reasonable way to state this would be 116.81667 hours, indicating you could pinpoint the exact time to the nearest quarter second, not the nearest one-millionth of a second.
---
who cares about skill cap here? skill floor is what important to someone who's completely new. I'd be careful with claiming that hunters have the highest skill cap anyway cough warlock cough druid. if he makes fuckups then that's ok because doing mistakes is part of the game. it all depends on how smart and aware he is as a player and if he will learn from mistakes or continue doing them
---
I mean, you're not wrong, but the average poster on this sub is unable to entertain the reality that playing on modern infrastructure does have an impact on the feel of the game—an impact that it very much not Vanilla-like.
---
It's like someone arguing that old PC games shouldn't be [throttled for modern CPUs](https://www.howtogeek.com/171945/why-do-old-game-run-way-too-fast-on-modern-computers/) because that was the original programming.
---
Oh shit, it's actually you! I'm a massive fan, and I've been working on a similar spreadsheet for Fury Warrior inspired by your thorough lists. Let me know if you're ever looking for any kinds of database to use in your project, I'd love to generate them for you!
---
we will see a difference, prety sure about that.
---
But you cant compare Retail economy vs Classic Economy
---
HA! Like this would actually prevent from being dazed over 80% of the time in venailla
---
Can you walk me through how to download it? I couldn't find it on the battle net launcher. Do you have to be subbed first?
---
/u/Palingboer \- nice Icons :D
---
That extra 9 copper from a level 6 boar may or may not be the most efficient
---
Classic will be WAY more popular than the modern wow, wait and see.
---
My friends havent played wow since mist of pandaria (becous of panas ofc), but now; we are like 30 irl friends getting back to play Classic, everyone is super hyped.   Just wait and see my brother, wait and see.
---
By playing the game?
---
Well sir - you are right :D It only is 5Mil....
---
To minimize your costs try to buy a used windows xp desktop pc (any will do) off ebay. Save 25-50 bucks for that. Then proceed to force install windows 7 (Blizzard ended support for windows xp 2 years ago, sadly...). If successful pray for driver support for that old hardware. Wait for your prayers to be answered and install any drivers that seem applicable. Now try to install battle net. If all goes well you'll be able to play Classic now with a budget of 25 bucks and a probably older computer than your laptop. 
---
Optional: For maximum immersion buy a 17' CRT Monitor and play the game on a resolution of 800x600. (That's the maximum your new acquisition will be able to run anyways)
---
Thank me later
---
You will have to compete for tanks and healers though if you don't have a group already set up.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, may try it after years of clicking the mount :)
---
Whooooot? I thought tsm for Classic was confirmed??
---
Going in as a guild master and I'm taking my boys to the end.
---
Troll can up to 41% haste if the data from the beta is accurate. They have the highest TPS which is the name of the game in Vanilla.
---
Your analogy doesn't make a lot of sense here. What the OP is asking for is quite the opposite of throttling modern cpus to make up for the different hardware. The OP wants to take the old game and instead of throttling the hardware to preserve the feel he wants to speed up the gameplay because how the original gameplay feels is too slow for modern times.
---
Priest has a much more interesting kit if we're speaking purely about PvE healing.
---
However Druids have their place, and can fill a hybrid role if you fancy some tanking too.
---
One area that druids beat priests is in gear competition. Druids get decked out fast while priests are fighting for a lot of gear. 
---
Druids are much more interesting in PvP imo. Shadow priests are great but you won't be respeccing just to PvP, it's too expensive.
---
About tree fiddy
---
It’s not hard to understand. We just disagree.
---
LOL
---
The amount of people saying you should only here this voice or that.
---
On a progression fight, sure, there would be the "clear fucking vent", but 90% of the time raiding was 20 people shit talking in raid vent, and smaller groups chatting in their other vent which they bound the push to talk to a different keybind.  
---
However, it must be a push to talk communication method as compared to an open mic Skype method.  40 people are just too much for open mics.
---
It was actually the first weapon that dropped in BWL that was an upgrade for me.  As a combat rogue I wasn't interested in using daggers, so I was using brutality blade and whatever offhand I could scrape up.  The claw was a major upgrade at that time and I got it really cheap (DKP wise) because no one else was really interested in it.  
---
I did a lot of research on my rogue and spent my DKP wisely on weapons first, since they were the biggest upgrades.  I got the first CTS and maladath that dropped for us in BWL too, but from what I can remember those swords almost never dropped and I can't remember if they ever dropped for us again.  I'm pretty sure that was the only maladath that ever dropped for us, and I spent a ton of DKP to get it.
---
You can only kill *some* of the competition though, and the ones you can't kill are far more likely to node-ninja you.
---
sixtyupgrades.com is a cool website, created an account.
---
Id personally just rather not be ganked for 8 hours straight :)
---
I know you don't want to hear this, but pve servers are just that. Player vs. Environment. The human competition and danger element that comes from enemy player interaction goes away. To me, that makes the game dull. You could try to convince them to go pvp server or make a pvp server alt.
---
&gt; Reserving is a symptom of the me-first, screw everyone else cancer that infected wow.
---
Not in Vanilla, on the contrary to say the least.
---
Gear is very scarce in Vanilla and very RNG based. You'll see yourself. Example; when you are trying to get Cape of the Black Baron (agi/AP pre-BiS cloak) and you're on your 40th run and finally see it drop, would you feel so 'happy' about the game when some random green geared guy takes it away from you? That's what goes against the spirit of the game. Stupid, self-entitled people that items that they don't deserve, because they didn't put in the time like others did. Reserving items is a mean to prevent this from happening. 
---
This 'I don't like people who reserve items' perspective comes from ninja's, fresh, new, casual players who don't put in the time compared to them or don't even have the slightest clue how much time, effort and dedication is required. The discipline to run an instance 30, 40, 50 times or even more is a sign of great effort and dedication, not some kind of self-entitled feeling.
---
I mean i don't know many Razorgore kills without having hunters kite it until you get fully T2'd out.
---
Tokens arent impacting Inflation / Deflation Rates. Afaik there arent any Plans to add Tokens.
---
Nope. It's not about “speeding up the gameplay.” What the OP is arguing is for *slowing down* the current effects of purposeful lag-compensating design choices so that the game feels like it did back when everyone needed some form of lag-compensation.
---
I don't, I take it off and put on the blue engineering helm. I might not even use the rocket helm in a BG meaning it's never off CD.
---
Back in the day, battlegrounds were far more active on PvE servers.
---
Yes you should apply to blizzard
---
Good to know they are not. And they could early game if suddenly players have 100k gold
---
I've never multiboxed but I have been around for server launches, although with classic layering might help a bit. Depending on how fast you get out if the starting zone (which as a 5 stack, will probably take a while since you'll only get 1/5 of the xp per mob tag) you will be fighting for mobs wherever you go.
---
I have no doubt there is less world pvp on a pve realm but playing on one in Vanilla I have many fond memories of world pvp.  People want to engage in world pvp on all realms, they just want it on their own terms if on a pve realm.  I just want OP to know there isn't "no world pvp", it's just not as common.
---
I do bind mousewheel up/down and alt+mousewheel up/down. I don't click the wheel though, because it often makes me scroll accidently.
---

---
I've never saw that happen in Vanilla, ever.  Not even in STV.
---
I sense anger in you.
---
I sold a piece of gear for 45 gold the other day on the pserver and got more excited than I have regarding money in retail since the bc days lol
---
I really hope so.  I need to dig in some more...last time I read (a couple months ago) they said it was to niche to port it over.
---
Mage is a decent choice, but dime a dozen. And any dps is going to struggle at #2. 
---
Consider the following:
---
-	Shadow Priest: crushes criteria 1 and 2, though doesn’t have a clear gold farming strat. I’ve heard people claim you can aoe farm lashers with holy nova but I’ve never tested it
---
-	Warlock: the ultimate solo class in my opinion. No other class has the ability to self sustain like a lock. Huge group utility in portals, healthstones, cc and buffs. I don’t know what gold farming options they have but I’m sure there’s something.
---
-	Hunter: weaker at #2 than priest/lock but tons of interesting farming potential and can be brutal in solo wPvP if played at a high level
---
There is an Alliance version... xD
---
On a 3min cd, only situational at best. Also very much depends on gear &amp; individual skill. Also, stun-&gt; berserking.
---
Down-vote all you want, but my point still stands.
---
Can't wait to stroll out of Ironforge during winter veil, comfy to the max
---
i thought for sure tsm would port to classic aswell. where have you read that it wont :o?
---
Yes you're right. I absolutely want to spend time with my kid, but he just loves Mommy the most right now. I do feel like we have some nice bonding moments though. I'm the only one who actually speaks to him, the mom and her family just makes baby noises ;)
---
Kys
---
Join a guild that isn't filled with tryhards who believe the only successful raid is a meta raid.
---
Not really.  Only issue will be BoP recipes that require a 60.  Otherwise a level 35 alt will work just as well.
---
About tremor totem, it doesnt cancel out fear, like fear ward does. It removes fear per the totem pulse. Thats, what every 3 seconds. So your tank can still get feared for nearly up to 3 seconds. And a lot of things can happen in 2-3 seconds. But if you have very accurate timers, you can shorten it by planting the totem so it ticks just after the fear.
---
I'm a Shaman tank! Plz take me!
---
On the flip side, people can also kill you since you're their competition.
---
They did keep track between 12-16 and it was faster than Joana's guide for between those levels.
---
Definitely not a proven 1-60 route but there is evidence.
---
Here on Reddit.
---
Experiencing raiding and raid teams, I was too young for this back then and never really got to raid until ICC.
---
snowflakes need to stay on their warmode off BFA if they don't like it
---
My comment gets removed and him bashing all private servers doesnt LOL. So retarded mobs in this sub i have no words
---
I hope they dont release tbc
---
Would be so much better if they just added into classic
---
Judging by recent posts, 90% of people will be rolling orc if it’s an option for the stun resist. I’m expecting undead pop to be lower than it was in vanilla
---
I'm unsure about the specific addons you posted about but it will def be a gap that's filled by release  if all these addons won't be in classic
---
And while the baby wont remember, you are denying it critical development by not interacting with it and they may end upsignificantly worse for it.
---
Put away your screens and spend time with your baby people.
---
Runecloth turn ins for that sweet nightsaber. 
---
Winter spring frostsaber?
---
There’s plenty of rep grinds that are long and worthwhile and the human racial is immense for them
---
As an alliance priest, how do racials compare to one another?  I know fear ward is quite useful later on, but how do human/NE racials stack up against it?
---
I plan on leveling with a quad, 2  shamans and 2 warriors.
---
Biggest problem we have is the other shaman wife is due in October...
---
Honestly imo there is no way you can play classic wow PvP at a reasonable level with a controller. with the plethora of situational spells, down-ranking, focus/mouseover variants etc. you'll need way more buttons than a controller can offer.
---
You can do exactly that with clique...
---
Yes.
---
Ha, no trend I think. One of the cringier ones I remember from back then was seeing a guy who had a similar Alliance tattoo on his back. He was flexing hard too, and admittedly had good definition on his back muscles. That was all ruined by the fact that his full-color Alliance tattoo was a tramp stamp.
---
Would you mind not playing classic? You are not the representation of  the classic community.
---
Because this kind of bug has happened before and he was only able to log on for a half minute before getting DC'd anyway.
---
I wouldn't even level prot if I had four friends who lived with me and we played constantly in dungeons.  Go Fury and tank when needed.  You will have all of the necessary abilities for dungeon threat building.
---
power creep has gotten worse with every expac. Obvously when you are stronger at end game earlier content should be a bit easier. But the expac i remember the best and raided the most was Wrath, and i remember still doing Ulduar and ToC when ICC came out and those raids were still not some cake walk. With these huge 15 ilvl jumps between content, the previous tier is almost always a joke
---
They're likely better than you.
---
Changing hit boxed or leeway distance will only distort it more. Especially for anyone with compareable ping times. 
---
The entire problem is people complaining about something they've seen in a video on twitch that they haven't experienced in actual gameplay. The leeway is the same on popular private servers and people don't hate it there. Because it feels right if it isn't just shown in extremes on video.
---
No. Can't you read?
---
While Google collects the same data, you get the function of using things like Google docs etc.
---
This shit site does the same thing, but gives you nothing.
---
If someone likes PvP, they usually PvP on all chars - at least a bit :) Further, in PvE, engi might be minor but it's a way to show your guild that you care.
---
Wand/shadow then respec @ 60. That's what I plan to do. Another option is wand/shadow, respec to full shadow when you can have shadowform, then shadow/wand and another respec @ 60.
---
Which is basically a mouse over add-on with extra tools.
---
i put it in quotes cuz he said it all the fricken time. Its also a dumb word. I know its short for cartoon. I dont feel anything about WoW is cartoony
---
priest isnt bad for multiboxing i suppose, seems to be a lot of work to control two characters though, it might be quicker to simply play the warrior on its own if im honest. just learn aggro ranges and pull with your weapon, put on rend and hamstring and strafe away from the target, when your weapon swing is ready strafe back into the target, re apply ham and rend if need be, and rinse repeat.
---
weapon swing addon timers help with this.
---
I’m a huge Bassnectar fan and there is a lot of I relapsed with tool but I’ve never really understood why, any ideas?
---
I think the bigger problem community will be the PS elitists...
---
Make friends.  Have fun.  Ignore the trolls/elitists.
---
You got issues
---
Good on you for removing. Hope you learned a lesson here...
---
As a horde player looking for a PvP server where we are outnumbered, this would be perfect
---
Less.horde to compete with while ranking, plenty of world PvP, and short queue times.
---
Win win win
---
ive played the game for 15 years. If you read my post i was also downing mythic raid content during my short stint playing...
---
I was also climbing the arena ladders but i left that out... everything still felt empty
---
Mouse over macros are baked into clique. It's the avoiding targetting for quicker response times.
---
You would have a keybind which activates a mouse over macro (or clique).
---
They aren't mutually exclusive.
---
Having the high ping that made melee leeway feel “normal” over a decade ago is *incredibly rare today*—leading to an un-Blizzlike situation.
---
**Why are we allowing a non-Vanilla-like situation just to placate the 1% that still has 180+ ping?**
---
you totally should, warlocks are great fun in pvp. you'll probably get minced by hunters though, and maybe rogues if you havent got void sacrifice and healthstone up.
---
Do whatever you are comfortable with.  Mouseover macros are advocated because of less actions required, but the time difference is negligible.
---
Mouseover is really only important for PvP, not raid healing.
---
Druids probably fit the support role the best, but they do need a bunch of gear. However they can run specs that cover 2+ roles at once.
---
You could decide to go hybrid DPS/Tank, or Tank/Healer. Always able to pick up stray mobs, you're Innervating, brezing, CCing (roots, hibernate), decursing etc. 
---
It's a really dynamic and rewarding class.
---
its not a blatant lie, this is the classicwow sub, i wrote this in the pretense that not everyone would know what im talking about. I didnt want to get into the minutia, but everyone i know unlocked flying about 10-14 days in
---
I Loved that Show Back then! :)
---
Starshards is nieschly useful in BWL on shadow priest because of rely on shadow vulnerability 
---
Increased Spirit is little useful i guess, the heal is not useful at all
---
“_That expansion isn’t ready yet_.”
---
What is your handle? 
---
You'd be the first I blocked, god damn no lifers.
---
I'm 90% certain it was that way before the flightpaths were connected.  It won't be so in Classic because everything is connected.
---
if you know how to kite in pvp, you can do this no problem.
---
i still remember the good old days when the gear that prepared you for the next raid, was the current raid
---
Human’s +5% spirit is nice. You probably already know this but they have a holy talent which adds 25% of their spirit as spellpower.
---
Night Elves don’t really have anything that synergises with a priest.
---
Neither of their race-specific priest abilities are that noteworthy.
---
This.... is absolutely true. Good show, old chap.
---
"I'm gonna do what's called a pro gamer move."
---
Nah but its cathartic after a while of doing things efficiently.
---
Ideally listen/watch the sound of alliance dying.
---
Someone said Tauren health was base
---
If you don't want to go shadow and want to heal more effectively in dungeons, just take 5 pts in imp wand and 5 pts in spirit tap.  You can basically holy fire -&gt; SW:P -&gt; wand everything with little to no downtime.
---
&gt; These threads inevitably turn into a circle jerk about classic so thise of us who may have a more centered, non-hype view- get downvoted into oblivion.
---
exactly, this is a wow classic sub. I dont see the problem
---
starshards is very mana efficient and nice for leveling, humans are the best race in fights that dont require fear, and obv dwarves are the best for fights that have fear.
---
Hunters don't even fall off until like AQ40? Most people won't even make it there so Hunter is good AF DPS for all intents and purposes.
---
Warrior/druid could have mining or enchanting for 2man DME runs.
---
All could have herbalism or skinning to pick up some on the way. All could have alch/tail/LW for CDs. 
---
Druid can get ench for almost-bis tank trinket (even if you didn't plan to tank, you still may want to, for Patchwerk at least).
---
Hunter can get ench to DE the cheaper DMT drops.
---
But tbh, if you're hardcore enough to level 4 60s, you probably know all the details we could give you already.
---
I played on a pve server in vanilla there was world pvp quite often. Though later in wotlk my friends and I transferred to a pvp server. I really loved it way more we always had to group up to do things without getting ganked and it was a real blast. Having to be vigilant all the time added a whole layer to the game I had no comprehension of before.
---
It has its downfalls 100% but i like exploring the skys. I still had tons of wpvp in tbc. Yes flying mounts changed the game a bit but i dont think this had as big of an impact as people think. But it definitly did effect the game no doubt.
---
I just said that changing it will also just distort it more for those other 99%.
---
And the number of players with compareable ping times to 06 is far greater than 1%.
---
Helps if your going for the Frostsaber
---
It's a stepping stone, not a final destination
---
no one bought any of this shit on my server.
---
I also got these supposedly rare pets and they wont sell either..
---
It got auto-deleted you fucking idiot
---
I don't really do anime but there's a few (One Punch Man, Avatar, Attack on Titan) that are supposed to be insanely good, so I'm gonna marathon some anime.
---
Other than that, podcasts and movies.
---
Hi guys...
---
Just a reminder.
---
Your wife WILL remember.
---
On up side her boyfriend will thank you.
---
I'm 100% in this camp. 
---
The minute you release TBC you're going to have a divide. That divide will only get bigger as they release additional xpacs.
---
The key to this working is content being community driven via in game polls. That's what has made OSRS so successful.
---
Might aswell fix every exploit vanilla has and call it classic remastered
---
&gt; I just said that changing it will also just distort it more for those other 99%.
---
That's not true. Adjusting it so that it matches the feel of 2006 Vanilla, but for those 99% of players, would be closer to the original than what we had in Beta.
---
Why are you against adjusting melee leeway to be more Vanilla-like? Why do you want to the game to change?
---
Being reliant on third party servers and having [privacy and security issues](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html) is not really something to brag about. I'm not saying discord is bad, because I use it. It's simple and gets the job done.
---
Discord keeps chat logs, uploaded files, hashed passwords etc... I mean, ask yourself, would you trust your information to Facebook? Because discord is no different.
---
They aren't. Mouseover macros require two button presses, clique requires one.
---
Horst mag keine Vorspann Musik
---
Wouldn't the spirit from human racial work with the mana regen from mage armor meaning you benefit from it while casting?
---
This comment is priceless!
---
"How do I level a healing priest?"
---
"You don't."
---
There's a rapper named after cotton on a stick?
---
I'm really looking forward to all of the same things you mentioned. If you play retail check out Operation: Mechagon, its an 8 boss dungeon that requires trash to be CC'ed and is somewhat difficult unless your ilvl 420+
---
&gt; This powercreep to destroy earlier content always existed. Take off the blinders.
---
ive been playing 15 years or so, powercreep is always there, but it has gotten way worse. IVe always been a tank and i always did a healthy dose of mixed content, I would always run dungeons in wrath even tho i was full ToC/ICC geared, I was never as powerful then as i was in end game MoP, legion, or current bfa gear
---
ah ok, well that would be indeed a bannable offense, it should not be possible, but if it was it was exploiting a known bug
---
No, I think anyone can only predict using said tools and can’t possibly know. I didn’t say my guess is better than theirs or more accurate and I’m not informed at all I just have anecdotal frame of reference which means nothing.  
---
I think their initial estimates will be lower than the number who plays for release, that’s all. I acknowledge that there’s no way any personal context or personal experience has any value, and I know blizzard has lots of tools to guess this stuff but I still think that the amount of people coming back would be impossible to predict and will be bigger than they realize. Is that better? Do you think every person who logged in for the stress test is exactly who will login? Active forum users? Twitch viewership etc really tells them everything? Do you remember how long and hard fought the battle for classic was and how blizzard scoffed at the idea?
---
If anything pushing back the stress test probably means they are only now catching up with predictive data you mentioned and are finally acknowledging how big the player base for classic is going to be. Hopefully they can accommodate but I’m betting release day will be plagued with login and stability issues and layering will feel like shit until the tourists drop off.
---
Type the n-word in worldchat, put anyone that complains on ignore.
---
Blue Plz...and cry a little.
---
The only effect a token will have on classic is being able to buy game time with tokens so you can continue to play classic. However this will need to be done in retail.
---
Smite spam and some lesbian porn on the side. Just like playing a pally
---
Which dungeons would those be?  Many dungeons have a level range on the mobs where the ones closer to the entrance are the ones I'm expecting you to farm until you can handle the later ones.  Uldaman, Maraudon, and BRD all come to mind.
---
&gt;  confirmed to work as it's supposed to in 1.12
---
This is bad logic. This is like [not adjusting your emulated clock speed](https://superuser.com/questions/630769/why-do-some-old-games-run-much-too-quickly-on-modern-hardware/631131) to make DOS games play like they were originally intended on old hardware.
---
Call them the F word in game like you just did in your title.  You'll never have to deal with them again because you'll be banned.  Simple.
---
You can ask the person who made the site he is on this sub quite often.
---
I mean, that was what the Meeting Stone system tried to accomplish as well. You either go to the Meeting Stone to meet other people wanting to do that dungeon or you can head to the inn and find adventurers there. And of course, other than the fact that role queue was nonexistent (it often matched 5 DPS together and said "good luck me hearties") the other reason it was never used was because there were only two places in a zone where you could queue up at, and zone chat let you spam messages anywhere in that zone.
---
Ah I see I never sold one. I assumed you dropped the cash and got the gold... that makes more sense
---
Haha my time to shine.
---
So yeah i used to do what your doing on the pservers. And yeah swp rank 1 is most efficient.
---
Start with 4 rank 1's and your 5th one should be max rank.
---
The priority for shadow invulnerability is only penultimate so it will get pushed off eventually. So keeping an eye on it will be big. 
---
Im assuming your also still a healbot?
---
Us gamers right??? I too cringe to mundane stupid shit like that. Makes me feel like I'm not a worthless 36 yo incel virgin
---
You can use the mobs abilities just like a priest MC. It only lasts for ~20 seconds though.
---
Not true.  I had several mouse over macros as a holy paladin in arena.
---
It definitely worked like this in wotlk, but idk about Vanilla.
---
pretty cool thanks for sharing
---
There is no reason to worry about dps, I'll be spending my time between reapplications healing. So flay to stack it up, sw p to refresh. Looks good to me, thanks!
---
but its also an .exe
---
Yeah, he was wrong.
---
Yeah, that was my point. My guild was planning on running 15-20 man MC runs anyway, depending how easy the content is. But no first boss in a large raid is worth locking out small groups of people.
---
Only one I can think is MC if you were doing bindings farming specifically. But you're still only getting half the bindings off one boss and not killin mag means dogs respawn.
---
Holy paladins take very little from MC. What they would grab, Dire Maul will replace it anyways.
---
Imo go rogue.
---
Warlock and mage PvE rotation is mind numbingly boring, while rogue is a bit more interesting. Rogues have 2 viable PvE specs which gives you some versatility.
---
Warlocks don't get competitive DPS until later in the game. Rogues can pull competitive DPS from the get-go.
---
Rogues get Windfury which is fun AF.
---
Rogue PvP is so fun, really high skill ceiling, can get by with a PvE spec too.
---
Gearing is pretty competitive with all 3. Warlocks are saddled with Tailoring gear for ages which is a bit shit.
---
Jupp und Allimania 20 ist mittlerweile auch raus!
---
Have you leveled since the scaled the content? It's actually not as bad anymore and I find myself going back to new/different/low traffic zones because I haven't been there before. Also timewalking in dungeons is a great feature.
---
Id say its more of prefrence. Sure, you can do basic healing with clique and its essentially exactly the same as using a mouseover macros. But when im healing i tend to have some other CD's that i have my left hand hovering over. So if im healing with naga and want to Bop someone, its faster me to click a button on left hand compared to move my thumb to another button and then press it.
---
Like im targeting boss, i mouseover heal melee. I notice boss changing target, i can just flick the mouse off the screen not to mouse over target anyone with right hand and on left hand press BOP macro (that does mouseover &gt; target (if friendly) &gt; target of target priority ). So on bosses i can do that MUCH faster than first moving my mouse to hover over target of target and then use a some alt+ctrl clique combo button.
---
Not really linked to the subject, but its the same principle still.
---
I do prefer to have my left hand on the same situation ready and press bop when the mouse is moved on top of the correct mouse over target. It takes less time than moving the mouse over the target and then pressing the mouse button keybind after i have stopped moving. Maybe its just me being old. i cant make my brain think about pressing the mouseover button (that im not currently constantly spamming, thats works fine) while moving the mouse on right hand while im moving it. Its more like move, move, stop. Press button 1. But for some reason i can anticipate pressing the key on my left hand, while moving the mouse on my right hand.
---
But basic healing, clique is just fine.
---
Nit in vanilla, think it was on mf ticks in late tbc or early wotlk
---
Is it worth going tailoring early on though since you can keep the cloth anyways and use it when you hit 60 and swap professions?
---
In vanilla I did tailoring/enchanting, but now I'm thinking I'll just go leatherworking/herbalism so that I don't have to grind gold for a horse.
---
Yes ofc, I can still pop off big PoH's, shield ppl and throw renews out if no one else is. Spamming flash heal Max rank will oom me very quickly but if I absolutely need to, I can pump out some decent hps for a little bit.
---
Well, even 50 DPS help to kill the boss faster! If you don't slack with manapots/runes you'll have the mana you need.
---
Keep in mind that I'm not sure if each tick of Flay gives you stack :)
---
Can you turn in runecloth for that?  I only know of the repeatable rep quests + the unique turn-in beads you can get while doing said quests.
---
We all know that Classic will be dead in 2 years max, if there isn't new content.
---
We also know that TBC only will have half the player base of Classic, because half of Classic players despise TBC.
---
Hence, Classic+ is inevitable.
---
Naysayers don't have the brains to see it, but Classic+ is a GIVEN.
---
I was going to roll RP but only if it was an RPPVP server, which doesn't seem very likely anymore. I don't think they confirmed RPPvE only but it sure sounds like it.
---
Wouldn't a priest also be a healbot? Pally healers are amazing PVP healers
---
If your talking about DM lashers it’s possible on Nost, idk about retail.
---
I'll be rolling PvE because my time playing is going to be even more precious than it was now that I have a full house to care for and a fulltime job.  I don't want to prolong my goals because of ganking.  I enjoy wpvp, but ganking is just a nuisance at this point in my life.  Sure, it's a sacrifice in some regards but I know that I won't be without some wpvp experiences if I stick to a pve realm.  I'll just have less of it but that means more time to focus on the pve content (which I prefer more).
---
WC has trash mobs that are level 21. You are going at 17.
---
SFK has mobs 24-26. You have it set to go there at 20.
---
RFK has a ton of mobs level 30-31. You have it set to go there at 25.
---
It seems to level off from there. But the number one issue I saw with several streamers was going too soon.
---
Kargoz's group died a ton because they were too low level for the dungeons consistently. Adding in ANY amount of wipes due to being underleveled is going to skew your results heavily.
---
This is a little soon for me to be talking about, but I plan on creating a true priest leveling method. 
---
I plan on callenging the notion you go 5/5 wands first. If half of your damage is wands then imp wands is a 12% damage increase. But I believe wands would only be 25% of your overall damage and thus only a 6% damage increase. 
---
Also this might be only for trolls, we will see.
---
I asked OP a question, because the answer IMO depends on his spec and lvling priorities.
---
It's also a but odd to ask about DPS while leveling, DPS is a metric mostly used in raids.
---
Back when vanilla was released, things were tough. People were still getting a handle on their classes, pulling multiple mobs could be a death sentence, and packs in dungeons needed coordination.  
---
It wasn't uncommon for random buffs from passers by, and lots of discussion in chat for dungeon groups about who to cc, where to pull the mobs, etc... in retail, there are many instances of dungeon runs being completely silent, people getting insulted for trying to start conversation, and overall it has a more personal grindy feel than a community working together to achieve the end goal.
---
Dont die
---
Teach yourself to use rely on greater heal as your go to heal, in the early days of raiding it will oom you but rank 1 shouldnt be to bad, if you can read the fight and know when people are gonna get damaged you cam precast it so you dont get sniped
---
Find a friend and just bind /follow and heal to 1.  WoW with one hand, porn with the other.
---
The video mentions that it's also a good way to make money, although with the constraints of bag space I doubt it is.
---
Yeaaahhhh.... you don’t know what you’re talking about lol
---
World pvp. Is it even possible in retail now?  I ran around stv and opposite faction was orange. No idea wtf they did to the game.
---
Kargoz (classic content creator) and some of his friends have been doing some shaman testing and they determined that Flametounge is always the worst weapon enchant that you could be using. Rockbitter or WF is always the way to go.
---
Isn’t the best in the world, obviously means he sucks.
---
Yes, in classic.
---
On YouTube check out Shedothedruid, Skarm and Stormx.
---
Exactly. That dude doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
---
It's crazy the different reaction people give lol. I jokingly made a post about dropping responsibilities and pawning off my wife and kid when classic comes out and got down voted to oblivion. You say it though and get 3 gold! Lmao damn you internet
---
There absolutely are people that would want a Cata server... or a MoP server, or a Legion server. So where do we draw the line? Do we just tell those people "no, you're wrong and you can't ever have your game".
---
Re-releasing any of the xpacs is a very slippery slope that should be avoided imo.
---
Im not using clique, i have all done in mouse over macros. But most of it i could do with clique, too.
---
OK thanks. But are quest rewards like 1 copper lol? But yeah, jokes aside, I heard respecing was expensive and that it took forever to farm raid food or whatnot too. So didn't want to make a mistake as soon as I spent my first talent point.
---
That is why these are notes instead of a fully fledged guide.  Nothing about these are finalized and feedback like this is why I wanted to share them here.  If you have anything else to add to what I have here then I'm very happy to hear it.
---
I still have some work to do on it clearly and I'll be looking for good quests to potentially fill in some gaps like that.
---
I'm pretty sure no one has heard this song before.
---
Thanks
---
Rolling horde for the first time (Orc rogue)..guess the question is to stay in Durotar for the start, or run over to Mulgore and do some leveling there and go ahead and get the Thunderbluff flight path.
---
There's far too much math involved but basically expertise is stupid op for warriors in Vanilla
---
But why? I’m not trying to be too much but there are a vocal group of the classic community that gatekeep blood elves and don’t give valid reasons for it (see my previous posted being down voted). Honestly I want to know what makes you afraid? As some who played during classic as a troll then played all of tbc and wotlk as a belf I feel like i’m entitled to want my main back.
---
Ehh, I think you misread the above user's comment. They're just informing what this site takes extra to the user they were answering, who assumed they only took their email. I'm sure they're perfectly aware other sites do the same or more.
---
You will be taunt tanking almost everything at low levels. Only try to fight mobs your level. Two levels higher is a no go.
---
Oo, this is an important one OP, take notes.
---
Dumbest comment i've read in a while.
---
How in the world are they goin to test MC / ONY / BWL in full T3 / BiS naxx gear? lol.
---
Limitations and problem solving, team based strategies in 5man content (M+ kind of scratched this itch but scope creep and new affixes kind of ruined it), GCD changes reverted
---
Haha.
---
Glass houses sink ships!
---
Thanks for the advice
---
I'm pretty sure everyone who played Vanilla heard a thousand witless versions of "because I got high".
---
Yeah, the game hasn't changed in speed but the people know a lot more now than 12 years ago.... that's why you have people on the beta beating the vanilla "world record" by over 12 hours to level 40
---
 Good Morning Azeroth is great, they really breakdown the game and get into the details and unique things that make classic interesting. For example, they were talking about the fact that tauren warrior tanks may be superior due to the fact their hit-box is larger and they can reach mobs from a greater distance, which can prevent a mob from smashing a healer that draws aggro.  Another example, in the beta they tested to the best of their ability, the different shaman weapon buffs and learned that Flametounge is always the worst weapon enchant you could be using even if you just learned the next rank.
---
Yeah, I love that video. Great example of how the design philosophy surrounding raids has shifted. He doesn’t clearly state what percentage of the playerbase actually plays, although he’s saying that 1% is a myth, and implies that it’s higher than that. The number I gave was 5% (5x higher than 1%), so him saying 1% is wrong checks out. It would take some involved statistics to get a good estimate of how many players actually raided using those numbers, but let’s just think about what he says in the presentation.
---
With regards to the number of subscribers during BlizzCon ‘05, I believe the numbers blizzard released at the end of q3 were 5 million; https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/acqhph/i_estimated_subscriber_numbers_using_google_trend/
---
The number of concurrent raiders during prime time (when a very large portion of raiders raided) was given as 50,000. 
---
Simply taking 50,000 and dividing it by the 5 million subscribers would give 1%, but that’s not quite accurate, of course. Some guilds didn’t raid during prime time, and some guilds didn’t raid every night of the week. I think that most guilds would have raided during 2-3 days of the week, meaning that those who raid on any given day represent between 2/7 and 3/7 of raiding population (of course assuming the you’ve averaged across all days). Let’s say that 75% of guild raid during prime time (probably more) on any given day. This would mean that 50,000 represents between 233,333 and 155,555 or between 3% and 5%, roughly.
---
Either way, the lead dev and the class designer are on record saying they remember 5% as the estimate at the time. They are also on record saying that the systems weren’t designed around raiders.
---
Orc is pretty great, borderline OP PvP passive racial and a decent little PvE buff. 
---
But imo it's a lot more important to choose a race you really like visually/thematically. You'll be spending a lot of time with your toon so make it something you enjoy looking at.
---
What level is BRD?
---
So like 10% of the playerbase?
---
The REAL Un'Goro crater!
---
Imo you shouldn’t be afraid of macros. They function from a user’s point of view very similar to a spell, especially the good ones
---
World pvp was most definitely NOT a dumpster fire back then.  It is now in retail and has been for some time but flying is one of the main causes for the downfall of wpvp.  Miss the days of the oh so famous Southshore vs Tarren Mill.  Anyways, that's just my thoughts on it.
---
I -think- weapon skill value doesn’t confer benefit beyond 305 since there aren’t any mobs above level 63.
---
I don't even use that site, but if you compare it to literally any other site you have to register for, it is completely normal. Literally nothing malicious about it yet you are out here spouting off about protecting your personal data like it actually captures anything of value.
---
thats a pserver only thing
---
Ah ok. Back when I played I was super young and never used them so I don’t really know the utility of addons. Is there a common list of useful addons for each role (dps/tank/heals) or class?
---
&gt;P R I V E L A G E
---
Then you already know what you want to play.
---
i dont have any idea :O
---
Amen
---
No... By level 60 you should have a bunch of gold from vendoring quest rewards and quests themselves.
---
Property of RTK.
---
Also don't look at my post history
---
-Toes
---
That mount was created to absorb the skewed economy of legion, due to class hall quest farming for gold. Many people had millions of gold so bliss dropped this overpriced, albeit useful, mount to mop up some of that insane gold supply
---
And don't forget the classic:
---
WHAT IS FORGE?
---
BABY DON'T SMELT ME!
---
DON'T SMELT ME!
---
NO MO'!
---
I can definitely see the bag space problem but you can't deny the overall higher value of items you will be looting in dungeons compared to open world.  As far as gold gain it will really depend on how well you manage your bags I feel.  Scarlet Monastery might have multiple mailbox runs to send stuff off to a bank alt as an example.
---
no. it means that his route is poorly optimized
---
Say hi to the spirit healer for me
---
Can you elaborate?  I'm not familiar with priest ins and outs and I'm curious to learn from your experience.
---
Thanks. It's interesting hearing about all this wanding. Wanding was like a joke in BC onwards.
---
Did you just reply to yourself?
---
I didn't come here to feel personally attacked. 2me4meirl. Ret pally for life though.
---
This is great i was just starting to think how will i get my UI set up before launch so i can have it laid out correctly and can focus on  leveling instead of UI setup.  I do have a question and it most likely has been posted in this subreddit but can't find the answers yet.  Where is the best place to get addons that WILL work with classic wow?  Also does anyone know of a running list?  i would love for things like Grid &amp; bongos or bartender to work on classic wow.
---
"total per person xp for full clear" - I just couldn't be assed to keep things the same for both sheets I used.
---
Exactly. People conveniently like to leave out the benefit rolling a PvE server has on your overall experience. If you have limited time, being able to choose how to spend all your time in game is a fantastic plus.
---
Yes, you will miss out on organic, regular, World PvP. However for some it's a worthy sacrifice.
---
No.  It's not.  Blazefury is 1:1.  Then you can stack servo arms and a bunch of other things.
---
&gt;Troll is great, but then you have to play troll.
---
I didn't come here to feel personally attacked. Ret pally for fucking life though
---
Given the number of pservers out there I say there will always be a demand for the original game with as little deviation as possible, sure people will get bored and rl busy and rotate out of the game but I think there will always be enough players to justify a handful of servers.
---
He must have died while carving it.

---
I'm trying to think of it in this context. Grown up life certainly cuts back on the play time and perhaps choosing when I'm ok with wpvp will be better.
---
Thanks, great tips! I briefly played a lvl 39 Druid twink somewhere between bc and wotlk and had green whelp armor which did still have a sleep effect, it was brief and the proc rate was low...so there’s hope!
---
So's your face!
---
All the best. If it works out, you can write a guide.
---
No problem, that's why I commented. Not to berate the guide just offer some criticism based on what I saw watching the beta.
---
This is how my dedicated group will be leveling, on horde, so I've done some research myself. 
---
We will start WC around 18, and we'll be peppering in BFD around 21 because we have 3 wand users and a few people who are new to Vanilla so they kind of want to see more dungeons.
---
It may slow us down a little traveling there, but it also eases that awkward gap before SFK, and should make the subsequent runs faster because we'll be at a more appropriate level.
---
Remember that line about witless?
---
Yeah, It's attached to your name.
---
I think once Classic is live you are going to have a much harder time leveling that fast comparing to a closed beta. Sure we know more information but the general population isn’t going to be speed leveling, most people will still take a very long time to reach 60, if ever
---
Should I have used an edit?
---
Pitiful.
---
Podcasts and Audio books.
---
Yare yare daze
---
If you strafe in a straight line, it's 50/50 as you say, however if you constantly turn a tiny bit towards the front of your character, the mob will be slightly in your frontal 180 degree nodaze zone and your running path will be slightly curved  (think banana shaped)
---
Good thing they don't design to reduce the number of complaints on forums then.
---
I'm rolling warlock for the same reason. But I get the free mount instead! Never buying a 60% mount probably.
---
shalom
---
Wird wohl ohne die alten Sprecher aufgenommen werden, oder? Ich denke, es wird schwer - nach Allimania 20 und dem ganzen Drama rundherum - nochmal alle zusammenzutrommeln, vor allem ohne Gehalt...
---
The price to respec rises each time you do it. I plan to respec twice, once at 40 for Shadowform and then again at 60 for Holy/Disc. Total of 6 gold. Pocket change by then.
---
You can heal sub-60 dungeons just fine as Shadow.
---
&gt; Releasing any of the xpacs is a slippery slope that should be avoided at all cost.
---
People said the same thing about Classic.
---
Podcasts, netflix, music. I cant listen to System of a Down without reminiscing my old shaman grinding out xp. Trailer Park Boys makes for some good background as well
---
WoW music and Red Hot Chili Peppers
---
Just look at the recent store mount and tell me again they don;t pull shit like that
---
Edit = Tide spelled backwards
---
PI/SW seems like a terrible spec.  You may as well just go full shadow PvP spec at that point.
---
With the formula being used in classic your cap will be 308 skill against raidbosses.
---
I did find an Aux fork that worked on PServers, anyone in the know have a clue what it takes to get them running on the Classic client?
---
Not that I can code for shit, sadly. But I vastly prefer Aux over the alternatives I’ve tried.
---
It's much more helpful to the raid than shadowform. You fill a healing spot and allow for a real caster dps to come instead.
---
Alright this is top secret info so dont tell anyone i told you but... 
---
You grab light well and spirit of redemption
---
(Keep your mf hand off that downvote button)
---
You take lightwell to heal people during loatheb since you know exactly when the damage is coming and it will keep your mages alive longer who are the the most important class for that fight. Its also helpful on 4 horsemen during the 2 minute rest phases so you can save a bandage. 
---
You take spirit of redemption because on loatheb if you die you can spam 3-4 renews on the mages then 1 greater heal on the MT which is HUGE on that fight.
---
You also are able to take the 10 percent hit with shadow spells so you know what that means? Thats right! Mind control baby you get the cool MC jobs for razuvius and faerlina 
---
But lets not forget: you have 31 points in the holy tree, the other priests dont! You know what this means for your heals??? Top 3 on the meters baby
---
But you also get to play with the shadow priest rotation when heals arent needed.
---
Also Barlow lebt immernoch vom Streamen. Der würde da doch bestimmt mitmachen !
---
This is so confusing.
---
relevant username?
---
In that case go ahead and use clique, I had no idea never heard about it.
---
Level shadow. Switch to heal spec somewhere around 55-60 depending on what content you are wanting to take on.
---
Taurens look like shit. Female orcs is where the action is at!
---
Meine Name ist Miraculi und ich werde nicht für euch kochen.
---
Money is actually removed for the AH cut I think.
---
Der ist bestimmt dabei. Aber Miraculi, Medivh, Dimitri etc. Sehe ich kritisch...
---
Anything from a 1050 and up is going to be plenty for Classic. More is always better, but WoW is a cpu intensive game anyway.
---
These are the big highlights, there are definitely more ways to abuse this spec in naxx, get creative
---
I never knew the alliance players on ZJ, but I remember encountering the Final Union guys would sometimes put together a team and steamroll through the BGs.  I got melted a few times by this one night elf rogue with full BF and Thunderfury, can't remember the name now though.
---
Being able to enjoy the game at any level and any type of activity I choose to do.
---
I played retail and it feel that I have to constantly rush and do the only thing that matters - clearing raids on 4 different difficulties. And also if you get later in the patch no one wants to invite you to raid because you don't have the curve... PVP is kind of OK but it feels so much sterile compared to vanilla and tbc and feels boring after a while... I also leveled max level engineering just to find out all of the items are useless in pvp and raids... 
---
I want to do low level dungeons that require careful planning and cc to complete, I want to stay 3 weeks lvl 39 because the pvp in that bracket seems really fun. I want to level a profession and craft rare stuff and people to know me that I am the "Enchanter" or the "Alchemist". I want just to goof around in world pvp... There is just so much more to do in classic than end game raiding...
---
There's really no big reason, like what eve said it makes you see what the boss is targeting which is nice iguess. It also means you can quickly cast any offensive ability you might want to use. It's not a big deal you could just play without a target too.
---
Wooord. Great to hear it! Very cool that you too were a Tauren Hunter. I'm in the same boat. I'm mostly concerned at level 60, but no one will really know until then, since Classic is a totally weird rebirth of Vanilla! I look forward to it though. 
---
My vote is Tauren. They're just plain sexy and awesome! Mulgore starting area is so pretty too. I'm not entirely sure how their extended melee reach affects their deadzone, whether making it smaller or just expanding it outwards.
---
Mechanically speaking, Troll is better, but damn they're ugly af and their starting area is poopoo :P
---
I've even talked with some that speedlevel without imp wand 1-40. Bit odd, but i guess there's a few options.
---
I agree with that as well, as soon as a TBC server would launch the community would forever split and that split would be detrimental to not simply the Classic Servers but also the TBC one's as well.
---
I am say that is a true blue fan on TBC as well, it is my favorite expansion to the the series on literally every level but I know what would happen if that came to pass and it sadly would just lead to further and further splits in the community.
---
This is 100% the opposite of the #NoChanges but guys lets be real OSRS led the charge and while the original popularity of the base OSRS was good it died off within a year.  The same thing is going to happen to Classic WoW and moving the game into TBC is not the answer, new content is, but it has to be new content that is in the same vein and mindset as what Classic hopes to achieve.
---
Yes, because Classic is running on a version of the BfA client.
---
Because Classic raids are hard.
---
Because you can see all 40 (or however many you are assigned to) with clique, while it's kind of easy to lose them if you are mousovering their bodies. 
---
Alternatively, if you are mouseovering the portraits in the raid, then yeh it's nearly the same, clique is just slightly superior because it provides a few extra stuff.
---
I see them bringing in the Wow Token system at that point if gold prices start to get out of hand. They know the problem and have a great solution so I doubt they will let it spiral out of control like the original wow, probably in the later phases depending on staying power of the playerbase.
---
But not the special unique toy, every year will have the same presents
---
No I was in high school . Grades were lacking lmao. Still graduated. I work full time and have a girlfriend and and all that now.  Won’t be doing that grind this time around. Had a solid PvP guild as well
---
It is a commonly accepted word with no connotations, unlike other words that have actual associations, such as racist slurs and swear words. It is not an adjective, but merely a noun.
---
You are free to feel however you want about a word, I merely gave you this history as some simple etymology.
---
I'm pretty sure I'm rolling Dwarf Disc/Holy Priest. Should be viable for both PvP and PvE without respeccing too much, right? I like the idea of being a battle support type class that's not just spamming heals. Although I know I'll probably have to go holy if I ever want to do high level raids. Am I wrong on my idea of the playstyle? What are the pros and cons?
---
Icon by icon would take ages, you can find programs to help make mosaics with google. :)
---
And a good few hours with a program like photoshop or G.I.M.P.
---
That guy is super wrong. That was true from mid wotlk.
---
You talked about the jet pack and how flying invalidated it. Well you knew very well that flying was already in the game when you were crafting your jet packs and that it was a matter of time till you can fly.
---
Most guilds are not going to require world buffs. Only like the top 1% will because you can't farm them as easily as in pservers.
---
&gt; Freezing Trap lasts upwards of ~26 seconds or so at level 60 with survival talents.
---
Not in PVP it doesn't.
---
A community
---
Thats not many icons to work with... there would be alot or recurring icons.
---
Never heard of it /// Nie davon gehört.

43%? How is that done?

Bad ass!

You mean Ass+
---
Depends on items and skill tbh. If you waste your Charge running into a Hunter trap, you lose the duel. If you’re well geared and you can get a Charge/Hamstring off, you win
---
&gt; One bubble of rested XP (5% of a level) is earned for every 8 hours spent resting. A maximum of 30 bubbles (150% of a level) may be earned. In other words, you can leave your character resting in an inn or capital city for up to 10 days (without gaining experience) before you earn the maximum amount of rest state, and a resting character stores up one full level of rest in 160 hours (6 days, 16 hours).
---
I think rest is like one of the things that really has not changed since Vanilla.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Rest
---
I'm curious if those will be brought back on the Blizz official forums or if maybe on reddit each server will have a subreddit
---
aah makes sense
---
I assume you mean skinning /herbalism
---
You don't need to go full shadow, shadow doesn't really bring that much to your leveling speed till 40 once shadowform comes online and mindflay starts doing reasonable damage. Even then, leveling is all about efficiency and if shadow is anything it's mana inefficient. Meanwhile as holy you've got some nice buffs to smite and holy fire, and Spiritual Guidance which is awesome since spirit gear is plentiful but spell damage gear is rare. 
---
Point being, basic priest leveling with wand and dots is plenty efficient as-is. If you want to turbocharge your leveling, pick up spirit tap in shadow, wand spec in disc, or both before you start going holy. For extra fun you can even do spirit tap first, then go holy to pick up Spiritual Guidance. Now by stacking spirit you're a high damage machine that never goes OOM.
---
Thing is, if you want to be a healer, be a healer. Don't buy into the "if you don't level as this one spec it'll take FOREVER." When I roll a healer I roll one to be a healer, I want to embrace that identity and playstyle from level 1. Just have an idea of what your final spec will be going in. If you're going holy/disc, go wand spec before holy. If you're going holy/shadow, pick up spirit tap before going holy.
---
PVP or bust. I’ve played both. The danger of enemy players adds a metric fuck ton of immersion and content.
---
It isn't efficient either. Mobs with the same level give the most xp as far as I remember.
---
At least the UK version is WAY better than the US.  It's on network TV and lacks the adult content.  And being in the US, the British accent is "fit"!
---
I've had a few instances were discord was shitty in raid and we couldn't hear each other for like 5 mins but not nearly frequently enough to care about.
---
I'd argue that most of your points are 100% correct, BUT a couple quibbles, just from the shaman perspective-
---
Warrior probably gets prio on dungeon drops or the 2h weaps, but the shaman needs to be strong as well.  You don't want to be using crescent staff and wearing a dress at level 30.  
---
Gear becomes much less of an issue once you make it into SM.  All wings have great gear and basically everything that drops is good to totally pimp out the warrior + get the shaman a mail set for level 40 and/or a 2h weap (ravager or Mog Might) 
---
I'd argue against speccing improved WF totem and then moving out of enh.  Elemental weapons is a no-doubter talent that boosts your DPS a ton, and parry is kind of situational but is a good defensive and offensive talent due to parry-haste. Definitely on point to go into Resto for the secondary part of the talent trees.   You can get all the way to NS without any filler talents for the leveling spec.
---
Thats true. Hopefully the cooldowns prevent world buff stacking.
---
The dire maul buffs are still spammable, though.
---
Over time, more and more guilds start requiring them, though. It starts out with no one using them because they don't need them. Then a few people start to get world buffs and start topping the meters, therefore getting more gear which forces other players to also get world buffs to be competitive to also get good gear and eventually  most of the raid is using world buffs and they start to look down on those who aren't as they're always bottoming out the dps meters.
---
Except an extremely intuitive interface that also lists comparable best in slot items, where they drop, how they are crafted, etc. Then scales up til the end of the game through every phase. You thinking this site is cause for security concern, yet use reddit is seriously asinine.
---
Ahhhh thank you!
---
I can’t be positive but I think the OP doesn’t fully know about mouseovers and could also be talking about mouseover frames macros.
---
What a shit attitude hope I’ll never meet you in game
---
Thank you :)
---
Healers maybe but there were streamers on the beta doing dungeons with 4 dps and a healer.
---
That doesnt prove they didnt originally planned to release kara in vanilla and just changed their mind later..
---
If you're worried about privacy and security, you shouldn't be playing WoW at all. Warden has permissions to scan every process on your system and report back to the server any information it wants.
---
I mainly just listen to the in game music/ambient sounds.
---
If you are tired of being ganked by the Horde don’t let your health reach zero. It works all the time.
---
Easy, save for mount at 40.
---
I literally proved that you dont know what you talking about in the very first paragraph, obviously you are clueless. Fear and Blind are both disorients like i just said, they are not a different category
---
Jizz.gif
---
AUX is definitely my favorite AH addon (next to TSM for retail).  
---
I even though about paying someone to update it.
---
Keep them for lvl 40 mount. Use the excess gold for weapons,skills and crafts
---
Pretend like I'm going to save it for lvl 40 mount but probably spend it on the AH like the weak fool I am.
---
You'd go imp wand before tap? I think spirit tap before imp wand as more than likely you'll be 11-13 before you get your first wand even if you are rushing it.
---
Sure but all these mailbox/bank runs probably aren't taken into account into the method efficiency. 
---
I hope I'll have such a group though, if only for those times when you don't really find quests for your level. Also because early dungeonning with a group of friends is one of the best experiences in game!
---
Same thing happens nowadays, someone puts some copper for 9,000,000 gold, very few people have that amount
---
Don't worry I was the same, just not as many hours
---
Make a stand of free white weapon trade for lowbies.
---
No. A common priest leveling strat is to stay clear of the shadow tree till 40, where you then respec. You basically use the very op talent that gives you + wand damage. Then you should, power word pain and wand mobs down. 
---
Keep in mind that until 60, you can heal any dungeon as any spec, including shadow just fine.
---
Locks are leveling beasts. Orc is the best warlock race. Winner.
---
Good practice for hunter kiting.
---
Not having he effort I put into my character completely invalidated every 3-6 months.
---
There is no way of knowing that. A few lines a code can have big implications. Ex: leeway
---
I’m not sure I leveled a hunter past 39 before bc, but I’ve very strongly considered the class for classic. I don’t see the logic in blizz choices here ,  but overall my opinion is that playstyle will be different and hunters will deal, adapt and move on. None of the issues are a net positive but there are work around in some cases and others you need to grin and bear.
---
I’m looking at the class as a range/melee hybrid now rather than pure range and will build talents accordingly. With freeze trap unreliable engineering is a must have. 
---
FD is a bug according to a blue post and is either currently fixed or on the docket (don’t remember).
---
What’s up with arcane shot?
---
I’ve gone back and forth on leeway. My biggest issue is you need to slow an opponent by 70% to deactivate leeway, hunters can’t slow beyond 50% so it will always be active if you are moving. So how do you effectively kite when someone charges over your freeze trap and keeps on coming? There will have to be new strategies to compensate.
---
Checkout minguasbeef channel on yt, he has two brief vids on hitbox size and leeway that are really relevant for any hunter, particularly taurens.
---
Linking the hitbox/dead zone vid, but click on his account name to view the rest, he only has 3 atm

Someone directed me toward Corossity’s channel, for which I am grateful. This is kinda where I see hunter pvp going in classic.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4gsk4MNn0k
---
There wont be enough demand for anything post wotlk.
---
&gt; "they can't release tbc and wotlk and ignore the rest." 
---
Why is this self evident?
---
I think it's far more likely they just wrote "wow vanilla bis list" into Google tbh.
---
&gt; Classic+ is an abomination. 
---
Retail is already a hundred times the abomination that classic+ could ever possibly become.
---
Disc is a support tree, not a fully fleshed out spec. Both holy and shadow rely heavily on the disc tree, and you’ll be putting a bunch of points into it in either case, but there’s not really a “disc priest” in vanilla.
---
Prices usually got out of hand because of gold farmers, tokens take away the ability/incentive to gold farm.
---
I don't know the numbers and it's a guess but I would hazard to say with Classics gold balance/quests hand outs we are talking 100/1 inflation rates from the regular player base just playing the game and gold farmers flooding the markets. That's how it back in the day at least.
---
Thanks for the unput.  It seems like the only two options for PVE tanking then are Tauren vs Troll.
---
Taurens just seem so bad-ass with their size.  I would chose them purely for aesthetics.
---
Trolls seem out of place for a tank haha, just my personal opinion, but this would be the right choice for min-maxing.  Tough decisions.
---
Gotta go with Joe Rogan podcasts. I get too bored listening to them on their own. Together with wow grinding it works perfectly.
---
Yeah. Everyone getting self-buffs, self-heals, lowering the difficulty on mobs makes the game more of a great combat video game, less of a great multiplayer rpg.
---
I wonder how far people will manage to push day 1 without sleeping. I know that when I die, it will make funny livestreamfails clip as I want to stream it too for my friends at work.
---
&gt; give away all the gold to guildies in need
---
Players are never in *'need'* of gold, they just don't want to take the time/effort to go earn it.  Don't enable them!
---
Always remember: *'Build a man a fire, and he'll be warm for a day. Set a man on fire, and he'll be warm for the rest of his life.'*

Throw some Ds on it - Rich Boy
---
I've been on many semi hardcore guilds on pservers and none of them did this, so I dont think it will be a big problem if it works at all.
---
Can't be dazed if you're backpedaling.
---
Hope they didn't steal my credit card info.
---
Sorry but when I see classic I think leeroy jenkns and -50 dkp, not asmongold and streamer dramas
---
You joke, but I have a friend who didn’t finish his degree because he was playing WoW. He was fine as long as there were classes, but when class finished and all that was left was his final project he never finished it.
---
I won't lie, there are quite a number of bugs that circulate around Hunters, pets included. Hopefully that'll be taken care of soon if not already. They seem quite adamant about it though.
---
Damn, can u read stuff for like 30 minutes, then put it on a 10 hour repeat? Your voice is perfect to put me to bed.
---
I am not a vanilla vet hunter but I agree with you. We will adapt and overcome. 
---
I think that hunters MIGHT get a fix in the first patch or so....or at least I hope so. 
---
Anyway, I am super excited to main a hunter in classic and nothing will stop me!
---
You have a dead zone where you can neither melee nor shoot. So be careful of that.
---
Your pet can run away if you don’t feed it enough. Your pet also has a happiness gauge which affects its dmg. Your pet also has talent points that you spend on spells you buy from your trainer.
---
You need to purchase ammo and keep it in an ammo pouch/quiver, and that bag uses one of your bag slots. We get to carry less than most other classes.
---
Did you try the g600? I've owned most mice and nothing even comes *close* to that bad boy, other brands or even other logitechs.
---
I want this!
---
&gt; but given the likelihood of making a mistake, it's just not worth at all. Even if you succeed to avoid the daze, if you land and end up say 10 degrees off from the direction you initially jumped, your loss of speed will be pretty comparable
---
have you tried gettin gud?
---
I'm sorry but, why not time it so you can complete the full 360? Why go 180 then back. Seems like a water of movement?
---
&gt; Well you knew very well that flying was already in the game when you were crafting your jet packs and that it was a matter of time till you can fly.
---
whether or not i knew something doesnt mean its upsetting... Mechagon was a lot of fun and very cool for the time where you get your jet pack and even before hand.
---
I also was merely trying to enjoy the game, I never really looked to much into unlocking flying until one day i did. It also read "allows flying in kultiras, and zandalzar" never once said nazjatar or mechagon.
---
Im sorry you are having a hard time with this but people can go into things knowning as much as possible and still be dissapointed with how it played out...
---
Exactly this. Many features were welcomed by the playerbase at first because they didn't know better. With time, people noticed why certain features were a terrible idea but it was too late to remove them. As many RPG players that hate the idea of flying mounts in WoW, many other players enjoy the convenience so once the feature is in the game, the box of Pandora has been opened. I only noticed the game becoming more boring over time, it wasn't until I started examining why that was that I realized that things like flying, heirlooms, cross-realm, etc made it so and I think a lot of players would do well to look more closely at how and why they do or don't enjoy a game.
---
I think Blizzard needs the courage to say that it was wrong to add certain features and remove them, like they did with Reforging.
---

---
I'd rather have more min/max guides than more opinions like these.
---
I’ve been thinking a lot (who hasn’t) and I wonder about rep.          
---
             
---
How did it work with mounts? There are discounts for being honoured and some PvP rank, yes? If I want a mount of a different faction than mine, how do I get rep efficiently? Do I just try to get quests from that faction? Is the whole idea even feasible?          
---
           
---
On a related note: Since 50-60 is grindy, is it smart to grind mobs that give rep as well? I’m thinking Timbermaw, for example. Is the human racial a must have?           
---
              
---
I’ve got a few ideas for cool mount combos!

I hope each had their own forums, it was so much fun. Trying to get unique and cool looking avatar and sigs made with your name on it. That’s soooo 2000’s.

Not sure why you're being downvoted so hard.

The excitement is real though....were so close.
---
At least you hit 60 lol
---
Sitting in ironforge inspecting the top players gear.
---
The 180 turn is a basic move for kiting with mage/hunter. So yeah, there is a point.
---
How can you be ready to launch soon, but not be ready for a stress test? Launch day is gonna be a shit show
---
Agreed that you don't need to go full shadow. There really isn't a point until shadow form.
---
Alright, Let's do this!  LEEEEEERoy JINGGGGGGGkins!
---
Why is everyone misspelling click?
---
Op-mouse over macros allow you to do two things better than a keybind. 
---
The first is quickly healing several targets. 
---
When you heal someone with a click you must point your mouse, click on target, cast spell, hover mouse, click next target, cast heal. Mouseover remove the click on target part of the chain saving you time which you could be using to cast. That time adds up and is easily noticed when you start using a macro.
---
Second, it allows you to heal without changing your current target. If you’re dpsing while healing, for example, this is a pretty nice time saver.
---
Please start with Avatar. All are amazing but Avatar is a classic that you have to pay your respects to.
---
The difference here is such minutiae that it doesn’t matter. Wand spec things die faster so you need to cast less, spirit tap you can cast more before needing to drink. Either way is fine. Honestly everything you do after these 10 points barely matters as well.
---
Will do for pvp.
---
They have some experience for sure... A lot of them were not good experiences, but experiences none the less
---
I don't think I've ever seen [someone with 100% kindness before](https://imgur.com/zp1uFfy), you really are /u/TheNicestFellow. But no one can read anything you write, so maybe they just feel sorry for you. ;-)
---
&gt;Why is everyone misspelling click?
---
The clique thing? It's an addon. Lets you bind spells to your mouse buttons. So you cast spell, say greater heal when you LBM click someone on your raidframe. Cast flash heal on RBM. Cast a lower rank Gheal on shift+LBM. I'm relatively sure you don't even change your target when you cast, or can set it up like that.
---
I was always told the increased healing from improved drain life was too low to be worth the talent points.
---
It was Elenfoiro and his wife Snowflake. I played in Untold Prophecy char name was Zubdub

Casters are not tanky even if as a warlock with that build you will still die quickly in comparison to other sturdier classes.

If your build is end game your shorting your self some considerable dps.

i dont understand this, we should have lower quality fantasy universes so suicidal people can mimic the real world in them? wouldn't suicidal people want to get away from the real world and be immersed in azeroth, not reminded of what they're missing out on?
---
Clique just does mouseover macros and whoever says that mouseover macros are better than clique is an idiot because its literally the same except you dont have to write the macro yourself or copy it from a website
---
I would argue there is not once the end result is the same. The other faction is salty AF.
---
People just look for any reason to shit on Blizzard, and assume that they have no idea how to make a game at this point.
---
I think a lot of people are taking time off around the release date so they've already made plans, and can't wait to stir up a shit storm if the game gets delayed a bit.
---
Not worried about this at all, surely won't work in Classic
---
Because then you're constantly flicking your mouse all the way across your desk and having to reset it.

I remember seeing you around! Was an alliance mage but I still recall your character. This whole thread is a trip.
---
I don't begrudge anyone who wants to min/max or get to their epic mount or lvl 60 as fast and optimally as they can. I'm glad folks get their enjoyment playing the game this way.
---
I just want to enjoy the journey, explore suboptimal leveling areas, get into some world pvp along the way, and take my time. WoW classic will be my unwind time after the little one is in bed. I doubt I'll ever dive into raiding or climb the pvp ladders. It's freeing for me to not feel obligated to optimize.
---
A man of the people. Good info in the vid btw
---
Discord doesn't even have my real name nor any of my real information.
---
Except you won't be popping Blood Fury in some fights because you gut your healing by 50% and healers will be wasting mana trying to keep you from dying to AOE.
---
UD and Human zones both have good story lines, are linear but with lots of interesting terrain and nooks to explore, but without crazy travel times (human is worse than ud) a lot,of resource nodes and apparently I like forests. 
---
My least favorite spot is orc/troll. It’s oppressively bleak, tons of travel, weak on resources initially, and pretty dull. I really dread that place,

In the "not a bug" blizzard thread, players reported that troll racial berserking actually gives 43% ias/cast speed instead of the listed 30 at 40% health or lower when activated.
---
Blizzard confirmed this is working as intended as its works the same way on the 1.12 reference client.
---
Dungeons that aren't just "walk down a hallway" simulators.
---
I saw a big post long ago about a massive RP-PvP event that took place on an RP realm, not an RP-PvP server. Basically MoP was launching soon, and some players want to play out their own version of the Siege of Theramore. When I played on an RP realm for a while, I kept my PvP flag on, and found others who did to. Got into a good amount of fights.
---
Now I still prefer PvP servers, but don't expect there to be no WPvP on PvE servers. I think we need to get rid of the notion that PvP servers are for PvPers in a broad sense. PvP servers are for a specific subset of PvPers who want a less controllable environment. You can be on a PvE realm and still love PvP, especially BGs and duels.
---
Yeah this makes sense. Points in spirit tap until you get a wand then max wand damage before going back to shadow
---
Yeah my first server on launch day was a PvE server and there was plenty of PvP. Southshore/Tarren Mill in Hillsbrad was full of flagged players fighting non-stop. Back then people would go on the Blizzard realm-specific forum to organize PvP times for both factions to meet and go at it  (I.e. you play on the Garona server, on WoW’s website they had a list of forums named after each realm where people from those realms would go to recruit for guilds, try to arrange trades, talk, etc.) 
---
The one thing you miss out on playing on a PvE server is ganking players headed to MC/BWL in Blackrock Mountain. That’s a fun pretty much guaranteed way to get some world PvP in against other 60s. 
---
I’m gonna try to get as many of my friends on the same server as I can and it doesn’t matter to me if it’s a PvE or PvP server. “PvP” while you’re leveling is 90% unwinnable fights. Either you gank a player 6 levels below you and waste your own time to waste someone else’s time, or someone does that to you. Sucks leveling alts on PvP servers too since there’s never a shortage of level 60 players ganking and corpse camping level 30 players in contested zones
---
Hunter was my first class in vanilla, and I can tell you that I wish I had waited to play hunter until after I had a firmer grasp on how the game works. Playing a hunter solo is very different from playing a hunter in a group. Hunters can equip lots of gear that they really shouldn't be using. Their DPS isn't amazing, even when playing optimally in a raid setting, and if you don't have a basic understanding of how to thread shots or kite, your usefulness drops significantly. 
---
Basically, while you can easily be a mediocre hunter that gets by, you have to work harder to be a good player than other classes.
---
That was coordinated guild runs. From experience, a pug will have a much, much harder time with that.
---

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Tl;dr
---
They arent hard, but the ones topping the dps meters get the gear, and world buffs pretty much guarantee you'll be topping the meters if no one else is using them
---
I go PvE because I get to play the game how I want it, when I want it.  Forget PvP servers; there's nothing more alpha than having ultimate control.
---
Honestly you will be better off min max another character then using the your max account to power level your warrior and provide enchants and weapon which will increase leveling speed.
---
OR
---
Find a friend with similar playtimes with you in this forum who will be a priest and of the same faction. Just make sure you don’t powerwordshield a warrior as a priest.
---
You can funnel all the cloth to one person who can craft bags for everyone.
---
No. That's not how it works at all.  Ok let me try it simplify this for you.
---
Alright the original trap duration is 20 seconds. Because of heart beat resists this trap is going to last 15 seconds. Heart beat resists are designed so that you sit in those long cc on average for 15 sec even though the duration says 20 seconds. 
---
So if we scatter shot the target first this is going to reduce that 20 second duration by 50 % which is 10 seconds.  
---
Right that's easy to understand I'm sure you get that.  
---
Now lets add in clever traps. So what does clever traps do?  
---
 Increases the duration of Freezing and Frost trap effects by 30% and the damage of Immolation and Explosive trap effects by 30%.   
---
If the base duration of the trap is 20 seconds and we increase 20 seconds by 30%.  
---
To calculate this we do 0.30 (20) = 6 . That's taking 30 % of 20 which is 6. We then add this 6 to the original duration because its an increase 20 + 6 = 26. That's 26 seconds. So with this talent we have a 26 second freezing trap.  
---
Ok so now if we trap someone with no DR it's going to be 26 seconds. If we scatter the target DR'ing it by 50 % we now have 13 seconds.   
---
He's not switching numbers just doing math hope this helped.
---
Fighting lower level mobs is not very efficient because there's a huge xp penalty for every level they're below you.
---
Even using an Intel processor is spyware. There is very little chance you can avoid anything unless you go full schizo and build everything from scratch.
---
would also love to know
---
World buffs aren't to clear the content, they're to top the meters so you get the gear over those who arent using the buffs.
---
Spend it on women and booze
---
Level as arms and try to get a solid two-hander for questing, with a 1 handed and shield for tanking. You'll be fine.
---
Dude you are such an obvious troll with all your posts.
---
Private servers knew you got 3 hit, just not tgat 5vweapon skill had that special condition, so the formulas were wrong but the final result was quite similar. But this makes 305 skill much better than 304. Its a nerf to Maladath on non human. Also, the cap for glancing blow reduction is only 308. So no need to stack weap skill, humans won't wear edgemasters over devilsaur, various implications from this. Getting 308 perfectly from two Anubisath WarHammers is nice
---
Haha oh yeah now that makes sense, I guess just to break it down into a per level basis.
---
Do you have a source for that? That would effectively lower the cap by 3 from vanilla on most toons.

It’s still catchup gear, because when it released it meant you could just invest time to do those rather than progress through tier 0. It’s just not free loot like how you get heroic raiding level gear for killing 8 bears.
---
I can second this. Yeah, if mind flay did that spriests would be pretty rediculous in pvp.
---
Bellends on both sides my friend
---
first go 5/5 wand spec in discipline, try to get an enchanter to give/sell u a lesser magic wand as soon as possible. you only need to be lvl 5 to equip and it will last you until lvl 15 or so, over time keep upgrading you wand as you get upgrades. after getting 5 pts in wand you want to go 5/5 blackout in shadow then 2 pts into imp. shadow word pain. from here put most of your points into shadow until you get shadowform (skip useless things like mind flay), then put the rest into discipline. once you hit 60 respec to a typical healer build. your rotation is basically, shield yourself, shadow word pain a target, wand it down, mind blast on cooldown, repeat.
---
Healing threat is half of damage threat. It also is only accounted for actual health healed, not overheating.
---
Would still be good in some situations, but it's not good enough. Also the main reason warrior's are so good is because of Shield Block negating crushing blows. Druids are known as the only real backup tank due to their high amor and health negating some of these crushing blows, and they mainly only tank adds.
---
Man if that's the case that's a bug and needs to be fixed #nochanges be damned.
---
There is no good version!!!!!!!
---
Tell yourself what you want champ.
---
I can relate.  I mean, I didn't actually fail any classes because of WoW, but I've procrastinated taking them and finishing.  I hasn't really hurt me and my military career yet, but I'll have to get out eventually, and I should have had it done by now.  Now I got a wife and kids, so that makes it harder to do than it was before.
---
I was going to complain about the music being too loud but then I realized it aligned into more of a spoken word song. Not sure if that was intentional or not.
---
The private server ones aren't gonna be any better. Pretty much all private server leveling guides will be wrong since mobs having different/more abilities, act differently and have different values. Joana's is probably the best true vanilla guide out there.
---
Timezones. Based on what one you live in Walters the time and for some the date. But In reality the exact moment will be the same around the world
---
I would think most would be rolling a Gnome because its "best for alliance mage".. So rolling human mage wouldn't be that common?
---
I think most people are missing the point.

Why force people to make an account for something like this when an image album can do the same thing?

Post NAXX content should be a new MMO with similar social and community experience to Classic.

At some point this will make more financial sense than pulling stunt (free level 110 with BfA) after stunt (WoW Classic) to get subscribers back.
---
Stealthassn was his name
---
And the shit talking @ threads on the server forums.  Without server forums, WoW is nothing.
---
Site ranks _every_ item in-game with different weighted values tailored after your race, class and spec so it isn't just a "bis list". You can also filter out quest items/raids/pvp/rep etc, there might be a big ass spreadsheet out there where you can do the same without registering, but lifes too short for most people.
---
Fair, slight correction : your wow posts are trolling  for the most part. 
---
So much negativity or baiting, the McDonald's shit, wows probably bad because X style posts, this post itself is absolute garbage if the lowest tier.
---
Even if you didn't have anything else on your whole profile this thread takes the cake for biggest steaming load.
---
True, but this is from their more popular games than WoW. Take Micro transactions out of Overwatch or Call of Duty and you could carve out a huge chunk of revenue, but removing it only from WoW and trading it for 5+ million concurrent subs is a good trade off.
---
Wouldn't it be easier to know a head of character creation? I mean if there's 10 people wanting to play together and they don't have a list of realms before they try to create their characters they run the risk of picking the wrong server... Unless server choice comes after character creation which I didn't think was the case..
---
Possibly. Spell damage gear would probably give more bang for the buck than 2 talent points that could be better spent deeper in the tree.
---
Look at the context of this particular discussion
---
Just take your regular Ret talents. Get Divine Strength and Imp. Seal of Righteousness, Respec for Seal of Command at 22, go all the way down, then put 10 points in Prot and 10 points in Holy.
---
You don't care about competing for gear. Most of what you level with are quest rewards.
---
That  100% mount you won’t be able to get until stage 2 when DM releases; plus the mats that it will cost you for the mount is somewhere around 500-600G that is on the cheaper side. So almost the cost of an epic mount but you have to wait longer.

I think a good solution to poor flight Paths is maybe, get Some sort of rental license where you can rent a bird to the big town in each zone.

So no self controlled mounts.

But rather one from any capital to any big quest hub, available from lvl 60.

Why

Was gonna pick a female human or night elf for animations anyways so I legit might do this and watch netflix. catch me at your local mailbox in IF /dancing while I catch up with one punch man

Killing the NPCs and camping the wrstfall tower is one and the sane as killing barrens NPCs and camping that wooden tower. Expect it to happen and have a game plan to deal with it.

Hell I'd be disappointed if such conflict didn't happen in classic. Its a huge part of the game IMO.

Can anyone confirm questing in Dun Morogh at level 18 after Elwynn is a good strategy?
---
I hope 7 will be handled one day in the future. The most fun part about vanilla was the endless tweaking/rebalancing of classes. EVery class got their few months of hype.
---
If Blizzard really goes for #nochanges, they should keep doing little tweaks in talents/abilities/dps output of classes. It would make vanilla classic quite dynamic imo.
---
I'm hearing the feedback on this loud and clear. It's just a good chunk of effort to support saving things both locally and on the back-end. I think the better experience is having it saved properly, so that's what I did first. Providing full functionality without an account is the next thing I'm tackling. Hang tight and hopefully you'll be able to do this in the next week or so.

I don't blame people at all for being concerned with privacy. If my privacy policy raises red flags, that's my fault for putting the policy together poorly. I'm working on some revisions there as well.

This is the problem though, you have people parroting shit like "well worked that way in vanilla."

Those people are why we can't have nice things.

Damage, interrupting if you're a shaman, keeping fairy fire up if you are a druid. In raids its not a big deal, at first you cant do damage because mana but later on you should if you know you have plenty of mana for the fight and dont have to be healing every single second. And in 5 mans thats pretty much what differentiates a good from a great healer. As an example with druids, mana is probably not gonna be a concern in 5 mans and i dont need to heal every single second so i will keep fairy fire and moonfire up on the target 100% of the time and if i have time for more i'll do even more damage with other stuff
---
I'm in that boat, we have a group of ˜15.

I'm sure it's just a meme name they've given and it will just equip your character with an 'average' set of epics/blues fit for the raid you're testing ;-)

I've finally figured out how to work TSM a few expansions ago (plus the new version is a lot easier to use with default settings). Yet I'll be content with Auctionator or Auctioneer. I really just need something that can gauge a decent selling price, without me having to track the prices over time or something manually. I don't need advanced AH flipping tools or anything.

oh that's nothing new. That's the reaction to the phrase 'crime-servers' as both active and former private server players hate it when you remind them about the criminal nature of those servers for both users and operators.
---
I was referring to WoW specifically. Obviously if they hemorrhage subs, that's a bad thing, but they make a huge portion of their profit from whales in the shop.

I hated running into SL as a Hunter. They were too damn tanky to beat before their DoTs destroyed me :(

I would love the meeting stones to be something like this. I am against teleportation to any dungeons though. I would still want people to have to run to the dungeons. There would be people hanging outside of the dungeons all the time too.
---
What law are users breaking?
---
On a PvE server you will never give up control of what you are going to do with your character to another player.  Want to quest?  Run into  blackrock mountain to do an instance?  No problem.  You'll be able to do your Nesingwary quests or run to popular instances in peace.  No longer will you be stuck waiting in an instance for a half hour while your groupmate tries to break through the horde blockade.
---
Plus verigans fist lasts forever.
---
I prefer a raid frame UI like vuhdo with mouseover built in.
---
I don't like mouse over macros because then you have to make sure your mouse never hovers over someone by accident or you have to exclusively heal by mouse over.
---
Awesome
---
Mouseover macros are insane for rogues. You can create a mouseover macros for abilities that don't generate a new combo point. So like blind and kick. This will let you retain the combo points on your target, while also cc'ing a secondary or third target, since you don't have to retarget the player or mob, thus not losing your cp.
---
A warlock classic leveling guide that suggestions that warlocks not buy all abilities so they can afford their mount...kinda sketch.

Drama time with preach :p

I’m bringing back my old playlist I had while playing vanilla. All screamo! (Tears don’t fall, atreyu etc.)

But I’ll probably listen to the ingame music the first time leveling.

to add to your list, might I recommend 'gurren lagan', 'houseki no kuni', and perhaps 'black clover' if you want a longer 'modern' anime [stick through the first few epis, gets better].
---
No, my WoW posts aren't trolling at all. All of my topics have been discussions except for the joke topic I made about the #nochanges crew, which was a was funny video. If you're not laughing, it's because you're sensitive and, possibly, autistic like most of the #nochanges peeps. It is a FACT that this forum is ungodly toxic.  Can you not see your own post? Literally re-read your posts here. You have offered nothing to the discussion. No counter-argument, no valid points, just insults that even a middle-schooler would think are cringeworthy. You are the troll--and not even a good one. I can only imagine what a person like you must look like in real life. 
---
I will look forward to camping your corpse in Classic.
---
A lot of those are raid recipes and you meant Bottomless Bags.
---
Well as a Warrior you have no choice lol
---
Is that... really how you wanna spend your time?
---
In game voice has been a thing since burning Crusade. It's just not that great and not overly used since there's stuff like Discord, Skype, raidcall, mumble, vent, teamspeak, etc.
---
Sorry I meant to explain further but was in a rush. Didn’t mean to leave you hanging like that.
---
If you’re using the priest for a healbot, he has to level along with you. So just to break even you need to kill things twice as fast/efficiently with your warrior. It’s not impossible to accomplish say 220-240%% efficiency over solo warrior, especially if the priest is helping dps and last hitting for spirit tap, but you’d have to be a master multiboxer and it would be taxing.
---
You could leave him out of your group and get huge gains on the solo warrior, but then he’ll need to level on his own somehow.
---
Haha they were from Azgalor but left for Scilla due to server issues. The guild everyone wanted to be in on Azgalor was Zissou (including while brethren was still on the server).
---
Aye could well just be a bit stiffer than others but I love it haha.
---
Honestly can't praise it enough.
---
from as long as i can remember EO has always been the #1.
---
PI isn't worth nearly as much early on. Casters don't do as much damage, and the healing talents from Holy are worth way more for healing than going down the disc tree for PI. When casters start getting into late BWL and AQ is when you want to make the transition because their damage starts ramping up and your healing starts to be less reliant on talents.
---
You can solo it as warlock too
---
You're gonna have to leave your friends and gf and roll pvp

Also sich in einen Faden zu nem komplett anderem Thema sich zu organisieren wäre wahrscheinlich ziemlich unpraktisch.

Gnomes are better but look like complete garbage (worst models in the game even with gear) so if you can't stand them then go Human no doubt.

Neee danke ich spiel lieber auf englischen Servern für Abwechslung und um das ganze rum geheule über loot etc auf deutsch nicht ertragen zumüsen. Deutsche wow community ist wirklich Aids.

As someone who switched from MOM to Clique in WotLK, it definitely is worth it.  Clique only requires one hand to effectively heal, which makes it a lot easier to manage things like movement or your action bar.
---
It also saves a ton of action bar space.
---
I zoned into Naxx the night before WotLK release. Logged in on WotLK release infinitely falling. A GM had to get me out.
---
Clique is less actions than mouse-over macros.
---
Ropetown (Horde) or Sparkle Motion (Alliance) on Executus
---
The upper range is closer to 40% according to the beta. And yes it helps you build rage more quickly from zero which is super helpful for snagging that early threat. At the end of the day it's just a racial and not going to make or break the encounter.
---
You can do that with Clique too.
---
I think PvP servers are slightly overrated and better on paper than practice, as usually PvP isn't all-out wars but rather cheap shots and skirmishes, but I guess it depends if you want a server where you're in danger at most times vs. choosing when to put yourself at risk. If you have very little free time to play and just want to progress, PvE might be better.
---
I played hunter in Vanilla until TBC release. I love the class but I'll be moving on this time around. Reasons being:
---
1. Pet AI/Lag. Too many issues reared their head during beta. I played in BFA and noticed some unfun lag with Warlock pets as well so I'm willing to bet it's a client problem and not a Vanilla problem. 
---
2. FD issues. I don't care about the SS/FT diminishing returns stuff but Feign death has to respond really well in pvp and pve as it's something I used all the time. 
---
3. Huntard Meme. Make one mistake, hunters are shit. Play consistently well, wow you're not a retard thats amazing bro. This kind of chirping in pugs was annoying. Made me play mostly in guild runs and with friends rather than meet new people which I always enjoy. 
---
4. Scaling. I've heard polar opposites on this topic but I remember feeling on top of the world during BWL content. Afterwards some of my caster friends felt like they grew into monsters and I eventually started to feel as though I was getting weaker. I think Rogues and Fury warriors were still figuring out the best item kits/enchants but when they did suddenly they felt like monsters too. Pvp started to be less fun when people could just soak your damage and kiting and still kill you. Hunters had a great time during MC/BWL and felt super strong. IMO after this we were still strong, we just lost that top tier feel and as more time went by the margin for error in PVP got pretty slim. 
---
This is a very subjective topic since WoW and games in general are about fun. I think if you have fun playing hunters all the stuff I'm talking about doesn't matter. Hunter was a lot of fun and I'll miss the class, hell I might even level it as an alt. However I think I'm ready to start a new chapter and have a fresh Vanilla experience rather than try to recreate the glory days. I can't wait to see you all out there and I couldn't be happier that we get to re-visit an untarnished Azeroth again.

There is a difference between farming trash at the start of the raid before you are saved to an id and abusing something to cause trash to instantly respawn. That trash usually takes hours to respawn and you can't get to it without getting saved so you can't just reset the instance to respawn it.
---
Is all it takes one guy toggling on PVP in BRM as bait to start some stuff?
---
None of the BoP items I listed are raid recipes.

I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Without gear scaling there can't be linear raid progression, everyone would just do the current content and skip all previous tiers, like they do in retail. The only way to prevent it would be the TBC style raid attunements, and they were terrible.
---
Clique is an addon that is basically mouseover macros on steroids.
---
I haven’t played on Aggramar since 2005/2006 but OOTR was the guild to be in back then
---
Having to do things twice, such as picking up and turning in quests and quest items, adds up to a lot of time from 1-60. It would be much faster to level first aid and cook/buy food on your warrior, or just find people to level with. It is an MMO, after all!

All the trash leading down to her respawns when you pull. You could maybe go back and clear after engaging ony if you really wanted to run out though

I think the main thing about the post was for healers.  I use MOM as a DPS, but I use clique as a healer.
---
Yes. Help your wife more. If breastfeeding, yea the kid doesn't need you as much, but you have a great chance to help your wife out.
---
Ya, friend is a new dad too. So he'll probably have to put me on follow for long runs to check in. May skip the talent altogether now that I think of it.
---
I recommend something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMhoZfxt0bbqZxM) and fill out the remaining points however you want. Prioritize shadow talents first. This will be a little slower than full shadow but more sustain and healing flexibility. Most of your damage will come through your wand, and if played right you'll have almost zero downtime
---
You can mouseover their unit frame, too.  I agree that Clique &gt; Mouseover, but the reason you listed is not one of them.
---
Seeing as I am getting upvoted and others downvoted, it must mean that I am clear enough and people possess basic reading comprehension.
---
Well then, that's awesome news for me as I am one of the few dozen people who actually love playing trolls!
---
&lt;Influence&gt; on Gorgonnash. They were a split off of the paladin MT Andorhal from the guild that I was previously in and they brought all the competent/intelligent players with them. Immediately climbed to top 5 on the server within 3 months of forming and were always at the top of progression after that.
---
yeah maybe later in the release but the starting areas are gonna be packed

Kudos to that

Interestingly, war mode has made me appreciate world pvp, but I'm pretty sure that's *exclusively* for the bonuses alliance gets from war mode. Getting attacked for no reason and fighting over a world quest for 20 minutes is the reason it's the frustrating thing in the game. 
---
So without the bonus, which is what classic pvp is going to be, I'm giving it a big 'ol "fuck that".
---
I think most of the people who say mouseover is better than clique, think "clique" is a mispelling of "click" and don't understand that it's an addon.

I’ve read that the 5% is off of base stats only, which according to this thread does not seem to be the case. If the 5% is off of total hp or stam then I’d say tauren and orc are interchangeable depending on the tier with tauren ending up better (thunderfury) but orcs being better where axes are good. Trolls are still king though for tanking because tps/survivability

I am going to be rolling horde with some friends and the two people that I will probably play the most with are going Shadow Priest and a Warrior. I was wondering what support class would be the most beneficial for the three of us when running around in the open world PVPing? I generally always play supports in games because I love helping my team mates reach their full potentials and keeping them alive. I know on alliance I would probably go paladin, but I am not sure what to do for Horde.

Ofcourse it's in the rules and I'm not forbidding it. It's a shitty thing just like getting camp ganked is shitty. That's the joys of wpvp and I ain't knocking it at all. One man's yum is another man's yuck as you say. 
---
I remember the keeshan escort in Redbridge being a tasty target for rogues.....the bastards lmao.
---
I played on Uldum on the Horde side way back in 2005-2006. I was part of a fun and friendly guild called Dark Faction and we raided but never made any serious progression. I always looked up to Eighty Eight Raiders, seemed like they were crushing content and the guys standing around Org were always rocking the sickest gear.
---
Wouldn't you still get spirit tap?
---
Both are a significant advantage, if only to reduce the amount your fingers have to work.
---
Farming elite demons like this is hot.
---
Think south winterspring (hederine) or dire maul
---
I wouldn't mind them making changes to these features so it would FEEL like Vanilla, instead of technically being a mirror of Vanilla.
---
It has all the things you want so everyone must like it right?
---
This is one of the main reasons I’m going PvE. Don’t need that bullshit when trying to farm gold.
---
Have you healed molten core before? It's not a challenge by any stretch of the imagination. Top guilds will all run PI for the first week. Holy is easily inferior to discipline for 90% of the 40man content.
---
Community, buffing random people, trading with random people, grouping up with random people.
---
I was one of the fools that praised and defended LFR/LFD because it meant not spamming “LFM for [raid/dungeon]” in /2 for hours.  I was wrong.  I was sofa king wrong.  LFR and LFD completely stripped all the soul from WoW.
---
not getting any data I care about. Fake gmail.
---
That is true as well, but onyxia actually does have a teleport mechanic where get placed back if you are outside of the room.
---
I actually have the exact same conflict and am leaning towards Warrior (it's the best class in the game followed by Mage/Rogue) and also Warlock. It depends what you want, as you state raiding is your ultimate goal then Hunter is not a good choice you are better off going with the 3 most over powered pve clasesses in Warrior, Mage or Rogue if you want to be competitive at all. Many will tell you meters are not what Vanilla raiding is all about etc etc but people play the game for different reasons.
---
You sound like such a pleasant person.
---
Im really pulling for them to do something different as long as they dont hurt the game. There is a reason people wanted classic.
---
I wouldnt mind a few number changes and small little re works to make class specs more viable. After all that was what made wow the good game it was. It was constantly changing and making things better. Then of course with cata everything turned into a shit show.
---
One qof change i wouldnt mind is dual talent or atleast make it more affordable to change specs.
---
tranq is like required for one of the bwl bosses and you need 2 as the enrage is on a cooldown thats 1/2 of the cd of tranq shot
---
But your heals are garbage and you're going to go OOM very quickly.  
---
Disc brings almost nothing to the table in terms of healing.  You miss the crit talents, the 15% cost reduction, and the .5s speed on healing.  
---
Disc brings so little to the table, just a single DPS cooldown for another player and marginally more mana. 
---
A 0/20/31 priest would be far better at healing, for example.
---
Idk why you’re being downvoted so much. You’re right lol.
---
&gt; not buy all abilities so they can afford their mount...kinda sketch.
---
This is a very common trick for leveling on **all** classes though. Just focus on buying your important level spells only till 40 &gt; buy mount with saved money &gt; then. Buy any spells you skipped on.
---
This makes being able to buy you mount right at 40 much much easier for all classes.
---
Amazing u should do other stuff 2 like logos and whatever
---
Just open your mouth and they will avoid you like the plague.
---
FD is fixed
---
Wraith blade + left eye is 121 damage, 2% hit and 2% crit
---
Atiesh is 150 damage, 2% hit and 2% crit to your party (including yourself)
---
How is atiesh not bis again?
---
This is what happens when the game isn't released yet.
---
Vicious Cycle
---
Where you at stoo you coming back? Msg me
---
I know. That is exactly the point of my post :p
---
Would love this for Alliance, truly awesome guide!
---
Not you, the first guy
---
Both save an insignificant amount of time in raiding.
---
What about an "expansion" in-between classic and TBC. Level 65 level cap, alternate timeline sort of thing and opening up those zones/dungeons that never got used? Or just leaving the level cap @ 60 and adding the zones/dungeons?
---
Going to say something different from everyone else.  You have a few options available.  Ret is the fastest, yes, but it isn't that much faster than Holy, especially if you have someone else doing damage as well.  
---
What I would personally do is go down Ret until level 20 or 22, and then go holy.  This way, you get Seal of Command (your biggest damage source) and possibly Pursuit of Justice, then you get the healing talents.
---
Element on ally
---
Rejects on horde
---
If it’s anything like BFA, I may actually just not even get it.  Currently I have no plans to ever return to retail.  That may all change eventually, sure.  But my present state of mind is that I will never touch retail again unless there are some major reworks to all the classes and world experience.
---
Go back to 4chan
---
Lol you won’t need to worry about any of that, people will avoid ignorant people like you. 😂
---
How do you avoid the Reddit dunces?
---
I dont really get this one, I cant exactly say my girlfriend brings me misery? Why would classic wow make it worse? Peter Griffin can you help me
---
Flasks as in applied weapon ones or the one you drink? 
---
Cause you can use the drink ones and poisons at the same time.
---
This is unironically how most people recruit for mythic pugs.
---
The coolest Horde guild on Malygos was &lt;Hell&gt;, for obvious reasons. They were one of, I think, three progression raiding guilds on the server. The other two were maybe Invictus and Severed both on the Alliance side (but I didn't play Alliance). Sometimes there'd be another guild or two raiding current content, but they never lasted or made much of an impression. Most other raiding guilds kind of meandered in low tiers then fell apart.
---
&lt;Hell&gt; had all the usual trappings: they were the only guys in Orgrimmar with serious epics. They had their own website and you had to fill out a serious application. I actually was friends with a druid from Hell, who'd tank dungeons for a couple of friends, and I thought I was hot shit by proxy. 
---
I did eventually get into Veterans of the Phoenix a few months before TBC dropped. We couldn't complete ZG and got only a few bosses down in MC, and that was \*after\* AQ was open. That was considered decent at the time, so you can appreciate &lt;Hell&gt; going around in AQ gear was a big deal.
---
To my surprise, a cursory Google search shows that all those guilds are still active.
---
Blood fury gives you ap based on any ap given by stats, it doesn't include things like battle shout. It will give you roughly 100 ap at 60 naked.
---
Use this priest leveling guide: [https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=31668&amp;sid=1457032d46c2ba262a2becbb14a3d0c4](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=31668&amp;sid=1457032d46c2ba262a2becbb14a3d0c4)
---
No need to add anything else.
---
Ya man I've never ever looked at the talent trees. I definitely didn't read the part where it says "if the target is killed by you while you drain its soul". Definitely not. 
---
The funny thing about this? Some talents didn't work in vanilla. They just didn't program them, and later admitted they hadn't.
---
Trying to remember if Moonlight Dancers was the lead Alliance progression guild on Stomescale or just the one that was less asshole-ish.  
---
Horde side ended up having an entire raiding/pvp guild jump to the server around AQ's launch, called Juice / J U I C E. Some alliance guys made a low geared zerg guild to counter them called Milk/ M I L K.
---
Thinking... fastest speed leveler time can have a group of 5 friends (preferably one warlock for summons) speed level in dungeons in parallel with him so the solo quester can take advantage of a super fast run through gor quests xp and gear?
---
Standard, i used SantaUI\_Textures\_1.4.1 but iam not sure is modifying the unitbars
---
The only thing you really miss is inspiration. Every other talent in the holy tree just makes an easy job already easier. With gear, your healing is fine. Yeah Mana will be an issue early on but it improves vastly with t2. Your shields and poh are the same. It's worth it
---
I think that’s pretty accurate.  I originally leveled on a PvE because I was new and I didn’t want people messing with me while I was trying to figure the game out.  This time I’m going PvP.
---
I felt like the point of your post was how nice it would be to have a physical release. Which is why I was stating how a physical release today would differ from the original physical releases in the past. If I misunderstood you there, my bad.
---
My vanilla server was an RPPvE if I remember correctly, good people and no crazy character names was what I remember.     
---
RP was done Sunday nights in starting areas like Brill and Goldshire but wasn’t wide spread at all.     
---
Man would pvp severs bitch and bitch when AV went cross realm lol but most realized that we were just super team players in the end. 
---
Man I wish I could remember the name of it, had a great time as a pvp pve priest heals.
---
Yes and no. Retail *is* an abomination, but that is precisely how classic+ would end up because we all know Blizzard refuses to learn from their mistakes. People have been complaining about the same shit for 9 years on retail, yet Blizzard continues to ignore peoples' protests and keeps strolling down the same road. Every single person has some different opinion about what ruined the old wow: put them all together and essentially any change you can possibly make will hurt the game. The only answer is to leave Classic it how it is, the way we wanted it to be, the way we begged Blizz for years upon years to implement it. I'm not saying vanilla wow is perfect, what I'm saying is that Blizz isn't capable of making it better, they *will* blow it if they try.
---
Bit off topic, but how certain are you that mana regen in combat is zero by default?
---
This was my understanding as well. When casting, mana regen is zero unless you have gear with MP5 on it. I couldn't help but notice  [https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/druid/night-elf](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/druid/night-elf) grants a level 60 naked druid 22 MP5.
---
This value doesn't line up with the 5 second rule outlined  [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview#spirit](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview#spirit) \[((110 Spi/5 +15)/2)\*5\] and I am unsure how this 22 MP5 is being calculated. I am unsure if the planner has a bug or there is an class MP5 value/calculation I am unaware of.
---
Notably the 60 Orc hunter has 15 MP5 with 73 spirit while the others only have 14 MP5 with 72-69 spirit(I assume thats the correlation at least).
---
\~Thanks in advance
---
But as soon as you strafe or turn around the enemy gets 2.66 yards of additional range, which is often enough to hit you.
---
Probably a lot of lil pump! Eskeeeetit!!
---
I can't speak for hardcore guilds, but us normal people don't usually raid in guilds that award loot based on dps meter performance.
---
Shit I didn't even consider that.  I've gotten late starts on the past two pservers I've played on and DM was already in the game by the time I got to my 50s.  My bad!!
---
Draenor-EU [A]: Passion, Ivory Heart, Shinasu and maybe Diversus Eminor.
---
I wont ignore them unless they are deliberately trolling or being abusive. I plan to treat them like any other player and group with them if they need to and buff them if I run past them - all the stuff you'd expect from classic. They will stay if they like it and if they leave that is fine as well. 
---
No excuses in STV though.
---
I understand you. Physical releases ARE nicer. But yeah its the nostalgia for me. Driving through the rain on my bike with just enough money i saved how i describe in my post vs ordering a game i dont like anymore (retail) on the internet
---
You don't use shields in raids, and your PoH will have 20% smaller radius.
---
If you're arguing you don't need any healing talents to heal I stand by my statement, but I think that's optimistic.
---
&gt; The price to respec rises each time you do it
---
This is why people say respec is expensive. First respec is just 1g, and you'll have some 100-300 by 60.
---
WF works like that....   You hit with your weapon dmg + Atk power/14 * atk speed normalization.  I think it's 3.3 for 2h?
---
Private servers, where values have been shown through the beta to overestimate incoming damage. Healing in vanilla is not a challenge, hate to break it to you. Just because I was 10 years old in 2005 doesn't mean I can't see what is staring me in the face
---
Glycemic Index?
---
Yea, the original poster who claimed 3% crit has admitted he was wrong about it already.
---
Leeway gives monsters or players 2.66 yards of range when they're both moving.  Afaik back pedaling does not count.  Normal melee range is 5 yards, so it's over 50% Further if you strafe or run away.  That's the benefit of backpedaling, e.g. When an enemy is slowed.
---
Yeah he's got me scratching my head as well. He must mean weapon oils.
---
Int, your dmg matters a lot less with a warrior there too, and running oom less will help.
---
I think TBC and Wrath is the way to go. It’s by far the most cost effective route. Especially compared to Vanilla, BC is easier to accomplish than entirely new content with R&amp;D. 
---
Secondly, I think people think that you can just *keep adding and keep adding and keep adding*, without any consequences. OSRS is a sandbox game and works better with this trend, but in WoW, the game experience will get too cluttered. Imagine a new raid every 6 months, for 5 years... The game would be a mess. 
---
Again, that being said, I’m fine with *small amounts of content* being used to SUPPLEMENT the original game... not wash over it. 
---
But that doesn’t exclude the possibility of TBC and Wrath. It will fracture the populations, but merges are in the future of Classic, NO MATTER WHAT. You won’t be having 20 servers in 2030 thriving on Classic, and not releasing a game to avoid the spooky word “server merge” is not in the best interest for the game. If people want TBC in 2024 and it’s not there, they’ll unsub to Classic. You can’t keep people hostage in one game by not releasing another.
---
So I’m 80% in the no 1.14 camp, and 100% in the tbc camp. TBC has no real downsides, while 1.14 has many, but could still be executed tastefully.
---
&gt;Though I'd love to play TBC, it's a very slippery slope. That means in 2025 we'll be playing Cataclysm? And later WoD? BfA?
---
I don't see where this slippery slope-esque logic comes from, and it comes up a lot on this sub.
---
Where does it end if they release TBC? Probably at WotLK. Why? Quite simple - this is when the game started bleeding.
---
TBC was more popular than Vanilla, and WotLK more popular than TBC, so it stands to reason that remaking these three games perfectly as they were would be popular among all the fans of the whole series and especially the fans of the game back then. It also stands to reason that if they continued on and remade Cataclysm they would be appealing to a much smaller group of fans and likely piss off their "original trilogy" fans all over again.
---
The box is nice, but its not the same as the feeling you had with it 14-12 years ago. Thats what you (at least i) will not experience again by buying the 15 years CE box
---
What makes you say a private server is more/less expensive than a blizzard server? I don't know enough to verify your claim, but I'd wager you don't have any evidence to support it either. 
---
If I was a betting man however, I'd think it would be cheaper considering the infrastructure they already have in place. In fact, when the original Guild Wars server were being considered for shutdown they decided to leave them up because the cost was almost non-existent. I would imagine once Classic is stable and no longer receiving updates/changes, it would be pretty inexpensive to host. 
---
Again, this is just my uneducated guess.
---
I'm with you on this. I don't get how a suplex is less pain that those 3 lmao
---
As long as they add a proper arena, I don’t care what else they do. P
---
I’m somewhat afraid a lot of people who have been bursting at the seems with anticipation are setting themselves up for disappointment, not because of the game itself but because they’ve built up expectations in their heads that are impossible to match. 
---
I’m afraid people will be expecting the same experience as they had 15 years ago, but that will be impossible to replicate. Too many people know what they’re doing now and where to go, the sense of wonder you get from exploring the game will be all but gone since we’re so familiar with it all. 
---
I see so many posts and comments about how excited people are to join a game that has a sense of community on a per server level, without taking into consideration the sense of community they got before was from the early 2000’s where online experiences like that were new and just chatting to other people in real time over something like a game in the manner of Warcraft was something practically unheard of at the time. That was a partial selling point of the game, when that we’ve all grown so used too it won’t feel special at all
---
I myself played the stress test through about 6 or 7 levels (a small sample size I know) but never really felt challenged or felt the need to group up to do anything. I hope I’m wrong about all this come release time, but I’m afraid this sub has built up expectations that are too great to match.
---
Does seem to make weapon skill insane raiding, and does seem to heavily favor alliance with how few axes there are in the game.  
---
Also really calls into question builds like SF daggers.  But I guess if you got the C'thun dagger or aged core leather gloves it would sort of make up for it.
---
Healing isn't hard, but with the TPS meta for tanks, they push their healers as far as they can go, stripping off as much mitigation gear as possible to push threat harder. You definitely get value from being holy spec. Inspiration is OP.
---
You're right.  OP wasn't asking about Troll.
---
Hey all,
---
I play a balance druid, and have done (with a bit of Resto) since WotLK. I like the different forms of a druid but I'm aware Balance is one of the least viable specs in game.
---
What else should I consider playing? A different druid spec? A similar spec but different class? Or just go for Balance again?
---
This is some kind of pasta?
---
You have to cross the sea between menethil and auberdine.
---
Nah that was the battle chest that would include everything but the current xpac.
---
It was changed I think this xpac so you only need sub to play everything but the current xpac.
---
They massacred him when they updated his model.
---
This is the comment.
---
Dungeon grinding is the high road to 60.
---
I started on TBC release date but &lt;PALS FOR LIFE&gt; and &lt;DEUS VOX&gt; were the two biggest guild on my server, Laughing Skull. P4L was obviously the coolest because they had Leeroy Jenkins in it (at least at one point, I never did see him in game).
---
Is that true? So no need to buy shit greens from ah just to boost a bit str etc when creating an alt?
---
Cataclysm for me. My daughter couldn't sleep unless I was holding her, so I got a Razor Naga and stayed up all night for nine months playing WoW one-handed.
---
I bind A and D to be strafe left and right instead of turning. Makes this a lot easier.
---
That's actually crazy to think about. Tool's last album was released at the height of vanilla wow. That's how long ago it was.
---
So we are outing us in this one- alright Onyxia(DE) EU. Keeping the name to myself till the name reservations are done (at least I want to hope for the chance to reclaim it :p)
---
  Now for your 1-9 list
---
\#1 Not an issue for offensive playstyles. Only the 'always on the run' playstyles really suffer from this and they are limited by terrain anyway
---
\#2 feels like this goes hand in hand with the offensive playstyle of #1 but again not an issue. Given the option to FD Trap directly during gcd/swingtimers of my enemy was a thing in vanilla the ''scatter necessity'' is not really a thing for me. It also goes into a similar category as #1 as post 1.9-1.10 builds usually had points into SV for pvp for more control over just sticking to the cookie cutter 20/31/0 build and I stand to my point: The main reason why crime-server players are complaining is because they either never learned how to play the hunter in any other way other than to 100% rely on freezing trap - or they are butthurt about the prospect of having to respec for more pvp efficiency
---
Lastly I have to say that imp wing clip and/or entrapment+frost are both hilariously overpowered post 1.9 (proc based crowd control effects have no DR post 1.9). The old Ranger R13 T3 clip has a perfect example of 2 back to back imp wing clip roots within 8 seconds of each other - both lasting full 5 seconds. With entrapment in BGs the frost trap earned (a well deserved) 'frost cancer carpet' nickname in the German community because of that back in the days. In a worst case scenario you were forced to sit in the damn thing for 30-44 seconds.
---
Or to put it bluntly - there is a reason why entrapment got reworked/nerfed to the ground with 2.0 :p
---
\#3 While it was only an issue for roughly 3 years of the game's lifetime I see it in a similar perspective as your own mentioned #3. The only thing I'll add is that people will get used to it rather fast or whine a bit and reroll.
---
\#4 That's more about server client communication (keyword: position interpolation) and less about 'just fast moving'. While I expect the word to spread that mounted autorun without any additional movement input could bypass trap triggers - it is only an additional limitation for both myself and my enemy. Running diagonal or strafing sideways sends constant information to the server and basically enforces positioning interpolation updates on a more frequent rate. So my traps are still going to affect the gameplay of other people just because they exist.
---
\#5 &amp; #6 I don't like the enforced 400ms simulation. I never had that bad a ping on the EU servers. Then again they are taking the information from the states and the infrastructure there is (while cheaper to access) in a much worse state. It's not like there is much of a point to argue about it as it is something with all spells that will require people to get used to it
---
\#7 The biggest myth about vanilla. Hunters never scaled as well as they did in vanilla. People tend to forget that TBC didn't just add the pet RAP scaling it also cut the RAP from AGI down in half. You will have more RAP in classic than your character had/would have in TBC up till the release of sunwell- that's when people finally caught up with the old RAP values. The dmg falloff comes from the 6+ seconds of afk auto shot wait time without melee dives.
---
\#8 Only really affects the 4:3 rotation and that is something that won't bother me for the first couple of months. I will always treasure it as the option. Hell I may even utilize it to go full tryhard with +flask + greater arcane just to freak out my fellow hunters ;)
---
\#9 not vanilla like as a selection of old farming clips have already proven. So definitely a bug of the 1 weapon and no secondary weapon system of the legion base client. I expect it to be fixed at launch - but even if it isn't - it won't bother my ego till AQ if I can't use melee dives. I doubt it that such an issue would go unfixed for such an extended time period
---
Outdoor dungeons! The orcs who took over the castle in redridge, the troll city in hinterlands, ogres in alterac etc. I loved those outdoor elite quest areas that needed groups to compete.
---
And there's the fundamental difference between your comparison that makes it not accurate. A lot of us had decent pings in vanilla 100 or less. It was 2006 not 1995 and broadband was fairly common. You didn't connect to a counter strike server and see all pings of 200 +. Cable and DSL was availiable unless you were in the boonies. My town of 12,000 people had it.  
---
People grossly over exaggerate this every time its brought up.
---
&gt;ry year will have the 
---
Opening presents ...yes.
---
Opening presents with exclusive items that changes every year....No, that started in TBC.
---
So, in Classic the presents will be the same every year, in fact those non-exclusive presents have been available on Winter Weil in retail every year.
---
Wenches and mead
---
Check out kork’s hunter class mechanics guides on YouTube. Saw it posted here on reddit a few weeks ago and it’s a great intro to the class.
---
Spending 6 hours a day playing wow will destroy your back, just like a suplex :P
---
I leveled a ret pally on a pserver for fun and feel it's common courtesy to pass on cloth gear since I'm primarily leveling ret. Once ~50ish or so, I'd start rolling for healing gear including cloth since a lot may not be replaced for a long time.
---
Is it just me or does the current lighting system in the client make that gear on your hunter look amazing?
---
I get aroused when I hear his current intro song.
---
Stun resist will help a lot more than you think. Especially against the tryhard female human rogues named xgankzx and lolbackstabz
---
Yes Mage is your best bet.
---
A weird amount of people don’t seem to realize that a huge segment of the player base get their kicks from being as optimal as possible. Fun is directly related with efficiency, to many. Personally, I just like knowing I’m not gimping myself for no reason. I might as well play the best if I don’t really care if I’m one spec or another. 
---
I expect minor rebalancing after a year or two.
---
&gt;reason why entrapment got reworked/nerfed to the ground with 2.0 :p
---
Dear... God... LOL. 30-44 seconds?! I'm glad I planned on going 5/5 Entrap and IWC anyways. That's probably why I remember doing so well in PVP in the past, despite all the Classic bugs and such. #SURVIVALNOCHANGES haha
---
Great responses. Thanks fella. 
---
&gt;Hunters never scaled as well as they did in vanilla.
---
I remember that nerf in TBC. It was pretty brutal and deterring :( Arena and those gd Trinkets getting upgrade was the next brutal thing for Hunters to deal with.
---
Found the paladin!
---
well we have video footage in the old Ranger T3 R13 clip of him firing, melee and then firing at a 2nd person with the normal boundaries of his gear's swingtimer.
---
With that in mind we have a solid case of 1.12 footage for the 'it's a bug' list
---
Thanks! Baby is here an screaming at 9.8 pounds. I still am just furniture to hold the baby till the wife can feed him.
---
I want Blizzard to re-release new Classic realms so i can do it all again when i actually have time. 
---
Been playing private for 8years, i want to keep doing it fresh
---
I understand your point. It will definitely not be the same experience like you say. All i can say is that i HOPE that the experience will be a bit like the old days, and that i dont like retail. When i think back about vanilla until wotlk i liked everything. Enough reason for me to play Classic.
---
Also i think its easier to play Classic when you have a busy life, not having to log back on every day to do follower missions, dailys, world quests and what not. 
---
Just planning to run Scarlet Monastery 1 time over the course of 1 whole evening with nice people who arent all rushing towards endgame. 
---
And maybe a part of it is just longing to go back to my youth and find some sort of escape from adult life responsabilities.
---
 But its personal for everyone and everyone has their own reasons to look or look not forward to Classic
---
Willitclassic.com
---
Oh my, warriors were the kings of PvE in both tanking and dps. But yeah respecs are a big thing if you want to PvP and PvE.
---
Mage water will be used in raids, but every raid will have multiple mages. Your everyday player won't be planning around having mage conjures. And people won't be broke for long. Like I said, mages stand out because they have good dps. Think long term, a class you will want to play a long time on.
---
The subject is feeling down by all the pressures of life.  Wow Classic walks in and lends a helping hand.  He takes it because he thinks this is the savior he's been looking for.  Then classic suplexes him on his head.  He thought wow classic would save him from his problems, but he ends up worse off than when he started.  The End.
---
No. Private servers use a 1.12 client where classic uses a modified version of the modern wow client. The only add-ons that work were specifically modified to work with the classic client. 
---
Check out this site to find classic add-ons: https://willitclassic.com/
---
Sounds about right!
---
I know right! None of my friends are playing paladin either so it’s really a waste :/
---
I remember Mages being good all throughout.... always useful in world pvp, battlegrounds, raids, etc. I may wait and make a Warrior alt so that I can gear him up and make levelling easier, etc... but thanks for your input.
---
Yes Molten Core and many other dungeons and raids required attunement. No need to feel dumb, discovering these quests can be hard. Here is a guide to all  dungeon and raid attunement requirements: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-attunements-and-keys-dungeons-raids
---
I don't quite understand what they're saying about the crit suppression.  They seem to be saying any crit not gained by agility is considered aura crit, and susceptible to the 1.8% suppression versus bosses.   So, let's say I am a hunter with no crit form talents or buff or anything, and then I drink a mongoose potion.   Would I lose the 1/8% of the 2% crit the potion provides?
---
What makes engineering a must for PVP?
---
I'm pretty sure all 3 of the guilds were always neck and neck when it came to progression. They all were separate guilds which I'm pretty sure most are still running today.
---
Good God you’re salty 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Or just put in a few flight paths when needed in certain locations. Player-controlled flying just shouldn't be tinkered with or used.
---
**TL;DR: Using consumables can be 3X better than using Poisons, which can equate to a 4% to 6% overall damage increase.**
---
Not using poisons is a significant damage increase:
---
&gt; [Instant Poison VI](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8928/instant-poison-vi) - Coats a weapon with poison that lasts for 30 minutes. Each strike has a 20% change of poisoning the enemy which instantly inflects 112 to 148 Nature damage. 115 charges.
---
Please note that from now on, when I say *DPS*, I mean *Damage Per Swing*.
---
    (112 + 148) / 2 * 0.2 = 26 DPS
---
Poisons do not scale with any consumables or raid debuffs.
---
With 3/8 Bloodfang:
---
    (112 + 148) / 2 * .25 = 32 DPS
---
With 5/5 Vile Poisons:
---
    (112 + 148) / 2 * 1.2 * .2 = 31 DPS
---
With 5/5 Improved Poisons ([the build commonly used by Alliance SF Dagger Rogues](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/20530310505105-320305200001-05):
---
    (112 + 148) / 2 * .3 = 39 DPS
---
The above with Bloodfang (though you probably won't be speccing SF that early):
---
    (112 + 148) / 2 * .35 = 45.5 DPS
---
    
---
With all talents and Bloodfang (just so we know the maximum):
---
    (112 + 148) / 2 * 1.2 * .35 = 54 DPS
---
Now time to show you that even this maximum can be beaten.
---
&gt; [Shadow Oil](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3824/shadow-oil) - When applied to a melee weapon it gives a 15% chance of casting Shadowbolt III at the opponent when it hits. Lasts 30 minutes.
---
&gt; [Shadow Bolt Rank 3](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=705/shadow-bolt) - Sends a shadowy bolt at the enemy, causing 48 to 56 Shadow damage.
---
At face value, this is:
---
    (48 + 56) / 2 * .15 = 7.8 DPS (we're going to be ignoring a Rogue's Spell Crit chance, even though it is a boost especially with World Buffs)
---
With a Warlock:
---
&gt; [Curse of Shadow](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=17937/curse-of-shadow) - Curses the target for 5 min, reducing Shadow and Arcane resistances by 75 and increasing Shadow and Arcane damage taken by 10%. Only one Curse per Warlock can be active on any one target.
---
&gt; [Improved Shadow Bolt](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=17803/improved-shadow-bolt) - Your Shadow Bolt critical strikes increase Shadow damage dealt to the target by 20% until 4 non-periodic damage sources are applied. Effect lasts a maximum of 12 sec.
---
It's important to note that while Shadow Oil benefits from the Warlock talent, Improved Shadow Bolt, it does not consume one of the 4 charges.
---
Now we have:
---
    (48 + 56) / 2 * 1.10 * 1.20 * .15 = 10.3 DPS
---
With a Shadow Priest:
---
&gt; [Shadow Weaving](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=15334/shadow-weaving) - Your Shadow damage spells have a 100% chance to cause your target to be vulnerable to Shadow damage. This vulnerability increases the Shadow damage dealt to your target by 3% and lasts 15 sec. Stacks up to 5 times.
---
    (48 + 56) / 2 * 1.10 * 1.20 * 1.15 * .15 = 11.8 DPS
---
Shadow Bolt Rank 3 has a 2.8/3.5 = 80% Spell Power scaling coefficient.
---
So now we get into the juicy stuff:
---
&gt; [Flask of Supreme Power](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13512/flask-of-supreme-power) - Increases damage done by magical spells and effects by up to 150 for 2 hrs. You can only have the effect of one flask at a time. This effect persists through death.
---
&gt; [Greater Arcane Elixir](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13454/greater-arcane-elixir) - Increases spell damage by up to 35 for 1 hour.
---
&gt; [Elixir of Shadow Power](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9264/elixir-of-shadow-power) - Increases spell shadow damage by up to 40 for 30 min.
---
That's a total of 225 Spell Damage on our Shadow Oil:
---
    [(48 + 56) / 2 + 225 * 0.8] * .15 = 34.8 DPS
---
So already, if you're specced Combat, Shadow Oil is better even without a Warlock or a Shadow Priest. When you have a Warlock:
---
    [(48 + 56) / 2 + 225 * 0.8] * 1.10 * 1.20 * .15 = 45.9 DPS
---
Which is better than any common PVE Rogue spec even when wearing Bloodfang. But when you have a Shadow Priest too.
---
    [(48 + 56) / 2 + 225 * 0.8] * 1.10 * 1.20 * 1.15 * .15 = 52.8 DPS
---
That's now double the raw damage of non-specced Instant Poisons. But we're not done yet:
---
&gt; [Dragonbreath Chili](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12217/dragonbreath-chili) - Occasionally belch flame at enemies struck in melee for the next 10 min.
---
The damage from the cone of fire is 60 to 70 and has roughly a 10% proc rate. It also has a 100% Spell Power scaling coefficient and can crit.
---
&gt; [Curse of the Elements](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11722/curse-of-the-elements) - 
---
Curses the target for 5 min, reducing Fire and Frost resistances by 75 and increasing Fire and Frost damage taken by 10%. Only one Curse per Warlock can be active on any one target.
---
&gt; [Improved Scorch](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12873/improved-scorch) - 
---
Your Scorch spells have a 100% chance to cause your target to be vulnerable to Fire damage. This vulnerability increases the Fire damage dealt to your target by 3% and lasts 30 sec. Stacks up to 5 times.
---
With the consumables we already have:
---
    [(60 + 70) / 2 + 185] * 1.10 * 1.15 * .1 = 31.6 DPS
---
Add an [Elixir of Greater Firepower](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21546/elixir-of-greater-firepower) and you have:
---
    [(60 + 70) / 2 + 225] * 1.10 * 1.15 * .1 = 36.7 DPS
---
So just bringing 5 total consumables can be worth an extra ~90 damage PER SWING, which is more than your Offhand weapon does on its own.
---
I "auditioned" as a resto druid for my server's top progression guild. They had MC on farm, so they took me for a run. I got 4 pieces of Cenarion gear that run. They straight up told me they would have disenchanted it, but they didn't want to be that dickish. However,  they would charge me full DKP.
---
So they end the run and say "great job! By the way, you owe us 210 hours of DKP." The only upgrades I would ever get would be ones they were going to disenchant, and I'd be charged full price for all of them. I would literally never have a positive DKP balance. So I said thanks for the bracers, good luck with your search.
---
30/0/21 is viable for raid healing and is one of the best balance pvp specs.
---
Yes MC, BWL and Ony all have attunes. MC and BWL are easy, Ony takes time to do, but both Ony and BWL require the last boss of UBRS so you knock out all 3 attunes pretty quick, assuming you can attune to BWL before the raid releases in a later phase.
---
Played horde on Magtheridon. &lt;PAIN TRAIN&gt; was a well known guild. If i'm not mistaken the Pally + Warrior combo brooks &amp; tugget were members of this guild and definitely well known PVPers.
---
Horde had &lt;R U N&gt; which turned into &lt;The Reqiuem&gt; eventually, I think they were the top horde guild.
---
Joho and his cornering of the market on arcanite reaper, ah the golden days!
---
It's really really good, sadly alliance can't get it, +1 hit chance on a trinket is INSANE
---
This does sound fun route
---
Eternal Gathering on Doomhammer Alliance.
---
yeah, but you still need to drop stuff in dungeons, I made a list of tanking best quest rewards and you'd get obliterated in those.
---
Depends. Some people have no trouble writing their own macros so the idea of downloading an add-on to do something so simple would be idiocy to them.
---
indeed
---
100% of all MMOs I played, WoW included, had their music muted on the first minutes of gameplay so that I could listen to whatever I liked.
---
However, this time, I will try to play with the original game sounds and music as much as I can.
---
Vanilla WoW tested my college career. I almost didn't finish mostly to lack of motivation. Thankfully, blizzard ruined their game so I could get my life on track. I got my bachelor's, then my master's, and now a good salary.
---
Classic WoW will test my marriage... *the cycle continues*
---
this
---
Nice theorycraft mate but iam wondering about this :  
---
" It's important to note that while Shadow Oil benefits from the Warlock talent, Improved Shadow Bolt, it does not consume one of the 4 charges. "  
---
Any source for that? or are you considering shadow bolt 3 non-periodic?
---
play a mage
---
**Munches lots of popcorn.**
---
What? Having your stuns resisted is far more infuriating than having a root removed once every minute.
---
Up voted for truth.
---
Yea this seems like a complete waste of time. Just go to westfall.
---
I think you're joking, but I've already decided to do this, essentially. I have friends who are going to play the game super-casually and may not ever make it to 60 and my wife will probably play a few hours a week. They all want to play on a pve server. 
---
When they're able to play, I'll roll a toon on that server with them, but my main will be on a pvp server, because I'll end up playing way more than them and I don't want to limit my experience with the game.
---
https://i.imgur.com/MPbX6OD.jpg
---
I'd go Orc as well. Orc for horde and dwarf for ally but thats just my opinion
---
Agreed! I'd like to see that list though, you have a link? I think we're all just champing at the bit because we can't play right now. Having a list of guaranteed drops can be useful because you'll know what dungeons and zones to spend your time in as the appropriate levels approach. And of course some BOEs will be replacing some of the quest rewards as you go. It will be nice to just get a start on it already!
---
You all worrying about these silly things like "Can I heal enough if I level shadow", and "Can I tank well enough if I level arms?"
---
You guys need to understand, it's all viable. The issue was never tanking as Arms. The issue was most player didn't understand 7 mobs was more than 3 mobs and there shouldn't be 10 seconds in between each speak in your rotation.
---
Don't play like an old lady and you'll do fine.
---
The most surprising part of this comment is that wildstar was tested.  I loved that game, but the amount of things that were just flat out broken on release (and for months after) was just crazy.
---
Not in my opinion. We would get 30 people on raid nights in discord and it was non stop disconnects and robots and issues. We switched to Teamspeak hosted out of my house and it has been rock solid with 0 issues.
---
Brutality was pretty much the core remnants of Dark Ancients, so we didn’t have to do that much recruiting to be able to raid. A lot of us ended up staying together for quite some time on ZJ but of course like anything else, it couldn’t last due to other interests, server swaps, or life getting in the way.
---
As for myself, I raided in a good amount of guilds during Vanilla/BC/Wrath, did the horrid PvP grind multiple times, and now just mess around with alts and farming mats while awaiting for Classic. Retail lost a lot of it’s main focus, it feels like an entirely different game. I’m super stoked for Classic, in fact Aimzz is recruiting for his guild, I will definitely keep you in mind if you’d like to join up!
---
A man, looking for an escape from the stresses of life, thinks he found one in the outstretched hand of classic wow.  So he takes it, only to have his dick buried in the dirt by the biggest stressor of all.
---
[Yes, confirmed](https://clips.twitch.tv/SassyMoldyEndiveDuDudu). It was always like that.
---
&gt;That's a total of 225 Spell Damage on our Shadow Oil
---
Maybe, but I would be vary of the "up to" used in descriptions. It's likely normalized per minute or something.
---
Yeah. Those are the guys!
---
It really was a good server.
---
Give it to someone else, why would I want to cheapen my achievements with handouts
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about the stun resist
---
Can I aimed shot with my throwing knives? :P
---
Will do, thanks bud
---
A few questions:
---
* So poisons don't also scale with spellpower, despite being nature damage?
---
* The proc from shadow oil gets the same spell coefficient as the real Shadow Bolt 3 spell even though it's always instant cast?
---
* How much of this information is backed by beta-testing?
---
Awesome thank you.
---
In-game music and sounds because I'm not a filthy casual.
---
It wasn’t there when I was playing on the stress test, but it also shouldn’t be there, I don’t think it was added until WotLK.
---
just spam hamstring like a normal person
---
stonks
---
[You mean this?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rQRdHw8LgmiPEVc8ST-cwdD1kKkBwhwlK1f0eO45voU/edit?fbclid=IwAR2T3678Vs4Re5_SaMzuhnuyG1JyXOC0IYCFqhGeY35Gjix9wqO3u2o5z3k#gid=0) Don't exaggerate, there were never 150 hunter bigs in that list and a big portion was client side only. Still alot, though, and not really acceptable. However, alot was fixed the last weeks of beta.
---
So 180 months?
---
No, the "up to" is because spell power scaling coefficients weren't better described in Vanilla. You're gaining that amount of spell power exactly, how much you actually see on the numbers depends on the spell.
---
Dear god I hope not. It does thankfully seem to be the opinion of many that classic should either stay as is or get new content with an original design philosophy, never getting those diluting systems such as flying and lfg.
---
We switched to Teamspeak recently and people were amazed at the sound quality compared to Discord.
---
I basically just want to play AV. 
---
Which classes/specs shine in 40v40?
---
Except lock orc doesn't help against lock.
---
That would mean they actually have to make something.
---
That's a good choice. Druids can tank 5 mans and can off tank raids but usually end up healing. There's a good feral/resto spec that will allow you to do all that and PvP. It's a great class if you have friends to play with.
---
Mage is great for the convenience and isn't super gear dependant so it's a good choice for a first character.
---
My two favorite classes!
---
Thing is none of us can say how we would react if it was put into the game again two or three years down the road, because the simple Act of being without flying will increase appreciation for flying again when we have it.
---
And in a way that's fundamentally different from current retail expansions taking flying away for the first half of the expansion
---
Thank you! I don't know what is this huge circlejerk "night elves should be savage and brutal" especially in current WoW subreddit.
---
When you *actually* played them in WC3 they were very close to their WoW interpretation. Yes, savage female warriors when facing foreign threat. But civilized, closed to nature, calm ancient race otherwise.
---
arguably the 20 man raids are the catch up gear
---
Prep because of hemo. Hemo is way better for leveling then cold blood will be.
---
Head over to r/classicwowplus   
---
These ideas are being worked on and developed.
---
Probably mage due to having a good swath of AoE and mobility skills. Being a stealth class is also fun if you want to cap towers or kill the person who is tanking Vandar.
---
how did you level if you never did pve?
---
imagine corpse running all the way to BRD and then running to the MC portal every time you wipe.
---
For. The. Horde.
---
Lmfao
---
Resto Druid main having issues figuring out what my one alt should be. 
---
I want this alt to be able to farm for me while also having some fun in BGs.  I played melee roles in WotLK but Rogues/EnhShams aren’t great at end game farming.  I am stuck between Mage and Warlock.
---
Folks talk about Mage like it’s the one you should pick for farming, but I really like the class fantasy for Warlocks.  Their utility with Portals/Summons will be super convenient too. Are Warlocks okay with doing AoE farming? They both seem super fun in PvP too.
---
Horde: Elitist Jerks - Mal'Ganis
---
Alliance: Damage Networks - Mug'Thol
---
&gt; So poisons don't also scale with spellpower, despite being nature damage?
---
Correct.
---
&gt; The proc from shadow oil gets the same spell coefficient as the real Shadow Bolt 3 spell even though it's always instant cast?
---
Correct
---
&gt; How much of this information is backed by beta-testing?
---
All of it (besides the unobtainable +damage consumables). We tested Shadow Oil not consumbing ISB charges, poisons not scaling with spell power, Shadow Oil scaling with other debuffs and spell power, and the same for Dragonbreath Chili.
---
Some other did tests too and streamed them: https://clips.twitch.tv/SassyMoldyEndiveDuDudu
---
One minor point: since Dragonbreath Chili can *also* be used by rogues using poison, you need to subtract the base (un-scaled) DPS from the Chili to fairly show the benefit of stacking spell power.
---
I like the switch from horse to ram, personally the rams are a lot nicer to me.
---
That is too small of a sample size.  Much too small.
---
People didn't group in vanilla, just for the fun of it.  They grouped up, because the game rewarded them for doing so.
---
Mob tagging - grouping up means not fighting over rare/slow spawns.
---
Difficulty - some quests and elites are too tough to do solo and/or are MUCH easier to do with 1-2 others.
---
No LFD - You'll need to rely on your guild, personal network and general chat for groups.
---
No sharding - You ran into the same people every day for months.  Really hoping Blizz sticks to their promises on this and eliminates sharding very quickly after launch.
---
The more people you meet, interact with and friend, the better time and easier time you'll have.  And its a looooooong road to 60 for most of us that aren't speed runners.  The sheer volume of interactions you'll end up having along the way with other players should leave you with a lot of friends.   Or enemies, if you're an asshole.
---
If you have a huge and amazing guild, you can get around some of that, but even then, with MUCH slower travel in-game, it's harder to get guildies to come out and help you kill an elite mob.  In the 20 minutes it takes them to get there, you could have just grouped with 2-3 other people that need the kill and gotten it done.
---
I was in a hardcore top 100 raiding guild Horde side, but still I really wanted to be apart of the alliance guild named ‘The Family Business,’ if only they were horde. They were simply the ever present antagonist to the us. We were better, but they just seemed like the dark horse that always ride in at the just right time to fuck your soul. I wanted to be like that. A very love hate relationship
---
Shadow is the best levelling spec as long as you pair it with wand spec in the disc tree. You want to find a wand as soon as possible in classic and then abuse the shit out of it for as long as you can because they’re really good for the early levels. 
---
First 5 talent points into wand spec. Then go full into shadow. You’re just fine as a healer without any points in holy, priests are the best healers in the game for a reason. You won’t have any trouble with any sub 60 dungeon as long as you’re not going in as soon as possible with a low lvl group.
---
Our thoughts are exactly in line with each other :D
---
Where is this template? Been trying to find it :). Link?
---
This!!! Then you bumble all over your keys because you're just raging irl lol.
---
Do some guilds use the DPS meter for loot distribution?
---
Tips is clueless idiot so yeah.
---
It cultivates lazy reactions. There is no world in which I want to raid with healers who are incapable of using two fingers simultaneously.  The time between targeting a player and pressing a button is unequivocally insignificant in Classic raiding. I’m glad I won’t be raiding with people incapable of understanding that. Scrub
---
Don’t worry after a year they will ruined it they are good at it
---
A couple hundred gold a night isn't anything to worry about with the help of my friends from China.
---
So much this.
---
Me and him both
---
I would like TBC too, but that doesn't mean that TBC is perfect. No flying mounts would be great, no level cap increase would be great, no dailies would be great. Those are things that started ruining the game IMO, but to each their own.
---
Does anyone have a suggestion for a near silent mouse with &gt;2 buttons?  I have a near silent 2 button mouse now that greatly improved improved my wife's tolerance to gaming, but it pains me to wow with only 2 mouse buttons
---
They were raids -- or atleast had quests in them that were tagged as raid and could be completed in a raid grp (something about plague dragons in scholo-- I remember it psyching me out about scholo in general and I was afraid to ever look for a grp for it until way later)
---
This is what the ADA description of this image should read.
---
They are equivalent. Vuhdo raid frames also has this functionality built in. Using any of the three options (or something similar) is fine. Not using anything at all puts you at a disadvantage (imo).
---
It looks very cool. It seems like it'd be functionally bad the same way that the standard ui is bad, but you're not worse off than if you're using the standard ui, and it is totally gorgeous.
---
Are you looking for an author or an owner? Because the copyright owner is Stardev Studio. If you're looking for permission to include that guide in some addon, you'll need to talk to them.
---
You do know that they actually did this back in vanilla and it didn't stop anyone from progressing on the live servers right?
---
You're not tanking anything important as a druid so he should be fine.
---
I mean you can still flag pvp and go kill all their quest givers and flight masters until you draw them out.
---
&lt;The Dark Squirrels&gt; Cho’Gall US was the top dog.
---
I was in Accounting for a bit but i know there where a guild that lasted from vanilla to a few years ago. Dues vox was world ranking progression for a long time also.
---
Another pro tip is to not use the key bind alt+f4
---
I used to play Metal Slug 2 on an old cabinet when I was a kid. Like every day after school, scrounging for quarters, collecting enough pennies to convert into just 3 lives because I *know* I can do better this time. The machine was in a building that had a rat problem. The power cable was tattered as hell and seemingly at random, every 30 minutes or so, would restart as the wires crossed and uncrossed in some unknown bump and grind.
---
I'd get a quarter back from the guy at the counter, but I didnt give a shit about that. I was in the middle of a game! Now I have to start at level 1..again! It taught me patience at a very young age. 
---
When I got older, know what the first retro game I bought was? You bet your ass it was Metal Slug 2. And i still love it to this day. Classic is like my Metal slug being rereleased, this time with a working power cable.
---
My 2 cents:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/055031105-053-050050512023](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/055031105-053-050050512023) 
---
lvl 26 2/5 Conviction, 2/2 Improved Ret Aura
---
lvl 32 3/3 Two-Handed Weapon Specialization
---
lvl 40 3/3 Precision
---
lvl 60 5/5 Illumination
---
I wouldn't respec at 20 for SoC(saw this recommended once or twice). 15% mana reduction + 5% parry wins out against +1.5 avg damage on swing and +7 on judgement. Start Ret and work your way down to Imp Ret aura which will help both of you open world and your tank in dungeons. I would take Pursuit of Justice as your warrior friend will be charging everywhere and your slow ass will be trailing behind him 90% of the time.
---
From here, if you are fighting mobs higher level than you frequently go Precision(Prot) first so you can actually hit things. Otherwise finish up your 2H Specialization(Ret) followed by Precision. This is subjective; are you guys are pushing harder content looking for a challenge or are questing below your level trying to mop up as much XP as possible?
---
Finishing up with Holy puts you in an ok spot for healing on your way to 60. As a fresh 60 the spec should still be ok for healing dungeons or open worlding. If you feel compelled to DPS 60 dungeons, that should be possible assuming your Warrior friend is tanking(no one will question a warrior tank about the DPS he brings).
---
Gear wise you won't need to worry too much about competition, at least during leveling. Most of your damage is your weapon, slower weapons leads to higher Seal of Command damage. Gear pieces for stat boosts aren't huge deals early on. Sample damage calcs:
---
\~16-20/min | White Damage: (Weapon DPS + AP\*.07) \* (Weapon Speed)
---
\~06/minute | Seal of Command: (Weapon DPS + AP\*.07) \* (Weapon Speed) \* 0.7 \*(1+SP\*0.2)
---
\~06/minute | Judgement of Command: X\*(1+(SP\*.43))
---
\[If used on CD\]
---
There are also some GREAT quest 2 Handers that both of you can push for together as upgrades. You can proactively tackle quests early as a group to get Trogg Slicer as early as 13(lvl 18 mobs) and Rock Pulverizer as early as 30(lvl 42 mob!).
---
As long as you are keeping **water** and an Int set of gear in your bags you should be fine to heal open world and dungeons throughout leveling. I personally wouldn't recommend speccing straight Holy for leveling. Get a big stick, stand shoulder to shoulder with your pal, and smite everything in your path.
---
\~Best of Luck
---
I'd just hate to get clapped by a molten giant or something you're offtanking cuz you wanted to shoot some dank shrink rays
---
The author(s)! I will not be using it in an add-on or anything, this is purely a curiosity on who the author is and what their online handle is. I also wanted to clear things up within my guild that is talking about it and aren't sure if Alenya had a part in it.
---
100% Troll is the way to go.  That health regen and haste buff is wild in PVE.
---
That was my recollection, but I'm glad to hear it's record.
---
Hope they fix it.
---
Yes brother!!
---
To hold more loot.
---
What do casual guilds use then? just straight dkp? that system is so flawed.
---
Wow, they really dodged a bullet there
---
Neat idea :)
---
That would be very neat!

Dump your GF and roll pvp with the other 10% of your guild.  If you stick together you'll be formidable.
---
Agreed
---
Amazing insight. Thank you!
---
I love TSM
---
Carbonite is not listed as updated. There is no information on its plans to be updated. Someone added it to keep tabs on it.
---
EU right? I remember you guys. Played a tauren druid in The Brotherhood and had many run ins with you guys. You kept snatching all the server first
---
I say again.  You got Vanilla.  Let me have TBC.
---
If you say I can't have TBC, you're worse than the retail fans who didn't want you to have Vanilla.  Because not only are you selfish, you're also a hypocrite.
---
Yeah, I'm fairly certain that's not Alenya's guide, he/she just linked to a public on and then mentioned the one they're selling: https://www.patreon.com/join/theraceto60

***^(IGNORING MY PROBLEMS DIDN'T FIX THEM. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT?)***
---
Who would you give gear to? The players contributing the most or the least?
---
Eh, with WoW I think you would have to focus primarily on level 60 content - while the journey is still very important to the game, I think there is plenty of current content for that. The journey to max in Classic WoW is much much much less than OSRS, as well as much more linear (you really just level up through one xp bar, skills are no where close to what they are in Runescape), which is why they still create midlevel content. Also, you are more flexible to do things in OSRS (your level dosen't matter as much) depending on group size, gear, consumables, etc. In WoW your level matters a TON.
---
Arguably my favorite zones in WoW.
---
Thats different obviously. HPS and threat retention are their jobs.
---
If you love the idea of shapeshifting, then remain balance I'd say. Just understand that you won't have competitive dps at endgame (probably among the lowest of the dps roles), and won't get into min/maxing guilds. Casual guilds won't care.
---
A Lot of people criticize it because they exactly know what its capable of.
---
When they reference micro transactions they never talk about WoW specifically. They always just reference them on the macro level across all their games.
---
Micro transactions do not have their place in MMORPGS.
---
That's what I thought as well but I'm still interested in knowing who made their guide
---
Yeah man
---
I would rather have healers that find more efficient ways of doing things.  
---
You'll notice from my example that there were 3 actions being done with the left hand.  I'd rather raid with players who can count past 2.
---
That may be true, rogues were very popular back in the day and I'm sure that they will be again. That being said, if you put in the work to get enchants and perhaps not all the bis gear but a good amount, I'm sure you will find a spot somewhere. 
---
Only downside, is get ready for the AV grind for lobotomizer if you go the PVP route, and even perhaps if you want to gear up before raiding. In all rogue is a lot of fun though.
---
Going out of your way to level professions before ~60 will always extend /played to 60.
---
Most useable without going out of your way is skinning + herb.
---
Stormreaver
---
How would a higher ping make leeway less noticable? You can still hit the target over the exact same distance. The only difference is that it is more needed to not constantly get messages that you're not in range. But you can still see yourself hitting the opponent over the same maximum distance you could at 15ms. In some cases even further.
---
People that RP characters from Arathi are the absolute worst kind of people.
---
It is not against the EULA, read it more carefully.
---
Old vanilla quest. Retail WoW has had the same stupid Cataclysm quests for nearly a decade now, and over half of them are just shitty pop-culture references that were funny at the time but just annoying now. It's like playing through a meme-park. I miss the days of WoW taking itself seriously, having a real story, and overall trying to be more of an immersive experience. I don't want to see any more episodes of "CSI: Westfall, with Horatio Lane".
---
Level 60 cap TBC without flying mounts is probably a good idea. You'd have different tiers of raids and to beat the most difficult raids, you'd have to have beaten the previous raids, to avoid what happened to Naxx back in Vanilla.
---
In retail, regardless of server type, you must either enable or disable world pvp in Stormwind or Org. Faction appears orange if war mode is disabled.  It's a terrible, terrible thing they've done.
---

I'm saying that they don't care about your individual info. Also, most of those privacy policies are just boilerplates that will cover the site owner legally in a wide range of potential uses. 
---
So you are the one that sounds uneducated. You are shitting yourself over some wording that nearly every website uses just to make sure they can't be sued. Look at reddits policy.
---
I really wanted to tank in a guild called &lt;No Quarter&gt;.  Let me start by saying when I wanted to get in, I was vastly under qualified.  They were the top guild, and at the time, the only guild on server doing MC.  They actually had a group that would take random people...and I was lucky enough to be one.
---
In reality, what they were doing was taking people to create an ID and farm 2 MCs per week.  Some of us random people got frustrated that we always stopped on Gehennas (around the time we figured all this out), and formed our own guild.  We never really challenged them for anything significant... We got the first AQ20 clear while they got the first AQ40 bosses :p.  In retrospect, they were toxic from all reports, but at the time they first let me in those initial MCs, I wanted nothing more than to OT for them.  I don't think they ever had enough warriors for 4 horsemen, so the irony is they ultimately needed those people that formed other guilds
---
How is that the dumbest interpretation? You didn't even join the guild which implies you weren't happy with the deal you were offered. 
---
The other interpretation I can think of is that you figured you'd made a big easy scoop from that guild and went on your merry way to get more easy loot elsewhere. I just don't understand your reasoning at all in this story. 
---
If I applied to a guild and they immediately took me on a raid and gave me a bunch of free loot I would be ecstatic. It's also a pretty good indicator that there isn't exactly a line of takers for the next drop you'll need either.
---
I know a lot of people are against it, but honestly I think the one great thing BC did was give shaman and paladin's to both factions. I truly believe that only nostalgia keeps these faction specific, it really doesn't add much of an RPG element to the game, and (dare I say it) forced the og classic team to keep balancing the two classes to become similar to each other. Yes it will be a bit hard to explain how paladin's come into the horde lorewise in a Classic+ setting, but I'm sure it's possible.
---
Beyond that, I think everyone has said what I think in the top comments.
---
Its from a pserver, people with &lt; 100 viewers generally don't get banned for streaming it on Twitch especially if they put it in some obscure section of the platform.
---
I know that guild! I was alliance and wanted to be in Faith! You should hit me up on discord iskra#0332
---
&gt;they don’t aim, they shoot from the hip like lunatics
---
I love this reasoning though, both for or against them XD
---
The tranq shot, what else?
---
It's still better for a Horde Rogue to use Shadow Oil on their Offhand Weapon than to use Poisons.
---
&gt;Lastly I have to say that imp wing clip and/or entrapment+frost are both hilariously overpowered post 1.9 (proc based crowd control effects have no DR post 1.9).
---
So each frost trap tick can entrap someone for 5s without DR? Sounds strong. In a 1v1 against a warr/rogue for example, can it be better to use frost trap? Or is freezing trap generally better for 1v1?
---
I'm curious what your pvp build looks like; which of the two talents you're picking (or both). Gotta drop some other talents if you pick both imp wing clip *and* entrapment. If entrapment + frost trap is that good, would clever traps be worth getting as well? I'd appreciate it if you could link your pvp build, if you've got that figured out.
---
Agree
---
I can't say, I ordered one the day they were announced. Best of luck finding one though!
---
Team 3D
---
At lvl 60 with either pre raid bis or tier sets you’ll be doing more damage and have more base mana to do dmg as a gnome. But humans do look better in gear. So it’s really do I want to have a slight damage increase or do I want to look the best playing.
---
Why wouldn’t you be Seal Fate in Vanilla? 5 piece + vigor is sick.
---
&gt; They have not. 
---
Do you work for Blizzard by any chance? You seem far too confident.

---
To be honest, if you were to play both WoW Vanilla and OSRS, the experience can be quite similar. Recent WoW is very theme park, but not so much on the old days.
---
If I sexually harass a (adult)woman in-game is it only pixels? You can say yes, this is just a test to see if you actually believe what you're saying.
---
Oh damn, I remember The Brotherhood. I was never in EG, I can't even remember the name of the guild I was in at the time. I just remember seeing those EG dudes around in their sick epics.
---
+1 to Shaman.
---
I'm not gonna even try to insult you like the other posters--you're clearly gonna do more DPS than me--but I have to ask why you're planning on spending money to increase your DPS in a game where the most common complaint made by good players so far (that I've seen) is that PvE will be too easy.
---
Are you competing for speedrun times?
---
wait what? why? is it just hunter's that make them cringe, because I was considering Tauren Shaman
---
You think Blizzard would be the only party to know if gold buyers were ever banned? No, every person in the gold selling business would know that too. ;-)
---
no it wont, phase 2
---
Don’t buy anything off the AH.  It’s a gold sink until you need level 60 mats, consumables, and the occasional BiS piece of gear.
---
Until 44, holy or disc/holy is more efficient than shadow. Shadow is generally better if you want to 1v1 pvp because of silence and imp fear. The top priest in the level 30 beta tournament was a disc, and level 40 was shadow. Holy has quite a few +dps talents, while shadow hardly has any. Disc has a bunch of survivability/mana saving talents. 
---
Mind Flay doesn't get decent for soloing until the level 43/44 rank. And also by 44, you can have shadowform AND 5/5 imp wand. 
---
Ultimately, as long as you go 5/5 spirit tap and 5/5 wand, you're good to go.
---
And yet another thread with 20 people and everyone has their "good ideas"...sigh... For 2 years (i hope) how can't people see why it shouldn't be done?
---
Fresh servers and eventual TBC (if there are a lot of players) is enough. 
---
The moment someone suggest a change, the arguing begins... And the silliest of all "better gear than nax in post nax raids". Remember what happened once IC and ToC came? Any form of scaling post-nax additions will inevitably lead to sudden loss of half the game content. You can't add without eventual catch-up, you can't have catch-up without rendering big part of the content useless. 
---
"add add add", "that that that"... yep, easy as that.
---
Yup. If a mob gives you 200xp solo, when you’re in a group with your priest then you only get 100 per kill now. So you really need to get a lot of value out of having that priest. I think there is a group bonus but maybe it kicks in at 3+ and up? I forget
---
Idk why it would be idiotic. You might kbow how to write your own macros but no one will create 20 macros by hand in 30 seconds. But with clique you can
---
Got a NAS full of stuff like Seinfeld, Curb, Office, Always Sunny, and many others. I make random playlists and just let 'er run. And Twitch when there's Overwatch League or a good Starcraft 2 tourney.
---
I agree with a lot of the things you say. With the history of WoW as our only real and first-hand reference for how the game evolves when Blizzard makes changes that the players asked for, it's entirely understandable to not trust them, or even ourselves. 
---
However, I also think that being able to look back at that history and see the effects made by specific changes gives us, and Blizzard, a perspective that we didn't have before. There's a difference between making bad decisions when you don't know any better, and making them when you know exactly how it's going to play out. The community is equally at fault as Blizzard for the state of retail (except for BfA, wtf Blizz). Most of the major changes that were made to the game were either asked for by the players, or lauded by them afterwards (most, but not all. looking at you, Cata talent system...). EDIT: I would expand on this some more, and why I would actually trust a 75-90% majority-required polling system to be implemented, but I don't want this post to get any longer than it is.
---
Personally, when the time comes around for the Classic+ decision to actually be made, I'll have already spent probably 2 years playing the game with zero changes, which will be awesome. But I'm probably not going to continue to dedicate myself to the game if there is going to never be any new content. So at this point, the way I see it is this: If they decide to keep it eternally the same, I'll probably stop playing at some point soon after. If they decide to move forward with Classic+, there's still going to be another long time window where they have to decide on the content, and then actually design and implement it, giving us another 6-12 months probably of 1.12. If the content they add is bad or introduces shitty mechanics, I'll probably stop playing soon after. If the content is good and stays true to vanilla, I'll continue to play for a long while. 
---
The only situation I see that keeps me playing classic long-term (3+ years) is if they add good, vanilla-compatible content. Whether they add no content or add bad content, the end result is the same in my mind: I'll just stop, and that'll be that. The two or so years of pure classic will have been fun. 
---
I'd rather take the risk than keep it stagnant after that long, mainly because I don't see it as a risk. After 2 years, no changes and shitty changes are equivalent scenarios to me. Sorry for the long-winded reply.
---
What was your characters name?
---
Combat is better until you reach a 30% crit threshold (which is impossible until the end of BWL and the beginning of AQ). And Vigor is a PVP talent, we're not talking about PVP here.
---
&gt;I just don't understand your reasoning at all
---
I don't understand why people write paragraphs about things they can't wrap their head around, being judgy, and when pressed still can't come up with better than a false dichotomy. That's when I ask questions, or say nothing.
---
I was in Blackrock PvP. Good times!
---
So are you insinuating that you work for a gold seller?
---
Couple of things. 1) I didn't say you can't have BC but your post essentially said "Give me BC and fuck your classic updates." 2) There has to be a cutoff somewhere, if they made TBC then there would be someone who wants WOTLK, then someone who wants Cata, etc, etc.
---
I started in TBC, but my friends moved to Magtheridon EU at the tail end of vanilla, so I followed em when I got the game. This, the obvious answer is Nihilum. The KT kill vid is what got me to buy WoW.
---
Scholo and Strat you can start around 56 or so, though if you're tanking you probably wanna be closer to 60. 
---
For BRS I would say you definitely want to be 58+ at least. If I was making an UBRS group I'd probably shy away from anyone sub 60 unless it was in the first few weeks of launch.
---
&gt; And apparently people don't want this for some reason.
---
I believe people have that feeling because they want Vanilla back. Once we have everything back and available, the game will eventually need new content, in about 2 years I would say. When that time comes, I really hope Blizzard follows OSRS/Jagex, adds community polls for every major decision and what not.
---
If you ask me, I wouldn't mind an update to Classic, in 2022 or 2023 adding all the TBC content, keeping cap level 60, no flying mounts, new raids will be the new tier of equipment, etc. Just an idea, but the core of the game needs to remain as intact as possible.
---

---
You won't be using scorch either for chili
---
&gt; Are you competing for speedrun times?
---
Yes, but only once a month.
---
I'll be using Shadow Oil because I plan to make gold irrelevant to my play experience. I just saw a post asking for the numbers, so I thought I'd share.
---
Confirmed. Didn't they crack open the AQ gate as well? I remember Kaizo having that mount/title
---
I really liked this video. What was the song you used? You have a nice voice and you dude try to force in jokes. Keep making videos!

This feels like a personal attack on my life strategy... It's almost working I just need to ignore the problems a little longer.

K enjoy giving away your data to everyone.

---
How does this tie in to Windfury? With WF, you can't use a poison on your MH. Will WF proc using Shadow Oil on your MH, and if not, which is better and what's the difference?
---
I was on deatromath at the end of BC and Wotlk; eve of serenity and then some guild starting with U I can’t remember.
---
Shadow Oil is two times better than Poisons in every raid.
---
When you finally get into raids that allow for Fire Damage, you'll have Fire Mages and can use the same consumables plus one cheap food buff to make the effort three times better than Poisons.
---
I think we take for granted how much better digital downloads are.  You don't have to worry about not being able to find a copy. Also you can just start the download and fuck off somewhere instead of having to hang by and switch out 5 different discs.
---
all good things, all things I didn't contest, nobody is saying gnome isn't stronger. Just that expansive mind is not as good as it's made out to be, leaving you with escape artist and engi vs perception. I think perception is a decent ability, as for racials its the worst one of them all, but you can use it to defend a flag or when a rogue restealths in pvp.
---
good to know. thats far more friendly of a price.
---
Your class actually have good Tier 1 and Tier 2 set bonuses!
---
&gt; Whereas you, fine gentleperson, have distinguished yourself to be the best, brightest, prettiest, and kindest
---
Not really, no. We've just established we aren't as retarded as you. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
Villainous VanCleef? Wasnt VanCleef the one who was screwed over by the nobles of stormwind? Id be pretty pissed too if i rebuilt a city then wasn’t paid for it. Team VC all the way. If we could pick sides id choose VC over SW any day.
---
Exactly. You should be using Shadow Oil even before you can spec Seal Fate and using it after you spec Seal Fate is still more damage even if you take Improved Poisons and since you don't want to, it opens up 9% extra raid damage on trash and adds 5% Eviscerate and 1% total damage (on most mobs) damage for you.
---
I think you may have the most fun with undead warrior and orc shaman. just meet at level 5-6 in senjin, with the undead grabbing the org FP and razorhill quests. or you can wait until your undead can grab the RFC quest from varimathras and meet up at the end of your level 10 class quests (maybe bind hearthstone to undercity to grab the quest quicker).
---
ASAP! As soon as you can find a group that will take you!
---
It can be a bit difficult if you're at the minimum level.
---
As a rogue in vanilla, with getting sapped on flare (and I could be wrong here, it's been awhile) you could jump to delay the flare reveal and get the sap off.
---
Better to respecc at 40 for 1g and 60 for 5g, because before 40 you dont go deeper in shadow than 7 pts.  Unless you want to put your shadowform back until 47 but that in my opinion is not worth saving 5g.
---
It's 1g at first.
---
If you have the free time, I'm curious: why do you choose to compete in a pretty mechanically easy game like Vanilla WoW whose principal design focus was the RPG instead of a competitive game where skill is the biggest factor? After I quit retail the first time (after getting a competitive US rank for a few tiers in PvE) I went to SC2. I only played for a couple months and only hit Masters, but even just to get out of Plat the mechanical skill required and the level of competition blew the highest levels modern WoW--which has inarguably more mechanics, more APM, etc. than Vanilla--out of the water, but lacked the world and RPG elements that I liked so much.
---
In short, if you're not into immersion/the world/the RPG why play Classic WoW competitively? Why not play something with a higher skillcap, where you skip the RPG by design rather than paying China?
---
There is no feeling better about being on a PvE server.
---
PvE in dungeons and raids, out in the world.. get ready to rumble.
---
Haha very valid point. Thanks!
---
Feasible is entirely subjective. I'd say most Rogues aren't going to bother with this, but some definitely will.
---
They confirmed it's working as intended so have fun.
---
Just put on Hybrid Theory, that should quench that feel ^^^^(at least for a little while)
---
Ever notice that people who still use retarded as an insult are on the wrong end of the bell curve to criticize?
---
"Take it on holiday" lol
---
A lot of those servers also have vastly increased Lotus spawns. I don't think you realize how expensive Flasks really were in Vanilla. You did *not* use them, even as a caster, except for select encounters that needed them (Patchwerk, Loatheb, C'thun).
---
It’s one sub :)
---
People desperate for early funds
---
It is a fair criticism if verbosity isn’t your thing. It was part of what I enjoyed about the series. If I really enjoy a character or characters, I get attached and want to experience a lot of their world with them. Too often, it’s a single book or a short trilogy, and I have to leave them behind. For the main crew of WoT, it was both a great long ride and a bitter end, like leaving childhood friends behind for good, when book 14 ended.
---
Anyway, if the cast and production go well, I have some hope for the tv series. A lot of the word volume came from Jordan’s detail-oriented style of writing descriptions of scenes and clothing, both of which will now be shown in a second of screen time.
---
I’m disturbed. I just...  why?
---
Personally I enjoy the leveling experience.  I’m not really trying to blow through it as fast as humanly possible.  The way I see it you can either level as you go or go back and level it later.  Although the latter is likely quicker because the mobs die with one hit, you’re not crafting anything usable for a long time.
---
It’s personal preference, but I don’t mind taking my time and crafting cool shit that I can use for the next 5 levels.
---
But I *am* into the immersion, the world, and the RPG mechanics. I just also never give anything but 100% to any hobby. If there's an advantage to be had, if there's a ceiling to push towards, I want it.
---
I see two ways to interpret your post.
---
1) You are a good person, but thought it was an unfair policy so you didn't join
---
2) You knew the policy was fair, but are a bad (or at least selfish) person so you took the loot and left to find a guild where your balance would be at 0 again.
---
I guess you're saying it was dumb to assume you're not selfish?
---
If there's a third interpretation please let me know, and try not to go off on a rant like you've done with everyone else you replied to.
---
You fight ninja looters with pirate looters.
---
Until you hit 60 and actually need to raid tank as prot you should be able to get by fine. Sure, prot spec helps, but it's much more about knowing your class, understanding the pulls and encounters, doing the marking, letting your healers drink as needed.
---
In fact if you level as arms, Tactical Mastery is so important to get intercepts in and Mocking Blows of need be.
---
From Robin Hobbs books.
---
You really think this is the only raid abusing mechanic that was present in vanilla ? I'd bet at least the Spellbinder firebuff thing will still work as well as all the ability abusing mechanics in ZulGurub and Ahn'qiraj
---
One of my toons is always named one of my IRL nicknames. Others I just randomly start writing down combinations of letters until something catches my eye.
---
&gt; Then I turned 16 and realized that these 30 year Old men played 14 hours/day and my awe turned to cynical pity.
---
but now you are 30 and the cycle of life continues!  In all seriousness, though, people who want to be good at stuff or the best need to put in the time.  Pity should be reserved for those who deserve it, not folks who get pleasure out of gaming.  At least this hobby is reasonably affordable, doesn't involve killing real animals like hunting / fishing, and doesn't involve drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, or pokemon.
---
&gt;I'd like to see that list though
---
no you don't, it's depressing
---
Or kick the person and make it known realm wide the guy is a ninja and do your best they never get into a group or a guild again.
---
I don’t think BoE items belong to anyone personally. You win the roll, you equip or sell to your benefit. Everyone gets the chance to win money or an upgrade.
---
Grab first aid!  You’re going to need a lot of money for that 40 mount, so you may want to grab skinning and mining.
---
DKP is such a flawed system without a loot council though. people busy horde dkp for  special items and bis gear
---
38, grabbing a lot of the people I played with in college.
---
I know exactly how expensive Lotus and Flasks were in Vanilla because I still have all my interface backups (and thus my Auctioneer data).
---
&gt; that's like a whole Hunter.
---
Ha, nice.

Ah, don’t remember the name, mine was Jastor but I was awful, doubt you saw my name any either.

No one will ever “fee guilty” for ninja looting fam lol classic is gunna be eye opening for some people lol I’m so excited

MF DOOM, always.

ignore that person, shun them
---
This is a great way to level and to switch. I had multiple priests and once I hit around 52-55 I started doing the work for the Ony attunement and such and pre-BiS. That is when I started working towards my final healing build. Especially if you have a group or guild that will run with you, there is a ton you can accomplish before 60. Lots of +healing items in BRD that are around the 55 level as well.
---
Wand spec is very important and so is spirit tap for leveling. What you max out first depends on what access you have to Wands. Once you get to 40 you have the option to go full shadow. You should be able to heal dungeons and DPS a bit at the same time anyways so I would say it is worth. Dpsing a bit while healing in dungeons as shadow is particularly important to try get last hits on mobs for spirit tap if you're doing dungeons before as shadow for the regen. It is worth saving mind blast for this purpose and trying to snipe last hits.
---
Tailoring and one other profession are good for priests. Enchanting is not really worth picking up until you are 60 and even then is a money sink unless you have super rare patterns. I leveled as Skin/Herb on my first priest and made a lot of money leveling. I also had an alt that was capable of speed running lower dungeons (60 Pally with consecrate) to help grind greens and cloth to eventually switch over to Tailor/Enchant. Tailoring isn't bad to level once you get past Mageweave and running lower dungeons is decent money too.
---
How do you stop people from hording dkp for their bis while disenchanting upgrades because it isn't bis?
---
How does Vigor help you in PvE though? You start with 10 more energy and you don't cap your energy ever again.
---
It's only good for doing a lot of front loaded damage in PvP.
---
Alliance only

Diggy Diggy Hole- windrose

&lt;Immortality&gt; Alliance Skullcrusher. Me as a kid, I was always in awe of every single one of them in insane gear that blew my mind (I raided only up to Razorgore in Vanilla). Also when AQ40 came out they were buying mats for supplies by CoD and were doing raffle give aways to have take every item no questions asked to the person who sent them most of the supplies.... And they paid market price for them (before crazy inflation ofc). 
---
It was just such a cool name, gear, actions, everything about them was awesome in my little 14 year old eyes. 
---
PS: I never had a poor interaction with any person in their guild either which was kinda nice as well.
---
I loved the Silmarillion and thought that Morgoth was one of the coolest names—I loved the last syllable “goth”....which is strange for me to type cuz I never thought of it in any sort of Goth way. Just sounds cool. I also like the name
---
Malfurion A LOT....taking elements from both names I came up with Maeloth probably sometime in 2001 and used that name in lots of games so it was my go to for my first character in WoW.
---
The same people who say this are the ones who didn’t want huge changes to vanilla...
---
I don't entirely disagree but I also think it makes sense. They worked hard to have MC on farm. It would certainly be nice of them to let the newcomer enjoy the fruits of their labor, but it also makes perfect sense to make the newcomer work for their stuff. 
---
I would also assume that with prices like that, many people would be severely negative. He probably wasn't even close to the most negative member. DKP isn't a currency, it's more of a scoring system. The only thing that matters is whether you have more than someone else.
---
mining skinning seems good.
---
You play how you want to and I'll play how I want to. Your PVE performance with Vigor will *not* be the same as if you took something else.
---
6% then consider how much dps is lost when warlocks throw shadow bolts on a target that had the shadow vuln debuff removed. Possibly a net decrease in raid dps.
---
Don't forget enchants and tailoring services
---
I play solo a lot. It's PVE for me all the way. I ain't got time for PVP server shenanigans. Plus, I'm not a ganker.
---
When I feel like living dangerously, I just flag up and watch my back.
---
The same thing as every WoW expansion... the fresh start and a chance to be at the top end of things... even if only for a little bit.
---
Clever girl....
---
Yes, of course you can't trust their word. Which is why many of them turned over their unadulterated review and support logs, even the unpublished ones. Millions of reports, plenty complaints, but not a single one mentioning a suspension or a ban. Nor did the research turn up any reports from a player outside the sites mentioning a suspension or a ban for buying gold, only copies of the email sent by Blizzard.
---
I deleted the comment because while I'm happy to continue debating the topic with you, I didn't want the entire thread to be about this.
---
58-60. 
---
You could make it work earlier, but what’s the point?
---
The quest content from 55-60 quickly becomes irrelevant once you hit 60, get your dungeon gear and enter mc.
---
We will be in phase 1/2 for 4-5 months minimum. There simply isn’t enough content to justify rushing through it.
---
If you’re horde, warlords command starts at 58–that’s your Onyxia attunement chain. Before that I wouldn’t even consider BRS, DM, Steat or Scholo. You’ve got a shit ton to do in blasted lands, w/epl, burning steppes, deltoid, winter spring, un goro. 
---
The same theory applies to questing: focus on yellow and green stuff now, for those still benefit you, if you go for the orange quests now, you’ll benefit enough you don’t need those currently yellow and green quests, but you’ll them be left with no upcoming yellow quests, just more orange or red.
---
This is the second time through the content, I’d worry less about getting everything done ASAP, and more on making sure the game maintains its fun by always having goals to work towards. Tbh the game gets stale when all of your upgrades come from 20-40 man content.
---
Making characters for D&amp;D since you typically develop a backstory for one.
---
I leveled 2 fully heal-spec priests in Vanilla / BC and again on the classic beta. I never liked leveling shadow for class fantasy reasons. Just put your first talent points into Spirit Tap (4 points is enough, IMO) and max out wand specialization. Shield, nuke with holy fire, SW: Pain, maybe 2 smites to get the mob down to about 60% or so and then autowand to death. It’s faster than you think particularly if you’re smart about using soothe mind, fear ward, and your cooldowns regularly to avoid needless deaths and other time wasters. Grind dungeons as a healer and you’ll level fine. We don’t all need to hit 60 in 5.5 days played.

---
In equal gear, Seal Fate Daggers beats out all other specs and even Sword Rogues will want to switch over to Seal Fate too.
---
Literally the entire point of this post was to tell people what to do.
---
No can do my friend. Horde all the way
---
Let’s *NOT* try to preserve this dumb meme.
---
Strawpoll time!
---
Most of the people I encountered on Vanilla private servers are nice and friendly. A certain % are toxic/trolls/elitists, but I'm sure not everyone in Star Wars is a saint.
---
Would be nice, but if they released a collector edition for classic with would sell millions
---
The real question is what is the value of shadow weaving over a normal PI or deep holy spec, when you have maybe 3 warlocks in your raid at the bottom of the dps meter?
---
&gt; There will be no Wpvp in Classic once the phase with honor grind comes out. 
---
At least on Lightning's blade EU horde and alliance used to fight over who's going to have the change to kill those emerald dragons. At that time I used to play in a pvp guild, and we were sometimes recruited to help to fend off the opposing guild to help with those attempts. Also there will be always BRM, Tyr's hand and STV. Those are definitely places where you will see some pvp.
---
&gt;It happened in Vanilla and will happen again. Once people realize they can get the rewards easiest in BGs the Wpvp dries up faster than a nun on Sunday
---
The first r14 player in my guild used to have heartstone in tarren mill just to hs there are terrorize Sorrow hill whenever there was a delay in the que. Its not like they will have 24/7 nonstop bg's. I played to r10 in vanilla and I can tell you there will be definitely be world pvp because that's really big chunk of the initial attractiveness of the game. Why even have 2 factions without any possibilities to interact?
---
Like I said, I want TBC too, but I just didn't like skribsbb's statement. It sounded like the meme of we don't need x, we have x at home, and x at home is something completely different.
---
If you can purge magical buffs just find out the big guilds on the opposite faction and when they raid and just sit in brm and purge them
---
You worry too much man. You gotta remember that it’s an online game, and people will be shitty regardless of what game it is, because people can hide behind a screen and act how they want with no consequence. You need to find like minded people to play with, which won’t be hard. There will be plenty of people like that. For an even safer bet, I’d suggest rolling in an RP server cause most people that play on those are more understanding of others choices and just play the game to enjoy it, not min/max or hate on others.
---
Just get another dildo and goto town. All life's problems are tomorrow's problems.

Devouring plague is a disease and is a huge reason why UD spriests are great. Feral druids have bleeds. Both classes are tough for rogues.

Can someone explain what Ninja looting is and how exactly it works? And a scenario of someone ninja looting.  I don’t understand.
---
It’s tough to generalize about any community, just like it’s tough to make blanket statements about society. 
---
Within the classic WoW community as well as within this subreddit there are helpful people and those less so. It really depends on what everyone here is looking for and sometimes also depends on what moment you catch them on. 
---
If it’s a Saturday afternoon and I’m relaxing and there’s a guy in the group that is playing a class for the first time, or it’s his first MMO, or just simply has no idea what he is doing I’m much more apt to help out. If it’s late and I’m looking to finish a dungeon run as quick as possible before bed I’ll have a completely different demeanor about the guy that keeps wiping the group by aggroing additional mobs. 
---
TLDR; It depends.
---
You know, when I first played I would have a little Portable DVD player set up next to my monitor that I played Pirates of the Caribbean and The Simpson’s movie on repeat on particularly long weekends when I would play all day Saturday/Sunday.
---
Name your pet something generic and let people questing tag themsleves for pvp. Dont know if thats still a thing.
---
I want a hunter but i heard they suck
---
Yep, from A Tribe Called Quest. They were pretty big in the 90s
---
P2W FTW!
---
I've never had any problems using discord. Apart from the occassional disconnect. But those are far apart and extremely rare.
---
I don't think it will.  While Vanilla was more a community, that community was still toxic by today's standards, Classic will be worse.  MMOs are nothing more than a vehicle for their time.  Classic could be line for line of code, and everyone could be sent free CRT monitors and the same internet, and it will still be a completely different game.  Gamers are toxic, and this generation of gaming, where talking is seen as being strange (I once had someone in Overwatch stop playing, during a competitive match, and make fun of me for using periods...), it will be even worse.  
---
But there is hope.  There will be pockets of pleasant people to group and play with.  You've just got to slowly sift through a bog of filth to find them.
---
Please look up the difference between your and you’re.
---
Weird conspiracy theory
---
I think too many would switch from classic to tbc then, but yea I bet it will be like that since it will save blizz a lot of money
---
Fire mage and Hunter snipe people at 41 yards.  Hunter also can viper to eat away enemy teams, and AV is terrible at people getting stuck in combat and not being able to drink.  Hunter can feign and drink.  
---
Frost mage is almost as good of a sniper, but adding in block and barrier for some tankiness.  
---
Any mage is good in the big group fighting at aoe.
---
Conversely healers are good to counter that stuff, priests maybe best overall healing paladins have more survival and and cleanse those viper stings.
---
Cool so you judge the entire faction off barrens quests, got it
---
Anti depressants

No changes

Go with an RP server and you will enjoy 100% of the time online mate. :)
---
Apparently it was added in 1.8, however the headless horsemen and a lot of the fun parts of the holiday weren’t added until TBC.
---
I might try this it seems neat tbh
---
Fair enough.
---
Then again, you do have people who want TBC content downported to level 60.
---
Just look in this thread... [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ceu3sv/if\_they\_ended\_up\_making\_more\_content\_for\_classic/eu56ood?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ceu3sv/if_they_ended_up_making_more_content_for_classic/eu56ood?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
And I will sooner see hell frozen over before I trust Blizzard to not screw up any content updates to Classic if they ever decide to go that way.
---
Allowing for a proliferation of viskags and deathbringers is bad. 
---
I’m not too worried about the t2 helms or the majority of the other loot, tbh.
---
But, if we are worried about fair competition, this is a problem for Nef. 
---
BWL won’t be killable until an entire raid has the cloak. Ony drops 2-3(?) scales per kill. Meaning at a minimum it is taking 13 weeks of killing ony to kill nef.
---
If blizzard speeds up the pace of content release, its possible they could release bwl, 13, 16, 20 weeks after launch. The abuse of lockouts like this, could give certain teams an advantage in clearing bwl—especially if they weren’t no life tryhards who killed ony week 2.
---
Druids can can grief rogues by keeping them stuck out of stealth. Worth it just for that
---
So like... only certain ads are showing on a given "layer" of audience? :D :D :D :D /s

If you expect all gold selling companies to be morally sound simply because some that you know of turned over some of their data, then that's up to you. It was pretty common knowledge that hacked accounts accounted for much of the gold that was bought and sold during the times that this was a bigger market. 
---
My point is, you're putting a lot of faith into some shady companies. Additionally, it's a practice some of your fellow players would ridicule you for if you were to discuss it so openly, but I'm not judging you for that to be clear. I'm merely questioning you because you're stating things as 100% factual based off of very little information, considering you're an outsider to Blizzard and the parties making money off of selling gold.
---
Fair enough for deleting your comment.

Anything and everything :)

Its a social game but its easy to exclude yourself and play things solo. Ask for help, say hi, offer advice, tell a Chuck Norris joke, etc.
---
Have visibility among others in your leveling zone to make the zone a more pleasant experience. /1 is General chat, so chat generally.

Bought one Of these at hot topic like 10 years ago.

#nochanges
---
There is no clear definition, but generally a player who need rolls on loot he does not need.
---
BoEs all roll need I agree
---
Huh. Legacyplayers is showing a lot of the top parses using Swords or am I missing something?
---
I have a feeling people are generally gonna be more friendly on classic then in retail because people will feel the importance of community on this version.
---
1. Farm Devilsaur leather. Engage is highly contentious PvP. Make sure to flare so rogues dont gank you and steal the leather.
---
2. Farm maradoun. Doing this now on my troll hunter on a pserver. Quite relaxing actually once you get it down.
---
3. Farm leather in Burning Steepes. North-eastern area is fantastic, plus you can swap over to farming ogres of you get PvPed out
---
4. Farm black pearls??? In STV, that shit sells high.
---
5. Pets - BrokenTooth (general and PvP pet) in badlands. Level 40ish.
---
You aren't a Warlock until you've tricked Goldshire lowbies into clicking the Ritual of Doom pedestal with promises of Fun™.
---
I'm almost 100% going to play a Dwarf.  
---
I'm primarily thinking of playing a PVE Rogue so that I can play a low-stress role in raids, and so that I can goof off in WPVP without much trouble.  
---
But I'm also entertaining the idea of doing a warrior, since tanks are usually high in demand, warrior was my main the first time around, and I prefer the melee fighter playstyle.
---
Ok? It’s clearly a post made by a maniac who thinks his version of WoW is “correct” because of some math and a stat sheet. It’s not correct. It’s just a preference. It’s also dismissive because his spreadsheet doesn’t show him something even though it is entirely correct. Intangibles exist. Uptime differences exist. Adds exist. 
---
Vigor performs at a similar level through AQ. Use poisons if you want and your raid is okay with it. You’ll do 312dps instead of 314 and the boss will die or not die just the same.
---
Getting lost in dungeons.
---
Now a days I can go the wrong way in a dungeon, but damn do I miss being in a group trying to figure out where to go in BRD/LBRS. That was an amazing dungeon diving experience. I think the prevalence of online guides will cut down on that this time around, but I am looking forward to it none the less.
---
I read your post, and thought, "what the hell is love island?". 
---
I'm very sorry friend.
---
No debt?
---
No, I just disagree with your definition of "ninja looting".
---
If everything's so buttery smooth and on-demand, why have stress tests at all ? If it's a software test then doing a multi-regional test is pointless (since the traffic is separated), and if it's about marketing or doing a census, then why would they suddenly have to delay it ?
---
While it's worth it to do some green quests in a zone to get access to others or because they are really quick to do, it's generally not worth it unless you are really weak (playing a warrior with an outdated weapon). When I go to Darkshore, I do some green quests that have really low level mobs, but I do them to get access to other higher level quests, not because they grant me a ton of exp.
---
lmao is that satire, that high elves and goblin shit has me geekin.
---
I raid lead weekly PUGs in Vanilla on my alt, and raid lead two different raid groups from TBC-Wrath.  My biggest piece of advice is don't lead the raid and the guild.  Have someone else deal with guild bullshit, class bullshit, loot bullshit.  Delegation, delegation, delegation.
---
When it comes to raid leading, the most important thing you need to do is create a fun environment.  Everyone likes to post and giggle about "more dots", but nobody wants to play in that kind of raid atmosphere.  Every now and again you need to lay the hammer down.  But for each time you knock a player down, you've got to build them back up.
---
This will be anecdotal, but take it for what it's worth.  I like playing Overwatch drunk.  I'm talking splattered in competitive.  My average aim on McCree drops from 55-60% down to 30s and 40s.  My healing on Ana plummets.  But each time I wake up the next day my SR has climbed 200-300 points.  No shit.  Every time.  Yes I'm sure there is a limit to how far this will go (I bounce from low plat to low diamond), but so far this strategy has rung true.  So, I record a game one night, and watch it the next day.  
---
You know what the difference is?
---
I'm like Frank Gallagher, I'm a happy drunk.  When I play sober I make the correct, succint, and emotionless callouts.  When I'm drunk I'm showering people with compliments, building them up, saying "it's alright, we got this", telling them "good job.  Good fucking job!".
---
Do the same thing when you raid.  Solve problems, but let people know when they've done good.
---
Grinding for something that last more than 1 patch.
---
Sounds like something someone upset at being called a retard would say. But hey, someone making comment about your behavior got you this worked up. You're doing a good job of further proving my point.
---
Needing on items that are not for your class, how is the definition any different?
---
What?
---
Undead rogue and I played with a Tauren warrior named Thacker
---
I am gonna disagree with you.
---
People already know "where do i go from here", they did it for many years on pservers, the same people are still playing on pservers restarting on new realms etc it has been happening for a long time.
---
I know some people will want a tbc server, but alot of players are still playing on 1.12 pservers even AFTER they cleared everything and went full bis. 
---
If Classic eventually dies as in noone is playing it thats when to discuss whats next, and that will probably be an optional TBC.
---
If classic got classic+ does that mean we are getting tbc+ to?
---
or LK+ ? what about cata+ mop+, legion+ ?
---
I'm learning a lot about it. Gotta love this sub.
---
Why would you announce that you’re going to buy gold?
---
Lol at all you just said. First week clear for all content not good? And yes all of our warlocks would probably leave if we didn't have weaving. I dunno what you're smoking but pass it on over bro
---
Maybe you should put an end to posts with extra content 2-3 years prior to actually hitting somewhat the end of the damn game.
---
Yes please
---
The whole point of Classic is that it is supposed to be as close to the original as possible. Adding stuff goes directly against that.
---
If you travel halfway around the world to see the Mona Lisa in person, then discover that museum staff have ruined it by painting a beanie on her head, then you are going to be upset.
---
On the other hand if you have been staring at a knock-off version of the classic painting every day for the last 8 years then you might be excited that the real Mona Lisa has had some shitty additions made to it, because you have grown bored of the original.
---
But if you are bored of the original then you should probably just fuck off and go do something else instead of trying to ruin a classic for everyone else.
---
A) Yes
---
B) Yes, spell coefficient is calculated from the base cast speed of the ability, and the ability shadow oil throws out is a warlock shadowbolt rank3 ability. 
---
C) From what I've seen, none of it.
---
I can't agree with this. I've tab-multiboxed a warrior + healer four different times in the past three years 1-60. Each time I had a /played of under 8 days, and I never rushed. I tend to Netflix my way through leveling. I reckon that's still faster than the *average* solo warrior to take to ding 60. Only the most hardcore and experienced warriors would actually perform better solo.
---
Goldshire whores
---
&gt; verigans us wery time consuming 
---
I read this in Chekov's accent
---
thanks
---
In Vanilla:
---
* I rolled a priest so that I could sit in BRM and throw people into the lava when they went for MC/\*BRS
---
* I rolled a hunter because this hunter on our server use to fuckup our AQ20 raid in Silithus with cheetah kiting + multishot.
---
* I rolled a warlock to dump Infernals on people.
---
I might be a jerk. PvP servers were so much fun!
---
Only for STV leveling though.  Otherwise, classic WoW isnvery relaxing imo (minus PvP)
---
As much as I like minmaxing, I think I'm gonna pass on buying flask and spellpower pots to buff my offhand weapon..
---
Don't give Activision any ideas that might make them money...
---
Taking my original shamans name , Okomim, because I had I just broken away from a conservative church and it stood for Only king of me is me.
---
Fun side note, my phone autocorrects Okomim to Solomon apparently.
---
Classic+ just seems too risky.
---
1) You have 2  very popular expansions they can go through before going into the unknown with Classic+. I'm going by sub numbers here, not personal opinions.
---
2) Not trusting them to do Classic+ right is valid. Just imagine that Classic is as succesful as we all hope and shareholders/Activision demand better monetization. What better way to do it than Classic+?
---
3) Your argument that the community made sure that the "quality and soul" of Classic stay intact really doesn't hold much weight. Just look at this subreddit and people who I would bet were the biggest #nochanges supporters want things like leeway or spell batching "fixed" (the hunter scatter/trap DR drama is particularly delicious indeed). The community you're talking about would fall apart and the direction of Classic+ would be left for Blizzard to decide. **You even prove this point yourself: " Yes, Blizzard has made many really awful decisions for the game. \[...\]  But, many of the bad decisions that led WoW to its downfall seemed like  completely reasonable ideas at the time. Many decisions were massively  pushed for by us, the community."**
---
4) Any Classic+ patches, even if done properly, would once again make it into a different game. You could wait another 10 years for "True Classic" or never get it at all (unless you played on pservers).
---
5) Classic seasonal servers on a 2-3 year loop with D3 season style (play a season and then get your character transferred to a non-seasonal server) are just so much safer than any other option. If they add opt-ins into later expansions, all the better for all of us.
---
Because the private server people have been playing "Classic" for 8 years and they are already bored of it before it even comes out. The only reason they want to play is to race to the end to try to brag about how many socks they pooped in.
---
They don't want Classic. They are bored of Classic. They want something new that isn't Modern WoW. They want something that is familiar enough to where they don't have to relearn everything they've obsessed about on private servers for the past  8 years, but different enough to distract them from their mundane lives.
---
Vanilla healing simply does not work in the neat and tidy fashion that you just depicted. If I see a tank below 50% hp with no weak soul debuff they will be getting a shield. Talking about rage gen issues in 40mans lol
---
Plus shielding casters on aoe pulls prevents deaths, which saves time, saves world buffs etc. Shielding is an integral part of 40man priest duties. Idk how you can think otherwise. Mana efficiency means nothing if you don't go oom, which most of the time you won't be anyway
---
The cake is a lie.
---
I enjoyed smashing pals for life in pvp on LS XD.
---
Oh.  Wow. That’s so messed up.  Thank the gods, old and the new for master looter right?
---
Post again when you actually first week clear. Any intelligent warlock understands weaving is a waste for a first clear situation. You are not going to have prebis first week, making deep holy even better. Youd be better off with another melee dps and a real deep holy than having a priest doing weaving for week 1.
---
imo, up until level 40, the fastest levelling spec is Disc with the mana regen talents. It's less dps than shadow, but you don't need to stop and drink, so overall it's faster. And as a bonus, it's great for healing instances, too.
---
At 40, you can respec shadow if you want shadowform (imo, shadow isn't really worth it until then). Otherwise, 40+ is when it's easier to find groups. As a priest, you never need to solo unless you want to. "Lvl 40 healbot priest looking for questing buddy for the next 2 hours" will get you a dozen tells, especially from warriors. I recommend pairing with a rogue, though. Their dps is higher, and unlike a mage or other caster, they never need to stop and drink.
---
I wouldn't recommend a shadow-healing hybrid build. With shadow, either you're all-in, or you're better off sticking with disc or holy. Holy damage spec does more dps than a shadow-healing hybrid, and disc has similar damage with more longevity.
---
I know your post is 1 month old, but[zUI](https://github.com/Ko0z/zUI)

It's mostly hindsight but I could've been in &lt;Death and Taxes&gt; while they were on Shattered Hand.  They weren't as big back then as they would eventually get, and I can't even really say I was dying to be in their guild at the time since I was already in &lt;Death Dealers&gt; and we thought we were hot shit already.  DD, DnT, Vermilion, Skyfang... So many awesome guilds on SH back in Vanilla and BC.
---
Kara was supposed to be in Vanilla

Southshore vs Tarren nill was organized. that's the 10% that weren't a dumpster fire. the rest....well i guess you allbknow STV
---
Are you asking if something that clearly goes beyond pixels and is non-pixel related is only pixels?
---
I believe that anyone who kills you or otherwise inconveniences you ingame through legal game mechanics is playing the game in a completely valid manner.  Particularly on a pvp server.  If your logical leap from that is I condone sexual harassment then you need to get a life.
---
Sick humblebrag bro
---
Thanks, congrats to you as well! I get two weeks, which is better than most! Legitimately thinking of rolling rogue just so I can stealth afk if I need to change a diaper/feed etc lol
---
[Peeling the Onion](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=19483#comments)
---
This is my vote. Many of my longtime hardcore PvP nerds are rolling PvE in Classic because they are either mainly focusing on retail Mythic raiding, or don't have the time and willpower to deal with insane world ganking after the server starts to settle. Add in streamers and grief-ers, and you've got a pretty nasty cocktail. Plus organized PvP is still very much a thing if you'd like to do it.
---
You'll find way better people in game than on reddit - you'll have a ton of fun learning the game on the fly, don't try and pre-plan every second for August 26/27 - most people that want to rush to 60 will be done with the game by November/ December.
---
The atmosphere won't be what it was 15 years ago but that wont affect you since you didn't play it :)
---
7 year olds and 70 year olds will be playing classic - there will be plenty of people on whatever server you choose to play on, that will match what you are looking for.
---
Thanks Peter
---
How many people lifted the headset to talk and not wear it? This makes me think I'm using the bathroom wrong or something.
---
After months of contemplating what to play, ranging from dwarf priest on a PVE server, to undead mage on a PVP server, I think I have decided.
---
So now: Why shouldnt I play an Undead Mage on a PVP server? Try to knock me off the position that took me months of going back and forth to get.
---
I was on Medivh as well. Fury and Ascent were definitely the guilds to drool over. I played as Alliance back then and remember Ascent raiding Ironforge numerous times, or just wanting to PvP In Dun Murogh. It was exhilarating going against them, I still remember some of their names such as Jeigermeister and Evovii.
---
To be fair,  my first time levelling to 60 took me about 4 months when I was an oblivious 14 year old brand new to MMOs.  I can do it in about 4-6 weeks now but I'd say 4 months is a fair expectation of people who are brand new and won't be able to play 30+ hours a week.

---
World draw distance is 60 yards on beta, be careful when you charge.
---
Get a ranged weapon.
---
Always have a stack of food. Don't bother cooking just buy food from innkeepers
---
First aid is bis.
---
Hamstring kiting is still good but different from pservers.
---
Don't dualwield.
---
White weapons aren't bad.
---
You don't necessarily need a slow 2h, all that matters is the top end of weapon damage.
---
Know your limits. Hamstring and running away is faster than a corpse run.
---
Figure out what spec you want to go. There's a lot of arguments on fury vs arms. Do your own research and commit to it. 
---
If you're going to die and there's nothing you can do, unequip your weapon.
---
Oh yes. That’s a bad idea. I was thinking more of a raid instance with 20 or 40 people guild run
---
Hear hear
---
What about formulas? Not for any specific class. What about items that can be worn by multiple classes? What if that item is prebis for one class but just an upgrade for the other?
---
"I need this more than you" is always debatable and people will never agree, especially if they have a vested interest in "needing" the item more than the next guy. This is why it's best to all need on big ticket BOEs, that way no one gets upset. Otherwise it devolves into petty arguments about how it's not that big of an upgrade, or how the paladin can use this or that, but the warrior will tell you that paladins shouldn't need on this or that and stick to robes, etc. I don't really like to deal with the headache.
---
Well there are still tons of software infrastructure practices to test like how layering functions at a software level. They are likely still tweaking layering and other software features. 
---
But your original comment said something about waiting on hardware.  My point was only that they surely aren't waiting on hardware, as the hardware are just servers sitting in an AWS warehouse.
---
I remember &lt;The Church of RNG&gt; and &lt;Exodus&gt; the most from Cho’gall... I’m also very surprised to see any other member of CG in this thread lol.   Cheers to what it used to be.

&gt; If you want Classic wow to become another game then thats ok 
---
It already is another game. Vanilla has become BfA, and Classic is a separate, faithful recreation of the first iteration of the game. But yes, some people do want it to become another game, want it to have longevity, want to have a second chance for vanilla to stay on the right path this time. Emphasis on *become*. I'm not asking for the game to be released like this, that's insane. 
---
&gt; But forcing new content on people who wants classic wow is the same as what blizzard have been doing already with multiple expansions. 
---
You're still getting Classic wow, though? We've got a solid 2-3 years of guaranteed no changes, pure vanilla, progression through the content phases. We *know* what we're getting for that already, and we're excited. What we don't know is what's after that. 99% of the playerbase in Vanilla didn't get to kill KT before BC released. We don't know what a content drought is going to be like for the game after phase 6. The best guess we can make is looking at private servers, which were much smaller than Classic is going to be, and who also cycled fresh servers for this very reason.
---
A boomkin is a waste because the amount of damage they provide + what they do by themselves is lower than the amount a real caster would provide. The same can't be said for a pi/weaving priest because I'm a healer. By me speccing weaving my guild can bring another dps. And no, me going pi/weaving and counting as a healer will not be a detriment to the raid group in any fashion
---
&gt; What will I need to track/take into account/make sure my players have done
---
* Attunements
---
* Resist gear (including having crafters at Exalted with relevant factions for each raid tier)
---
* Aqual Quintessence for MC
---
* Watching videos/reading guides about fights
---
* Consumables
---
* Reagents
---
* Correct hearthstone location
---
* Prebis
---
* World buffs (e.g. songflower which you can get reliably)
---
* Warlocks: soul shards
---
I'm looking forward to be the namesake of your alt

---
Im the same way, but at least I know what im going to play. Im either going to play warrior, rogue, hunter, mage, druid, warlock, priest or shaman! Ive narrowed it down to these few!
---
Something about tanking a dungeon and getting complimented by the rest of your party on how smooth the run was never gets old.
---
I know a fuck load more than you do. Sit down.
---
I think he means that questing in Dun Morogh after Elwynn until you're level 18?
---
Local Defense was my answer for this question. I think I remember your dad's character name (though didn't know him personally, I was also like 11)
---
&gt;that's like a whole Hunter
---
I wanna play hunter but God damn this is depressing lol
---
Wep skill is well understood, there were many write ups on it on elitist jerks and warrior forums. There was even a blue post in vanilla clarifying how it works. +7 skill gauntlets were known to be bis and were very expensive from aq on.  
---
The mechanic is basically it drastically reduces white damage glancing blows which massively benefits fury warriors. It's between 5-8% depending dps on your gear level on buffs.
---
I prefer to listen to the the death-wails of the nearest horde scum. 
---
Tor ilisar'thera'nal!
---
This is more than just misinformation. It is dumb. Hunters deal *20% more* dps than warlocks in BiS. They deal roughly 5-10% less than rogues on patchwerk, but are a ranged class that's easier to position.
---
A hunter that knows how to position, how to use raid utilities like tranq, pulling, and aspect of the wild, and when to/not to bring out their pet is every bit as valuable as a rogue. Don't believe the alarmist crap that dealing 90 less dps than a rogue in a straight dps zerg makes you unviable. Hunters and rogues being the only dps specs with a threat drop make you an uneven comparison to other dps.You are not by any means a ret paladin.
---
Once the pserver true believers realize that correct parry haste is important and you can't infinite threat dual wield fury tank every boss on progression, people will value your aggro drop and there won't be any reason to consider you less valuable than a warrior, rogue, or warlock.
---
I find that hard to believe, obtuse people don’t have many real talks with other humans they just hear and see what they want.
---
well done
---
Private servers have nothing to do with Classic. Only private server poop sockers think that.
---
Quiet, grandpa
---
well you could move for about one to x seconds. The root doesn't re apply while you have the debuff on you. But the moment you don't have the entrapment root on you the game rolls 25% on every slow pulse against you again. In the worst case scenario that means you sit the full duration of the trap in roots - or the ultimate worst case you get another root at the last pulse - hence the 44 sec notice
---
Load balancing based off application. Nice. Awesome technology.

&gt; Why are we discussing adding more content to something that havent been released yet? Why are so many obsessed with getting new exclusive content for Classic wow?
---
Well classic was actually released 15 years ago, we know exactly what's in it.  And while it's going to take people a little while to play through it again it's not like we don't know what's there.
---
There was a bunch of great guilds too.

Have you ever met a jerk? If so, there are likely jerks in WoW just like they're likely in Star Wars, just like there are in real life.  With retail wow, its a hollow game.  No risk, just press buttons and win.  It's a solo experience unless you do dungeons. With dungeons you don't really even *need* to interact with others.
---
With classic, the difficulty is a lot higher. You'll have group/elite quests where it can be very difficult to take on an elite. So you'll see people talking in General chat asking for help with various quests or asking where a quest mob is located (Mankirk's wife for Horde was common).
---
Don't let that dissuade you from playing WoW. I urge you to come to your own conclusion because if you don't try then you won't know. You might ask a friend about WoW and they'll say it's toxic and bad.  You might try it and have a completely different experience or you could have a similar experience.
---
Kvatch. Had just finished Oblivion
---
I can’t share where I got my name from and if I did everyone would claim my name on every server.  And my alts names are great too.  Once lunacy happens. I’ll share my names.  You’ll all be mind blown!
---
Thank you for clearly explaining your position. You only hear and see what you want and that is why you outright reject truth.
---
Jesus so condescending.  It’s interesting to see how perception of online gaming has evolved.  “And that’s what you refer to them as... your friends?”  Yeah you dolt stop making it sound so weird.
---
Don't worry, Blizzard added a mechanic only hunters can beat to 5 of the 70+ raid encounters in Vanilla and all of them are progression fights, so you'll have a spot even though your damage is bad.
---
Fair enough, but I think it’s a bit presumptuous to assume that PServer players are like the majority of the crowd that Classic will pull in. Nothing wrong with Pserver players (I am one of them) but they really are an outlier. 
---
And PServer is a lot of people that play because it’s free, or if it’s actually out of love of X expansion, they went out of their way to research Pservers, find out how to access them and downloaded it. I think it’s safe to say most of the Classic population will be returning players that stopped playing in X expansion, or Retail players that may or may not like Vanilla. This crowd is the majority, and if a majority says “I love this, but X sucks”, it’s not out of the question to see Blizzard following the majority’s opinion, sort of like OSRS.
---
This does create issues and worry if it does play out this way, as when you go by a majority, tons of players will be from retail and aren’t the people in this Sub. You get people that really want layering for an easier leveling experience, people that want transmog, people that want their spec to be viable. To me the safest way to deal with it is an optional server so it doesn’t change Blizz-like servers.
---
And even going back to the people you know that still raid Naxx. I have a max mage (BWL geared, nothing amazing) on that server, and those people that have cleared Naxx, see their server dead and every time they get to that point on a server see everyone leave again for a fresh realm? A lot of them want things like Vanilla Kara, Grom Batol, just something to keep players there or have a reason to use their gear.
---
Again, most players won’t get to that mentality or understand if they want it or not until they’ve experienced Vanilla and know if they want more of it (Classic +), want to experience it again (Fresh), or want to try BC.
---
Your point of then needing to make BC + and WOTLK + though is a very good point. And is likely their thought too. Avoiding opening that can of worms of supporting many versions of each expansion can’t really compare to OSRS
---
All good above except DO GET COOKING. You'll be glad you have it later on.
---
And maybe pick up piercing howl talent. It's nice to have occasionally for runnig away.
---
Thanks for the reply, I'm trying out arms atm because of of hamstring kiting and rend atm. As far as professions, I'm thinking of going skinning and mining so I can have gold for my mount at 40. After that maybe drop skinning for engineer or should I stick with skinning and join a devilsaur mafia? Probably more focused on Pvp this time around
---
Honestly I was so young and such a scrub I doubt anyone even remembers me from CG so I haven’t even bothered with Vanillafriends.com. I wasn’t in any major guilds but I just remember being in awe of Church and exodus every time I saw them.
---
“Mirror mirror?” i guess I should have expected a 3rd grade level comeback from someone like you haha.
---
That’s for being unwilling entertainment, I’m done with you.
---
Your chance to hit on classic servers increases drastically at lower levels. That alone will make things much easier.
---
Train up cooking as you level. Spirit scales extremely well into warriors health Regen, which food will give you.
---
I'd say the character sheet is just calling the base regen 'mp5' because it's easy to understand. I don't know if there's bugs in the calc or there's some hidden base class/race regen that makes the numbers a bit wonky.  
---
Casting regen for all classes is definitely 0% by default.
---
There's no such thing as a BoE ninja looter. If it has value, everyone should be rolling need.
---
Expensive BoE? Need. Nuff said.
---
Just have everyone need all BOEs. After some one wins they can decide if    they want to give it to someone to use.  That way there is no ninja looting.
---
I tried creating an account yesterday on mobile but kept getting errors about my email address being invalid. I'm going to try on my desktop later.

I just see those stupid "Tank Jack does blah blah blah" ads.

There's a line in LotR that's something like "you dwarves are so loud we can find you at night just from the sound of your breathing."

Thus, Loudbreather the dwarf priest was born.

Shadow Oil procs should definitely be consuming improved shadowbolt charges.  If they didn't on the beta that's a bug.

World pvp

This is a person that is flagrantly saying they're going to buy gold, I wouldn't try arguing the economics of minmax with them when they're saying cost is quite literally no object to them.

I think that’s where the fun is. 
---
Choice.
---
You level as Fury with a 2 hander. No questions asked. You tank by keeping a few pieces of tank gear at all times, no need to respec. A shield, one hander and maybe some stamina gear at most.
---
Fury does not compare to Arms at all in high end PvP. Warriors are wanted for the MS effect. A Fury Warrior with great gear can kill people, but moreso in a pug level where people are just doing their rotations. Arms is what you want to be.

WoW is only the 5th MMO to release a "Classic" version. But of course it has nothing to do with the industries long history and ever growing trend of remastering old games. It has nothing to do with the wild success of EQ Classic and OSR. It's all only because of the private server and their crayon drawing representation of what Vanilla used to be.
---
Ya right. Get a grip on reality. Look at the world you live in. Attributing Classic WoW to private servers is as stupid as calling EQ a WoW clone.
---
Wow that’s useful. Thank you!
---
&gt;  just trying to buy the item for cheap and turning it around on the AH for a quick profit.
---
lol, that's what you call being nice?
---
&lt;Banana Boys&gt; on horde was the top guild for a long time
---
No. The section is specifically about obtaining in-game anything for commercial use and specifically mentions obtaining currency for the purpose of selling it. Neither of those terms apply to buyers.
---
The child is still ranting? 
---
I guess obtuse and childish would be fitting characteristics.
---
Enjoy writing another wall I won’t read, going out now, bye bye
---
And what if I want to play vanilla wow in 4 years?
---
thank you, i was about to get upset
---
FUCK those guys.  They've tricked me a few times.  Their ad dept is spot on lol
---
&gt; It's good, if you are fine with healing in both pve and pvp and just want to farm with the same build.
---
That's exactly what I was going for, yes the single target pve/pvp dmg blows but I just want to be a healer and manage well on my own outside of raids to farm packs of mobs. The reason I left PoJ out is because any other boot enchant isn't that useful, maybe the +7 stamina but I'd rather have 2 talent points. I mean there's really no good options to get to Ret aura for this build, since I'm not gonna be judging most of the time and SoC/Vindication doesn't help either, so meh.
---
Or try to do the right thing and make sure no one else gets their stuff ninja'd too? Doing the right thing sometimes requires work, but it's usually worth it.

Layer 7 is a type of load balancer, Snapt is the company selling the service

&gt;Mob swing animations are entirely unreliable for their actual damage point, so you just have to do it by gut feeling

---
I agree that strafing is better but have no fucking clue what you're talking about with your strafing angles. The jump strat is best done to avoid initial aggro daze so you make/keep distance.
---
Many guides on the web, google it.
---
(C) "Performing in-game services in exchange for payment outside the Game" 
---
This blanket clause covers any exchange, including purchasing gold and items for payment outside of the game. I'm not arguing that Blizzard hounds gold buyers, but if they wanted to, they certainly could under this clause.
---
Invest in apple stock.
---
When Pro changes crowd can no longer even argue their points, they try to tone police and deflect.
---
No we will not see "how people feel". This is a classic game. We want it to live on for future players, it deserves that.
---
Take your shitty changes, nu-Blizzard, corny ideas and go kill other Blizzard games. Let us at least have this.
---
Another point on mage is keeping distance for polys, CS etc.
---
not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need
---
I think most Classic servers are going to have enough of everything to not care about what goes on at other servers. We're not getting 250+ realms, we're getting ~25.
---
&gt; at the cost of the sanctity of the immersion, the world, and the RPG mechanics that you claim to be into
---
Joana's speed runs is a place to look guy used to level 1-60 as a hobby.
---
No changes!
---
Arms and mortal strike is essential for pvp.
---
You can tank in any spec, tactical mastery definitely helps but it is possible without it
---
2h Fury is a thing for horde earlier in the raiding meta because of windfury
---
I didn’t know it was possible to avoid oneself
---
Correct. It's funny I really didn't remember that but I associated the event to the headless horsemen because that was just awesome.
---
I really hope classic ends with TBC
---
Because it's a bannable offense.
---
It can really help to get a mouse with extra buttons. Not like the insane mmo mouse, but one with 4-6 comfortable, easy buttons. Also bind your mousewheel up/down. And of course unbind Q/E and put strafe on AD.
---
My highest pri buttons are
---
QERF1234
---
Mouse wheel Up/down
---
Mousebutton 1/2/3
---
That’s 13, modified by Shift/Alt = 39
---
That’s usually enough for combat related stuff. The rest is bound to 5-0, zxc etc
---
Minions of mithril and became later Inner sanctum at silvermoon EU. Best guild
---
Well, that's your opinion. To me, the social economics and the actual economics of an MMO are the best parts.

It is not.

I've seen that his runs aren't super efficient anymore, but it would be a good place to start!
---
My worry is that routes done on private servers might not be accurate. (Not related to Joana, just something I thought of)
---
This is a great copy pasta. Where did you get it from lol?
---
Dun Morough, Wetlands, loch modan, and STV. I can't wait to get my dwarf back out questing in those zones!
---
I’m playing Troll so I’m always happy with Raptors
---
Arms has a lot of benefits while leveling, especially with access to tactical master and the limited benefit of early fury talents outsides of cruelty.  The lack of sit/crit in classic also makes Fury worse for leveling than it is on pservers.
---
I like both the Outlands and Northrend. The problem is that older zones were made completely useless after each new expansion. If there was no level cap, old content was still relevant, old gear was still decent (a bit worse than the new BiS) and the player capacity was increased (unless each server can't handle, I don't know, 20k people), it would probably be fine to have a big world.
---
Agree with removing or complete rework (i.e. **nerf**) of flying mounts and old elements such as the talent tree.
---
I’m pretty sure you won’t be able to do that.
---
If you were capable, you wouldn’t have to ask for guides tbh.
---
&gt; have you ever played this game?! It's like you only played retail.
---
idk why you gotta take shots at me or assumptions.
---
First off that 240 hours is hugely off, thats what im talking about when i said side tracking.
---
Second idk anyone who would only put in 2 hours a day, as busy as i am i plan to do a fair bit more than that.
---
long story short, the average time it takes someone whos barely trying isnt a useful statistic
---
That weak attempt at a burn is what I mean by Nerd Humor.  And it's why I often do my best to avoid such people.
---
not being an asshole and degrading that person is what I do not want people to do. Some need motivation to not be this way, hence my suggestion.
---
&gt; Enjoy writing another wall I won’t read, going out now, bye bye

Oh are you going to leave for real this time? Or have you been hiding from reality and spewing bullshit for so long that you can't stop yourself from lying to make yourself appear to be more than you actually are every time someone challenges you. You've been doing it for so long, and convinced that it actually works, that you don't smell the stink of your own bullshit. Everyone else can smell it. Everyone else can see you for what you really are.
---
I hope for your sake that you really do shut up and fuck off this time.
---
No. Buyers are not "performing in-game services in exchange for payment outside the Game".
---
\1. Calling that a rant in a forum where layering causes frothing at the mouth is weaksauce.
---
\2. What's with the tone argument? You trying to establish dominance with a little chest beating? Trying to bait me into saying anything you can twist as a tone argument so you can dismiss me with an oversimplified ultimatum?
---
\3. Cenarion gear sucks. Shoulders are the only piece that's better than what you can get in 5 mans (at least in leather) (boots are a tie), and they're still worse than the other off-set (leather) shoulders in MC. I had just been charged more DKP than I could earn in 20 weeks of raiding for gear that I could not, in good conscience, wear while raiding (two pieces available on the AH for the same price as nexus crystals. I could have given them the gold that would cost what, $5 to a gold farmer instead of 2 1/2 weeks at a full time job). Imagine getting charged for downgrades that you had to take, and every marginal upgrade going forward would be forced on you, placing you in further indentured servitude. Even ignoring the immature notion that "equal = fair" put forth by the guy replying, there's a simple motivational issue: I would spend my entire "career" with that guild watching my DKP number go deeper and deeper into the hole. I would never climb out, and would never feel like part of the team. Another naked druid could at any point join and gear themselves with priority to a similar gear level with less debt. I would never roll for any neck, ring, trinket, or held item ever. The only items I could ever loot from a current raid would be set piece items every other druid (including new ones who start at 0 DKP) didn't want; even non-set leather would go to shamans or spell power hunters.
---
This wasn't some clever scheme to ninja loot. If I'd known the deal in advance, I would have balked, and never gone on the raid. Imagine if you were recruited for a job (and yes, I was recruited), and they flew you out to interview, and then said "by the way, you owe us for the plane, and you will never owe us less than what we pay you." That's a multi-level marketing scam. If I'm always gonna be a raid (or two) behind, why not experience that with a guild doing *that* raid, where I can feel valued and valuable? I don't have to be a saint to think that's not for me.
---
&gt;report them if you must, and move on.
---
Play on a low pop oceanic server.  Good luck.
---
But since that one is limited supply they can't sell millions
---
To repeat myself on that topic. TBC over classic+
---
The moment they open the box that would be called classic+ people will demand the class changes of TBC. Why? Because they know that they exist and that this made the gameplay much smoother.
---
So why bother with Classic+ when it would just end up being TBC in the old world anyway. It is a safe bet and much cheaper for them to go for TBC.
---
Aside from that. The gear balance of classic is already a huge mess. AQ40 gear and naxx are so batshi...flip insane overpowered that they trivialize everything that's not a part of those raids. Even the buffed R14 gear stands no comparison vs that gear. Now classic+ content would have to add world and raid content that would be upgrades to people with AQ/naxx gear. Making the entire thing even more insane. (and as reminder. People were still using T3 minus weapons in T4 and T5 content at lvl 70 - just to give you a comparison of the gear's power. They've never made gear so overpowered again that it would trivialize not just one but 2 additional raids - in the next xpac)
---
So a classic+ would most likely not be possible without changes ... and we know how much people like changes :p
---
I like to use penis slang from different regions of the world for my toon names. Especially for big Taurens. Things like Australian penis slang, Irish, British, 'Murican...  I'm not going to post them here, if you want to steal my idea then figure them out on your own you big lazy Johnson!!
---
My vanilla guild started with DKP and then went to loot council, using the DPS meter and other stats like damage taken and actions-per-minute.
---
We'd try to distribute loot where it made the largest impact. Players who kept themselves alive and had high dps and high actions-per-minute got priority over players who had poor stats.
---
We were a semi-hardcore "friends and family" guild, so we had a number of raiders who showed up regularly but were consistently at the lower end of the dps meter, regardless of gear. They were not top priority for rare drops.
---
Is that what you call those people dancing on top of the mailboxes?
---
We had an alliance guild called Pain Train on Gorefiend - we always jumped in their vent and made fun of them after we rolled them in WSG.
---
I’d love to see what you look like before calling anyone a loser or a nerd lmao, your cunty attitude makes you more of a loser than anyone else. Your probably an ugly pig too
---
I'm not the one who mentioned Joana... this time.
---
Im rolling with a ND guild for classic lol. Continue to rage for no reason
---
Well that's nice you're concerned about that. I'd be concerned about anyone who's seriously practised on private servers will be 10x faster than some dude who's worried *private servers might be inaccurate* so doesn't do anything to practise and just thinks naruto running really hard to his goal will make all his dreams come true.
---
Spell coefficients also have downranking penalties, as well as an additional penalty for spells under level 20.  Shadow Bolt rank 3 should scale at about 9.6% spell damage.  Full scaling and not consuming ISB charges are both bugs.
---
Only guide you'll ever need.
---
Step 1. Aquire Poopsock
---
Step 2. Profit
---
Mainstream media still treats video games that way (at least where I'm from).
---
I mean, that's an opinion for sure, but as I couldn't do it in vanilla and I'd rather not try and practice on non official servers, all the relevant info is going to be older or from the beta. It's a matter of time and effort, the particular route and grind spots are just helpful.
---
I guess most of the problems will occur on layer 8 anyways.
---
People have trained for years. Unless you find a empty server and play 18-20h a day it will be close to impossible
---
Therefore he's right! (hint: he's not)
---
If you want server first level 60, you're going to have to convince 2-3 other friends to play your character while you can't.
---
Nice
---
Many people already enumerated different arguments why a big number of talent points wouldn't be that bad (as long as the talent tree also became longer/deeper).
---
But I ask a different question: did we really need so many level cap increases? 80 was already too much if you ask me.
---
Of course not - because it depends on layering. 
---
No vanilla server has ever launched with layering.
---
If it's easily manipulated- there are several things one can do to exploit leveling.
---
Hunters are typically server first to 60 - will that be the case with layering? Maybe?
---
Maybe they make a mistake and leveling is unbearable... then those that dungeon grind 24/7 will hit 60 first.
---
Routes are important if you are rushing but you're gonna have to adapt when we see how launch goes.
---
Yeah both would be fine, especially if you could queue and browse at the same time.
---
This is exactly the problem, You have already played for 6 years on a private server and you already have a guild in that game.
---
&gt;and have a guild with 80 members ready.
---
Are you moving to classic?
---
If so why?
---
Are you moving so you can "compete" in the same content that you been doing for 6 years?
---
Are you moving because you dont want to play on a private server?
---
I play warrior because I like charge mechanics. Zoom!
---
In vanilla i hit 10 on my hunter ez. on my warrior i was 1 rank from GM (13? or was that 11.. can't remember) solo.  when i did it on my warrior that was all i was doing.
---
Yeah I'd choose the server carefully and pick a strong class for it.
---
You realize that doesn't do anything and Blizzards official stance on it was that unless you reserved a special item it's not their concern.
---
And you do realize that part of the appeal of classic is that community and reputation matters?
---
I think you fired up a bowl, smoked for about two hours straight, started philosaphising, and wrote this dope post as if it were revolutionary.  
---
Yes, servers will be different.
---
idk its just funny in a thread about leveling efficiently someone is talking about how something that they consider to be average or good, is actually innefficient..
---
I've always just moved with the mouse and keep my pinky, ring, middle and forefinger on 1,2,3,4 respectively.
---
Quick slide the pinky over for ~ is another keybind. 5 and 6 are easy to nail with the forefinger, as well as R and T on the next row down. 
---
That's 9 hotkeys there. Then F1-4 above the key rows I usually save for bigger cooldowns. That should handle your rotation.
---
Then, get yourself a multi button mouse for everything else. Mounting, hitting cooldowns/items that get you out of snares/freezes. Anything else you need RIGHT AWAY when you need it. 
---
Spacebar remained Jump, you can hit it with your lefthand thumb easily from the position I described, as well as your bags.
---
Just like, name it the same as the monsters that appear in that zone and are the same type. 
---
Example- you're in the barrens, and you tame a level 12 "ornery plainstrider".  Name your pet "Ornery Plainstrider", hide yourself in a bush, and use 'eyes of the beast' to walk your bird out in the open, stand around, and walk in a straight line now and then.
---
I will leave this to the rogues who want to compete in a remake of a 15 year old game, as all of this is insanely expensive in time and/or money to sustain for each and every raid night.
---
Trap mastery huh. I'm not sure what percentage resist chance ppl have without resist gear. Your build looks very different from mine:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cZtVohtZ0xiVohux
---
my fear (as I'm not shy to say I'm seeing classic as a stepping stone towards TBC) is that the playerbase of classic will already start to drop with AQ40 and naxx
---
as much as I despite private servers. They are a perfect reference for how imbalanced classic is. Those servers start to die the moment the gap between AQ raiders and fresh 60s becomes so hilarious it is no longer fun for either of the two groups. Even less when you consider that it takes months to catch up - month ins which you still pose little to no opposition / while you still get rofl-stomped constantly
---
Did this on a pserver with /sit sometimes to get lowbies coming from the barrens.  Make it look like you're afk or something, /sit and looking the other direction.  
---
Then /cast mind control
---
Run off
---
#NOOOOOOOOOOooooooooo.............        *thud*
---
I mean if you arent comfortable with that then dont play it?
---
I was 14 so I thought a Tauren named "Thunderhorn" would be cool. Not super creative. There was another Tauren Warrior named Thunderstomp, and everyone thought he was my dad.
---
My Tauren Druid was random name generated as Onokoshar.
---
I'm only thinking about the competition and streamers being assisted by windowlickers.
---
I’d love to experience the magic I felt when I was younger. I could just walk around stormwind and be amazed by everything. The world was so incredible and I was beyond eager to log into the game
---
&gt;-Discipline tree for Priests was supposed to be a "melee" tree (like Monks in some other games), which is why Inner Fire increased attack power.
---
I asked KJ about this and he said it was false. If he said why it buffed AP, I don't remember.
---
&gt;-Undead were able to communicate with the Alliance.
---
And Gutterspeak still uses the same cipher as Common. BUR
---
&gt;-Spell schools used to have a skill system similar to todays weapon skills. "Your skill in Fire has increased to 93"
---
And 1.12 added it for all 3 specs so you get 3 lines of meaningless spam when you ding.
---
All content as it's "world wide" 
---
If it was only early zones it would be sharding and that's what retail has... nobody wanted sharding so they came up with layering. 
---
Layering will be in for a set amount of time that blizzard seems necessary. It could be 1 week or 2 months, we wont know.
---
What we do know is it won't be in Classic come Phase 2.
---
It's not August so they haven't given out details, even though I doubt they will when it comes to the timetable of layering.
---
You still should never use Poisons in a raid, you just choose to because you don't want to pay for the better option. Doesn't make the statement less true.
---
Are you moving to classic? 
---
If so why? 
---
Those questions are kind of important in the subject.
---
Because there is a reason why you are moving from your pserver, is it shutting down? Otherwise you can stay right?
---
2 hours a day barely trying? You have a full time job?
---
&gt; Honestly, you'll be able to heal any dungeon as shadow up until you ~~hit 60.~~
---
start raiding.
---
Shadow healing is stupid fun in Strat/Scholo/LBRS/UBRS/DM if you know what you're doing and manage your mana. Not only are you the healer, but you can do middle of the pack DPS. Just be smart enough to stop DPS if you run low on mana and/or pull aggro with Vampiric Embrace.
---
Well yeah, choosing a non-streamer server would optimal, but also knowing the "good routes" means I know what to avoid/modify to keep from bottlenecking from the hordes.
---
if anyone ninjaloots soul shards again im gonna golla roll opposite faction and gank until i die
---
I know it wasn't Vanilla, but in WOTLK when knockback mechanics came out for several classes it was SUUUUUUUUCH a frickin joke to use in AB, EOTS, or world PVP.   Elemental shaman with PVP gear just sitting there keeping yourself alive and then VOOMP send a whole group of people plumetting to their deaths.
---
I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
Pretty much. I had a Naxx Fury warrior in vanilla and I could still dunk on undergeared people in PvP, but I didn’t do well in things like organized WSG. 
---
The biggest downside of warrior IMO is that all the specs are very one dimensional. 
---
PvP = arms
---
PvE = fury/protection
---
There is very little overlap, and I think the other classes are far more flexible in this regard.
---
It takes a bit after that for a need to group really comes up. I've been playing on a private server the last few weeks and really only started adding friends doing the elite quests in Wetlands and running Gnomer. For a while it was short easy Deadmines runs and quick quests here and there where I talked to people, otherwise mostly solo stuff.
---
I mean farming gold generally isn't fun.
---
Will be interesting for sure, I have off for 9 days under the assumption that launch day will be an absolute shitshow.
---
Thanks for the input.
---
When you factor in ranks, utility, and damage, your spell bar can fill up rather quick.
---
Lots of real life friends are coming now that they know progress won’t be lost out of the blue. 
---
A lot of things are also going to be different. 
---
I could stay but so many people are moving on / arriving / coming back I’d rather be with mates than on a small pop server.
---
I don’t know how I feel about some people wanting more content, but I got time to think it through.
---
I'd bet J!NX could be convinced to re-release it.
---
Following your logic, is the 10th healer even necessary at all then?  Do you really need the small healing you provide? Sounds like you guys are overvaluing caster dps in Phase 1, with 6 PIs and a shadow weaver. Why not run 4 PIs, one deep holy, and add a DPS?
---
The person who gets first 60 will be someone who has already been practicing routes for months at this point. If you just want to level fast, go for it! But if you haven't already played through a bunch to see routes you won't be first.
---
Please never comment again, my brain hurts. By your logic any form of testing by the public is negative gains for the company, since its all about cash there would be no public testing whatsoever, due to the fear of people not purchasing the game (LOL) after being handed 'the keys to end game' lmao. shutup you fool.
---
58-60, otherwise you pull aggro.
---
Go ahead and try. But you will probably be out of the running in the first 24 hours. The people who are top tier have been practicing their routes over and over for months in preparation. If you think you can go in with a few weeks and compete then go for it, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.
---
If you don’t already know how to get server first 38 days before launch you won’t get it, end of story. People have been doing the 1-60 leveling prep for years.
---
No problem I'm working with a similar schedule :) 
---
If anything I think the launch will be way better than any of expect. 
---
The stress tests were great to participate in, just to see them testing layering.
---
The next stress test should give everyone a great idea how launch will go since they are planning on a global stress test and it will be in August.
---
Yeah I had a noticeable jump but definitely requires high end gear and TSA from another hunter. I'm probably not going to try it until being mostly T1/T2. I did it in a combo of MC and BWL gear originally and it worked but had a raid composition that allowed me to pull it off.
---
I agree with this post and just want to tack on that most PvP shadow priest get Blackout (chance to stun). Its really annoying for tanking to try to move mobs around that keep getting stunned in place. Some raids wont allow a spriest to have Blackout.
---
Both are the right choice because having big shoulder pads is all that matters.
---
Yeah that ain’t happening.
---

---
It is my opinion, which is why I'll thank you not to downvote me (if that was you)
---
In my opinion, paying chinese gold farmers is not actually engaging in what you're calling 'social economics.' It's not engaging in in-game economics because you're not trading any in-game currency for the gold, you're trading your real-world currency for it. That is absolutely the opposite of 'immersion.'
---
This is exactly it. I lurk and only post on a few of the threads. I like to watch the sub for Classic news and those few threads I enjoy or think I could be helpful replying on. I skim straight past all the power leveling, streaming, layering and so on complaints. I just don’t care. The couple of hours I had to play in the stress test was a blast. Can’t wait for Aug 26.
---
So things like deadwind pass, hyjal, and azhara crater are corny ideas? Things that they wanted to include in vanilla but didn't have time to?
---
I should have been more clear about a lot of things. But probably most importantly my stance on what additions. Outside of the edit, the word "change" doesn't appear a single time in my post. I don't want a single class, spec, or ability to be changed. No tuning. No "expansion"-like releases. I just want things that already exist in the world to be completed. Maybe one or two long, difficult questlines for a single small reward, no better than anything in Naxx. Maybe implement Karazhan as additional mid-tier content. It'd be the same game, but fuller. It's not going to become like BfA because there won't be added continents, level-cap increases, talent changes, zone overhauls. No. I don't know why everyone assumes that's what people want Classic+ to be. It's possible to add net-positive content that doesn't outdate other content
---
Sorry to inform you but the ads are personal, not subreddit specific.
---
Im getting game of thrones web-game ads on /r/worldnews.
---
This really kicks ass, doesn't it.
---
if you are looking for an opinion. I would argue against lightning reflexes with early blue gear (even as solo player) For pvp the + multi shot dmg really helps a lot. More so when you can double it down with the T1 8 piece
---
Trap mastery can't circumvent the 1% lifeline resist chance and (while I'm not 100% certain on this) is a leftover (for max lvl) from the time when traps were calculating their lvl by the level you learned the spell and not by the level of the hunter that was casting it (which was fixed as a part of patch 1.6) Prior to that you had insanely high resist rates on CC traps and massive dmg resists on the fire based traps
---
I usually go mining and blacksmithing to craft gear along the way.
---
As mentioned, if you have ideas for future 4DCs, please DM them to me directly and I'll add them to the list to consider!
---
No interest in raiding, but do you plan to rank to 10 and try for 13?
---
If you hit r13 you don't need to raid :)
---
Sure fully naxxed out people will be better than you stat wise but you'll be good to go.
---
Lol they really treated gaming like it’s some mental issue. Little did they know..
---
Swg name was autogenerated name for a wookie Ralrelowokalla... Shortened it to ralre
---
6pm what time zone?
---
I haven't put money on me (and i wouldn't suggest doing it). It's something I wanted to try for launch since I had the off time and I didn't want to start on boars right away.
---
I asked for help, if there are all these people who have been doing stuff for years, certainly there are videos or something. I dunno why this post attracted immediate and thorough toxicity, but it is what it is
---
philosophizing*
---
The only people that don't consider real-life when talking about immersion are role-players and I don't care about them.
---
Only layer 7 ? We need to go deeper !
---
The most common etiquette for BoEs is to need. This is such a commonplace loot rule that calling it "ninja" is a tough sell unless different loot rules were clearly established beforehand.
---
People should also discuss loot rules and ask to reserve important upgrades beforehand. You're free to not join that group if you don't like the loot rules, but players should get in the habit of asking before they get into the instance.
---
I see. Cool, ty
---
Won't you have pretty good gear from running all the dungeons?
---
Both have trade offs. Digital: far more convenient, but less of an experience. Physical: far less convenient, but more of an experience, creates a memory. It might not seem like a big deal to 'experience' buying something, but I think many of us fondly remember trips to the video store. And maybe even the smell of it.
---
Don't be. My best guess is that you could count the number of people flagging for pvp 1 hand for 1-60.
---
This is a joke, right?
---
You do realize that people have put years of effort into perfecting their solo route to 60? Every guide out there is not efficient. If you follow them, you will end up with a terrible /played. All those guides do it give you a general sense of what to do.
---
I'm personally am going for Classic world first 60 druid and I have put countless hours over the years practicing and I still find ways to improve my time on every run. For example, I started grinding 23-28 and I cut four hours of my 1-30 time just a few days ago.
---
Also, biggest thing, if you're not willing to stay up for AT LEAST 48 hours right at launch, sleep for 5-6 hours, stay up for another 24-36 hours, repeat till 60, you won't even come close to server first 60 even if you do have the best path ever created to 60.
---
&gt;  I once told the stirring story on here a few weeks back 
---
For those wondering:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/caclx2/orc_warlock_maybe_undead_mage_maybe_gnome/et8bmhl/
---
What guide would you use to just casually explore the game? None. That's why there aren't posts like that. I see tons of parts asking if they're the only one that's going to take their time.
---
As a priest, wand at level 5-6 is your first priority.  On private servers, they were selling them via /y in Brill on launch day.
---
german chat is going so fast, no one will notice i'm english and gay
---
Leveling 1-11 on hunter is slow, so get someone to kill tagged mobs for you. at level 1 - 6 a lvl 1 can help.  at level 6-10 a lvl 4 can help.  you dont need someone your level to kill for you, just get a friend to start a hunter as well and buy him 600 ammo.  10-11 is slow only because you need to do pet quests.
---
I would bet on Classic having a more engaged and helpful community than swtor. That said, I'd also expect there to be more "hardcore" or "try-hard" players also. 
---
It's kind of a mixed bag because swtor specifically has become basically a single player game for a lot of people, whereas Classic really can't be. You'll probably meet more helpful people and make friends, but you'll also likely run into more jerks in Classic.
---
You dont. You end up smashing your face into Garr, cause no one wants gear. You either /roll for non-bis, or you FORCE people to spend it on upgrades
---
My vanilla priest was named Esmer, after a character in one of the books in the Thomas Covenant series by Stephen R. Donaldson.
---
Little did I know that it's also "Brunette" in Turkish, and I was playing on the EU realms.
---
:)
---
Since then I've specifically chosen names that both are more significant to me, and a bit more rare. 
---
As a side note,
---
I also have a hobby of coming up with new names and checking WarcraftRealms to see if someone already had that idea. 
---
Hmm, so someone did already name a character CatBearElf, Mudamudamuda or Z̡͖͇̰̺̜̥a͖̗̪l͏g̛̟͍o̭̟̺... :)
---
Wait what? You cant? Macros are useless to me then because all my mouseovers are on the mouse+modifiers
---
I mean with the loot nonsense that was Titanforged and the rediculous amounts of ohshit buttons in retail I get what he's saying.
---
Wait, poisons don't scale with spell damage? Aren't they considered nature spell damage?
---
They could be shackled as well.
---
All good entertainment is addicting. That’s what I always look for when finding a game. They market books as page turners you can’t put down. People talk about shows that are binge worthy. Who wants to play/read/watch something that they aren’t even excited to pickup the next time they have a chance?
---
He just gave you a reason to use poisons in a raid: the better alternative is too expensive.
---
They are considered nature damage but no, they do not scale with additional spell damage nor additional nature damage.
---
All attack speed buffs are multiplicative on the base, not additive.  So it wouldn't be a 113% attack speed increase, it would be a 76.06% attack speed increase.  
---
For example, a base 3.0 speed bow would thus be a 0.72 attack speed bow.  If you combined just 40% health Zerker with Rapid Fire, you'd have a 1.03 attack speed bow.
---
A mage is going to have to stop and drink regularly. I might as well drink with him, especially because the water is free. So mana isn't really an issue, because a mage can blow through their mana pool faster than priest can, anyway. So mana-hungry specs like Smite Priest become more viable.
---
Holy Nova is pretty terrible. High mana cost for a pretty meh effect. For AoE grinding, I'd probably focus on keeping the mage alive. Improved Power Word: Shield pairs nicely with a frost mage doing a channeled Blizzard. I'd also consider (if playing Alliance) going with a Holy Paladin who can heal and cast Consecration for AoE damage. Priests are a bit lacking in the AoE department. Spamming Shadow Word: Pain is the strongest "AoE" that a priest has.
---
SW:P, shield, and healing is pretty nice to support a mage, though. Not as good as another AoE'er, but still solid.
---
TBC is the only game I've ever gone out and lined up at a store for a midnight release. TBH I can't even remember how I went about buying Vanilla. All I remember is that I was playing pretty much as soon as the servers came up.
---
I see. Is this better? https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cZtVohthZ0xiiohu
---
Also, is it worth switching back to lightning reflexes with BWL/AQ/MC gear?
---
aww you took my kill
---
Who let trump on here?
---
Yeah, good luck to melt faces with that 4k manapool.
---
SP runs out of Mana in no time. Only to buff up after death and go into shadowform is like 3k Mana.
---
Ah the old list with arcane shot spell power scaling
---
Little do people remember that up till 1.5 hunters weren't casting Aimed shots because it had your weapon swing timer as additional cast time on it. Forcing you to cast between 5.5 to 6.3 seconds depending on what 50+ ranged weapon you were using. Because of that the T2.5 gear was catering to arcane shots. They just had almost half a year worth of data that implied that hunter players wanted to use the damn weak shot :D
---
On an aesthetic note, what class has the best looking armor and weapons? Im still juggling between lock priest abd shammy, but im also tempted to go a melee class for dark edge of insanity and other cool melee weapons
---
I think you’re missing what people mean by immersion, here. Immersion is immersing yourself in the in-game world/universe during the time you’re playing. It’s roleplay.
---
The kind of immersion you’re talking about is immersing your overall time and being into World of Warcraft, which is not recommended by the large majority, and is pretty much only achievable by virgin minmaxers.
---
Not in the long run, not without new content
---
The MC attune was incredibly easy: touch the rock. The hard part was getting through all the mobs in BRD between you and the rock.
---
Unless you were a rogue.
---
If you don’t trust your guild leadership then you have bigger issues than loot distribution.
---
Peak alliance gameplay
---
As far as time management, this isn't my first rodeo as far as long dumb grinds - i have friends on the couch to minimize time spent away from the desk.
---
As far as routes, I didn't just start looking into stuff, I just got a wild hair and decided to ask Reddit (for some dumbass reason, this thread is a shitshow). I haven't played it, because I just haven't done any pserver stuff, but I have a handle on the theory. We'll see what happens when it's in practice, but it's not like I'm playing for the life of a loved one, if it's competitive cool - if it's not, cool, I'm playing classic.
---
I just thought maybe a few people would see this and post some stuff I hadn't seen. Whoops, haha.
---
do you even like mmos?  because thats a pretty shit description of mmos and absolutely not an honest opinion of classic was
---
~2010, played a mage Yoitsjoe
---
idk what you are trying to help me with, i never asked for help?
---
If we can agree your estimate is a tad high then sure, I wouldnt consider people who play 2 hours a day the average, I wouldnt consider 240 hours a person who spent there time efficiently leveling
---
Also based on a video by hakurai and general notion from the beta, nodes for gathering are much more rare in classic, and bag drops are also much more rare. Hakurai adviced not leveling professions outside cooking and firstaid while leveling.
---
Ima play around with it, but i should be much quicker to wait till 40 or 60 with your level 40 mount to go back and gather
---
[Obviously](https://i.imgur.com/p4VJHkd.jpg)
---
Explains a lot tbh. I don't like Westfall much but Redridge and Duskwood really stand out vs other zones in that level range. Duskwood is probably my favorite zone of all time and the only reason I might roll alliance even if I'm 99% set on horde. The alliance zones really tickles my nostalgia
---
Not a greedy kiddo. I just don’t think BoP and BoE epics should be treated the same. Can you bring anything to the argument to say otherwise?
---
I wonder if that much attack speed could be bad. Reducing Aimed Shot below 1.5sec could have a negative impact on your rotation. Might be better to just let the autos fly. You would be hard pressed to even get off a multishot without delaying an auto at +113% attack speed with Rhok'Delar and a quiver.
---
I remember testing being done to see if a quiver actually reduced dps with certain weapons. But I believe this was on a pserver.
---
Every single guild is using some form of Loot Council in Vanilla.
---
Main issue will be doing your class quests man, lvl10 I think is your pet training thats in durotar. And 6 I think is a class specific weapon quest. Gonna be rough first few days for sure.
---
Everything? No
---
take with a bit of salt because I'd never consider hunter, and I'm choosing between priest and warlock.
---
1. Warlock can't kite like a hunter can.
---
2. more warlocks but fewer raid spots for hunters.
---
3. Hunters are mediocre raid damage and are only brought for tranq shot. Warlocks scale more with gear.
---
4. Not really.
---
Pretty sure the first respect starts at 1g
---
I immerse myself in the aspects of the game I enjoy. I choose not to immerse myself in the aspects of the game I do not enjoy and instead choose someone else to do that for me.
---
You have to bind as much of your keyboard as possible around your fingers that rest on wasd. Then u use an Alt or a mouse click to effectively double those keys, so you will have something on 1, then something on Alt-1 etc. 
---
research the rotation and put the most used abilities on non Alted keys. 
---
No, not the battlegrounds. The actual game servers. The server you joined was simply a single server. You NEVER saw anyone from a different server. It was the same people, everytime you signed on. As you leveled you leveled with the same people. Alliance and Horde.
---
brain with a mirror finish
---
They are removing it in classic - they announced it a couple months ago and I kid you not their logic was that the racial drops were yucky.
---
Step 1: Be a Rogue
---
Step 2: Lurk by any narrow bridge in a pvp area (Alterac Valley for example)
---
Step 3: Use Distraction when someone runs by
---
Step 4: Watch as enemy falls off the bridge
---
Yeah, I get it. The reference was to the Chad Immersion vs. Virgin MinMaxer. The meme has a history and its own meaning, which you repeatedly fail to get. They’re not talking about the literal meaning of the word “immersion,” bud.
---
LOL Ads. Reddit gold baby.
---
If you want to be a pure DPS shadow priest and never heal, definitely go warlock. You will probably regret choosing a priest. 
---
Yes, shadow priests can do all the dungeons, but you're not going to melt faces in dungeon gear and will need to drink more than anyone else in the group. You may even need to use mana pots to not run out of mana.
---
Nothing beats [Loot Lists](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/).
---
It just is hard to take you seriously when other have been perfecting their routes for so long now. I think you will be surprised how hard it is to speed level even with guides. Even if you do a couple practice runs on a private server from now until release 1-60 you would still be behind the competition. There are some people who just level the same class 1-60 over and over for fun trying to beat their best times.
---
If you had just asked for some speed leveling guides you probably would have gotten just that. But people had to give you a reality check, and honestly you can just google wow classic speed leveling guide and get all the same ones anyone here would recommend.
---
I made a thread a year or so about this and how this system wouldnt hurt classic because it will exist through addons anyway or discord. People read lfg and downvoted me to hell even tho i said how i hated lfg and that the premade system was nothing like it.
---
DKP is capitalism.  Loot council is communism.  DKP is American.
---
No one cares about your memes, you're the only one talking about them.
---
I’m just excited to finally play classic that isn’t on a private server. My character(hopefully) won’t get wiped after 2 years!
---
If you say so. Sounds like a system ripe for drama. Personally I don't care much about gear and enjoy realm drama so bring it on.
---
uh, how are you ignoring spirit tap?
---
Me neither now that i think of it 🤪 good to keep in mind haha
---
This made me laugh. Thank you.
---
The average WoW player plays 22.7 hours a week in-game. That's ~14% of your time. You'd be stupid not to take that seriously.
---
I think you trying to win the F1 races next year is more reasonable then trying to get server 1st my guy.
---
I recommend take your time, find a guild whenever, if you just want to relax, play casually after school/work.
---
I was a Runescape player where names were abominations and lived outside Chicago and thus Whitesoxrock, the human warrior, was born.
---
rekt
---
Early Hyjal was so tight.
---
Well it's certainly circumventing those RPG mechanics you claim to care about. 
---
I guess you only care about *some* of them--which again...your prerogative. but all of this taken as a package certainly makes the statement
---
"I'm into the immersion, the world, and the RPG mechanics" 
---
kind of ring hollow, jus sayin.
---
Nice I would have been around then as well. Horde or Ally? I was a shaman named Senth
---
Same for me, thats because when you got BC you knew the game you were playing. When you bought vanilla the game was unknown so there wasnt yet a feeling to feel
---
Bubble Hearthing
---
Man up, be true warrior and level up on protection spec. Don’t be a lil bitch and cry ‘bout not leveling fast enough. Let your server known you are the shit, the 100% protection warrior they can trust, earn your reputation by carrying their sorry little asses through dungeons while leveling - kick those wannabe dps-warriors out of your parties and tell them L2P.
---
Be you - Be the best!
---
For the past 2 years to become more immersed in the game I have been crafting back stories for my characters. Looking at npcs names to determine patterns or what sounds good. Along with determining core traits of the classes and races. 
---
 For example I'm going to pick "Falx" for my tauren durid because tauren tend to have short and stern names. While the nails on a tiger's claw function like a falx's blade. 
---
If revantusk trolls where playable in classic I would pick "Vujek"
---
No, the only opinion that matters is my own.
---
I joined Hell at the start of TBC and raided with them all the way to Illidan. Loved some of the people in the guild, but it was a very demanding and competitive environment. I eventually left to focus on getting my master degree.
---
There will be tons of guild recruiting. You won't have trouble finding anything. You'll have plenty of time to meet people while you level. Don't rush it.
---
Yeah and then ask “didnt this release just now?”
---
Leave can be changed though, and I t’s not like they’re cancelling it.
---
Yeah, this whole thread is awkward.
---
I was thinking, people may not realize it , but they do *not* wanna mess with a warlock controlling an elite, in a zone where u can get feared into other elites.
---
I think it might be pretty safe, in a weird way.
---
It doesn't circumvent the RPG mechanics any more than using an addon circumvents the RPG mechanics.
---
Lol seriously. People dont throw together a 40 man raiding guild then last minute be like "oh btw were north korea only guild"
---
The idea of rewarding loyalty appeals to you. The math shouldn't. The idea that 4 pieces of unusable gear is equal to 4 nexus crystals, or ~500 gold you could farm in 10 hours on an alt, or $5 to a gold farmer you could make working 1 hour at minimum wage. But 210 DKP hours is a 2000% price markup, or at ~47 cents/hr equivalent is a slave wage that's only legal to pay to prison inmates. (which by the way, really illustrates how evil capitalism is)
---
I think Blizzard is going to be good about watching IPs for world firsts. If players account sharing are in the same house with same IP, well then good for them.
---
Prelaunch posting idea.  Quit asking to change a game that hasn't even launched.
---
You’re competing against people who have been practicing for **years** and you have **zero** practice.
---
You’re competing against people who will have an army of helpers summoning/crafting/helping them along the way.
---
You’re competing against people who will account share and play 24 hours a day.
---
And you’re here asking reddit for a starting point.
---
Why are you guys so offended by what this guy is saying. You can like RPG elements and buy gold. They aren’t mutually exclusive.
---
It's not a matter of being upset people are stating the obvious, people are being straight up assholes for no reason. I didn't ask if I could do it, I don't care if I can do it. I said it's something I'm trying to do. I'm going to try to do it whether or not a bunch of jerks on Reddit tell me I'm a pile of shit for trying it or not. 
---
I asked for info, thinking maybe I'd get some info I hadn't seen before.
---
I did learn something, but it wasn't what I wanted.
---
I think people here are overexaturating just how many actually care to speedrun. 
---
I personally did a bit of a "speedrun" myself on a pserver launch and I was #3 server wide for a fair bit, and I had really no experience in advance. I was orc hunter did a 1-30 clear on test server and a few 1-10's, did duo with a shaman and then just rinsed through barrens following joana's guide. 
---
It's a marathon, I definitely wasn't in for that, I played for 35 hours fairly efficient(still did Grun WC which was a waste of time) and was lvl35 at the end. So as long as you dedicate yourself to it, I think you stand a chance.
---
Imo pick a Nelf hunter, get really good at the 1-30 route and study the rest of the route. Get a duo druid to do 1-10 with. Speak with other people about how they are gonna handle 1-10 with the layering and all that stuff. I personally don't know what to do here.
---
Doing the gameplay, don't go hard on junk food. All the absolute no lifers I know drank water, a caffiene pill if things were rough, and like powerbars or something in the likes. Try your best not to consume sugar. Stretch and walk around as much as possible doing flightpaths. Be efficient with killing mobs inbetween quests.
---
Its in section iii of the EULA btw. Took me 20 seconds to find it. “Gathering ingame currency, items, or resources for sale outside the platform or game.....solicitation or offer through or within the platform”
---
I like hotwings
---
EPGP was the best loot system I've raided with, the worst I radied with was bidding DKP.  
---
Blind bid DKP is probably the worst.  I would avoid blind bid dkp guilds like the plague.
---
For PUG raid runs?  ...Master Loot IF ML was someone I trusted other wise Need/Greed rolls I guess...
---
I have mixed opinions about loot council.  I believe it's a much harder system to use without drama in 40 man raiding(in Vanilla most guilds tried to have ~60 man rosters to be covered from my memory).  Then again, there will be a lot more people who have played together online who will be doing Classic together again so there will be more trust in those cases compared to 2005 when most people were strangers to MMOs.
---
I never felt like class leaders were all that useful.  I remember on my horde alt I rolled on fresh server being made a class leader since none of the other mages were performing at all and that was basically to force them to listen to someone since they were super disagreeable people :/
---
If you have good camaraderie between your "class-mates" you can sort out things amongst yourselves(such as who will sit out when needed) but I suppose having someone designated to have the final say doesn't hurt.
---
I have no comment on # of officers and structure.  Like with government reality isn't convenient enough that there is a one size fits all answer...
---
Discord and whatever?  I dunno...I suppose there will be less guild message board sites?
---
We used voice chat and will do so again.
---
I spent like half my time leveling in vanilla unable to vanish because I never remembered to buy reagents in town.
---
The more free inventory you have, the longer you can stay in the field before going back to town (to sell, or mail to a bank alt). You can also take more consumables into the field and maintain 'enough' empty slots to balance out water/food/arrow/potion consumption with incoming loot. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Also, the +/- on your comments is rarely about what you think it is about. They don't matter anyway, so just ignore them.
---
It’s not bannable.
---
Yep
---
That can cause a lot of issues with pugs though... Kick people out at 5%... Sure probably won't happen due to lack of anonymity, but could happen.
---
Then I fail to see why you think it’s worth pointing out that anyone cares
---
&lt;Scion&gt; on Khadgar US. I believe they were one of the top two on the server. No idea if they were cool people but they looked cool standing in IF ;).
---
Thanks for the insight, man.
---
I listen to the goblin who says "Time is money friend" on repeat for 18 hours.
---
Buying gold is not "gathering in-game currency for sale outside the platform or game". Selling is.
---
And that "concern" is unfounded and exaggerated because, as I explained, almost nobody even does this to begin with. Only the super-mega-ultra-tryhard guilds do this.
---
Oh no, &lt;1% of the playerbase will have a slightly higher chance at getting Onyxia weapons which are replaced by AQ40. Classic is dead guys!!!!!
---
 RemindMe! 5 Weeks
---
Agreed, all I will say is that I feel like its harder than other zones. Though what I should do is go Durotar from 11-13 or so. Itd be worth going into Tirisfal slightly overleveled
---
I’m wondering the same... have a similar plan to you guys. Just play and then look.
---
Personally I think people are way too hype for this. Don’t get me wrong - I’m excited. But some people have gone wild: planning levelling routes, people asking about min/maxing talents while levelling, joining guilds in a game that doesn’t exist yet. All of this is CRAZY.
---
I want to play WoW classic - I don’t wanna dumpster it like I can on retail. I want a savour it. The BS can wait until I’m in BRD.
---
From what I remember as well, Vanilla was not very mechanically demanding. I honestly feel like modern WoW players are gonna dumpster the encounters. I think the difficulty will be finding members so I’m pretty sure most guilds will have open recruitment

---
Solicitation or offer through or within the platform covers buying gold
---
Yeah, my mistake for sure.
---
I came up with Mervil cause it sounded like a great paladin name in my mind and forever since I get people telling me not asking me but telling me that I stole my name from Marvel but ya know I still like my name.
---
I'm not saying that you should do everything, but there's a lot of things that you want to or need to do, and you can't go 100% in all of them. 
---
And I cannot imagine for the life of me caring enough about vanilla raiding go to 100% in it. I enjoy going full out for a speedrun every month or two, but doing it every week? Hf with that.
---
you are insufferably vain
---
Please stop.  Go here:
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
Good. I'm not around here much but glad to hear people care. Not because I have some warped ego and ocd complex but because layering legitimately hurts the essence of vanilla in too many ways. None of us want an inferior version of it when we have the power to reproduce it in all it's glory.
---
my man
---
Well, I just love Liqourice!
---
I used to do that after long sessions!
---
Can't have spaces in pet names
---
Shadow oil will piss off warlocks and shadow priests because your shitty weapon proc will consume improved shadowbolt charges. I guarantee your raid would rather those charges get eaten up by another max rank shadowbolt or a mind blast over your weapon proc any day. 
---
Dragonbreath chili can be used in conjunction with poisons. So you're basically wasting gold to consume imp shadowbolt charges for barely more dps.
---
Rly wish mods would enforce/promote this. It makes way more sense for all this discussion to be on a dedicated sub.
---
No. Shadow Oil does not consume Improved Shadow Bolt charges.
---
FoH / Triton forums were my jam in HS
---
DO IT!
---
That's life.
---
I am here i do not care about being first to 60 or rushing to the raids. I plan on taking my time running every dungeon, doing every quest and keeping up with all of my professions. If i feel like defending Astranar for 4 hours and not complete a quest i will do it. I eventually will get back into raiding but the nice thing about classic is those raids will be there in two years i do not have to worry about a expansion making content obsolete i have done them before i will do them again when ready. I also want to be more helpful to guild mates who may new to vanilla if they need help to kill a elite on the other side of the world i will travel. Just trying to recapture as much as i can lvling my first character.
---
its also like the main criteria when searching for a guild.
---
Whats next people arent joining guilds cuz they dont know what faction they might choose?
---
Tinkleperiwinkle! I was wondering where you were
---
Well, the best way to avoid pushing off anything important (but I dont think a r1 spell would? that's what ive read) would be to stack to 5 at the start of the fight, before every slot is accounted for. Then just use mind blast to reapply
---
I always thought DKP was notoriously bad. It's been surprising to me how many people here plan to use it.
---
Yeah honestly going for it is an achievement in its own, I guess people ”and unfortunately myself” sees it as cocky thinking that you can just watch some guides and succesfully slam your name on 1st 60
---
Now you might not even be arrogant about it, just felt like you thought it would be an easy task. Ill apologize from my part, I might have quite a few useful links I can give when I get to my PC
---
My first druid back in Vanilla had the name Aurathorne. Because we could cast a damage shield on other players called: Thorns.
---
I also had a Tauren warrior who started life as a bank alt. He was named Pakmyool.
---
I have it and I still see ads. What gives
---
They are essentially remade old vanilla era models.
---
How that translates to the specifics is unknown, i.e. if there are still texturing issues with things like the jade legplates.
---
What I would love to know is if its possible to "toggle on" the chinese version of the forsaken models. IMO they look a lot better flesh and without the random bones protruding.
---
&gt; but there's a lot of things that you want to or need to do, and you can't go 100% in all of them.
---
I disagree.
---
&gt; And I cannot imagine for the life of me caring enough about vanilla raiding go to 100% in it. I enjoy going full out for a speedrun every month or two, but doing it every week? Hf with that.
---
It doesn't require any more effort or time, just money.
---
No system can use the human element. You can could all your scores and make your lists, lootcouncil is always going to be infinitely more in depth.  And if you cannot trust your leaders with loot, then why are you in the guild?
---
If bartender is updated for classic with the same functionality theres a built in option to enable mouse over. Saves you custom writing them all out. Very useful for weaving dps in with your healing. You can keep the boss targeted and just hover over raid frames to heal people.
---
I honestly think (call me crazy, this just seems likely and i just have a hunch, and Blizz can be greedy sometimes) it's because they didnt connect the dots until now on the 3 days game time for retail, in which they gave a lot of people that was to expire on the 28th.
---
I think a lot of people (also my friends and I) were planning on using those 3 days to play the stress test. Activ Blizz realized this and had to push the date because they want subscribers and also want retail to succeed. Money. 
---
Theyve had two successful stress tests already, months of Beta going on and the a lot of the games bugs have been fixed and addressed. I just feel like this is why.
---
You'll probably want to find a resto druid friend since you can act as a normal res. Also there are some specific mobs that are kinda advantageous to mind control in certain dungeons (I'm thinking evokers in lbrs).
---
My girlfriend at the time said put your dick in my but so that's how I got the name Deckinmahbum for my mage gnome.
---
why would you think i'm offended?
---
i think that rmt is pathetic and cheating, what is the confusion? also it is funny when the person rmt'ing says "immerse myself in the world of the RPG and the set of rules it stipulates" yet they are bypassing some of the rules of the game.
---
The coolest guild on my BC realm was
---
Mass Casualty-Nazgrel US, I remember, they transferred to the realm instantly was the top guild because our progression was like Kara during t5.
---
We did a server-wide group pug one day and a few people from mass casualty joined. The plot twist was I was healing on a druid they scouted me and requested I join and try out for Black Temple progression. They were restructuring and rebuilding. I fit right in, ended up killing Illidan and Archimonde before the big 3.0 nerf. I owe the coolest guild on my realm at that time everything. From that moment on I officially had experience at the highest level and I was addicted to raiding and til this day continue to raid at the highest level because of them . 😁😁
---
Blackrock had all the best guilds.
---
These creatures still exist?
---
Needing “for gold” is bull shit. 
---
If you need and don’t equip the item you are a ninja. Simple as that.
---
Ruthless
---
Hey, adding to this. Would it ever be more beneficial to bring less people if you can farm them efficiently? Like duoing, or trio for group exp?
---
Agreed, Larry
---
If you need assistance with that, consider open sourcing it, and I can develop a solution for it. I have professional experience of using the browser storage to save things locally, so I figure it wouldn't be a lot of trouble.
---
Don't.
---
That guy is clueless.
---
Damn, guess we’ll just have to wait for tbc re-release.
---
^ what was known in my guild as the "rogue shadow council"
---
I personally dislike forming cabal loot councils within a DKP system. At that point just switch to loot council
---
Is there one for Florida?
---
Hm, I would have to disagree with you right there, or at least say that it depends on the addon.
---
Looting gold and salable items off monsters, and trading resources you've gotten in the wild for gold, that you can trade for crafted items is part of the game. Alternatively, you can gather the resources and craft the items yourself to avoid trading the gold. That's a very time consuming part of the game you circumvent when you buy gold for cash. The consumables in this case are extremely time consuming because they are extremely good. The scarcity of these items as resources is part of their balance. If getting frost oil was as common as getting wool cloth, then to be sure, the frost oil would probably not add nearly as much damage. 
---
So yes, it certainly does circumvent RPG mechanics much more than using 'an addon.'
---
If I could use 'an addon' to enchant my weapons to deal massive amounts of DPS, that would certainly be cheating, as well. 
---
You haven't a leg to stand on. It shouldn't matter, because you don't need to defend yourself to us. The strange thing is, you are trying to do just that, even though it's indefensible.
---
Wow
---
It was my friends runescape account name. He got the idea from skateboarding companies
---
I saw someone post a recommendation for Joanas guide, yet you dismiss it as old and inefficient. As if people _who have been practicing and theorycrafting for a decade+_ are just going to post the fruits of their hard labor for anyone to use.
---
&gt;You can enjoy an rpg and still use rmt.
---
do you know what immersion means? also, did you miss this part?
---
&gt;and the set of rules it stipulates
---
if you rmt you are vain
---
i did not make fun of his account age, just pointing out that it is suspiciously new.
---
i'm just arguing for the sake of argument.
---
"Oh, a rogue guide, sweet!"
---
"Oh, horde only. Again."
---
Zeit für ein Babelfisch
---
He didn’t say there was no reason. He just said you shouldn’t.
---
After launch so I can choose the best server for myself rather than be forced to go to one I may not like because the guild chose it
---
So you're saying instead of giving users flying and taking it away and giving it back, they should do the same thing but slower?
---
What about just don't entertain the idea of flying mounts again?
---
As someone who will also be leveling a warrior, I agree. When you're talking kill rate and down time of killing mobs 1-3 levels below you vs 1-2 levels above you, it's night and day. Going out of your way to do a quest which is above your level is a waste of time in my experience compared to staying put and grinding.
---
Also I don’t like how he presents info kind of hard to follow imo
---
Welches?
---
Wayreth my first character is from a Dragonlance book. The Tower of Wayreth was the tower wizards went to to take their test to become full wizards. So I named my mage Wayreth.
---
I said I've seen ON THIS SUBREDDIT people dismiss it as inefficient.
---
I said I'd check it out.
---
seriously dont do it man , even mos of people i know they gonna do it they are kinda account sharing like the old days .
---
Here is someone who doesn't know why they like vanilla wow.
---
You’ll be invited to groups quick just for being a priest, as soon as you say you’re a dps priest they’ll kick you from the group once they realize your not joking
---
Good luck.
---
Should I play a dwarf Priest? All polls I’ve looked at have ~13% of people playing Priest. Given that more dps is needed in raids than healers, does the 13% indicate that Priest will be a overly played class?  And if one plays a Priest, it may be difficult to find a spot in a raid?  Thanks.
---
Can you explain more? Been a long time for me since vanilla lol
---
Thanks, man.
---
Why the fuck does he pick up his headset to talk into it?
---
I got in a car accident on my way to get tbc.  Rear ended someone in the best buy parking lot.
---
No, but there are like 10 of these posts each day.
---
Mate, you are yet to explain how 2-3 hours at end game cheapens a game that you're probably going to spend 300-500+ hours on. It makes 0 sense whatsoever.
---
If you absolutely don't want to heal, you're ignoring 2/3 of the class. 2/3 of the class that has the biggest healing toolkit.
---
You're a worse DPS than any non-healer class, and since you pretty much only provide healing as utility, you're also the worst hybrid support dps of any the healing classes, imo
---
I definitely won't invite a Shadow unless they're my friend or guildie, but I will gladly invite a Feral or Enhance. I'm going to be Warlock, even Shadow Weaving won't be enough.
---
That's coming from someone who was going to main a Shadow Priest.
---
That son of a bitch cost you server first 70!
---
I don't?   Please enlighten me see you think you know so much about my love for vanilla wow.
---
tbh if you just go to /r/askreddit, sort by new, then make some stupid joke involving gold, you can get it pretty consistently with a bit of effort. I did it like twice then just wondered why bother
---
So you aren’t going to answer the question, got if.
---
I've also got got. I'm like "Oh yeah, good question, I wonder what people said -- 0 comments, damn it TripleByte" lol
---
You are fine to do 5 mans but keep this in mind Shadow is the second lowest dps spec in the game (only Ret is worse)....
---
Death to all gnomes and human warlocks and priests and mages .
---
Mervyn? Your name is Mervyn?
---
Alright... Mervyn.
---
It's simple.  If you know what about it you like, you would support changes made to it which follow along those ideals.
---
It definitely is worth it for overall dmg output (not for burst though - but that's down to player choices)
---
As for PvE lightning reflexes have to live with the old meme before memes even existed 'you need 1000 agi before it becomes better than trueshot aura for raiding' - a value you can't reach in classic
---
As that amount would give you as hunter the same amount of RAP (with kings) as you would give your group + pet
---
&gt; clique is just slightly superior because it provides a few extra stuff.  
---
What else does it provide? Legit question.
---
One time I played for like 25 hours straight when Warlords of Draenor Xpac dropped. With the use of a youtube loop website I listened to Bidibodi Bidibu for about 20 of the hours. Its the song from Super Troopers 1.

While if you have good and smart people in your guild, its certainly much easier to manage, you still need some sort of command structure, because youre never going to have 40 likeminded people that all raid at the sime time with the same level of dedication.
---
Your idea honestly reminds me strongly of Leninism, where the smarter your guild gets, the leadership tends to wither away. The problem is, turnover and varying mindsets and goals will always prevent this state from occuring.
---
Yeah, kara was a fun raid, im not saying 10 mans are no good, but 40 man just feels epic. Flying feels great, but how do you accomplish that? Add some kind of way that if you attack someone in the air it takes you both to the ground without fall damage maybe? Idk retail has gone through so many changes that took away so many immersive things that made classic great.
---
Hey good job, you used spell check this time! And spent ten minutes coming up with big words.
---
I mean, if it’s anything like vanilla private servers, it will be great. Of course you didn’t feel challenged, you were level 6. If you want to challenge yourself pull two or more mobs at a time lol. Wait till you reach level 15ish when you start getting quests with mobs all bunched up together, or elite quests. Good luck soloing those.
---
Your first and last boxes swapped places for some reason please fix and resubmit.
---
haha Warglaive du fromage!
---
Or I know I like x so I want exactly x.  Not to mention the company that makes x has a history of turning x into y.  Why can't we just be happy with classic servers without like 20% of the playerbase putting on their amateur dev caps and begging for new content?
---
There was a guild called The Evil Empire on Eonar. They were always hilarious. If you were doing BGs with them at midnight on a weekend you knew you were gonna have a good night.
---
Not if you don't talk about buying gold inside the game.
---
This is it. Blizzard is in full panic mode. Classic is dead and probably won't ever be released.
---
who you be in accounting?
---
Actually both haha, but I was alliance for wotlk!
---
I think you should join PUGs at least to mix it up.
---
Usually by reminding yourself that guilds are made up of individual players and it's up to you to get to know and play with those individual players.
---
Das auf der Seite.
---
So Warlocks have Ritual of Doom, which works just like Ritual of Summoning, except it uses a 1g reagent, has 1 hour cooldown, and requires 4 other people. When the ritual completes, it kills a random participant and summons a very powerful Doomguard (which is hostile).
---
It's literally just gambling with some spectacle. There's a one in five chance to die. So a 20% chance to payout of 3 gold (5g pot minus your 1 gold buy-in, and the 1g reagent cost to the Warlock).
---
It's most profitable to the Warlock, since they can't lose money on it (unless the buy-in is set higher than 1g). That's basically their incentive to set up the thing. 
---
Obviously the expected value is terrible, but the cost is minor if you're just killing time waiting for a raid to start. The death doesn't have an armor penalty.
---
Plus (and this is the biggest plus) lots of low levels come to check out the commotion, and tend to jump around the ritual altar, so when the Doomguard appears they're the first to die. It usually bags two or three noobs before the city guard get it under control (and sometimes it kills a couple of those too).
---
You can do it!! Don’t know much beyond Joana’s guides, but you can always hit up the Youtubes
---
still blaming blizzard
---
Raids are too fun and the gear is too good for me to play solo.  
---
I am a solo player where possible, but I'm not passing up the opportunities that I have in vanilla to kill raid bosses and see great gear.  
---
I always encourage people to try raiding. It's such a nerve wracking thing to do if you have some sort of responsibility and you've never had to do it before, but when you succeed it's a good feeling. Killing bosses feels good. Watching people receive loot even if it's not you feels good. Seeing an amazing item drop feels good.
---
Thralls Champions from Terenas horde?? I was Terenas alliance - Stehlen Life/ Eternal Keggers were the two big ones there in terms of progression. I was in a guild called Ascensum for awhile that was 3rd IIRC  - got all the way thru CThun and a fair ways into Naxx with them prior to TBC, which for a small server like Terenas was pretty solid. Definitely remember TC on horde though!
---
Gitta lave the Esfand shade 👌😊
---
I solo mostly but I do the 5 mans when I get quests for them.
---
No it does not.
---
Please for your mental health go warlock.
---
Don’t play with douchebags. If you say you don’t notice any douchebags in your guild... well then.
---
I played Alliance on Sylvanas EU. I think someone might've heard of a small indie guild called &lt;Method&gt;. Obviously couldn't get it because I was like 12 and sucked.
---
I played solo during classic, and plan to do so again. There's nothing wrong with it.
---
Honestly, They could do all sorts if they wanted to if they didn't look to pursue towards TBC.
---
The issue lots of people seem to neglect is that if they don't start considering later progression (I would suggest Horizontal over Vertical personally). As Horizontial would allow for additional gear to allow greater variety.
---
You aren't going to get server first - too many coordinated powerlevelling groups within the truly hardcore guilds. I mean... they have their sleep/eating schedules planned out and are planning to rest through alternating 6 hour sleeping sessions and 30 min power naps.
---
Others even will break the EULA and account share to do so.
---
But it still benefits you to be amongst the first wave of 60s, particularly as a warrior tank or a holy priest!! Joana has excellent 1-60 vanilla guide for warrior. So I would still go for it.
---
This has nothing to do with Retail.

I want the classic servers to stay classic if they want to eventually make a BC server that people can transfer too i would be ok with. I want to take my time in classic clear all the content if that takes me 3-4 years so be it i just do not want new content possibly making old content obsolete.

As dwarf hunter back in the day vanilla I used to tame a boar and run to the orc starting zone. Use eyes of the beast and try to mimic the boars in the starting area.

Loot council is fantastic *if you're in the council.* The vast vast majority of raiders are not in the bleeding edge minmax "what is absolutely best for raid progression" population. Thus, loot council simply becomes a way to funnel gear to a small clique of friends and their asskissers. It is a very awful system for a raid member that is quiet, shows up, does their role, and logs out for the rest of the week because they have more things to do than play this game with us for 12 hours a day.  
---
I get the complaints with traditional DKP, but the solution is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and trust a benevolent dictator and his/her sycophants to mete out scooby snacks from on high. I'm running static-price DKP. You show up and kill bosses, you get points. Something you want drops, roll for interest with the other people that want it. Whomever has the highest DKP gets it and they get the price deducted from their current total. We've got notable exceptions for the fancy-pants items like thunderfury bindings, but those get preferentially allocated only *once*, on the first drop. Additionally, the priority-allocation carries a heavy DKP penalty that effectively knocks the recipient out of further loot acquisition for about two weeks.   
---
Loot Council is a cancer for any guild that isn't the toppest of top tier, which is most of em. Any guild *you're* gonna get into isn't going to be on that level, so deal with it and get with a group that runs a system that is at least the most fair, if not the most numerically efficient. I have never ever heard an argument for loot council that is logically more coherent than "trust me, bro".
---
Even rank 8/9 takes a lot of time, enough to I pact real life commitments

That's a good point. Plus if you're using VW DS then they gotta burst you while you DoT them and sic an Elite on their ass and heal off their suffering...

---
The nature of MMO's is content will become obsolete.
---
Besides, what would we do to keep level 20 deadmines relevant?
---
The answer is, the relevance is in the replay and the only thing stopping us from hitting level 60 and getting a raid group together to tackle molten core when naxx's on Farm...is US.
---
Yeppp
---
Interesting how a certain zone / setting can help one class so much
---
Never played a PvE server. Not a massive PvPer but can't imagine WoW without it, sorry OP!
---
F
---
This is precisely it... I know there will be some people who level up some what normal, but if they know the game from playing back in the day or even playing retail, they will level faster than ever.
---
The only original vanilla experience you will ever get is usually that very first character play through... not that playing another class won't be somewhat original, but because you will still bias how you play because you already know the world and basic mechanics that all classes share.
---
I'm sure a few new players will join in, but I do not expect very many people completely virgin to wow.  Therefore 90% if not more players will be leveling up much faster than back at original vanilla.
---
Plus 1000s of guides have been spammed on youtube for months now.
---
It's philosophy.
---
If you knew what it was about the game you liked, you would argue "you can't do x because it will interfere with y" or "this addition would make something else obsolete".
---
The fact you Stonewall any mention of any addition no matter how minor or major, and bullheadedly push for no changes period, is evidence that you yourself do not know what it is about the game that makes it so appealing to you.  
---
It's natural to fear the unknown.  You fear any type of change because you don't know if it will affect something you love about the game, and that's because you yourself don't exactly know what you love about the game.
---
I'm intrigued by this. I do plan on a rogue or hunter, and if it really is just ganging up on the same thing everyone else is ganging up on, that I can do. It's the nuanced, meta, deep-dive knowledge people have about their class and mechanics and bosses that I just can't equal. So thanks for this, maybe I'll give those a try.
---
I can't wait to enhance an Alliance player's experience by giving them a sense of danger.
---
ohh now im gonna kill you all
---
I'll probably need 2 years to get to level 60.
---
Add another 7 years to clear naxx.

It is less complex than you think. The 43% is derived from Berserking effectively applying TWO buffs: one 10% base increase that is always applied, and then another 0-30% based on health lost from 100% to 40% current health. The maximum gain is therefore 1.1 * 1.3 = 1.43.

Single blind bid DKP with a low min bid was always the best system I found. Value of the items are placed on the individual thats bidding on the item, not some pre determined list or council members value, yours. Makes me want to go to raid and see what loot i can get today.
---
LC is definetely the worst wide spread system in place ive found. From the perspective of both getting and distributing the loot, it makes loot something i actually dread dealing with rather than look forward to. It makes loot feel more like a punishment than a reward.
---
PUGs probabpy GDKP is best, but from pservers, it certaintly greatly destabilized the.economy and caused enormous inflation from gold effectively not being horded any more and becoming extremely liquid. Rolls are fine, but discouraging for people whose onlynmeans of raiding is through PuGs and cant get ahead.
---
The better your guild, the less micro management youll need, so hardcore guilds wont really need class officers but weaker guilds where numerous people dont know their class might.
---
GL with 3 upper officers i think is ideal and 8 junior class officers. Distribution of labour is key. Class officers dont do much except handle buffs, Cc/Dps/heal targets. Upper officers spread Ranged/Melee/Tanks/Healers between them, handle groups and raid leading.
---
&gt;People didn't group in vanilla, just for the fun of it. They grouped up, because the game rewarded them for doing so.
---
Incredibly true.  The game gives a set of challenges and mechanics to overcome those challenges.  One of those mechanics is being able to group up with others to share in killing monsters, getting exp, completing quests, and getting loot.  When humans are grouped together with strangers, they're not going to interact naturally and will keep to the people they know.  When a challenge is introduced that becomes easier as you add more people, the strangers are going to start being social.
---
This is natural social interaction that comes through the need to tackle challenges in the game and, surprise surprise, people that play the same game together often have common interests which results in further socialization.  That's INSANELY different from a social media platform like Instagram where all you do is look at pictures and the most social interaction is a *like*.  That's like throwing strangers in a room with nothing to do.

I only see hulu

40 man raid and yes.
---
Same I played most alliance around that time. I was in a ton of guilds including Exodus/BiPolar/Section 8/Karma
---
Idk why people here are all about downplaying how much grinding you needed in this game. It was rare to get the Rank 11 mount. I tried, and I played a lot. Like an unhealthy amount and while I was not a part of a hardcore premade neither will someone who plays 1 hour a day. Honestly I think there's no chance people get r10 being casual...Or really get anywhere in this game. Probably just MC pugs tbh.
---
People are really delusional about Classic. Rank 10 is a huge grind. You will not get there as a casual player. I am willing to admit when I'm wrong if someone wants to come here and call me out after release...But I doubt it'll happen. The people here thinking they're gonna be grinding PvP ranks with minimal play prob won't even hit 60.
---
Many of the old dungeons were truncated and frankly, dumbed down for the autistic, ADD weenies. I can't WAIT to see Blackrock Depths back to in its full, sprawling glory! The last time I saw it was during TBC.... the messed up group I went with was so undergeared and unprepared, we were lost in there for SEVEN HOURS. So many wipes.... but damned did we keep going. And hey, we did the quest to get the key for the rest of the dungeon from the undead king dwarf too.
---
Of course. Bring your consumables!
---
&gt;Providing proof to the plebs was not our prerogative.
---
Why are you here then? You obviously have something to prove.
---
&gt; Except you have to wait for the tank to sit down and drink after every single pull
---
Thanks for, yet again, confirming that you've never played with a Paladin tank.
---
If you're "drinking after every pull", you're doing it horribly wrong.
---
Most questions are let dumb, its more so the keyboard warriors who will make you feel dumb.
---
Mostly lvl 60 warriors are prot. But WoW has 3 specs available for a reason. So if you want to be a dps warrior at 60, be a dps warrior.
---
That sounds SO freaking amazing! I def need to do this
---
Yeah! How dare they play for fun! What a bunch of fucking losers! They probably don't even afk in the main cities to show off their gear and mounts!
---
Nah man, for 5 mans, especially all the leveling ones, if you're a dps then just attack the same thing that the other guys are attacking and hit your abilities some times. The dungeons are generally quite easy and most of the burden falls on your tank to pull properly. People aren't going to expect you to walk in there using consumables and and maximizing dps. Just treat the mob like a normal mob and attack it in the same way you would if you were solo questing, it just (hopefully) won't be attack you back.
---
I share the concern about making old content obsolete. I understand it's a risk making a parallel set because they might fuck it up and make it OP.
---
This was more a 'if they do it, what I'd find interesting' sort of post than outright advocacy of it.

Boom roasted.

No idea, you can start one if there isn't!
---
who cares? you're like romanticizing holding a box? life moves on, it's great we get classic back but like... c'mon dude, you don't need to relive the entire experience of it.
---
&gt; Are they largely forced to tank?  
---
It's my personal belief that if you're accepted into a raiding guild as a warrior, you're going to actually have a difficult time finding a tank position.  
---
You have a main tank, off tank, and then usually a warrior who has the best tank gear in addition to his fury set who will take up some third tank positions while in fury spec. Guilds will mostly expect fury warriors to maintain a tanking set for those pulls that require extra sets.  
---
I personally think it's easier to get a fury warrior position right now than a tank position (tanks usually 2-3 spots, fury usually 5-7 spots in a guild)
---
&gt; Who’s making the show?
---
Amazon. And the people tagged to produce, direct, etc have been pretty impressive.
---
5 Points into Improved Wand, 5 Points into Spirit Tap, the rest doesnt matter from there, I like to go into Disc, you can go into holy. At 40 respect and go full shadow and get Shadowform

No! 10 isn't realistic for most* guilds but I don't see why you wouldn't bring at least 6

---
&gt;quest somewhere else or run a dungeon or get a buddy
---
Exactly, WPVP is a nuisance that forces you to stop doing what you're doing and go do something else. How is this in any way enjoyable? Like imagine if ANY other videogame did this, people would be whining about it nonstop, yet somehow in WoW, everyone claims to love it.
---
There are more dps warriors in raids than tank warriors (though on some fights you may be asked to throw on a shield and offtank). Tanks are more welcome for pugs, but so DPS is more competitive, but all warrior roles are competitive. You'll gear up faster in general as a fresh 60 if you tank yourself or make good friends with a feral druid tank.
---
Someone asked on this subreddit, so I provided an answer.
---
There's no chance most warriors at 60 will be prot.
---
Check again, there's an Alliance version below the pic. ;)
---
Well that's what you get for reading the comments before the post.
---
Expanding on B33rtaster’s third point, if you’re planning on raiding past BWL, go lock. Most articles I’ve read state “locks dps takes off” after tier 2.  Plus they have cooler looking gear.
---
In real vanilla I opened a ticket once saying that the tram in the instanced portion runs east west when in the game world it goes north south.

GM told me that it was because it was supposed to go to Darnassus and they never changed the instance rotation to match the actual travel direction.

Can the amateur philosopher bullshit its almost as bad as all the amateur devs on this sub.  I like vanilla period.  Don't you dare try to add sprinkles.

I quite soon after burning crusade, played a bit on my brothers account after I regretfully sold my 60 warrior with epics for like 120$ on eBay. Sigh that was a lot of money for me back then. I heard there was a way to get your old character restored but I haven’t looked into it not sure if it would even work since I sold out.  However, I am really not familiar with he game I haven’t played in 7 years. For me I’m looking forward to figuring out a new class, making my own macros (or finding them) and having way better computer, mouse and keyboard. I think there’s plenty to work towards without getting hung up on every person having no idea what’s going on. I feel like most folks will be super into it since really there’s no point in playing a 10 year old game unless you love it
---
Yea thank you, it's appreciated. I'm just playing devil's advocate really: when you consider Druid is like the second or third fastest leveller in Vanilla, surely that leaves a lot of room to take a build that's slightly slower in favour of being more useful in world pvp and dungeons. Another way to look at it: what's better - slightly faster levelling on a class that's already faster than 80% of other classes (also a big part of Vanilla is the journey/levelling right? So faster levelling could even be seen by some as bad) or having Furor and Feral Charge to make tanking and world pvp easier and more effective? Interesting decisions to be made. Right now I personally feel like the utility offers a lot more, don't know if you could convince me otherwise, or if you agree.

Ha, I have that exact hoodie. I got it in like maybe 2006-2007? It got worn nearly every single day to school for the following 4ish years. I was that totally that kid for a while. It's got 2 massive tears directly above the front hoodie pockets because that's just where I kept my hands all day. I actually use it as my "long sleeve lab coat" at work when testing asphalt, as asphalt is black and the hoodie is black so it never gets too noticeably dirty. Its also quite small on me now, but hey, I get a hit of nostalgia every time I put it on :)
---
arms &gt; fury when leveling
---
Yeah, but some of us don't want to spend real money on WoW gold.  So then it takes more time to farm it ourselves.   Those of us who were playing Vanilla at launch in high school typically have a family now, so 8 hour gaming sessions aren't a thing.  So, this is one of those times where poisons are okay.  What little income in game I have, I'd rather spend it on something better than \~6% dps boost in a perfect world.
---
Your perception of this is largely skewed.  Is this the best DPS?  Yes.  Poisons will still be used by 95+% of raiders, and this content is so easy that it's damn sure going to be enough.  So quit it with the elitist attitude.   
---
Also, props for the clickbait-esque title of the thread :)
---
I dropped hunter. But that has to do with all the additional setbacks that were revealed over the last weeks that are just crippling for pvp. So yes those mechanics played a role in the decision
---
#TAKE MY MONEY! I wanna play
---
Alright. I wouldn't have thought 50 AP &gt; 15% agi. Thanks for the info. Last question: clever traps or trap mastery for pvp?
---
I was 17 and knew I wanted to kick ass, but thought my name would get flagged for being offensive. Hence bootaykicker. I will however be a paladin this go around, and I am reprising my name of Yuengladin.
---
Omg Hippie! I used to PvP with him. Was able to hit Rank 10 with that group. I remember we both applied to Blood Reign and competed head to head for the last Shaman spot. I was lucky enough to have an edge because I had more PvE gear than he did, but overall it was pretty equal in skill.
---
It’s all guild dependent. Find a guild that cares less about min max and more about fun.
---
Yeah don’t level as fury
---
I doubted they would look any better but youre totally right. Looks way cooler.
---
I used to play a lot of online games.  Took a break for a while then the next online game I played was OW.  Don't know if it's the OW community specifically or a different era, but it was by far the most toxic game I've ever played (didn't play LoL or DotA which I hear are really bad).  People complaining all the time, anytime someone is in chat they are complaining "trash this, trash that".
---
fromage de guerre
---
Opened up my star wars visual dictionary, saw Yaddle.
---
Im fucking horde but have leveled ally a bit due to friends forcing me too and Ewynn-Westfall-Redridge-Duskwood saga(precata) and zones are legit the best in the game so far.
---
Unbelievably good.
---
I thought I had the coolest name ever! I was so proud of myself. Then one day I got a spell with the same name. I was so upset. I kept the name for a while and eventually changed it. Good ole’ counterspell.

When we rolled Horde I named my Tauren Druid Hughheffer
---
That Hunter focus note is interesting. That mechanic sounds really cool and it's a shame they scrapped it .
---
I want cake now for some reason

No, he doesn't have it.  It's theorycrafting.  He's just defensive. :)
---
Yup lol. I was just a pleb troll hunter named Zyoz at the time. Was in blackout and then Lithium
---
Mages hold all my aggro while I backstab them.
---
People are just bummed out that the classic hunter turned out so much weaker than what they were used to on private servers over the last years.
---
Since you two won't have any heals other than bandages, burst damage is going to be very good - backstab should work really well, only should take 2 before a single mob dies. Fire would also work well until about 30 when frost becomes much more Mana efficient
---
Agreed, warlocks were gods in the TBC prepatch.
---
it is cute to see the retail crowd make posts like OP's. 
---
really reminds me of this one guy, and I'm unsure if the picture I'll link will be his, but this guy thought he was a genius by looking at the classic NES color palette and going "wow... all these characters from NES titles COULD have looked SO MUCH BETTER if only the artists knew what we know today about pixel art..." and he [re-colored megaman something like this.](https://www.pixilart.com/images/art/5e5ec58d2d2140d.png)
---
the thing he completely overlooked and was completely oblivious to was that while that color palette was available, the physical limitations of the device didn't allow for that kind of mixture of colors in the small of an area. it was just a really short-sighted "OH MAN IM A GENIUS I FOUND SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE REALIZED WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM!!!" kind of moment, pretty similar to this guy. "DUDE, YOU CAN GET SLIGHTLY MORE DPS IF YOU JUST USE THIS ITEM WHICH YOU'LL HAVE INFINITE OF AT ALL TIMES BECAUSE WE GET EVERYTHING WE WANT FOR FREE IN RETAIL SO THAT MUST BE WHAT CLASSIC WAS LIKE!!!"
---
The legendary daggers has been introduced after WOTLK and that's the limit I set for my farm, otherwise I'll go crazy :D
---
Luckily for caster you only need r13 since the r14 weps are so mediocre.
---
Haha BiPolar, was with them for a second before I joined Stoic
---
same.
---
It's like a catch 22: if you want to tank, you can't tank. If you want to dps, you can't join. 
---
The way to be the #1 dps warrior in your guild is to start as the main tank, get geared as hell, wait for the day one of the now-geared off tanks wants to MT, and everyone allows you to switch to dps because reasonably you've "put in your time," plus they're afraid you'll /gquit with the only Thunderfury in guild.
---
Is that how they do it?! Ill never /salute a Grand Marshall again!

Can also be used in Battlegrounds to hunt down that one guy on the enemy faction you REALLY hate so you can consistently camp the hell out of them.

I mean it’s 2019 do you guys think there’s actually gonna be a lot of “clickers?  I’m betting they are gonna be rare with the amount of “optimal play” info out there these days

---
I'm only going for R13 and I plan on attempting it post graduation and before I start my new job. Perfect timing lol
---
Yeah mage will hold aggro if you he opens, you have to build energy, he spends it so easily :)
---
&gt; Too many people know what they’re doing now and where to go, the sense of wonder you get from exploring the game will be all but gone since we’re so familiar with it all.
---
I'll interject with this; there are more than likely a lot of gaps in your memory. We'll recall a lot of things but there are things you will not. Played on a private server last year; do you remember Stone Cairn Lake? I fucking didn't and I thought I knew Elwyn like the back of my hand.
---
There will be those people who somehow manage to suck the fun out of it by getting competitive but you know what? Fuck em.  I'm not looking up guides. I'm not racing to 60 and I'm not as concerned with do I *need* people to get through quests as I am with will it make it easier. 
---
Try-hards and people coming in just to gank are the reason I'm rolling PVE.
---
Yeah lol what never heard of this.
---
Exactly. Thank you. Just want to make sure everyone gets names and such on a server they want to play on. My main focus is the guild I am going to join because I am one of very few that are wanting to raid semi-hardcore/hardcore.
---
So far they've said "we don't care which region" so I'll probably be making executive decision.
---
In my opinion you should mostly ignore the polls as a factor for your class choice. What you like to play matters the most for fun! This is a game afterall
---
Someone asked for proof here as well... 😂
---
Account share and collusion. You make a premade of everyone who has a shot at rank 14 and agree to take turns each week. *Big* drama on my server amongst the marshalls anytime someone spent a little too much time pvping.
---
Both have good merits. Maybe flip a coin?
---
Loved that series as a kid.
---
Not at all.  You do additional quests which can put you a singular level ahead of where you would be.  That level could be the difference between having an easy time or a terrible time.
---
Westfall also blows at level 12.  There are pretty big gaps there.  I'd much rather go to Loch Modan, finish up most of those quests, then head to Westfall, do all of that zone, then head back to Loch to finish up the Northern and Eastern quests, and then to Redridge at, minimum, level 20.  Then you're fine for Duskwood.
---
Well ol chap, I do believe I gave it my very best to convince you to experience something remarkable, to look inward and notice something about you own thought process and change it to make it broader and encompass more.  However it seems your pigheadedness has prevailed in the end.
---
I would like to leave you with one minor caveat though.
---
What do you see the as the future of classic, 3-4 years down the road?  Perhaps, or most definitely, you have not given it any thought at all.  Well let me paint you a somewhat realistic picture.
---
You'll find yourself sitting in a major city, all your end game gear equipped, but no one to show it off to.  The only players around you are the few who are just like you, the players who have reached the end.  Who have refused change, yet refuse to let go of a withered, decaying memory.  Who have just logged on in an attempt to relive their past in their memories.  Yet even those players will eventually accept reality, and the game will die.
---
It honestly seems like a terrible way for such a great game to go.  Especially since we are so lucky to have precedence of a company ruining a game, rolling it back, and a separate team revive it and expand on it without compromising it's core gameplay.  There is evidence it can work, so why not take the chance.  If noting is added, the game will die, surely even you can understand that reality without having to personally experience it.  So with it's fate set in stone, why not take the chance to push for greatness?
---
I think the reason is because you no changers are truly the rose tinted glasses players.  If you believed the game itself is great and the gameplay is still great today, then you would be more than supportive of expanding on it in a way that doesn't comprise what makes it great.  But that is not the case for you guys, and the reason is quite obvious.
---
You are just trying to relive your past.
---
Yeah, unless your faction dominates, you’re not going to be able to guarantee raid times for casual raiding guilds.
---
I was a casual raider when I was in high school on a high pop PvP server and remember some nights where we had to call it early or even miss out on an entire raid. Tier 2 was the worst because sometimes we’d do MC and then get camped and prevented from going to BWL for an hour+, leaving us only time for razergore and vael. We eventually had to cancel MC because we couldn’t go from Ony to Mc to BWL reliably. Some people didn’t get their tier 2 legs.
---
Backstabs and Frost bolts, whatever it is will be dead before it gets to you
---
&lt;Relentless&gt; Shattered Hand US.... always server first
---
So, I believe in Classic there is actually a buff cap that is not on private servers. Shadow power elixir,  and arcane elixir are likely not able to fit into that cap if you are optimizing buffs. Neither will Supreme Power realistically. How does Shadow Oil compare to poisons with SP consumes.
---
Mages and to a little lesser extent warlocks are the kings of AOE in vanilla. So if your are looking specifically for big battles I'd say go one of them.
---
The fun thing about AV is that pretty much everything shines there. Hunters/mages/rogues are particularly good/usefull in the Bg. But sometimes you really need a tank and don't have one so a tank could shine in AV
---
No, there's a difference from asking for discussion and demanding proof.
---
Also be aware of when your pet is 1-2 levels below yourself, he might pull things you wouldn't. When in doubt, dismiss your pet for a few packs and save your group the stress.
---
someone late for his nap?
---
Its stat budget is pushed very heavily toward stamina, which will keep it out of totally min-maxed BiS lists. If you look at lists expanded out to best 10 items, it usually ranks middle of the pack there.
---
Rimklove, small character from a Swedish DnD campaign. It's available in English now too, Wildheart or Vildhjarta as the original was called.
---
It depends if you get to know the people in your guild
---
I mean in phase 1 there's no bonus, but later on when pretty much most people are capped, world pvp outside of dungeons can be hella fun. While leveling if you're behind on a pvp server though yeah that sounds pretty fucking awful.
---
Is this guy serious or is this a joke post? I'm confused... sorry
---
The buff cap is 32 (the buff display cap is 16), so you're unlikely to reach it.
---
You made as wall of text because someone here asked a question. Now someone asks for proof and you can't/won't provide. I don't really care, but seems silly and inconsistent.
---
This is the list that never ends
---
School of life
---
Assuming no buff cap, world firsts will do this, maybe. Titan's might actually be better for speed running. Cheap out on healers, take more dos, have the melee pop titan's and be more responsible for keeping themselves alive.
---
Hey! Could you please include daggers? Would love to use those, mostly.
---
I also played the stress test, and I had a great time. I knew what the quests were and where to go. But I was quite pleased that I didn't have the game leading me by the nose the whole time.
---
I felt both nostalgia and a sense of wonder. I didn't have my level 1 heirloom mount to cart me around, and things could actually hurt me. 
---
That is what I'm excited about. That classic is challenging and doesn't water down the game. Yes, we have wowhead, we can look things up or use addons. But they're not baked into the UI. The mobs hit hard. The world literally does not revolve (scale) around my character's progress.
---
There will be tons of people doing the quest at launch tho, not so much 1 year in.
---
Leveling I plan to go full nostalga. Either rewatch my fav 100 films or a fav SF series like Stargate.
---
For general play, my second screen is a 4k monitor with 3TB Tivo, Roku, 4k bluray, and Playstation connected. Also 14TB of SF shows I own and ripped. So always have something playing. Or Spotify on occasion.
---
You only pick up the blues and vendor. Simple as that.
---
Yeah, got Thunderfury 10 years ago and didn't play for a while, last year was a great year indeed :)
---
Hah holy shit I totally forgot about those guys until now.
---
Otherway around lol.
---
Idk I always just powered through into westfall.  The travel to and from seems like a waste just to do some green quests.  But I guess idk really.  I would think if it was really so effecient it would be in the Joana guides.
---
I knew that about arcane explosion and I remember how dumb I used to think it was that it wasn't always instant! Ah what a refreshing post. Thank you

To be honest, he's not going to be lonely and waiting at level 60 if he does it in a week.  There will be other people looking for other level 60s that also did it in a week.
---
Though, his initial point was stupid and you guys are arguing over semantics.  If you said, "It takes people 4 months to reach 60," instead of, "It takes people 4 months to level," there wouldn't be an argument at all.  
---
He's trying to make the point that if you take 10 days /played to reach 60 then you were doing other things along the way.  That's a dumb ass point Imo.  What matters is how long it takes to get to 60 for the average player.

2H fury is excellent for levelling, at least until you get MS. You'd be surprised at how often you're able to keep Blood Craze, Enrage and Flurry up - even with the /sit mechanic fixed. Levelling as dual wielding can be tough due to the hit rating penalty you take for dual wielding, plus the added dimension of the return of weapon skills needing to be levelled. Once you have good gear though, you'd typically go dual wield for raid dps. Fury warriors were consistently high on meters but because of all the heroic strike spam, they'd pull aggro a bunch too.
---
Also there is a massive difference between fury and arms specs when it comes to 2H weapon speed. Bloodthirst is attackpower based so it works quite well with dual wield. But your biggest damage dealers as arms, overpower and MS, are both weapon damage based**.** 
---
**This effect is magnified by weapon speed.** Even though my Sul'Thraze hits for roughly the same weapon damage as my enchanted Whirlwind Axe, the 2.6 second swing timer on Sul'Thraze vs the 3.6 seconds of WW axe calculates out to be something like **25-30 damage less per swing**, a HUGE amount at that level. **Remember, slower weapon speed = bigger dmg multiplier**. As I got mortal strike with a slow WW axe, the damage output increase from MS alone was more than enough to make me not miss Enrage/Blood Craze/Flurry too much.
---
This is why Stoneslayer is so, so, *so* good for MS warrs when you are levelling up. Run Uldaman like mad for the sword because it won't be replaced until the one that drops off Wyrmthalak in LBRS. Form a group that can't weild 2H swords except for you, I mean it. The Rockpounder is also a good consolation price, but Stoneslayer with MS and Sword Spec will just f'ing destroy. 
---
Arms spec is essentially some combination of 41 arms to get weapon spec and MS, 20 fury for Enrage/Blood Craze.
---
Show me one guild that is not using some form of loot council.
---
I saw them from Horde side. I remember being afraid of their pallies. On our side, the top dog was Nightmares Asylum.
---
Moonstalker. Plainstrider. Crocolisk.
---
Apparently...
---
&gt; The basics of the system are as follows:
---
&gt; Players are put in an ordered list, usually based on a random roll (although some have made attempts to translate the order from a pre-existing loot system). Multiple lists may be used (see below for discussion).
---
&gt; When a new player needs to be added to the list, it is possible to let him "roll in," or simply insert him at the bottom of the list(s).
---
&gt; When loot is dropped, the person who wants it and is nearest the top of the list wins the loot and goes to the bottom of the list.
---
&gt; Players who are not currently in the raid do not move up or down in the lists.
---
&gt; If no-one wants the item, it is up to the guild to decide what to do with it. See the SK FAQ for some suggestions.
---
Does your work laptop have a VPN client which auto connects? Could be ur works firewall.
---
If u can set an installation location with the battle net client you could do it on an external hard drive and then run it from there but idk enough about the blizz client to say that with any csrtainty.
---
It works fine for the 1.12 client tho.
---
Some quests in Vanilla are like "travel across the world to deliver this letter" and it rewards 90 exp. Total wastes of time that a really experienced player would know to avoid.
---
Didn't vanilla only had limited free transfers from high pop realms to low pop?
---
You may need to specify the exact ports for your internal company VPN to allow the WoW download through. I am assuming this is what your coworker had to resort to.
---
I hear you it for sure helps (if you can pull multiple mobs to one drop spot). But its a lot of mana cost and a pain. 
---
I honestly may have used to too much thus hated my life (both times.)
---
I always find it odd that paladins QQ so they got 15 min buffs and shamans are 2 minutes rofl.
---
isBoxer just makes boxing so much easier I can't fathom not using it at this point. I've tried a variety of other software as well but nothing compares to the ease of use and overall functionality of isBoxer. It's really a top notch product. 
---
PvP server just gets messy. It's hard enough to manage one character in a fight but trying to juggle 2 just frustrates me. Mobs are fairly predictable and easy to manage but players are not. And if someone figures out you're boxing they're going to go out of their way to mess with you. Having to run multiple chars back to your body and deal with everything just becomes a hassle. 
---
On the flipside your box char can be a scarecrow and may deter potential gankers.
---
&gt; convenience isn't always best (game design-wise).
---
Good point. At this point  my pc  no longer even has a CD rom drive anymore. Buying physical copies of pc games is a fond memory like buying CDs and I do miss it.
---
Are casual guilds even recruiting at this point? 
---
Feels like only the hardcore guilds are recruiting.
---
Thanks, I really appreciate the offer. I'm not looking for contributors for the moment, but I've been making note of folks who have shown interest in case that changes.
---
The basics of saving things locally in general are pretty straightforward, it's more about implementing it in a nice way that abstracts it a bit and doesn't require that logic in every place I'm fetching/saving data. I'm using a GraphQL API with the Apollo client, which has support for local resolvers for this kind of thing. So it's going to involve setting up a bunch of those, and some plumbing to make the decision on when to hit the local resolvers versus the remote ones, or a mix of the two.
---
I also want to have a nice experience for when you've been creating stuff locally and decide you want everything saved to an account. So there's some UI and API work around that. Plus a bit of messaging here and there to explain how data is being saved locally and what things might result in your browser clearing that out. Sharing links to sets will be a bit different as well.
---
Maybe nobody cares, but in case you were interested in knowing some details. This is what my weekend is going to look like :)
---
Haha I should have mentioned adrenaline rush but I think the point stands. :)
---
Came here looking for an alternative to funneling all tanking gear to a maintank. We're running a dkp system and obviously need geared up tanks to progress, but as we're not a hardcore or even semi-hardcore guild, the concern is an overgeared player may just get poached. Is there a good way to handle tanking loot in a dkp system without just funneling the guild to 1 main tank?
---
If you want to do both pve and wpvp then I would recommend Rogue or Mage as they are top 3 classes in Wow and good in all areas. Hunter is also amazing in wpvp but is not very good in Raids. For professions you will want Engineering and your other proff is up to you.
---
We had "Beyond". They were the most elite players in the server.
---
This question isnt fair without taking assumed information into consideration. There is no structure or loot system that is universally superior. 
---
Ultimately, the best way to organize your guild and distribute loot is greatly dependent on the people in your group.
---
For example, if your guild is incredibly focused on progression and performance, all other considerations be damned, then every piece of loot should be given to the person who is projected to enjoy the largest throughput benefit from it. If a piece helps healer A by 10 hps and healer B by 11....it should go to healer B. If an item allows a single dpser to do 25 more dps, but allows the tank to achieve 7 more tps...it should go to the tank. Etc. 
---
In this situation, loot should never be a desire or a point of discussion or drama...loot is the means to the end. 
---
But that is very few guilds. Very few people who are that competitive are able to let their ego fade within the group. What I mean is, people dont just want to be part of a team that produces high parses (you entire raid needs to be putting up good numbers to allow for anomalously high individuals, to relatively increase proc uptimes). Most people who want to be on that team also want to be the first one to get the loot so that they are winning internal meters too. 
---
So even in hyper competitive hardcore guilds, loot drama stirs up, because skill is never equal across 40-50 people. 
---
Which brings up another issue--the bench. 
---
A wow raid requires 40 people. But reality being reality, getting 40 people to consistently show up multiple days a week for multiple hours at a time is difficult unless you are punishing or paying them. Thus even the most hardcore guilds have a bench of 5-10 players. 
---
How do you apportion loot to them?
---
If the goal of the guild is to kill raid bosses ASAP, cleanly and quickly, repeatedly, then I believe the "best" system is dkp with oversight and carteling/collusion allowed. I also think it is important to be selective in the membership--its important to find people who are to be good faith actors within the system.
---
A zero sum dkp system, blind single bid. Ties to rolls. Legendaries decided ahead of time (first 2 TF to MT/OT, Guild vote on others). 
---
People want agency. This proposed guild would select only people who are interested in getting the most out of their characters and more broadly the most out of the raid. Considering that, I would feel comfortable leaving distribution to the invisible hand of the market. Everyone will be most interested in securing the biggest upgrades for themselves. For the most part people will come into MC at different stages of BIS, and certainly once in MC, few people will achieve BIS between the tiers. As such, aside from weapons, everyone will have a different piece that represents their single biggest upgrade. Then there are others who have pieces lying in wait for a key upgrade, that individually isnt massive, but by the reorganization of gear it presents is huge. 
---
If however, your guild is more loot than performance oriented, loot council and random rolling can often produce preferred outcomes. Some people dislike the free market approach (probably cause they arent good at working within it), and  a loot council, or "central planning committee"  to carry over the economic metaphor, works better for them.  Still others see that as a contrived way to shower the guild leaders' chosen core group with loot, and they prefer random rolls. 
---
This also again, comes to guild population. If you have 200 raiders, random rolls and loot council seems a lot better than dkp, as infrequently raiding in a dkp system can lead to weird outcomes.
---
Don’t even bother 
---

The only speeding ticket I ever  got was when I was heading home from buying WoTLK.
---
When I leveled my night elf druid, I corpse ran at level 1 to Stormwind as it was my favorite zone. It was a huge mistake as I didn't realize there was going to be all this Druid specific stuff going on all the way over on the other side of the world. I don't think there was even a druid trainer in Stormwind at the time.
---
I see guilds run 1 shadow priest for shadow weaving but the rotation sucks, spam rank 1 SWP, then mindflay and chug mana pots while ending up at the bottom of the meters. The shadow weaving debuff does provide a ton of raid dps though..
---
BRD is basically gifting epic mounts to rogues. The DI Ore sells for great prices, and if you’re geared enough to actually solo that Flameguard at the forge, you can just mint gold by smelting it as well.
---
LMAOOO AHH I HAD THIS
---
Honestly, even with collusion the time commitment was absurd. I can't imagine without it.
---
AQ introduced some new ranks of skills, but not entirely new skills (to my knowledge).
---
Is your guild rolling together for classic? I definitely remember your guild name. What was your characters name?
---
Sorry to hear that. If you still have issues you can reach out in a private message and I'll take a look at what's happening.
---
I don't believe it has an auto connecting VPN, though I have one that I can turn to access company-specific programs, so I doubt it has any kind of additional one that is automatically connecting. I may try to the external hard drive thing. Thanks for the idea!
---
Is your name Will?
---
Yea, the best way to come up with "Is this action actually bannable?" is to ask the question "Has anyone been banned for this or something similar before?" and the answer to that is yes, many a person has been banned for purchasing gold.
---
Ahhh! A Gilneas buddy! I remember Beyond.
---
I a hunter so i never feel bad for rolling for everything ;P
---
Layer layer. Layer 7. Layer. Layer. 7.

this only works in retail and the beta, if they fix it until release you will lose cp.
---
Am I the only one who keybinds everything but still keyboard turns? It always seems that keyboard turning is assumed to go with clicking. I’be used keybinds since I worked out they were a thing but used the arrow keys to move. I’ve recently got a mouse and am trying to get the hang of moving with the mouse but I don’t like that you can’t move backwards easily.
---
Who gets the gear?
---
Loot council has been the best from my perspective over the years playing the game. *Assuming the loot council cares about the guild as a whole*.
---
We had a class officer for each class,  general guild officers and GM. Loot rules were if something dropped and you wanted it, you'd link what you were trying to replace and if it gave a set bonus when we got around to that item. We'd quickly go over whoever linked and divy it out based on performance, if you hadn't gotten anything in a while, guild rank, etc. Loot rules were quickly gone over at the start of every raid during trash to make sure people had it beaten into memory and dealing out loot wasn't a slog to get through.
---
We determined guild rank by activity, not necessarily raiding and raid performance, but they were definitely taken into account. If you couldn't be on for every raid but helped people do stuff like attunements in the few hours you could be on, we took notice. If you helped supply the bank with mats for consumables. Even if you came to raid but couldn't make it and sat on the bench, it still counted as coming to raid.  
---
This worked for us for the longest time and only really stopped after people had to leave for real life.  It also meant that once most people were suited up, loot became progressively easier.
---
This ONLY works if the guild is a community, and everyone is friendly. If you've got officers who are asshole and wanna hoard loot it doesn't work. The officers need to make sure who they have on the council are people who are fine with giving someone else the loot.  It was also something we kept a close eye on, using a spreadsheet to track raid attendance and loot people got (or was DE'd)
---
Yea its possible, I'm just not sure how I would go about allowing ports through the company VPN. I did it for the Windows firewall on the off chance that it was blocking them, but it didn't help unfortunately.
---
Yeah if they give you TF you're tanking for life. The only way I see you switching from tank to fury is if you transition between phases such as BWL to AQ and you don't have TF.  
---
The best way to get an invite to a guild as a fury warrior is to beat all the other warriors to 60 + pre-raid BIS.
---
I have a little penis, so LilPenous it is
---
And how many blues does princess drop per kill?
---
Yeah in a raid if you have at least 3+ Warlocks. Not in a dungeon.

Frostmane correct? I was horde but regularly joined vent with members of VC. I was in the Horde guild A Cut Above, which reformed into Beyond Remorse.
---
I remember a few alliance names from the server though. Dwarfpriest, Batsman, &amp; Flamingtable are the only that jump out to me now, but I know DP was in VC for sure.
---
Onslaught's loot system looks great for heavy raiders, but you need someone quite technically inclined to understand and maintain it. A loot priority system with trusted loot council override could work well. 
---
E.g. If I were in charge of loot distribution, there would be 0 favouritism. I'm lawful neutral. Emphasis on the lawful... Which is much better than awful! 
---
For more casual raiding, I think a priority list with EP/GP may be the way to go. Or perhaps just track people's involvement and incentivise progression nights, somehow (more kudos for sticking with it through learning and wiping).
---
If X piece drops and Y player has attended as much as anyone, if their priority (for progression, not personal gain) is above anyone else, give it to them. If there are equal priorities, roll for randomness and note that next time that piece or a similar piece drops, it goes to the other player--so long as they maintain their attendance rate.
---
Just thinking out loud...
---
Lol yeah that's not a thing, you tried.
---
Hunter has no reason to wear any leather armor since there is plenty of chain mail with agility and int expecially once you start raiding.  So if you are trying to compete with rogues and druids for armor your probably one of the reasons people call hunters huntards.
---
I used play main healer in 5 man dungeons with my spriest using VE. People doubt me but I pulled it off. I just took off my shadow form if things got out of control and popped trinkets and potions. Was quite easy.
---
I had similar story as a resto druid. Played couple months until i finaly realized its pointless and left. Good decission.

How much were they paid to give this interview.
---
You shouldn’t be allow to press MS in a raid. Just factor in extra farming per week to respec pve and pvp.
---
ain't nobody playing ally out here lmao
---
Find a good guild early and stick with 'em, yeah. My alliance alt was a warrior, and I loved tanking rend runs in vanilla, but I never found a home for it.

Yeah frostmane and then to a couple others I kind of forget it’s been so long and I didn’t join until a little later. They were a top guild in the world though.

90% of the time i see something media coverage is related to its so bad, time period only changes how grey and the amount of pixels in the awful consumption
---
For real, we all know priests should accrue dkp far greater than ~~taxi drivers~~ warlocks.
---
Unfortunately there has been a habit of late for people to simply lift guides from the creators, for better or worse. 
---
It’s Brian Kopp’s guide OP, good solid guide for a freebie 👍
---
Same.
---
Ah I remember those guys. I was in Out of Line during BC we grouped up with Impervious for server first Kil Jaedan kill IIRC. Also remember running with them to kill all of the horde faction leaders the day the challenge released for the Black War Bear. Good times!
---
dueling and MCing people into the STV arena where a bunch of my guildies were waiting in stealth was always neat
---
bitch move but my god i was 19 and it was hilarious
---
5 layers are all thats needed https://m.imgur.com/gallery/WcNXvgQ

When naming my characters I have always taken a word that correlates to aspects of the particular class that character will be using, and then I translate it into another language that I find interesting.
---
For example, when originally naming my Elemental shaman I selected the English word "Lightning" and translated it to Norwegian. Thus resulting in the name, "Lynende"
---
Agreed. Friends rolling horde for classic. Am sad I dont get to spooky quest in darkshire..
---
I'll message you when servers come out. What class you going? I'm heavily leaning towards warlock. Plan is to no life by way to 60 and then figure out my path from there lol.
---
I want that shirt, where can I buy it?
---
Seems kinda silly to give the best players all the best gear....I hope more went into it than that. Otherwise it'd be impossible for the other people to ever catch up.
---
Yea buying gold is kind of awful cant condone that.  Pay to Win is just so lame.
---
NA left as soon as the server transfers were available. If you weren't past suppression room by 8:30, then the raid was pretty much donezo due to server lag and a giant queue.
---
Sounds like me, but with mage spells lol.
---
Phuck min max! I'm a phoken philthy casual and I just equip my shit and raid pugs aaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllll day long
---
1 ag = 2 ap only for rogues, all other classes that get ap from agility gets 1:1.  Thats how it was in vanilla and also why rogues scaled allot better with gear.
---
God damn, my load was so unbalanced because of my platform.  What a timely intervention
---
&gt; you've removed all incentive to actually play the game for a number of players
---
Yeah give birth to a human being just to let it live in that dumpster you call a house and be surprised he's looking for ways to escape his reality
---
We're going Horde aswell but luckily I think precata horde zones etc are also amazing. But fuck me were they bad post cata.
---
depends on your class it was not flat 1ag = 2ap for all classes.  Rogues got 2ap:1ag but hunters and druids did not.
---
I can see how someone would think that, but for me, getting to maximize my performance (and thus my enjoyment) inside the hours I have to play the game is not lame.
---
Yes. Hunters and mages can farm Hederine Slayers in winterspring. They have a 1% chance to drop eye of shadow which is an epic trinket required for the benediction priest quest.
---
The current 1-60 record is 3 days 9 hours (81 hours) so I highly doubt that you'll see anyone dinging 60 until at least day 4.
---
Doesn't Blizzard ban you for buying gold though? Why do you think Blizzard thinks its okay?
---
Well to be fair WoW addiction IS a thing
---
Good to know. Still very fast for what it is
---
Wipe recovered by rogue/hunter with cables.

Actually in any form of communication. Not just in game. I’ll explain it for you later.

What's the difference between NPC's and your guild. 
---
.
---
The NPC's don't key turn
---
I'm gonna run a priest this time around. Unfortunately I've grown up quite a bit since vanilla so no lifing my way to 60 may take a bit longer than I hope haha.
---
You can always ask at the start. Or declare what type of items you are rolling on. Typically, i think you roll for the spec you are playing in the group. But if you join a group and are like hey im rolling for enh gear, people will typically allow this. And if Healing gear drops wait to see if the caster N if not ask and people will almost always let you have the caster gear they don't need.
---
Hope you got your guild already locked in!  I'm going Fury OT again, me and some shammy going Cleaveland with some hungry melees during the SM phase!
---
Yeah, that much is clear :P
---
The first transfer definitely was only to a designated low pop server... But eventually they may have allowed more specific transfers I think.
---
only read the tl;dr:  what?
---
Actually i tend to name my characters after the Dragons in rain wild chronicles i also have a character names Kelsingra. I figure the main characters are to common although i like the idea if a rogue named Chade.

I am mostly a solo player. I think it’s a personality thing. I get and build energy when I am alone and do what I like. I build energy when I have absolutely no commitment to anyone and nobody else have commitment to me. 
---
But the energy I get (the part that is not spent on myself by doing what I do alone) is used to be social and do stuff with others to get “rewards”
---
I am introvert by nature but I am also pretty good with logic. And it’s far easier to get rewards when you are with others. 
---
So I act extrovert to get rewards. It’s not my true self. And I long for the next time I am alone again, so that I can enjoy the reward I got from being social. I mostly enjoy rewards that I can spend when I am alone and on myself. 
---
So I have raided, played bgs and I have been in all kinds of group content. But mostly I will play alone or at least play with friendlies around me that I don’t talk to.
---
Our guild is tackling this by inviting 2 or 3 non officers (with different members each raid) to the council and making the council discussion as transparent as we can. We're gonna try to judge attendance, performance, and contributions (such as donations to gbank, providing flasks, etc)
---
Nope, they’re dead serious
---
Abandon your family quest is always an option.
---
Yeah I'll be crafting full Shadoweave asap once I hit 44. Who cares if it won't help enough to justify. I'm gonna have more fun with it than leveling faster so it's actually 100% necessary
---
Top DPS doesn't mean the most dedicated. You could have someone that shows up every raid, with full consumables and extras for the raid that does less DPS than the guy that shows up for 1 raid a week. DPS meters aren't the be all end all of dedication. As long as people are doing decent DPS it doesn't matter who tops the charts. People will leave if they get skipped over week after week to the guy that only shows up for bosses he needs loot from because he does slightly more damage for example.
---
You probably want numbers from actual blizz servers than private servers since thats thats going to matter.  Back in Vanilla There were no multiboxing cause most computers couldnt handle it, as well as the cost of having multiple accounts to do it.  Then you might have to deal with blizzard or GM's because back then something like that was probably an exploit since it was something new and not heard of.  If blizz allows you to multibox on classic servers then that might change things as well as the economy of the servers so we will see how they handle it.  They might ignore it but when I played back in vanilla if anyone was multiboxing I never heard of it nor did anyone say anything about it.  Now I multiboxed in eve online back then but not in wow.
---
I was planning on rolling a warlock before this, but reminding me of how fucking great a troll summon is just solidified that decision. I'm looking so forward to all the trolling I'll be doing

If you play an Alliance Priest you ought to play a Dwarf if you can stand looking at a Dwarf while playing.  Fear Ward is op af
---
ELI5 what is layering?
---
I think this is one of the biggest things i'm excited for. There will be a large, large number of people who never actually experienced the raiding environment back then and can do so now. That will be a new experience in a familiar setting.
---
I always like aoe leveling as a mage, when you get really good at it you can kill upwards of 15-20 mobs in a pull pre-mount. 
---
Nothing makes you feel more powerful watching people quest and kill maybe 2 at a time and then you say "hold my mana pot" and kill the zone.
---
Find a warrior to babysit.  He'll keep you alive, you keep him alive.
---
Do you want to play Horde or Alliance?  Do you have any friends/guild mates playing Classic, what faction are they going?
---
There will be plenty of groups who will take anything for dungeons and plenty of groups that will be min/max wannabes. You'll be fine. I know I'll be inviting anyone and everyone to my groups, as long as they aren't a complete tool.

My buddy is going to roll a hunter and we're planning to do a lot of pvp. I may do some casual raiding, but I want to play a class that complements the hunter really well. Any ideas?
---
Through or within.
---
If I’m selling gold on stonemaul is alliance side. Would you say that is an offer through or within the platform?
---
It will run retail just not very well
---
One that Agi is useless. (why even type out oh you get 1-4 more agi, pff a joke.)
---
Dwarves' stoneform make you much better verses rouges, other hunters, and a few other classes. 
---
They are arguably the best Alliance race for hunter.
---
That being said NE's shadowmeld is great for ganking and eating/drinking in bgs.
---
I'm actually looking forward to a different experience.  I was extremely hardcore, min max, server first raid kills, pvping to Commander on my Alliance server and also Liutenant General on my Horde PRE NERFS to the system.  Pushed a lot of people to Grand Marshal and a few to High Warlord in the premade wsg's I ran with the best crew on both servers (separate times of course, I rerolled alliance on a fresh server after my time as horde on my OG server).
---
Anyways... All that is the past.  I want to casual the shit out of dungeon runs and 5man groups of my friends who will be playing with me.  I look forward to joining PUG MC/Ony and hopefully failing a few times!  Not because I don't know what I'm doing but because the pug will be a fun mess.
---
Planning my play out to the course of exactly what runs I'm doing and who I'm grouping with or what hours my time in the WSG premade are (because they ran 24/7 so I had timeslots to fill and never miss of like 6-7hour straight minimum every day).  Planning to be the 2nd server lvl 60 because my class officer Priest was dictated to be with the server first group MT and dps....
---
Classic is going to be very different in how I play but yet the same game.  Can't wait.
---
Ayooo. It's ya boy. I'm doing as little research as possible so I can enjoy leveling and not feel like I'm rushing to endgame content. I feel like those who want to rush to level 60 to start raiding are missing the whole point of going back to vanilla wow. But, people can play however they want, I'm not saying any which way is better or worse.
---
This, why all those guides even list them is mind boggling to me.
---
The 2% crit aura provided by atiesh does not stack with moonkin aura or other atiesh. Because the 2% crit gets applied to the entire party, and the other mage who does not have atiesh equipped is gaining benefit from it, we can just remove that crit from the staff for the sake of argument. So atiesh is 150 spellpower and 2% crit. If you're in the atiesh aura party and you're using wraith blade + OH you have 120 spell power, 4% crit (2% from items + 2% from aura) and 2% hit. 2% crit is worth roughly 20-30 spell damage. Meaning wraithblade and OH are about roughly equal to atiesh assuming you're min/maxing your raid groups properly. We don't know if the auras are gonna stack on classic, they didn't on pservers.
---
I know it’s ridiculous. Thanks liberal snowflakes.
---
Pretty sure Shadowmoon had &lt;Bloodsworn&gt;.  They were one of the top raiding guilds, I believe they had a few world firsts even. Famously, the entire guild got banned for some wall hacks in AQ40.

If you're communicating your intent to sell gold by using in-game chat or even BNet chat, then you're breaking the EULA.

If you sell any gold for money, then you're breaking the EULA.

If you use a 3rd party site to discuss and confirm your purchase of gold, you are NOT breaking the EULA.

---
LH has rep gains double that of classic.
---
Not if you do ALL the dun Morogh starting zone quests after completing    \*taps head...     
---
(Honestly strikes me as awful advice,  but whatever.)
---
In pre-raid gear? There's no lol about it.
---
Leveling in NE area is prob the best imo.
---
That’s not true at all. For example priests have four pre-raid options that are better than Sky Shroud and they have two upgrades from those in MC. (Not counting PvP ranking items)
---
Warlocks on the other hand have no other pre-raid option and they have only one upgrade in MC.
---
Sadistic af. 
---
When you consider the amount of time that went into farming some of these buffs, much longer than a corpse run , I'd rather someone ganks me in the open world than purge my buffs before entering a raid, you'd really want to inflict pain onto others to do such a thing !
---
Warlocks are one of the most underplayed classes for vanilla
---
Thanks.  So still much lower, low enough that instant poison is better in most cases.
---
Hahah day TLDR!
---
Do you happen to know what server?
---
&gt; First of all: I do not believe Modern or “Retail” World of Warcraft is dead
---
RIP, downvoted. Clearly has no idea what he's talking about and only cares about his own opinions.
---
Retail is a great game that is very successful for Blizzard.
---
Classic is a great game that we hope will be very successful for Blizzard.
---
Haha yeah, was it hurricane or something for druids?  My brother would have a helluva time knockin me off bridges during duels.

I feel like during WOTLK, as a mage I had one, or maybe that was just fire spec.

cheats; i.e. methods not expressly authorized by Blizzard, influencing and/or facilitating the gameplay, including exploits of any in-game bugs, and thereby granting you and/or any other user an advantage over other players not using such methods;
---
?
---
Whisperwind had a couple that always stood out to me whenever I saw a member. Both were, and still are I think, at the cutting edge of raiding. &lt;Rocket Surgery&gt; and &lt;Alpha&gt;
---
Most likely. It's the same with Runescape and Oldschool Runescape.
---
I remember kill scores of MC raiders by getting them to fall into the lava on the corkscrew part where the chains are. Most people aren't paying attention when there's a whole raid running together with them.
---
It was from J!inx. I maaaaay still have mine lying around somewhere.
---
Two categories for the same game? Doubtful.
---
Probably less time consuming to farm rock pulverizer especially without any high level carries early on for ally. Then you can go straight to bone biter at 34.
---
Yep, nothing about exchanging money for in-game currency there.
---
Why not just bind A and D to strafe left and strafe right (Is that an option in classic, might not be)? That's what most arena players did from TBC onwards when arenas were introduced and it was pivotal, and it kinda got rid of the need for this..maybe I'm missing something, but definitely over explaining how to avoid dazes if strafe left and strafe right bind options are a thing in classic.
---
On ND hosted by LH they have statistics for every level 2 and above character. Undead makes up 37% of the horde population in a sample size of like 400k characters. On their previous server LB it was 38.1%, and on their new super fresh server it's 34.1%. 40% isn't far off from what I can see.
---
Fire is fine so is arcane. Mages almost cannot mess up.
---
Fire gets really cheap (if less impressive) aoe damage from 3 points in fire from flame strike 5% crit per point (15% crit). That is a good 3 point talent, major issue being that it doesn't scale the dot. However ignite scales fire crits. So not only is it 15% crit (~22% more damage you get and extra 40% of that so ~ another 12% so that make your Flamestrike hit for ~ 34% increased damage). Also with other talents reduces mana cost by ~ 7%. also later blast wave is nice you need stuff dead faster or his hp is low and wants to run away a bit to bandage or something.
---
Not bad.
---
Still you as a classic isn't like wrath. He will largely generate threat on a target, and you can just blast it down. 
---
Without heals he is going to take lots of damage but hey you can make him all the food he can eat.
---
Not sure why you wouldn't say warlocks first, that place was practically tailored for the class.
---
Enslave elite demons and use it to kill other elites is biggest cheat, not to mention you have the most CC options available out of all classes (banish/fear) , so you can handle mishaps that occur smoothly.
---
Not to mention locks have track demons, it's like that place was made for the class or something.
---
Plane and simple, Vanilla died with the first expansion, not that an expansion was bad or patch worked on top of the old world, but that Flying mounts killed major concept of exploration and world mystery.  They've later tried to fix this with flying restrictions.
---
One could argue that with every expansion the game really only became more of a mount farming simulator.
---
The difference between 34.1% and 40% is 5.9%, that's like a whole Hunter.
---
Do every quest becomes more valid after level 30, though.
---
I mean if you're going to say fear ward will be instantly dispelled by Horde Shamans but not say that CC will be instantly dispelled by Alliance Paladins then it's clear you're looking at this in a biased way.
---
Interested of you to ignore the to other samples where it was 37 and 38%

RuneScape, OSRS  
---
LoL, TFT  
---
Dota 2, Auto Chess  
---
Wouldn't doubt it.
---
I can not for my life remember any build mentioning or using trap mastery post 1.6  
---
Though this reddit is notorious for digging up proof that people used all kinds of things. As stated above my personal opinion is that it is a relic from pre 1.6 that has little use for you once you are 60. (as stated - i may be wrong about that)
---
How is it not? you don’t get the gold without going through or within the platform.
---
If you were to remove all quests and judge the zones based on just terrain Elwyn, stormwind and Westfall would all be boring. They're just standard fantasy settings. Compare this to zones like thousand needles. Players love the early alliance zones for the story and quests.
---
People that stack warriors/mages and rogues most likely will do split raids, at least for onyxia.
---
Almost kill her, let most people die and leave the raid, loot her with 3-5 people and repeat until you are running out of people/twinks. 
---

Latency is the amount of time it takes for you to send and receive updates, right? So lets say you're playing WoW and in a BG with 80 other people, the server is pushing you updates at 112kbit/s. Well fuck thats too big for you so what everyone else is getting in one second takes you two. Then you process that info, move three steps forward into melee range and try to brain some hapless elfs face in. But fuck, he moved out of range, you can't see it yet on your screen cause your internet blows, your pc is trying to tell the server you can hit, server is telling you to fuck off you're too slow, he is no longer there. But hey, leeway right? We'll just increase the range so he can hit anywhere within a certain distance. Cool, so on your screen you were next to him and hit, on that guys screen you were 7 yards away and hit him. Bandwith and latency are related when your internet blows.
---
Teamfight Tactics and League sharing a Twitch channel would be more akin to Hearthstone and WoW sharing a Twitch channel.
---
The example you were looking for is Runescape and OSRS having their own Twitch channels.
---
I had a lot of run as a rogue gouging/stunning mages who were doing this. It's pretty funny to see the mobs catch up and clobber the mage.
---
Every character has a word synonymous with their role, but in a foreign language. Priest is a doctor named Lekar... and so on
---
The bad part is, I have so many alts over so many servers I forget which one is which. "Shit, I need to log on Lekar because his auctions are expired. Was it the Dwarf on Gorefiend or the Orc on Laughing Skull? I need better notes."
---
It happened with Runescape and OSRS.
---
As someone who went for multiple server first 60s you should have already been practicing and fine tuning your route on private servers. Even though i tried multiple times the best i did was come in second 
---
Back in vanilla and now that i am a bit older there is no way i could do it my body could not handle it.
---
Ever hear of loot council?
---
I play for raids, dungeons, and pvp.
---
Where are you finding these parses? I would like to check them out! Please and thank you
---
Oh man, same. I wrote my comment just before seeing yours!
---
Actually receiving the gold within the Platform has nothing to do with
---
Elwyn, westfall, stormwind, all standard fantasy landscapes. If they had not put so much developmental time into the quests there these locations would be forgettable. Look at a zone like ungoro tho. You don't need any quests the zone is interesting conceptually.
---
Not going too deep but just a couple of comments:
---
Shamans definitely don't "delete" you unless they have insane gear, you can easily get heals off between his shocks and mana burn on a class that already struggles with mana is brutal. If he interrupts your mana burn you can now cast heals freely cause mana burn is shadow school and heals are holy.
---
You're right on them not having an extra offensive spell like horde priests do but they instead have stoneform that helps vs rogues a lot, don't forget that dwarf racial instantly removes the plague and alot of pvpers will play dwarf making plague not as useful as you would think. 
---
And lastly, having paladins on your side will put less pressure on you as a healer (priest is the only real healer on horde side so you have to focus on just healing in BGs) on alliance side you're more free to go for dispels, mana burns and other shenanigans so it might be more fun if you're into that.

The wand is important for priests to sustain and stay within the 5 second rule and get that spirit tap bonus.

You can still put on FF for chilling in IF and being out and about in the world, then when youre in raid put on rime

I'm not going to bother sifting through old vanilla footage trying to find Armor Shatter on the bosses, since it's clear that is the only evidence which is good enough for you. That's fine, we'll just have to wait until early September to see if it stacks or not.   
---
I think the fact that blizzard handpicked the 4 other weapons with the exact same tooltip but simply "forgot" to take out this one other weapon with the same chance on hit description but different spell ID, and also this weapon coincidentally being of a different nature than the other 4 (since it requires considerable gold and a master axesmith and is not a dungeon drop), is very suspect. Clearly Rivenspike, Bashguuder, etc. were utilized by **some** guilds for them to warrant the nerf, yet somehow no one mentioned Annihilator being unnerfed after 1.8 until the end of vanilla? That seems conclusive enough for me but sure, it's not HARD evidence.  
---
Either way, even if Annihilator were not to stack with SA + FF + CoR, bosses still end up having less armor than on private servers, so the game doesn't really end up being any less melee dominated than before. The only hope for a meta change and for you anti-private server people to feel vindicated is if it's proven that the 3 basic armor debuffs somehow don't stack or that there is a certain portion of boss (+3 lvl mobs) armor being unmitigated. We'll be able to tell as soon as they announce when the final stress test happens.
