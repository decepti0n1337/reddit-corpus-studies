Isn’t it better to make normal silk bandages since they take less cloth? I remember one being better just forgot which one.

You'll just zerg Derek if we dont defend frostwolf. Also i dont care about the honor or the rep. I want to summon lokhalar
---
Cash to gold? IDK your server's prices are absolutely fucked. Undeath is 1-2g and Water is 10-12g on Whitemane.
---
2 Hours is basically the standard time for pugs on my server, pugs who don't do gearchecks and don't kick anyone so we often have people with either blue bis or a mix of blues and greens.
---

---
The only potions required are fire and restorative potions but even then it isn't checked because there tend to be no problems.
---
It's hard to say where exactly it's going wrong without logs but I'm guessing inexperienced raidleading is also a big factor on top of your raidmembers not being in bisgear. In Vanilla we'd usually assign people on the spot, in these pugs everything is done before we've even started as you can see here : https://i.imgur.com/YdE3c4u.png
---
Loot distribution is also something which can take a lot of time if it isn't handled well, it can easily up your clearing time by 30min.
---
To get a picture of how these pugs go on my server : https://www.twitch.tv/rovefogle/video/524519876
---
Honestly don't care too much. I'd be annoyed if somebody rolled on something offspec that I needed but in terms of raiding I don't really mind.
---
I save my DKP, cop my decay loss per week and I get loot. If I'm doing my job well and having a good time I know I'll get loot eventually.
---
Yeah we on a solo mov best dps is to just remove it asap as the first hit is instant but 2 or more mobs you can just keep spinning until they die if the procs stay poppin.
---
OK I'll post. Give me a few minutes. I'll DM you
---
It does sound like that, doesn't it?
---
I agree. Bots ruin(ed) old school runescape, it’ll happen to classic wow too. It’s inevitable unless blizz cracks down on it.
---
Take everything and leave nothing to the alliance! / 95% Winrate in AV Horde!
---
I don't think that many people would quit over bots. But the amount of bots they'd have to ban? All those bots pay a sub fee
---
There's no economy in retail for bots to destroy. Gold is beyond plentiful and there's nothing to even buy with it anymore.
---
Shit ally pugs aren’t even stopping at Galv lately.  By the time Bal is dead they’re pulling Drek
---
19 minutes for sleeping, then 1 minute to eat while you shit.
---
If your guild doesn't require consumables, doesn't and doesn't farm pre raid BIS gear, they probably are not analyzing the strategies that are being used or asking player to use talent specs that are beneficial to the raid. I would guess you have serpent sting taking up debuff slots, etc. There are probably a dozen things that each individual player could do to speed your raids up, but these problems usually start at the top. If you aren't willing to ask for a leadership role and implement change yourself, then I would recommend looking for a new guild.
---
The same problem has existed in RuneScape for over a decade and it’s an incredibly difficult problem to fix. 
---
Even with bot detection systems and sweeping bans people figure out how to make more sophisticated bots that can bypass the detection process.
---
If I were in that group, I would not have had a problem with letting that dude have his BiS. I simply don’t care enough about economics in a game to feel otherwise. This thread has made it perfectly clear that many people do care about the economics to a very large degree. We will need to be more aware of that going forward.
---
Actually a lot of bots have jump in their commands now to look more fluid.
---
When did this happen? Even for BoEs I think you should greed if you can't / won't use it. If no one in the group has any use for it then you can decide to all roll need.
---
All it takes is a handful of mages.
---
As a warrior who leveled from 49-60 in BRD  arena only, I feel like I can tell you a lot about farming arena. 
---
For starters if you are not level 60 knock out two birds with one stone and just level there exclusively by doing arena and the loop around where lord roccor is. 
---
The Ogre and Gorosh are classified as “rare spawns” in arena meaning you won’t see them very often. The good news is their drop chance for the highly sought items are very high but you have to have two rolls go your way. The first is getting the boss and the second is getting the item. If you see gorosh, the chances of you seeing the savage gladiator is almost as high as all of the other items. I have seen two drops and countless banthok sashes. 
---
Good luck on your farm
---
You are not 100% incorrect but not 100% correct either. 
---
You nailed the part of me coming back every few years and not liking it and quitting again. You were off on the part of me not trying mythic dungeons/raids. Last time i played was legion - and i never said mythic raiding was easy, its much more complicated than anything pre-cata in terms of mechanics. 
---
In terms of retail feeling dead. Sorry i stand by this. I played in legion quite a bit (about 7 months) and outside of raids,  the guild chat was dead constantly. Trying to start conversation was met by crickets. Guild chat pretty much became a private lfg channel. I left my 1st guild that was like this thinking it was just the guild. If it was, than i guess the luck followed me because i tried 2 more and both were identical in that aspect. Crafting is nearly worthless from what i could tell - so farming was a thing of the past it seems. Pretty much you pay to play a single player game with MMO features. 
---
Disclaimer - I will accept the possibility that my server "cluster" or w/e was just bad - but the game feels like a shell of itself with harder bosses. thats it.
---
how has it backfired? nochanges has been demanded to counter the forum/reddit whiners and so far its highly successful.
---
nochanges is just a stupid excuse to not act if they dont feel like it. 
---
game is still fun for me and a lot of stuff is blown out of proportion, yet a lot of minor changes could really improve the game while having less negative effects than certain changes which already broke \#nochanges.
---
Well by your definition it is doable. It is also going to be a lot worse than if you were properly specced / geared for the task.
---
Find a dedicated group if it's something you're seriously going for. It takes a loooooooooong time.
---
I unno dude, in Legion they almost destroyed a lot of players wills with being able to fly in-game before it was even allowed.  All that clipping through the air was broken as fuck.
---
Okay (=
---
You can't use the same rules for BoPs as BoEs... When a BoE drops, gold just dropped for the party and it's to be split fairly. When a BoP drops, it goes to the class/spec that can use it best because in most cases just rolling it off and vendoring is a waste. The Need button just communicates a player declaring t1 priority and Greed t2, there's nothing sacred about "Roll need if you can equip." 
---
That's how the MMO community has been doing it for the last 15 years...
---
Because im stating a fact. How many threads do you see about alliance losing av? Then how many threads are you seeing about how long the horde queue time is? If you can answer those questions youll easily reach the conclusion that alliance complain more. Now obvipusly horde bring up the queue times in posts, but there isnt a constant new thread about it like how Alliance loses AV is.  
---
  
---
You on the other hand just lose your shit since im not praising the alliance posters here and start claiming im horde, like bro, if im alliance or horde how does that change what my post said? Instead of trying to attack me why not try refuting my post? And the reason is that you cant. Even now in this reply youre still going on about how horde made it hell for alliance and *somehow* I wronged you personally. We probably arent even on the same realm. Like i could ve horde on heartseeker where alliance were camping org, or i could be playing on a pve realm and you still are acting as if im the guy who hurt you lol
---
Could you pm me how to find one? Or maybe someone from EU cross realm would like me as a player? I have 100% mount, mostly epics, and know my stuff. Hunter, btw.
---
but crossrealm is just a shitty fix for mistakes they made pre-release and during release. hell, some servers are even dead with crossrealm and it is awful for realm identity.
---
That statement caused me great pain when I fell on the floor laughing.
---
I can't comment on the integrity of PS's management, but if i was running a free PS before classic and some gold selling company came by and said "Hey, wanna make a deal? allow some of our bots to farm and get part of our profits" then i would prolly be inclined to negotiate - i would even be underhanded enough to specifically target bots from other services to ensure a larger profit margin and competitive edge for my collaborators.
---
Business is business, the gold in your pocket doesn't care where it came from or how it ended up there.
---
------
---
Ofc Blizzard isnt using this method, it would simply be too risky and the profit a gold selling company makes isnt enough to really make the integrity loss worth it.
---
However, i don't think it's financially worthwhile for them to go massively out of their way to apprehend these gold sellers, just ban their accounts with automated systems and collect money from new sub fees.
---
How does he need a recipe to maje gokd with morw than I need prebis gear?
---
Everyone here refers to the current expansion as "retail" no one considers classic retail even though yes it is now that it's no longer on private servers. But he is clearly not talking about classic and means the latest expansion (bfa???)
---
Somebody should make a bot that kills these other bots
---
I get that it’s easier with a much smaller population, but I find it hilarious that it was harder to bot on most private vanilla servers than it is on classic.
---
I am subbed to retail to play classic. I do not own BFA because i was not impressed with legion (although i will give it some credit - it was better than anything else i had tried of retail past wrath). Yes i play a 15 year old version of the game. Wonder why the oldest versions of the game have the biggest pserver presence? Why is no one trying to monopolize on Mists? Or WoD? Why is there only 1 legion server? Stand on your pedestal all you want - but at the end of the day this was vastly more popular than current retail or the last 5 expansions.
---
Like the age old saying says 8 peoples christmas depression is 1 persons christmas miracle.
---
I’m seeing a lot of mixed comments about down ranking. I played DPS in vanilla and didn’t heal much till the end of BC/start of WotLK and I struggled with understanding when and how to down rank. In my opinion It’s a good rule of thumb to down rank to avoid overheating, and once you have stacked +healing like others said.
---
it's crazy to me that wanting to win isn't really a reasonable goal.
---
I don't turtle or defend out of spite or because I think it's better honor, I literally just wanna win the game. 
---
the other say I won most AV matches right and got like 600 hks for not even 100k honor. was a good day tho cause I won way more than I lost
---
Frostards are the new huntards
---
So what’s the sub numbers on classic? A game that you deem successful?
---
Yeah man. my monitor is pretty dark and i need max brightness to see anything in caves or less lighted buildings.
---
Who are you?
---
Do DM E jump runs. Just get a shaman healer and split the profits. Much easier than leveling an alt
---
Mage.
---
The disastrous launch issues and last minute server creation despite plenty of data to suggest a huge influx of players proves that Blizzard will endure a shitstorm as long as it doesn't affect their sub numbers. Classic WoW being a hit is about keeping costs and the team as small as possible, while generating huge profit. Destroying bots really gets them nothing outside good faith with the playerbase, which they likely believe they don't really need.
---
This jump have nothing to do with class. it was regular character jump, not blink jump or smtg like that.
---
Yup
---
Now you are just wrong and stubborn about it. All your arguments have been thoroughly dismantled and you are offering no rebuttal.
---
A lot of ppl won't say anything and still think you're a dick. Which is completely stupid. If someone asks you a yes or no question and you say nothing then how are they supposed to act when timer hits zero?
---
Bots are just unavoidable at this point, even on vanilla private servers people bot like crazy
---
They should, instead of banning the bots, push them all to their own server. It could be a botbuilding server and they'll all try to outperform eachother
---
So you're saying if a pre bis boe dropped and everyone rolled on it you would be perfectly ok with losing the item, even if it happened over and over?
---
Difference between blizzard and jagex (osrs) is Jagex is willing to admit how much the bots ruin the economy, where blizzard will continue to take in the $15 per bot.
---
I tried 1 more time but failed. IDK about rooftops, next time i get there i will try to get to rooftop.

Question. In vanilla, I remember Ally were the ones who turtled with the bridge, and Horde camp was full of holes. How is it the opposite in Classic? 
---
Disclaimer- I haven't actually played Classic. This sub is my only Classic info source.
---
Literally not affected in any way by bots because nothing in the game is exclusively controlled or produced by bots.
---
The reality is if you have a normal life you were never going to rank anyways. Even if they removed every botter there would still be hundreds of neets on each server pushing your cap to ridiculous levels.

If you haven't seen any bots lately, you probably need to get your nose out of AV or your weekly MC/Ony and go take a look at how shitty it is right now. Fishing prices have been ruined for months, ever since they got the multi-box bots to the coasts of Feralas and Azshara. Then it was black lotus, and various other herbs location getting spammed nonstop. Elemental water patches, wreckage pools with some Chinese hunter moving back and forth all day. Now its golden pearls, elemental essences, whelp pets -- literally anything worth more than a few gold on random mob drops. It's super disheartening. I report them every time I kill them, break their armor, kill their pets -- the works, but nothing changes. I just see the levels on the bots go up steadily each day, knowing that they're making 10x as much money off the item I'm trying to farm myself... not even to sell, but to use. LOOKING AT YOU, GODDAMN GOLDEN PEARL -- HORSESHIT
---
The hell are you talking about? English please.
---
There is an easy fix, Blizzard is just too lazy and greedy to do it.   Every single action you perform is recorded somewhere, if a player performs repetitive actions for over an hour, a flag should be raised and a GM should goto that location (invisible) and watch the player for signs they are a bot.     Spotting a bot is incredibly easy, after they loot if they do an instant snap turn to the next mob and target it, they are a bot, this is something all bots have in common.   
---
It would take a little code and 1 GM per server to maintain.    Greed and laziness, pure and simple.

Quick question! I am an arms warrior and a healer kept letting me die in BRD (I was 60) while arms specced. I’d never had a problem before with the usual charge, SS, WW to sword and board combo, but I was dieting repeatedly. Is this usual, or did I just have a ‘meh’ healer. Pretty much in full plate.
---
Yup which just makes basically every counter measure worthless.
---
Very well said and I totally agree. People should not be rolling need on offspec loot if someone in the party needs it for their main spec...it’s just common sense, not to mention common courtesy.
---
Bullshit, name ONE popular vanilla private server that was not riddled with bots

To be honest throwing a fit when you don't get your way is something that only tanks are getting away with, and it is triggering me a bit. If you don't want the repaircosts play a dps warrior or healer druid or whatever but they don't wanna do that because no group will take them. You know warriors are like the best class to be in classic there are only 3 downsides. 1) pvp vs mages. 2) they can't farm very well. 3) they lvl slowly,wich only has an impact until 60. On the other side: 1) best dpsclass, 2) best tank class. 3) gods in pvp. 4) instadungeon queus if they take up a shield. In high demand for both tanking and dps. 
---
Let's look at paladins. Cons: 1) can't farm. 2) very basic at tanking. 3) very basic at dps. 4) okay lvling Pros: 1) great heals. 2) discount on mounts. 
---
Hunters: pro: 1) great lvling. 2) great farming. 3) easy to gear. Cons: 1) not in demand at all in endgame. 2) ammo and the bagslot.
---
Just call blizzard. They’ll ask you some questions about when you created your account. That’s what I did long ago after I got hacked. They just mail your shit back to you
---
&gt; And I don't think it's unreasonable to think that if there was an easy fix, Blizzard would have used it. It's just not that easy. 
---
Calling BS on this, Blizzard makes millions every months from all the subs and one of the biggest reasons for moving to the newer client was so it would prevent all these bots. Never had I ever seen so many bots in Vanilla WoW. Interactive GM's are long gone, and this presents a major problem for the game. The human element of whack-a-mole is gone, and it seems Blizzard lacks the basic tools on the back-end for detecting bot actions. I mean, how hard it is to detect bots that move in literally the same exact pattern for hours? Or creating a check system for interactive GM's that raise flags on players that perform certain actions? VPN checks? I don't get it. For a company this large, that makes this much money, this should be a very easy situation to deal with.
---
Never even heard about TGA, can most picture applications actually open those?
---
No.
---
Now if you accuse me a third time of saying something I didn’t say, you probably have reading issues.
---
Sounds like ur healer was bad, its not hard to heal an arms tank especially if they pop a shield on for multi mobs after ss. Make sure u pop into dstance after ww too.
---
Keep reporting bots and I add them on my friends list but they kept farming
---
Leveling fishing more than anything tempts me towards using a bot
---
Not gonna lie, afk AV is going to be an even bigger problem now.
---
As a warrior main I think this is bullshit. People act like repairs for tanks are sky high when they are really not. If my gear is completely busted it might be 20g which in the grand scheme of things isn’t much at all. You make gold and get items while running a dungeon. If you’re not cool with a plate wearer’s repair bill don’t play one.
---
Hey buddy quick question. What weapons should i be using? Staff or axe and shield? I am an orc so that’s why I think maybe axe and shield and enhancement do have points for shield stats already. Lmk what u think
---
Groups are always looking for mages for AOE and sheep, rogues are fun as fuck and very engaging since they have a combo point system and are very mobile. Obv subjective but imo rogues are way more fun than mage.
---
thanks Phoosball. Yeah there's a couple of us that want to progress and take it seriously. Like we aren't 6 hour a day gamers but we are all in full pre-bis. hopefully it gets better because I really don't want to be left behind while half the server is decked out in bwl gear.

Epic mount is one of the least important things to worry about when reaching 60. You dont really need it for anything. You will get to dungeons 2 minutes faster. And its probably nice to have in BGs, but thats about it.

It would take way longer to level but you could legit just farm mobs with good mat drops all the way to 60. Up to you to determine which ones to farm.

if a 300+ gold BoE drops and you roll greed - thats on you. Most players immediately roll need due to the price of it. Still cant feel bad for them.

No but it should be easy enough to test in a lowlevel dungeon with some random blue item.
---
I appreciate it Munkin! Glad to hear from real RLers
---
Around the time when the content cycle is MC, Onyxia, BWL and ZG the majority of guilds will have more potential raids per week than they can realistically clear though. That's two ZGs, two Onyxias, one BWL and one MC each week. And you never stop farming any of the classic raids so when AQ comes out there's also two AQ20s each week in addition to AQ40.
---
You'll be more than busy is what I'm saying.
---
Unless you want to heal, play mage
---
Selling out to China was relevant to selling out to botters. If you don't like that, don't support Blizzard.
---
If you are sub 2 hours you are probably going to clear BWL the first week, depending on how it's tuned at least.  It's honestly not that difficult, and sub 2hr MC with 33 means you probably have at least 10k raid dps, which means every boss outside of vael/chrom/nef die in a minute or less.
---
isn't 1 mage with winter's chill enough? why 2?
---
Why would anyone with a brain stem bother watching such a moron. Liking his content is a clear indication you're either a child or a moron. Sorry i'm insulting your hero.
---
Alliance starts off the BG as 20~ish people due to the premaders dodging queue, then we get wiped in middle/galv and are forced into a turtle which we lose.
---
While the super advanced horde strat is: Don't cap SHGY (yes, thats it)
---
Make premades bannable, it's a one faction only exploit, and it ruins bg's for everyone not in it on both sides.
---
I don’t understand why someone would do this.  Wouldn’t it just feel so incredibly hollow to rank up when you didn’t even play?  
---
At a base level WoW is not as fun as other games objectively.  All the “fun” comes from grinding out accomplishments and the feeling of reward you get when you finally level up, or get that next piece of gear/mount or w/e.  
---
I feel like logging in to see how much honor my boy grinded today would take away the entire point of the game.
---
So when running strat live melee and healers should need on orbs while casters greed? Because technically they are only used for +Healing enchants, crusader and priest vestments. Anything other than that should be seen as greedy since they are only needing to line their pockets?

This. Especially the last point. I sometimes hang in a warrior discord where daily someone comes and asks if we can help their tanks improve. There are often issues with gear, often issues with specs, often with (lack of) consumables...  
---
But without fail, every single time, people just aren't using enough abilities in those cases. Not even talking about optimal rotations just number of abilities.
---
A bad tank will click on abilities and take a couple of seconds to decide what to use when sometimes they could literally be rolling tier face over 3 abilities and perform better.  
---
Bad dps often just need to click one or two abilities as fast as possible and their performance improves drastically. 
---
A bad healer will click a possible heal target and then mouse over their heals trying to decide which to use and then just end up using a random one. Their performance could be improved by just binding healing touch rank 6 or something to their left click and then just keep clicking low hp people.
---
Before anything you gotta just get comfortable managing a certain ability-output without it requiring much of your attention. And people need to dedicate their attention: I've played with one "girlfriend of the gm" healer before. She wasn't great but she also wasn't horrible - when she was there. But she was nearly always distracted by her dog, social media, her phone, whatever. This made her the single worst healer I have ever played with. And that includes the guy who kept letting me die because he was sup er stoned. At least that guy only wiped a group and not repeatedly a 25man raid and had the decency to say sorry.
---
Any good paladins to recommend?
---
No
---
All high lvl zones are still a gank fest on my server.
---
I've said this once and I'll say it again; when Blizzard implemented classic, I genuinely believe they had no intention of providing game master support. Despite this being anecdotal, I have experienced incidents of individuals exploiting or botting and game masters either ignoring tickets and closing them without responding and another count of threatening to ban me because their excuse was "I was opening multiple tickets for the same issue" despite the ticket fell under the same ticket ID.  
---
But it's these experiences that lead me to these conclusions, on top of the fact that half of the server population I am on are bots, some I know I've seen around for two months with no consequences.  
---
I want to believe that Blizzard is trying to figure out bot patterns and behavior and is planning a massive ban wave in the future, but something in my gut tells me otherwise.
---
You're right, we shouldn't bring up a situation where the company prioritized making money over its community. It has nothing to do with the thought that a company wouldn't spend money or time on banning characters to improve the company, aka, prioritize money over the community
---
I’m going to try and say this without sounding like a huge cry baby, here it goes. 
---
The alliance is so bad at PvP it literally ruins my enjoyment of the game. BGs are by far my favorite aspect of the game. When I first heard about classic coming back, it was the first thing I thought about. Alliance is so bad that it can only be described with numbers. In the past week and a half, (I started tracking it Monday before last), I have won 3 out of 48 AV games. I know there is no way to fix it, blizzard can’t make people improve their game play. But it’s crazy to me how insanely bad alliance is. It’s not even fun anymore. I don’t have the time to level another 60 on horde side. So basically I’m just stuck losing over and over and sucking the fun out of the game completely.

Believe me: it is true, some people just aren't using their buttons fast enough. If they just kept using the same ability every 1.5 seconds they'd improve.

---
Last night was 3 straight matches against premade alliance in a row. When it's a 30 min+ queue between 5 minute games it's starting to look like a long, mostly inactive, grind to exalted.
---
Pretty sure people afk in AV bet whatever honor you got
---
Stadia is absolute trash.
---
yes ur guild sukcs
---
My server seems healthy. I would guess most others are the same
---
Just make sure to get your 15 HK or else it's all for not.
---
I also have a warrior and a rogue. I like being in close for the kill.
---
Is more like 50% 50% AFK
---
But that would be a \#change from 1.12.1
---
 Yeah, I did that with felcloth once.
---
Ended up with about 60 felcloth in my bags, ah was instantly back to full and the proce dropped even further.  
---
Fml, neer again.
---
Stay off the drugs mate
---
Yeah this will work out.
---
I just go and then hold then ransom for an orb half way through
---
Private severs were crazy strict though with bots. Since they didn't get money from bots they paid closer attention.
---
New bug, but you get honor.
---
I don't see why they would need to go to retail 
---
just res what you want and fill your group and if you can't fill your group GG 
---
we res one orb and all patterns on our strat live runs and have no issue filling
---
Wtf are you trying to say lmao. Not anywhere in there did they say people would be punished. And I’ve already said I’d rather see blizzard fix this than to let it go untouched. 
---
Blizzard patches it. No one gets banned and we all move on. That’s what I thought would happen from the beginning.
---
&gt;I started throwing in some dps while I heal and nobody has noticed.
---
Thanks for your hard work on making the guide and thanks for sharing it here. I'm sure some will find it helpful.
---
I thought they were holding back Don Julio's for a bit because they didn't want to add spell penetration yet?
---
Constructive
---
Just attach a sticky note with the word bam on it and wave your hand 🤷‍♂️
---
Warlocks are fine in raids, we hit very hard, that said they’re is always a big fight for gear. Fast levellers though as we have no downtime
---
Game is not dying, the initial hype has subsided so some flavor of the month players have left but game is still good. Some servers had trouble in early p2 but its mostly over now
---
The difference here is in private servers they didn't get money from bots and could checkout reports faster. I remember on lightshope I would report a bot and 30 minutes later they would get ported and banned.
---
This doesn't happen in the actual WoW
---
Which was well known but horde still decided to shoot themselves into foot and try their hardest to make PvP server playing alliance quit.
---
Probably shouldnt have done their darnest to get the other factions more pvp oriented players to quit.
---
But by the time the bots are banned the economy will already have suffered irrepairable damage by doing it this way. So doesn't really solve the issue IMO.
---
At this point I’m convinced they’re part of the game as filler players.
---
Let's all take a second to acknowledge a shadow priest being 2nd on the damage chart
---
Found the horde player.
---
Doing parses based off item level doesn't work all that well in classic, especially for casters due to how highroll greenies very often outperform raid loot in terms of damage output, meaning that a person that has full +frost damage greenies should outperform the guy in full T1 despite the massive ilvl difference in favor of the guy in full T1.
---
Most people who roll mages alts for money I know have over 1k before they hit 60. 
---
That’s just from leveling

**Guild Name:** Kingdom  
---
**Server:** Atiesh | Classic   
---
**Faction:** Alliance  
---
**GM:** Momotchi (Btag: Zylra#1152)  
---
**Officers:** Bossmage (Btag: bossmage#11451); Thejolly (Btag: Shrimby#1158); Eskal
---
**Guild Focus:** Maintaining a relaxed yet serious and competitive raiding environment. Raid Times: Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday at 10 PM - 1 AM server time Discord: discord.gg/EKg2uyE Progression: Fresh. Our members, however, have cleared all current content.
---
**Current Class Needs:**  
---
Warrior - Open  
---
Rogue - Open  
---
Druid - \[Restoration\] Low, \[Feral\] Low, \[Balance\] Closed  
---
Priest - \[Holy\] Open, \[Shadow\] Closed, \[Discipline\] Low  
---
Mage - Open  
---
Warlock - Open  
---
Hunter - Open  
---
Paladin - \[Holy\] Open, \[Retribution\] Closed, \[Protection\] Closed
---
**Loot System:** A smart BiS free roll system. An item that is BiS for someone will be free rolled among others that share the condition. Tanks receive utmost gear priority, and hunters receive ranged priority. Leadership will mediate gear concerns and in cases of notable gear disparity will help nudge a piece or two to a less fortunate raider as needed. Recipes and patterns are free rolled but must be learned on the spot upon distribution. This system ensures speed, fairness, and eliminates unnecessary human bias.
---
**Notes:** Kingdom is a brand new guild. As of typing this, “this week” brand new, conceived after our members departed from a larger guild due to conflicting values. Though we are in the startup phase, our members are geared, experienced, and serious about progression as content is relevant. We wish to foster a fair, transparent, and helpful environment where constructive criticism is both sought out and encouraged. As such, new raiders as well are encouraged to give us a try, and for PvPers, our roster may frequently be found in BGs during downtime. Looking to jump right back into Onyxia and Molten Core as soon as able. Do not hesitate to send us a message to an in-game, via BattleTag or via Discord. We look forward to hearing from you.
---
The people enjoying the game are too busy having a blast to complain on the forums.
---
When people say "PUG" they often don't mean "40 random dudes from trade chat who have never played with each other". They might mean "a competent and prepared core with vetted additions from trade chat". 
---
If you just LFMed trade chat for 39 other people I'd say your chances of killing Rag are pretty low.
---
I've got the ST trinket sitting in my bank, I'll keep it in my bag. As for +hit, I'm a leatherworker with nearly enough skill to make the devilsaur gear (and some friends who help me kill devilsaurs :) ) so I'll definitely add them to my gear. I'll check out those rings. But that's a good tip about aoe trinkets, thank you
---
Maybe it's a sign to hang up the gloves, step outside into the real world, and start slaying real problems.
---
An account permaban would be a worthless countermeasure?
---
Say sike right now
---
Glad to hear atleast some bugs get fixed.
---
Welcome to 2019 gaming lol
---
problem is ques are 25 minutes and if you are on a realm that doesn't bracket stack, guess what you have to do in between ques?
---
my hearth is set to kargath so if i que in org i can ghetto hearth and kill alli in searing gorge/burning steppes. sometimes i'll que in alterac mountains and go to wpl/epl. when premades make the games only last 10 minutes, i spend more time ganking alliance unfairly in world pvp then i do in a bg.
---
i absolutely hate it. when you're in que for a bg there should be a debuff where you can't gain any honor.
---
I just hit 60 today and working on that honor grind again. I heard there is a premade discord for NA Alliance. Anyone know how to get into it?
---
Bosses weren't necessarily the biggest difference compared to my guild runs and whatnot, mostly just was that there was almost no downtime. 3 seconds after the last mob in 1 pack is dead the next pack is pulled, and if you're low on mana you just drink a bit into the next fight more or less.
---
don't open with taunt. you waste the CD and achieve nothing. I usually don't even bother charging any more. it's doesn't generate rage like warriors.
---
just walk up, body pull, demo roar. maul, then spam swipe (don't spam swipe without primal rage and omen of clarity).
---
you might also consider pulling with moonfire from a ways back. if you can tag 2 or 3 mobs, you'll have a huge threat lead.
---
Far from a hardcore player and I’m still enjoying the game massively. Would recommend  10/10
---
Just the same way I don't see how maximizing honor gain is "fun", sure, you can buy fancy snanzy gear with it, which I too enjoy, but once you've gotten the gear then what then? Is this game only about getting the best of the best gear? If that's so, what are you gonna do when you've completely maxed out, what fun is there left for you to enjoy?
---
Summoning the ice lord is an experience that for many is something new and refreshing and also just cool, imagine winning a hard fought AV by getting that final ice lord to push your team into theirs, I can see how that is fun.
---
Because they just make more of them...
---
Try over 450 runs for your SGC. I literally saw over 50 caster belts.
---
Hi, /u/UndercoverNorman

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/eg3u9z/i_have_not_seen_a_single_bot_in_my_entire_time/). 
---
8.3? This is about classic
---
I do. Constantly.
---
I wasn't prioritising one over the other really. I may be swiping too much because I always seem to have rage issues
---
Do they usually reply when they dont speak your language and thus cant understand what you said?
---
I think sometime between the time when I stopped being able to use Thorium Point and the time when I stopped being able to use Morgan’s Vigil on raid nights, the last of my sympathy for Horde getting long queues dried up. Shame.
---
yeah, a huge PvE mistake that blizz never recreated.
---
silithius will barely have more action during AQ than it does now.... the pityfull attempt at bringing WPvP back with the 'scenario' going on is utterly meaningless
---
They’re welcome to make their own groups too
---
I personally hate the idea of a banwave.  They should just ban immediately, not when they've had months to go unchecked.  That being said, I do actually know of one guy who got manually banned for pvp botting, which feels like a rarity.
---
After the first month of Classic the community got insanely toxic.  It’s so much worse than it was.  /ignore just flying out for literally everything.  People rushing to trade of lookingforgroup to blacklist people.  It’s so weird.   
---
I was questing on an alt in Redridge and I went AFK for legit 45 seconds (after saying brb), and came back to the dude spamming /1 and /4 with “don’t group with ____ he will go AFK and make you complete the whole quest for him.”   I tried to whisper the dude and was instantly ignored.  It’s so weird.
---
Back in actual vanilla I would trade horrible insults with people for hours in whisper before we both ended up laughing and going to bed.  Now you need the wrong VC green and end up on 4 ignore lists.
---
No if you roll a 2 you can get a 1 or a 2 if you get a 1 you lose if you get a 2 the next person rolls a 2
---
Do they actually have honor bots? I could hardly believe my eyes when i saw  rank 10 mage decked in full pvp gear with not one but TWO freezing bands.
---
Rams &gt; pony
---
But unlike IRL... we can kill them in WoW
---
MUHAHA
---
That's not what nochanges means.
---
Agree with all of that, but dont forget mages can sell ports and water/food too!
---
Can the bots vanish properly if they resist though?
---
Recent expansions have WAY more code and mechanics than the older versions (and less development time by reverse engineers). That's why they are almost empty, because they are full of bugs and things that doesn't work, ruining the experience. When I started playing in a wrath server in 2010 we had just Naxx and some wings of Ulduar working, with just the first boss of ICC available because of bugs. Your analogies are biased towards the game you like the most, but it does not hold true to the whole fan base.
---
i was spamming that i am buying mature blue dragon sinew and some dude told me that i shouldnt buy it ,but instead grind av rep and buy harpy hide quiver
---
is that true since it costs 600g on my server ?
---
i am not really expirienced,will i ever be needing extra 2 slots for arrows as hunter ?
---
I do tend to be stingy with aoe taunt for exactly that reason haha, I'll have to start using it more. As for talents, I am hybrid feral, though I have 5/5 in that talent. I am missing 2/2 primal fury though, so I don't always get the extra rage. When I hit 60 I'll probably drop feline swiftness which I took for levelling, and fill primal fury
---
I think the reasoning behind having an alt for farming is he doesnt have to rely on others
---
There is literally nothing wrong with 1 orb res for tank. 
---
1.	Tanks can’t farm gold for shit
---
2.	strat live barely has any loot for tanks 
---
3.	crusader is a bitch to get 
---
4.	because tank is doing all the heavy lifting in the group; live pulls are atrocious from start to scarlet and every beginning pack has 7 mobs
---
5.	it takes forever and “takes forever tanking” makes you get carpal tunnel while “takes forever dps” means you’re just looking at reddit while you yawn that you’re still aoeing and only at Timmy
---
That's the nature of these things. I'm more in the side of removing the AV# completely
---
Have fun living in your cold dark world of percentages and spreadsheets.
---
Seems you’ve forgotten the RPG in MMORPG.
---
Go play MOBA games if you want to be a slave to maximum efficiency.
---
That is the next likely banwave, they will probably merge both retail and classic banwaves because it is still all one account, if they don't do a banwave for both then it won't be until close to the next phase of classic that they do one.
---
You are wrong.  The ranks are kind of misleading.  It's better to look at it in terms of Rank Points, rather than Rank.   Rank 6 really means you are between 20,000 and 24,999 rank points.  It's proportional.   The OP is like 98% through rank 6, or 6.98.   0.98*5000 + 20,000 = 24,900.
---
id insta leave a guild that doesnt down rag before sons first try at this point. We downed rag first raid week. Most of us had 50% prebis, but 5 of the raid team were 58 and in greens and random blues. Only consumes we used were gfpp prepot and a second one if the first one wore off. We did that for 4 weeks before we stopped using consumes completely.   
---
After 7 weeks MC should have been on farm for 6 weeks imo. its so easy.
---
My favorite is “LFM UBRS (MH res) need key)
---
Yah which is definitely much easier lol
---
Except tons of pvp happened there, it even had open world pvp objectives.
---
It would probably make horde and alliance mostly stall and then with an hour passing they would just Zerg
---
Dudududududickkkkk
---
Any decent hunter will feign death immediately after multi shot. If they don't, then that aggro is on them and they can enjoy staring at the ground while getting an ever increasing repair bill.
---
Long Q's = Horde doing WPVP between BGs.
---
I mean, to be fair, Blizzard did try with the Warden a while ago, but it was so invasive that it was basically spyware.
---
Imgur should really be avoided. They abandoned the "Simple no BS image hosting site" ideal a long time ago and at this point are only interested as making as much money as possible off the good will they earned back when they cared about user experience.
---
Its still better than not looking at logs at all dont you think?
---
And understanding how logs work?
---
And performing better against your own parses?
---
And start at zero each time.
---
Will anticipate your level 60 ding post with masterbated breath
---
“We”
---
Are you that vampire Ironman?
---
That's definitely not how you do it. You'd lose one and a half seconds of swing that way.
---
too hardcore for me man. its bis. but not THAT bis imo
---
Xiaxia has been betting in badlands on Kromkrush for weeks and I've reported the dude at least 10 times while leveling my mining
---
Yeah, they ban in waves, but how many months can we wait for even the first ban wave without the economy being perma fucked up since all the servers are fresh with so many people on them?
---
I totally did this the first couple times I did each dungeon. Definitely let’s you focus on the dungeon experience 
---
But after that? Nope. Blind farming is torture. Hello Atlasloot...
---
it's not because it is a natural consequence and the best solution that it is good
---
why are you blaming us for playing the game blizzard made? and why aren't you capable of fighting back?
---
I’m pretty sure other people might have said this already but your raid setup is beyond bad.
---
5 Druid healers is 100% wasted as the HoT’s dont stack, my guild brings 2 druids to raids, one healing and one feral
---
You should replace 3 Druid’s with 3 dps and just that “tiny” change will help you a lot 
---
You guys also have way more tanks then you need, bring 1 main tank and 3 fury warriors who can offtank when needed and dps on bosses.
---
It's an age old problem in pretty much every game with a grind or resource that needs to be farmed. The only way you fix shit like this is  at the design table before the game comes out not 15 years after it came out.
---
There is 6% more horde than alliance at 60 roughly, thats 41000 characters. On paper that might seem roughly equal but in terms of queues? Far from.
---
In what way is this at all helpful information?
---
What profession do I wan? Mage! Lvling Hunter Inc, like in vanilla
---
Yeah like wtf there’s some awful scripts I see running around and I wonder how it’s possible they aren’t banned
---
It's super easy cause this game is super easy. Don't overthink it or let others complicate it for you.
---
Just make sure you're prioritizing the tank and you'll  be fine. Maybe toss a renew on a lock here or there, but dps shouldn't be taking much damage - if they are, that's on them.
---
Some people have commented this already but I wanted to just stress it again to make it clear: Get used from the start to use mouseover macros for your heals and dispel. You will never become a truly good healer without them because you always have to take that extra step of targetting the players and can't target the enemies instead to see via target of target who is about to take damage.
---
\+Well from what I read I can guess that you play horde. Let me tell you how it looks from an alliance point of view. 
---
Horde is turtelling every single game to a point where the only way to overcome this is by joining a premade group. I understand that you have long queue times and want to spend as much time as possible in a battleground but this kind of gameplay is making a lot of alliance players quit pvp and thus increasing your queue times.
---
It really sucks that this version of AV is in the game and I don't think we will see any change to the behavior of horde and alliance. I already stopped pushing since I don't want to queue 12h a day only to be abled to compete against AFK botters...
---
On pvp servers? Horde dominate just about every server with numbers.
---
I had a 5min target dummy parse and got 0 crusader procs on double daggers.
---
That's pretty much 50% of the time, the issue is the long games run well into the 30+ minutes which completely fucks the efficiency. And no, 3400 is from a long game, a short game is less.
---
they also just made gold so easy to come by that there is virtually no profit to be made by botting for gold anymore.
---
horde defintiely would
---
Thank. Fucking. God.
---
It was intended as an answer to "pugs do this faster?!", though I suppose that might have been a rhetorical question.
---
The only thing the abusers did was add players into a group, you can't fault them for that just because Blizzard didn't have the foresight to make that reset the queue.
---
#AD
---
A true Classic!
---
Looking at parses can be useful for sure, I mostly just wanted to note that ilvl isn't necessarily the best indicator of who has better gear in many cases.
---
you don't need all those dedicated tanks, see who's got better dps gear and get them to respec fury, make sure all the warriors are grouped with your limited 2 shamans for windfury. ask people to bring consumables. last week i did 740dps on golemagg, not "pre bis", still using 3 pieces of green gear. buffs help a lot. windfury is insane.
---
Ah I see, thanks!
---
THIS.
---
p1/2: RED IS DEAD LOL gank gank gank
---
bg: NOOO YOU CANT JUST COORDINATE AGAINST US! BLIZZARD HELP MEEEEEE
---
I mean here is the thing about gear.  For many classes much of your bis gear for the current phase comes from 5 mans and craftables.  For mages and warlocks a good chunk of it is simply green items with "of frozen wrath" or "of shadow wrath."  For fury warriors is basically all from 5 mans except for onslaught girdle, band of accuria, and weapons.  For healers, much of it is also straight out of 5 mans. 
---
If you hover over the ilevel number for each individual member of our raid, you can actually see what they are wearing, and many of them are simply decked out in 5 man blues.  Our top parsing mage is still literally wearing 4 green "of frozen wrath."
---
I would encourage your members to start researching their gear needs and start farming BRD/LBRS/UBRS/Strat/Scholo/DM for the pieces they need.
---
If it's your first time playing, focus on fun over min-maxing as a general opinion.  Don't force yourself to do chores that aren't fun if you aren't sure the end reward will be worth it.  As for your particular question, if you're interested in raiding, you would probably prioritizing running certain dungeons (Mara, ST, BRD) that give you pre-raid BiS to gear up for raiding over farming gold for your epic mount.  In general, the best way to save for your epic mount is to not spend money on unnecessary things.  As usual, gathering professions are good sources of money, crafting professions are generally money sinks that, if they do pay off, take a while to do so with a large up-front cost.  Not worth it if you want your epic mount.  As a warrior, depending on your server, you can charge for tanking services sometimes by reserving an orb from Strat live - a controversial choice, but warriors don't have a lot of the best ways to make money.  This is as opposed to ZF AoE farming as a mage or solo jump or mara runs as a lock/hunter/spriest.  You can team up with someone else to do duo jump runs, but I don't know what your g/hr would be in a duo.
---
Why does everyone blame horde for "bad" wpvp? Both sides do it. I've played both H and A, it's the same thing for both factions.
---
when you cant handle the Wpvp on your PVP Server i think you might choose the wrong server to beginn with.. the horde has nothing to do with alliance stop playing because they get stomp.. Horde is just playing the game and now alliance is crying because they cant compete :/
---
Eye of the storm wasn't released until tbc. It's a mix between ab and wsg.
---
I said the same thing a few days and got downvoted to shit. You're not gonna get a message through. 
---
Moreover, Blizzard isn't fixing a damn thing. You really think 16 hour per day AV grind to get rank 10 is ok? You really think if Blizzard gave a fuck they wouldn't have fixed it?
---
This is the end. Nochanges + phases signed the death warrant, it was a matter of time.
---
They banned honorbuddy, they'll take care of this
---
Salutes from the old school runescape community
---
 Enjoying it, Bigglesworth has been a great US server for grouping (DPS), wPvP, and generally pleasant people put in the world. I didn’t play Vanilla, and am still really enjoying Classic a month or so in. 
---
On US - if you want to roll Alliance, pick a server carefully. With the recent paid transfers some of the aggregated population data is misleading. See: Stalagg.
---
So.. you are saying there wasnt a server with Legion running for free during legion that was only a patch or 2 behind retail the entire time with minimal bugs? Interesting. I seem to remember it because i was outspoken about the server because of my mind set on why play a pserver (that being that its not available anymore by legal means). 
---
Yes, i do have biases based on my favorite iterations of the game. . . but vanilla is 3rd on my list of favorite versions so i dont think its as bad as you want to think.
---
the domain just expired, sorry
---
It's funny because one of the reasons they used the BFA client was for anti-cheat reasons.
---
A/V supposed to have 60% mounts. It's for 50-60!!!!!
---
Worth can be defined as more than just what you can sell it for. It happens all the time (I'm sure you've even done it), especially with these types of arguments. If the person meant it as just how much it can be sold for, then it should have been specified more clearly, and also addressed it since it will always come up. Even the OP talked about it.
---
Mobs pockets reset every ~8 minutes. Mob density and the length of the circuit in BRD is such that it allows you to constantly move and only have 30-45 seconds of downtime excluding bad luck with failed picks.
---
I don't think they ever cared about players buying gold.  It keeps some of the more casual players with disposable income active on their subs.  Like if Joe Shmoe plays 4-8 hours a week but is bummed he can't get his epic mount in the forseeable future, so he pays a gold selling website to get it, now he'll continue to play/sub and feel a lil caught up this way.
---
I mean for god sake they literally sell gold on retail.  I think the only thing they regretted was not selling it sooner to internalize both ends of the profit... Keep a casual sub happy who has money to spend and get the money from the shortcut that they used to call a problem.
---
Soothsaying for dummies. Its a book in tanaris, look it up. Hopefully i caught you before you releveled.
---
Why?  Because they'll be getting less over all.  If the game is a half an hour, there is no way the bonus for owning the mines is going to beat an entire game worth of tower burns and marshal kills.
---
This reasoning never really sits right with me. You can find updated bots literally the next day after a ban wave.
---
That is how the new client deals with pickpocketing.
---
No i dont. Did you just assume that?
---
Well, that question you covered thoroughly while managing to make a slightly braggy post, or so it might come across. It is probably helpful to point out that there almost certainly was a knowledgeable and decent 'core' in that pug leading things, and that people most probably were both better geared and overall more experienced than OPs crew. Just so he realizes that not every pug clears it in 90 min - or even clears the entire thing. I'm making those assumptions based on some of the few pugs I have been in or guildies who missed our raid days have described, forgive me if I'm too liberal in making them.
---
I mean that's how horde gets ahead when they have long q's.  That's how you beat the people afk in town.  I haven't really seen horde complain about it.  If q's were shorter they wouldn't.
---
Oh it's unfair huh? Like how horde have better town locations or zeppelins being better than boats, or having a much better leveling experience. Having WC, RFD, RFC, and SM all in horde owned areas...
---
Oh and let's not even talk about PvP racials...
---
Yeah it's almost like horde is used to soo many advantages that when you have one disadvantage you can't handle it.
---
I've been in tech since 06' and every company I've worked for spends as little on security and as little on backups as possible. JUST enough to get by. This is no different.
---
Reread your comment.
---
You saying alliance has the best healers?
---
I have theres several in azshara, just grinding away, if you kill them they just run back. There's a couple at the satyrs. 
---
Blizzard just needs to hire a few GMs.
---
How much do we pay a month for classic? 30 guys to check hotspots and bot reports would cost maybe 100 grand a month.
---
That's peanuts, but Blizzard is greedy.
---
I'm tired of the appologetics. They are a business after a money happy to let their product go to shit to save money.
---
I think it'll depend on when that end happens. As it is, there are some rather large YouTube "content creators" out there for many years that do nothing but react to stuff and they're going as strong as ever as far as I can tell.
---
You make a good point, one I did not realize. Hmm, so parsing is a good standard to judge players, not simply DPS alone. Thank you for sharing, it looks like we have a lot of work to do
---
1.  This doesn't matter, because like I said, if you get a bunch of people together, you're going to get the same discord-style premade anyway.  Just how many new games do you think are created every second?  The most I've seen is around 200 for the number of the game.  Someone can do the math on this, but I'm pretty sure that queuing 80 people at once you're going to get a good number of those in the same game.  All you need is a dozen or so to chat about how awesome their premade strat is and the rest are going to follow anyway.
---
2.  I don't think this really solves anything.  If a premade can do a game in 10 minutes, taking five more to re-queue isn't going to hurt.
---
3.  This is a completely moot point.  Discord premades don't care what server you are from.
---
4.  Forcing people into a different BG is just going to move the problem to a different BG.  Instead of one premade, you'll have four WSG premades all doing the same thing.
---
Horde is holding some serious L's.
---
Get bodybagged by long queues that just lead to curb stompings by our Alliance Premades.....
---
Try to escape by abusing WSG queue; and have Blizzard patch it.
---
Tough break bois.
---
Didn't we not foresee this happening anyway? It would be ignorant to think this was never going to happen. I highly doubt it will be fixed swiftly.
---
WoW tokens kneecapped bots in retail.
---
I mean yeah it is because without it wow would have never existed to begin with.  So there’s that.
---
Hell, if they paid me $15-20 an hour, I'd work that job. Being a GM sounds like a grand old time, and banning cheaters is a huge plus.
---
The person I inspected was afk in the cave, hence this post.
---
Can easily be programmed to vanish if it is put in combat.
---
if you clear in 90 mins without abusing buffs and consumables yes it is hardcore
---
Could be a case of confirmation bias, how you remember the bad bots but the good ones are unremarkable.
---
The fire to earth xmute should be buyable by a lvl. 35 alt. Just need a main to clear to the gnome in theory. I’ve not tried it
---
Do you work for Blizzard? You seem to have so much insight into stuff you have no idea about.
---
Keep staying away from this awful sub.
---
Literally as easy as playing whack-a-mole. You don't need to know the dungeons, just follow the group.
---
What's this farming method you speak of?
---
You should read the other comments here on the subject because that is only the 70 days for the value of the recipe itself. It doesn’t include the lost profit from not buying the recipe and instead using the other xmutes
---
Imagine being illiterate
---
RFC = Stockades; both are in a main city.
---
WC = Deadmines; both are in the 2nd zone for the faction
---
RFK/D = BFD; Both are in the 2nd zone for the faction
---
SM = Gnomer; Both are in the main zone for the faction, shortly outside of the capital city.
---
1) Access can be given to class leaders to manage invites for their classes.
---
2) Characters can be put into groups for specific roles and they can be subscribed via this.
---
Fuck them! And fuck this pro multiboxer propaganda
---
Dexter bot?
---
I do not know any that had only "minimal bugs". They always have lots of things completely broken. And now you say it's not available anymore by legal means, even though your entire argument was that blizzard does not care about pservers of recent expansions because they have little impact compared to older iterations of the game. You've got to be trolling.
---
Think it was the hotfix rolling out
---
8 Mins but otherwise accurate.
---
I so fucking agree dude it's insane that anyone can defend a person walking around with a 10 man that can 1 shot anyone within range. Shit I saw a fucking 30 man box the other day.
---
Yeah wrong ring, my bad. I know healer itemization not melee. :P
---
&gt; “spare a few copper for repairs”
---
Man leave Topper McNabb out of this, he will pay you for that hamburger!
---
Yeah I just so happened to do 16 runs tonight and I say again, fuck off lol
---
more like "have an actual point instead of mindlessly raging against someone you don't actually care about anyways for internet points"   
---
but I know abstaining from karma-whoring is a foreign concept to some redditors
---
Seek help.
---
It's pretty damn cheap if you can find another lock to summon the steed for you, like 300g. I see people fairly frequently advertising it for free on my server. If you can't then yeah the AV mount actually isn't that much more and is better for PvP.
---
seems to me you're a smart and a kind dude who wants to improve and do better. i'd just speak to them in a kind manner and leave for better alternatives
---
That's meaning less. When people check logs they go for spell usage, cooldown uptime, gear choices.
---
I used bots for YEARS, Vanilla through Legion. I got caught botting Azerite and was swept up in a major 2 year banwave. 
---
After that I don’t want to lose my account. I just wanted to say 2 things: bots are not well made, the good ones got sued out. Currently there is a bot named after a sea-creature, it has nothing on Honorbuddy / WoWGlider which were shut down 5 and 10 days ago.
---
The other thing I wanted to say is I tried using a few bots to level on private servers and after 10+ attempts got banned before 30 everytime. 
---
Bots are easy to detect; Blizzard is fucking lazy.
---
https://youtu.be/aUomVzVcNR0
---
Bora weren’t this relevant that close and hold cost way more cuz it was new. These builds have existed 15 years so yeah there’s more people making em and using compared to year 1
---
Didn't know they're already in the game!
---
What how
---
Good start I suppose, does nothing to address people that benefitted from it though.
---
Why not random captchas with set auto log response times?
---
Thats not a problem because they arent botting on their main.
---
I mean, yeah. The game has been damn near unplayable for a month. Give us a month to get over our salt.
---
I would say send 12 Defenders, Mages, Hunters, Rogues, And some healers. Rest 28 can push, IF The 12 guys can't hold Iceblood Towers, Frostwolf GY just trinket to Base and help recap them both. By then allies are stuck in Base, split on The map.
---
Not being able to fly anywhere or enter an instance has nothing to do with wpvp.
---
There literally wasnt enough Alliance on my server to meet the horde on any kind of fight.
---
Horde has everything to do with the Alliance getting stomped and idiots like you who dont understand the pvp system you´re competing in at is how we got to this situation.
---
And it will only get worse but you´re too stupid to understand whats going on.
---
"You thought you wanted vanilla and the systems that practically required botting, but you didn't"
---
Lmao no
---
There is 1 billion turtlehordes. Sometimes rushing drek in 20 minutes gets me 200 HKs
---
See, idk about this because the idea of an 'offspec' is not as defined in vanilla. You cannot blame a person for leveling in the only viable leveling spec, but you also can't blame a person for rolling on loot for the only spec they will feasibly get to raid in. As a warrior, I will gladly tank dungeons but raid tank spots are in high supply and low demand (only 2 tanks per 40 people), so I will be rolling on dps gear in that dungeon since I'm basically only going to be dpsing end-game. It's just the way vanilla works to a degree. You play your class not your spec.
---
how is this a bad thing for the horde?  they get to wait 20 minutes between queues and remain competitive in honor rankings, meanwhile we have to queue constantly and go through extra hoops to remain competitive.  
---
i guess if you consider doing 3x as many boring ass PVE zergs a good thing.
---
The questions you are asking can be only answered sufficiently by scouring data yourself from server discords and making lvl 1 alts to check AH and population in capital. Every server is different and so are the players.
---
Just stop
---
That is possible. Purchased a mount on my rank 3 character, traded with a friend and then he traded wity my rank 1 character.
---
You can send back some melee frontline and keep some on offense, keep locks on offense and druids for offensive caps. GG
---
Dec 26 Patch Notes "After 15 years of tolerating multi boxers, we've decided to release a patch to break their functionality..."
---
This is a consequence of how brainless AV is, resulting in a fair share of noobs occupying higher brackets. Whereas before they couldnt farm much honor at all.
---
There is literally no difference as long as you get the needed amount of sleep. Wasting my life.. wtf
---
This guy gets it
---
Throw in Multi-boxers and you have my support.
---
sounds like you should have coordinated against the horde in wpvp.  BGs have been out for a while now, you need to let it go.
---
i’d say try tab-maul and only swipe if you have extra rage. see if it helps. sometimes i will do a swipe to get a little bit of aggro on the other targets as a temporary thing, but you can’t really hold them that way for a long time. i guess i just hit the non elites (eg dogs in brd) with swipes, for the most part. i’ll eventually lose them but usually they die pretty quickly so it’s a decent compromise.
---
Back to AV meta! Great PvE battleground! Glad I can just go in with my PvE spec into a PvP battleground! and botters can happily bot 24/7 pushing bracket 1 because AV doesn’t require any skill! Thanks blizzard!
---
Yep you're right spending all night alone in a room infront of a screen while majority of society around you is asleep is no different to being a functional member of society.
---
Maybe I'm confused, but what is to stop everyone from having half a dozen lv1 alts that play a single game of WSG to make several times more honor slots?
---
Yeah. We lost about a quarter of our guild to P2. Can't quest, can't pvp, can't get into dungeons unless you wanna corpse hop for an hour.
---
Ideally the game would be balanced, but if not, at least let each faction have their turn as the advantaged one.
---
&gt;Hardly anybody wants bots in their game.
---
I actually don't mind bots in MMOs where resources aren't shared. They only drive material pricing down, there's no real detriment to the player when the bots aren't competing with players.
---
Obviously, that's not how Classic WoW is but it's like that on FF14, retail WoW, GW2, etc.
---
It still exists in the form of Horde ganking questers and farmers while in queue. World pvp died for Alliance, tho.
---
Laziness will always breed innovation in automation. So no, it wont exactly solve anything. It may drive bots to a more crude style...but it wont stop people from developing these things. Not only that...but streaming is still very intensive for network consumption and causing me to pay tons more for a “level playing field” is rather stupid. At least at this point in time. 
---
Regardless of how beneficial it might seem to some, i do not like it. Especially when you say “no addons”.
---
But opinions aside. Stadia is absolute dogshit.
---
&gt;Two AI could play an entire game of chess against each other in literally 1 or 2 seconds.
---
Not if you expect them to play at a very high level. Chess is really complicated.
---
It's a bad assumption that only Rich Thorium is worth farming, Mithril and Iron and their stone sell for just as much or more than thorium and dense depending on how badly people are undercutting and ruining the market.
---
I becer said it was an automated syatem, like LoL's bullshit leaver buster that punishes you for nothing. Usually Blizzard will send a GM to see what the player is doing, talk to them, and determine what to do after that. When someone receives multiple reports, the GM would be alerted. That's what I was going for.
---
Just ignore this person. If they are praising stadia they dont really know that much on the subject lol
---
Well said. This post felt like bait judging from the last few sentences but you wrote an actually well thought response. (Even though it was copied)
---
Good job.
---
I'd rather they ban the griefers, scammers, etc. Sure ban the bots too but the next time someone terrain abuses for hours just perm ban them.
---
Truth is it's cheaper to buy in bulk, and ban in bulk. They won't expend the resources on it more often because they're an international corporation with shareholders to suck off
---
If it works in dota 2 (i think it's called open AI or something)... it tries different things until it finds the best possible courses of action, then there's no reason it wouldn't work in WoW. Yes it's freaky stuff.
---
I had multiple stalled out matches where the alliance were a clear premade and took their time sliding that girthy monster right up our collective asses, good god i am glad i hit exalted. I love AV but fuck that shit.
---
Earthfury got absolutely fucked. Huge ally imblance so all during P2 us horde got camped 24/7, could not do a single quest only dungeon leveling. Now BG's come out and thanks to cross realm it is a 25 minute queue into a 30 man premade and 8 minute loss. 
---
Blizz simply doesn't give a shit.
---
The point, my friend, is that the guy I replied to was judging the 1v1 strength of warriors based on a dueling tournament where the warriors are decked out in absurdly irregular amounts of gear while the shamans of the same tournament (to which he compared the class) have pretty unimpressive gear. If someone with little experience with vanilla was to read that, they might get the mistaken impression that warriors are actually great in 1v1 when it is in fact the very worst class in the entire game for that particular thing.
---
Yes because doing it at daytime makes all the difference. Omg you are right, it is so different:O:O
---
Nope they were afk. I was about to snowball them put of the portal but alliance won too fast
---
I hate you......
---
Also me..... 200+ runs later and I still don't have it.
---
&gt; except a handful of 50's leveling up scattered across the globe.
---
Yes, that's who they are ganking. 
---
Level 50+ zones are just as bad for Alliance now as when P2 was out.
---
The AV meta has forced people to use auto hot key profiles and afk to match the 20+ hour a day everyone else is doing. If WSG was actually what rankers played and pushed (like they did in vanilla cause AV was shit honor as it last forever and wasn’t this current dumb version) skill would matter and not just mindless being online in AV.
---
\&gt; I feel like it's awesome because I'm experiencing real progression raiding. 
---
This is the most important thing. Yes you're doing 'bad' compared to the majority of players who have done this before. Does it matter though?
---
In my guild we did some 20 man split MC raids, we did this specifically because we're jealous of what you have right now. The raid is a challenge and you need to figure out raid compositions and strats to make it work for your specific group of players.  The enjoyment is not in getting loot from the bosses, the enjoyment comes from achieving something that is difficult.  
---
If you're having a blast, keep doing what you're doing man and avoid looking up spoilers on the internet.
---
Note that AOE farming on a high pop server during peak hours, especially as the smaller faction, has a pretty low success rate.
---
Wsg begins at 10 for a starter
---
Machine learning pvp bots have existed on rs for some time
---
Because most just flat out don't care. No seriously....they have no idea what they are doing. They are just there to farm rep from what I've seen. You can literally have a raid leader tell everyone to go left and half the raid will go right. Tons of afkers and people just sitting around.
---
Fucking stressed.  I'm a class leader in a lootcouncil guild, and I'm starting to dread raid night.  I try to keep things as fair as possible, but it seems like every week someone is pissed at me about something; and it's usually the most geared players who complain.
---
AH bots are easy to fake out: just mail them like 200 blacksmithing hammers/mining picks. Their mailbox will get so full which floods their inventory after they cancel items and expect to get them back, which trips up the script.
---
Keep in mind blizzard will ban you for this for 3 days, but you can appeal it and tell them it's clearly a bot, and that you were doing them a favor.
---
What I find truly ironic is that when blizzard change the game they made, just like they did for retail, you’ll blame everyone else for “crying” about your actions instead of admitting that you did it to yourself.
---
I will never understand what people get by playing the game like this. Yes you statistically get more “stats” but you literally aren’t even playing the game. So what are you doing with your life if you play like this?
---
Kinda bothers me you're still friends with him... ppl can say they're sorry all they want, actions matter way more than words. And people often do not and will not learn if they don't feel any consequences.
---
I most certainly can actually... but you are right in that blizzard won’t do anything about it.
---
My guild used fixed-cost DKP with a class priority system (no druids taking Mana Igniting Cord from Mages / Locks)
---
There was a bit of drama around warrior weapons simple because we’ve seen 0 Deathbringers, 0 BREs, and 0 Spinals.  Also, no Vis’kags and only one Brutality Blade and Perdition’s.
---
Some melee are looting up rings and off pieces, and others are saving hard for the weapons.  It sucks, but RNG is RNG.  The people with DKP know they are next for the item of their choosing.
---
The game is pretty simple so it wouldn't be that hard.
---
A bot fighting a human is another story, eg: island expedition AI is terribly shitty even on the highest difficulty.
---
The near 100% WR of Alliance premades is proof enough that the Best Alliance strat is far right Galv LT RH Drek rush, but it's completely reliant on everyone having epic mounts and a brain, both of which are in short supply in AV pugs.
---
Your Endgame talents look exactly like the one i linked.
---
Healer would give you even more HKs
---
&gt;Theres nothing special about him being able to use it straight away. 
---
Yeah, there kinda is as it's what the entire loot system of "Need or Greed" is predicated on. The Alchemist needs this recipe to learn and use in his chosen profession. All non-alchemists would be looking to sell the recipe, hence the greed option.
---
This shit isn't rocket science.
---
They got in a lot of trouble in the EU for their first implementation of warden, as it read processes unrelated to WoW, and text scanned those processes for information.
---
If you had something like messenger open it'd read the titlebar to see if it matches the process list, which could be someone's email, etc. 
---
It was spyware, and the EU has anti spyware laws.
---
We need people to stop crying
---
Speaking of these orbs, is it standard for tanks to reserve them on other servers? I try to avoid these res groups but people get super passionate about it.
---
Alliance on heartseeker here  - questing in the world is still terrible. I was killed 6+ times yesterday in searing gorge by the same horde priest that kept lapping around. 
---
I have no sympathy for horde complaints anymore. At this point they deserve everything they have to deal with plus more.
---
Oh, cool that they closed the sieve that was the Horde city.
---
Great now av is going to be even better
---
sure it is. 2 runs is 35g\~ depends on how many blues you get. turn all cloth into bandages to vendor, and vendor everything else. its not a bad farm for some quick extra gold once in a  while
---
Hard to ban China
---
XD don't give away our lock scoreboard perching secrets 🤣 that field of strife pass through when shitrats run left and horde right it's an all you can eat dipping dots buffet
---
As a druid im using a roguetimer with neatplates, i see the ticks on my bar, target bar and healthbar 😂 dont wanna miss the powershifting
---
That will be the bot to get banned lol.
---
because they have 20 min+ queues, which is why this will work, at least make them defend even harder.
---
Catbox moe is pretty good.
---
or they disabled whispers (they wont see them). And not everyone responds to (every) whisper.
---
Blizzard is just going to turn layers back on and send bot reported characters to that layer. It won't really fix anything, but casual players won't see bots as much anymore so they think blizzard actually fixed the problem.
---
Man... casual guilds on your server must be good.
---
Yeah it seems necessary maybe I just need to set it up to where its less distracting.
---
Bot bans tend to happen in waves, so my guess would be when he next wave happens your guy's bonered.
---
just curious how much do you think blizz been making from classic? a month? a year from release? how any millions of players? I'm actually serious
---
if the fight takes logner they will also do more mistakes
---
making the fight shorter is always the best solution
---
Im not making it rocket science. When something is of equal value for all parties, its not magically needed more by one of them. Its just basic economics. Even children can understand how money works. 
---
Id even argue that most ppl would spend the gold from a valuable boe on something they need more than whatever rare as fck boe happened to drop. Like even the alchemist would be better served to sell the flask recipe to buy some gear or an epic mount as a fresh 60.
---
you think the earth is flat too? damn dude, you are wierd. fyi they alrdy did 1 ban wave
---
u dont get it
---
Seeing as this is a pay service, it stands blizz should take some sort of action. Some Pservers had better bot control.
---
Gnomer is faster to get to for horde than ally, and i dont know a single person that would prefer gnomer, arguably the worst dungeon in the game over the greatest leveling dungeon that you Can do for 14 lvls
---
Im just gushing over his chadness
---
&gt;I'm tired of the appologetics. They are a business after a money happy to let their product go to shit to save money.
---
What did you expect after the Hong Kong thing? Please stop enabling the Chinese bootlicking garbage that is Blizzard. Unsub.
---
Help me understand what you are asking.
---
That's why I always bring along a different, patsy recipe to learn instead.
---
TRUEEEE
---
yeah thats a big yikes from me
---
Oh, the 2-3 “balanced servers” ?
---
There was talk that it more than tripled subscriber count. They make a ton more from retail players through micro transactions and expansions, and I imagine half of players left classic ish, so a very rough guess is may be 1.5 million. So maybe 20-25 million a month from classic would be my ball park.
---
Only AV complaints right now
---
6ish healers, tbh. Maybe a couple more.
---
You guys have like zero dps so it's taking forever to kill trash.
---
4 tanks is fine, but you realistically only need 2 prot specced, full tank-geared up guys, and the other 2 spots can just be a dps warrior with a bootleg set of tank gear or a bear druid.
---
English is hard
---
I'll echo what other people have said: there's a lot of good pointers here on this thread, but if your guild is happy then no reason to change things up.
---
Blizzard doesn't do shit to bots. Friends of mine have been using bots for the last 10 years to grind for them in Wow on the same account and never get caught.
---
Blizzard cheat detection fucking sucks, to them a cheater is just another person paying for a sub, banning them means less revenue.
---
Have you read any of the other comments in this thread which explains why you’re wrong? Do all mages have a reserve on freezing band? All warriors Edgemasters? Just because you can immediately use it doesn’t mean you have more of a right to it than others. Gold is of the same value to everyone.
---
What potions will be used in BWL?
---
~~$11~~  
---
$15
---
Botting is a way of life in China, Blizzard will never stop it.
---
Hey you're fighting the good fight I have so much respect for alliance who tough it out and a good alliance player is typically better than a good horde because y'all get used to carrying your teamates as well as being outnumbered/disadvantaged. I hope things get better I bet a part of it was annoying ass whiners like asmongold choosing alliance flooding servers with 12 yo twitch watchers who never played a game that lasts longer than a fortnite match.
---
You laugh but that is what is done in many prison camps that run many of those gold selling websites.
---
Spoken like a bitter?
---
All this turtle hate for AV is crazy.
---
I dont think AV is meant to end in 5 minutes its kinda meant to be long battle...
---
Haha
---
Hmm good point. It'd be interesting to see what would happen if top pvp players went up against bots in arena. Maybe you're right and the bots would win eventually.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295273/classic-triples-wow-subscription-revenue-in-august
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/eb0ese/retail_classic_active_populations_december_2019/
---
this is the most I could find, the tripling subscribers is concrete that post is an estimate. I'd assume that hasnt held steady, because of people quitting from p2 or boredom or whatever, but it seems to be without question that classic has brought blizz a huge boost in revenue. if I had to guesstimate I'd say at minimum 3 million people globally that play just classic, assuming half of the EU and US players are classic purists and adding n another million from Eurasia. definitely worth spending 100,000 a month on IMO, thats at minimum 36 million extra per month
---
On my server they only log on during the night
---
I mean that's cool horde vs alliance role play but you'd rather real people pointlessly waste real life hours waiting in queue, for something that isn't really their fault (it's Blizzard's)... out of spite?
---
afking often seems opposite of bot behaviour, which would be constantly active
---
I mean, Blizzard's devs are now Chinese, so we have a language barrier and Blizzard isn't going to ban bots that mainly originates from their biggest honeypot.
---
Why can't we queue as a group in AV?
---
I didn't really play kronos 1 as I was on nostalrius, but they banned china as whole during kronos 2 and had to take servers down for 2 weeks because of retaliatory DDOS from chinese gold farms.  After that though the vast majority of gold selling spam stopped completely. 
---
I don't think anyone is trying to suggest that private servers had a magic force field that prevented any bot from exsisting on their servers, only that completely obvious bots were banned and on classic they just aren't.
---
So, I guess US West (which is where I play) battlegroups aren’t having this problem as bad as other groups?
---
Should this ruin my experience when picking up the game again?  I took a break shortly after the honor system was introduced mainly due to limited time. I am not familiar with bots in wow, are they mostly active in the lvl 60s as I have not seen them before yet, I think?
---
Well. The current (as of writing my comment) sub numbers for /r/ClassicWoW are 409,315
---
409,315 x $15 = $6,139,725‬/mo
---
Mind you that's ***just*** for classic. I don't have the numbers for Retail WoW, but that should give you an idea of what they can do in terms of staffing
---
Back to the mines we all go
---
thats fine DPS wise for clearing MC
---
That's not likely to be anywhere near what happens with wow botters. Sure, they have reaction times, but creating actually *good* AI is a massive endeavor. Huge teams of people come together in order to solve a single game, like Chess or Go. And a game like Warcraft is orders of magnitude more complex than a board game. Especially since Blizzard is actively going to fight whatever methods botters use to interact with the game.
---
Dont forget the bots :)
---
It's not about advantage or disadvantage, it's about one faction missing huge game feature. Huge because this is MMO and one side can't play with friends while other side can. I'd think the same if I was Ally.
---
Translation: I killed you by mistake. So sorry. I got ganked in return. Karma
---
I would like to chime in I recently did 6:39 without cloaking device
---
That ....seems invasive asf
---
I dont get that mindset its a game isnt a long epic battle better than base rushing?
---
Using moba terms its like the community agreed to baserace from different sides of the map and never meet and teamfight
---
And if some people try to play the moba properly there called out for "turtling" its crazy.
---
I'm disgusted to hear people copping temp bans for Botting. 
---
I have an account that copped a perma ban 12 years ago when one of the great ban hammers fell. An account that blizzard still won't give back. 
---
Same crime different time is an injustice. Banhammer needs to fall.
---
idk he posted logs above seems like they are putting out a decent amount of DPS and half the time PUGs don't even have 40 people in raid. Guild raid with 40 people, even if its got 13 healers, shouldn't have a problem mowing down Rag. if they switched 5 of those healers out for DPS they could prob nuke him before submege
---
This is why you run with a guild that does blind DKP, loot council is garbage.
---
it's because bots pay subs. subs= money. plain and simple why would they shut it down?
---
No significant change will happen as long as people need rank to get pvp rewards, rank is determined by relative standing, and players trying to rank feel "locked in" by the two problems of other players on their faction trying to rank up and decay preventing them from taking a long break. If you've already invested 100+ hours into your grind, queues are just a fact of life.
---
No reddit is as always overblowing the problem. I play on the highest pop EU server and havent seen a bot in weeks...and ive played like eight hrs a day for the past couple weeks lol
---
Well, the best strat for WINNING is to blitz relief hut, but we want honor too.
---
Go look up AlphaStar. The Google DeepMind project created a bot that plays Starcraft 2, and it has had limited runs on the ladder anonymously. It got around a 90% win rate against masters and grandmasters players. Serral, unarguably the best player alive, walked up to the demo area at Blizzcon and played a few games against it. I think he won one, might have lost them all. The AI has its APM hard capped and vision limited so it has to rely on making good decisions like a human. When you watch it play a lot of times you wouldn’t even know it isn’t human because it picks up the meta.
---
My thoughts as to why the ban waves happen so infrequently is more of a revenue strategy than an anti cheat strategy.  If someone gets away with using a bot for 5 months before a ban they are more likely to return and do the same thing “being more careful” the next time.  Whereas if someone is immediately squashed when their deceit is traced they are not likely to return at all.
---
I really feel this as someone who enjoys making gold fishing. I spend hours manually sitting there, casting and reeling in my line. Yet a bot can sit there for days on end catching so many fish that I get pushed out of the market.
---
Source that directly pertains to WoW Classic?
---
Nice
---
if they had bad pathing maybe on terrain but usually i just see them slowly rotate and run from mob to mob to mob in a mechanical fashion for optimal efficiency
---
You’ll be glad to know I’m also a rogue
---
Sit in your queue and rot, Horde.
---
You all spammed the dominant population faction and now you reap what you sow.
---
Fake bullshit stop upvoting this crap.
---
It's not a definitive answer, but showing that a player base of "just" 400k or so brings in literal millions each month serves to show that there's enough to budget for some GM's
---
I dealt with it with no problems, I chose to not be mad or salty due to ganks because it was my decision to roll on a PvP server - it's you who can't deal with it weeks after P2 is over. Also I haven't mentioned fairness and you missed the point of text you are replying to.
---
It seems you are just venting with premade cliché answers so I'll kindly remove myself from this convo before I see one more copy/pasted overused excuse from official WoW Classic forum trolls. Have a good day.
---
Actually according to all available data its 52% to 48%.
---
If it turns unbearable check out Fairbanks all joking aside I respect the hell out of our alliance they put up an excellent fight and even though the server is either 6040  or 6535 horde/alliance they always held at least 2 or 3 entire neutral key zones in phase 2 at least the second half of it (I'm usually in felwood which swapped hands almost every hour I would soulstone until alliance passed out of view come back farm a few water elementals die corsperun repeat) very impressive for the server numbers.
---
You lost me at AH bots.
---
Im pretty sure they did that in Apex Legends. They put all the bots and hackers into the same lobbies in a cheat to the death.
---
its better for blizz to ban them, either they paid upfront for a chunk of sub time they lose out on and have to make a new account, thus paying again, or they are playing month to month and will have to pay again at most expensive option. blizz gets more money, not like people running bots to sell mats dont know a ban is likely coming at any point . they have all be banned multiple times i imagine and keep coming back
---
that's disgusting
---
Not really, search for APES and look at what the holy paladins in that guild spends mana on. It's basically all about what you cast. but keep in mind that its a difference if you raid heal or heal one specific target.
---
Bots don't get bored though
---
High five! Same counts for me
---
Congrats on the lower dps due to aggro
---
Have fun pulling aggro off everything always
---
It's why everyone gives main tank it first and rogues 2nd :D
---
My older brother friend who played a lock in Vanilla and tbc, used an afk bot to honor farm. 
---
This is it. This is the same.
---
He didn't but I did
---
It still doesn't mean having 6% hit is not more than enough to not miss a GDC or that going for more hit would make you rage caped by most of the fight, and thus wasted. Only good argument I heard is regarding execute phase being longer, becoming more relevant, thus making hit more valuable, but people defending that were conjecturing hypotesis, not stating facts.
---
Weird to have cite as source, as the communty that guides most successful players still like 2 months ago thought that going for more than 6% hit was fine and now states anything more than 6% is nearby wasted and came to that conclusion only recently.
---
Rfk/D are two different instances which cover multiple level sets are in Horde Territory. BFD is one instance, and the Horde has a FP literally right next to it, giving them two in one zone, lol.
---
SM is a four wing leveling dungeon, good for half the game with a ton of good items. The other is all around shit 70% of alliance never even touch  - and Horde even gets a free teleport right into it.
---
Also: For deadmines Horde Get both WC and SFK. Both of which are better in terms of level range, quests and gear.
---
What if I told you our main tank already has it.
---
When I was leveling a warrior, a found a priest that always wanted to run stuff with me. She was by far the worst healer I've ever played with, and classic was her first MMO, but she was nice and fun to play with. Now she's raiding in MC and doing just fine, you learn as you go. Play a priest, we're the best!
---
Yeah there is really no reason to do that unless you are trying to big dick parse.  Just makes it harder for healers with the enrage on the adds :P
---
Lmao you're playing on one of the Alliance dominated servers and still crying about the Horde because one guy killed you a bunch yesterday? Man, the Alliance really are whiners
---
Hey, you 'called me out' a month ago that I made up the thing with 14v15 bot bgs in WoD. I randomly saw this vid today linked in the classicwow subreddit:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHeSHT2ZDnU
---
And here's even a vid from a streamer who's a lot more famous nowadays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QppsW_sRWs
---
Just in case you might be interested in that.
---
Jerk off to his ex girlfriend then watch asmon reacts videos so I can talk about how much I hate asmon on Reddit some more.
---
Logic wins again.
---
Actions are already being tracked, thats how they track you down when you buy gold and such things, thats how they restore an item, they ALREADY track inputs.    Nothing new is required, simply a flag for the same actions happening on repeat.
---
Salty (:
---
Source? (Other than your ass)
---
Yes. Them.
---
They were campin chilling and lights hope today on our server.
---
Everyone needs gold my dude and that's all an expensive BoE boils down to. I would give it to a guildie no questions asked but in a pug? Fuck no, I need 200g just as much as the alchemist needs the pattern.
---
Yes and if you read what I wrote I had an alt do my transmute while I kept doing transmute on my main
---
Times may have changed, but your average WoW player is as DRUNK and STUPID as ever!
---
*laughs in /r/2007scape*
---
Get back to the salt mines boys
---
Gnome for mages and dwarf for rogues..
---
Gnome all around
---
The only question which remains is this: Of what year?
---
we couldn't even survive for 1 submerge. we are half dead when he subs
---
Lol you aren't progressinf if you won't even get pre-BiS
---
Holy crap. I can only hope you're joking.
---
Good alliance premades? Please, don't spread such fantasies.
---
I don't know if you guys are just slightly above average. I only checked the mages because that's what I play and they have all their pre-raid BiS and a ton of raid BiS. You're clearing MC in less than 2hr easily, that's 80th percentile according to warcraftlogs.
---
People on this subreddit don't realise how average the average level is. OP's guild seems like a normal casual guild. They're probably not doing the right strats on some of the bosses which is making their lives much more complicated.
---
They do, but freezing bands aren't uncommon for hardcore AV runners.
---
Most mages can make 30-60g an hour easily with DM East or ZF zombie runs.
---
A bot would have greens on, and barely interact with the game.
---
I put a stack of Black lotus (6) up on the AH for the price of one on accident, and within a split second it was bought. I really don't understand how that's not against the TOS. You should have to physically click the button to purchase stuff...
---
So if you banned you get all your money back? 
---
And anyway botter definitely will make new account and new sub.
---
Hey OP I think the thing that will allow us to help us the most is if you gave us the strats you're using for every boss and telling us on which bosses do you usually wipe or have a hard time.
---
MC bosses can be a pain if not done right, and some things like Ragnaros tanking switches are not obvious at all.
---
Why not offtank 2nd?
---
This is just my opinion, but I really hate this mentality. 
---
I saw a guy in LFG for LBRS. I wanted to join him, but he didn't want me because we would be competing with gear. So I joined another group. Me and another guy both needed one gem to form the seal for UBRS. We both rolled need, I won it. I offered to do the dungeon again so he could get his gem. 
---
We did the entire dungeon twice, and did the quest after you have all the gems. So we both got the seal to UBRS. The entire time I'm doing all this, I see the original dude still typing in LFG. He can't find a group because he is so picky about who he will group up with. 
---
I saw another guy wanting to do jailbreak. I offered to help him with jailbreak, if we could also do the MC attunement for me. He refused. 3 hours later, I still see this guy in LFG.
---
I swear, if people would cast their net a little wider, everybody in the entire realm could find groups faster. And everybody would get loot faster.
---
I mean, you can kill them IRL. You just shouldn't.
---
lol I played horde and alliance too (my alliance were on a 30A/70H server and my horde were on a 70H/30A server) and horde were waaay bigger offenders in world pvp ganking during phase 2. 
---
Horde were playable atleast not so much for alliance.
---
I'm sure it leads to confusion at times.
---
Like now.
---
Our current off tank at the time was on his first raid with the guild.
---
i keep telling people it was alot easier and possible.. you cant even compare to nowasdays.... sure it took x amount of weeks to rank up, but getting like 50-200 k honor placed u easily in top 100 just casually playing some hours per evening (especially up to rank 11)
---
Rule #1 is dont trust druids or hunters with gear.
---
People really like this explanation because it sounds so clever but it doesn't hold up to actual inquisition.
---
First of all, just for exalted rep, losing in 8 minutes is VERY VERY ABYSMAL for horde. Lieutenants and Commanders stop giving rep at exalted, and Horde usually misses more than half of them in an 8 minute loss anyway. Most rep comes from quest hand-ins, and 2nd most rep comes from HKs (1 rep per HK. No diminishing returns on the rep.) Plus, 100 rep for 3x token hand-in when you win. So, given these facts, it should be pretty indisputable that the optimal strat for horde to gain rep is to force a lot of PvP, and then end the game (in a win) right about at the time when the meat and blood quest hand-ins are maxed out.
---
Turns out that's pretty close to what happens, on average. It also turns out that people have crunched the numbers on honor, and it's also better in games that go 20+ minutes or so. Games do go a bit longer than this often times, so it's not perfect, but it's better than the 8 minute games, which are really 28 minute games for Horde, which often have no HKs and often miss half the LTs and Commanders.
---
it was torture leveling my healer to 60. never again. did wish I got the staff before quitting. hard getting it isn't it?
---
least you got the bindings, been runnin every week and we havent seen one :S
---
Exactly, so gotta keep that in mind when calculating profit from recipe
---
Same with my guild lol, 0 legendaries.
---
Later gator
---
Hunter if you can tribute run (it's a skill and gear helps a lot)  or warlock to run Mara with your eyes shut for 40g/hr
---
I'm yet to see a aoe farm for mages above 40g/hr and aoe farming takes a lot more effort
---
It's worth noting that peofessions will out do all these numbers however going mining/herb as warlock and soloing DM E(needs gear and skill) will get damn close to that tribute run money on hunter.. around 80g/hr
---
yea tie up all the alliance in 30 minute turltes so horde has less alliance to fight, making your queues longer. 400IQ move there mr. zug
---
Bro dwarves tho they just thicc gnomes
---
2 nights ago in tanarsis on heartseeker there were around 35 horde.
---
1 was a player.  One.
---
The rest were bots farming leather.  It's getting out of hand.
---
No. I guess now I understand where your confusion comes from. There is a big difference between BoE and BoP items. When you are running a dungeon, you are specifically looking for these items. The only way you can receive these items is by running the dungeon. BoE epics and recipes are world drops that can come from basically any mob you or your party kills. There are a couple exceptions to this such as the flask recipes. If you start a dungeon group, or let your party members know ahead of time that you are specifically farming for this recipe and they agree, then 100% it goes to you. Otherwise, the gold is fair game. If you honestly think that BoE items and BoP items deserve the same treatment then more power to you. Just make sure you let your party members know your stance right as you join, and I wish you the best of luck.
---
It's not that bad...
---
I usually can, my schedule is just pretty hectic atm (working a lot and in uni full time) so I usually have the time to play it’s just not at the same time every week due to assignments etc. Considering the headache that PUG’s are I think I will just have to live with it and try and keep it as consistent as possible.
---
Pre raid bis is not good for aoe farming from what i learned you want pure stamina and intellect intellect gear.
---
Spellpower does almost nothing for aoe spells your better off with the gear that gives you the most mana and hp you can get.
---
Not trying to correct you im just saying what i heard.
---
Warrior already counters rogue, gnome gives you a minor chance against mage which is warrior's biggest counter so go gnome.
---
Use robe of the archmage when you're missing 625+ mana
---
Use mana gem when you're missing 1200+ mana
---
Use mana pot when you're missing 2250+ mana
---
Use Evocation when you're below ~20% mana and after the boss has used an ability that could interrupt your evocation (after bomb on baron geddon and after knock on ragnaros for example)
---
Hold up you don’t know that the arena ladders are full of rotation and interrupt bots?
---
They already trained AI to humiliate Dota 2 pros successfully. If someone did the same for wow, it would whoop ass as well. 
---
https://youtube.com/watch?v=tfb6aEUMC04
---
Yeah. Do that. You will lose the game with pugs.
---
A long time ago, I showed my friend who originally helped get me into wow how to reach the summit on top of IF. Over the years, whenever I anticipated taking a long break from the game, I would log out here, sort of as a resting place for my character. Then, one day, my friend passed suddenly in an accident. A few years later, I received a free trial of retail wow, and when I logged in, I was here. It was the first time I logged in since my friend's passing, and I was suddenly hit with a wave of nostalgia and sadness being reminded of him in this place. It was important to me that I come back here on Classic and pay tribute, because I know he would be here too enjoying the experience with me all over again if he was still here.
---
Anyone that’s good is in a premade. Only the shitters have to solo queue.
---
fuck, id give my left nut for some bindings
---
That's why i farmed Tyr's hand for about 3 weeks straight and got 6 bags to fill up my entire bank \^.\^
---
Can a single shaman put down 4 of the same totems at once?
---
More alliance *solo* queueing, please. It gets tiresome playing the fifth consecutive pug vs premade in a row.
---
your list is even better. thanks man. do you have one for bwl when it comes out?
---
/r/yourjokebutworse
---
Hard part will be getting an invite as a warrior, most groups are full over warriors.
---
..let them fight
---
Horde have queues: "Real live people are pointlessly wasting real life hours waiting in queue!"
---
Alliance unable to play camped at every contested zone, every flight master, home cities: "Looks like PVP happened on a PVP server!"
---
This is the big one, without mouse over flash heal you'll almost always get sniped in raids
---
game is amazing. on that honor grind right now. looking forward to bwl, 20 mans and arathi basin.
---
Gnome. Coming from a PVE human warrior hero.
---
There is no battlegroup, every NA server plays against every other NA server, every EU server against every other EU servers and so on
---
Horde is the overpopulated faction, this is a consequence of that
---
And who cares that alliance games are ruined? We have no queues, just do what little you can and get into the next one. Ironically, this is the same reason alliance will never adapt like the horde did, forcing us to premake AV
---
The fuck kind of person are you? Just dropping a friend over a mistake like that? You sound like a massive cunt.
---
When you have dozens of addons, it's pretty tedious to have to select the profile for each one. Copying is easier for me.
---
Just like the bots that were farming Scholazar Basin at the start of Wrath, who were still there toward the tail end of mop. I added like 3 of them to my friends list just to see if they'd been banned yet.
---
I can't imagine how many millions of gold and thousands of dollars they farmed there.
---
Healbot is a great addon.  Set up heal spells for left/middle/right mouse buttons and group/raid healing is simple.
---
I find Druid and Monk healing over time to be a good way of more even healing (esp. with poor ping or unreliable internet) but Priest, Paladin and Shaman are also very good.
---
Enjoy, now is as good a time as any.  :-)
---
&gt; i think you might choose the wrong server to beginn with..
---
A lot of first timers to WoW in general were told to roll PvP servers by people saying "If you don't roll PvP, you won't experience the real game." If they happened to roll alliance after being directed to 'roll pvp server or you wont experience the real game' P2 most likely made them quit.
---
You're just like me.. my magic cards need to be in color correct sleeves and all borders must be modern on the cards.. and the dice must match the color.. and the box.. jesus I'm insane.
---
Bro pug life is the way lol. Been raiding since week 4 and gotten one onslaught girdle about a month ago and literally not a single piece of true fury warr loot has dropped before then or since then for anyone. Then I do an MC pug and get brutality blade while another warr had to pug too and gets flameguard gauntlets AND wristguards of stability
---
Bad. Too addicting I can’t stop. Don’t play!
---
You people have repeated this lie for so long that the opposite is now true.
---
That's the essence of capitalism - prioritising profit above all else. Companies does the bare minimum to keep their public image positively intact. It's not about the consumers or doing good.
---
Literally every company operates this way, abiding laws and regulations if they exist, but as it stands, there's no regulation on how well companies need to address cheating.
---
Why not?  They're fun and you get tons of rep and decent honor.
---
All these assholes concerned about honor aren't getting past rank 10 anyway.  Enjoy the games for the game itself, or else you're going to burn out.
---
Story of fucking Classic man.
---
I say it whenever I do a run with people I've not played with. (I prefer to form groups and will be the lead if a few of us guildies get together)
---
With people you know and trust it can be all cool (dropped this exact recipe to my guildy a few hours ago because I'd already won it the other week) but otherwise everyone rolling need on something of perceived worth (some BoE epics are just fucking useless in general but the purple catches the eye) means you can't have arguments over people ninja-ing stuff. You can argue over who deserves it more, but not that someone is stealing something.
---
&gt; Horde is turtelling every single game to a point where the only way to overcome this is by joining a premade group
---
That's absolutely not what's happening, in my experience. A typical Alliance pug vs Horde pug game takes about 20 minutes for the Horde to win. No turtling, just a small effort to defend and a willingness for the game to not be a flat out zerg. They are still in the game for less time than they are in the queue for.
---
Pugs are good for experience, I would run with pugs untill you find a decent guild
---
Just got mine Saturday. Still waiting on that brutality blade! Congrats.
---
YoU tHiNk YoU dO bUt YoU dOnT
---
Although in that case you’ll need either a gold generator to afford the water, a farming spot that drops a lot of water, or a friendly mage to conjure water for you.
---
How is bots paying 15/month losing them money exactly?
---
If you include blood elves then maybe
---
I play both sides, and in alliance pugs, people don’t seem to get that horde has been que’d for 20 mins, and any attempt of horde to defend, there is always someone that complains about “turtling”.
---
To compound the issue, all the pug games I’ve played on alliance side refuse to adapt, and just rush on their right side, half get sniped, then the rush falls apart. I’m not surprised some players got fed up and started a premade If that’s the case.
---
I tip extra if it's of more benefit to me. E.G I was once in Tanaris and wanted to get to IF.
---
Domo is a bad boss to judge dps on because it depends a lot on how you do the fight. Link magmadar or golemagg and people will be able to tell if your players know at all what they're doing.
---
Thanks for the counseling lol
---
P.s this game fell off
---
Its more about what items you've got. With azure, toep, Ragna choker our mages would be happiest creatures on Earth.
---
&gt;It is simple vote up or down if you agree, put your thoughts and opinions to discuss in the comments below.
---
Is there a different way to do it?  Did we need this explanation?
---
Tbh I think just sheep at least that's all I know.
---
Agreed man. Its a different culture of wow and gaming in general now. Classic like everyone expected was never gonna happen. Ironically a lot of people even had trouble with a raid as simple as MC for the sole reason that it actually requires some patience. The biggest thing classic had going for it was wonderment which was only perpetuated by the temporaries, yet destroyed by the tryhards which are now largely the only ones left. 15 year old ganklords and unemployed single children who get their goodies off killing lowbies in groups have driven off all competition and are now jerking each other off while parroting “hur dur go to a pve server hur dur.” Its sad and hilarious at the same time but it is what it is.
---
And probably no one cares that you made a post about it. Youre one in thousands.
---
Why quit in the first place tho?
---
Besides, what is "starting at zero"? It costs $15 to get a bot up and running, and it pays for itself quickly once it starts farming. How long does it take a bot to level fishing?
---
You can turn the brightness of your monitor up, if you didn't know.
---
Why is everyone saying to stay arms? If you want to tank, Prot is *amazing*. I arms tanked until like 58 or 59 and it was fucking brutal. Not well geared or specced to tank, somehow trying to tank UBRS and scholo...not that much fun.
---
I’ve been speccing around all over the place, and I’ve enjoyed lots of different playstyles. Right now I’m the chad fury/prot build, and I honestly don’t like it as much as deep arms or prot. If you want a dps/tank hybrid, though, this is eventually the “best” build to go if you have to gear for it and want to push yourself.
---
Sounds like an alliance player to me.
---
Yawn. Fun fact 'bro' but being a toxic idiot isn't required to be good in this game. I'm in near full raid BiS and have been clearing MC with ease for months. 
---
But keep blaming me for the problems you create for yourself.
---
Holy fuck its Tryndamere from league. Big fan of yours and riot games man, grew up on league of legends as a kid and ive always wanted to work there haha.
---
Took me 14d on my hunter :(
---
I do not think so, I know trap 100 no cuz I've tried lol
---
You are very wise. I too experienced the toxic misery of losing AV after AV tonight. I honestly hate BGs to begin with, and I was only even there because I felt like I had to because the gear rewards are so good. After so much frustration, I decided that I don’t care how good the gear is anymore, I’m just not going to do it. It isn’t fun to me and it’s a waste of my time for that reason. I will help my guild raid once a week, and I think that will be the extent of my playing for the next few weeks. I just got my epic mount, so I don’t need to grind/farm anything anymore.
---
I would think so
---
Second Krimcrush
---
Made me lol! That's why I made this post I thought this was common knowledge but I found people didnt know so I'm here to help
---
We did. You can only out coordinate 3v1 so long. Now that having a huge number advantage diesnt exist it’s all Herd QQ.
---
Their solution shouldn't have been to let everyone keep the money.
---
you think you do, but you don't.
---
Getting PvP rewards.
---
Damn people, they ruined socialization!
---
I'm rarely having "fun" while playing classic but here I am still playing 8hrs+ a day because I hate myself.
---
Come to think about it, the only fun I've had in classic were lvling to 60, grinding my pre-bis and the first few MC's and Onys.
---
I'm not so sure about this.
---
Mobs are moving and you have to be somewhat careful about where you walk. There's also patrolling fire ele's that have a constant aoe that will hit and unstealth you if you aren't careful.
---
I feel like this kind of bot would be leagues more difficult to do.
---
At best you could pick a static area like the Arena, have the bot do a specific route through it, and then wait the 8 mins for the pockets to reset. It would be a bit slow, but if left running 24/7 it would add up. 
---
But even then, when pickpocket is resisted you'd have to immediately have it sprint in the opposite direction of the mobs and re-vanish, then have the bot get back on the "rail" it was on without running over a mob again.
---
People are assholes because they have a different concept of fun and don't like sitting in hour long games?
---
Awww cute, he got stuck in a loop.
---
True strike shoulders, the DM trinket... how much hit% are you going for as swords :O
---
Love the scenes when he’s dragging the tree. 🌲
---
No, it's just being within sight range of someone in your raid group when they get a HK, you will get credit for it.
---
A warrior can do 500+ dps on a fight golemagg or magmadar without a single BoP item. There are so many good items for warriors that are either crafted, quest drops, or world drops that you can pull these kind of numbers without getting a single piece of dungeon gear let alone raid gear.
---
It sounds like your warriors don't understand their rotation, aren't specced correctly, or just aren't putting any effort at all into their gear. Consumables also help but not so much that they're essential to do reasonable damage.
---
L2P.
---
takes 5 minutes tops. I always snowball them after Belinda to make sure they are afk.
---
I mean so what you are saying is the entertainment only comes when capitalism is involved.... thonking...
---
For someone who played the shit out of AV back in the day, and I'm leveling rep, we suck now. I've been in a 12 hour AV back in the day multiple times, but alliance single que sucks now. People are rushing, failing, and are hoping the druids will save us. There are more parts to AV, summon the Stormpike Ram Riders, they fucking win AV.
---
you get stuck in a loop whenever you try to fly to a contested zone lmfao
---
Grats
---
Slinging insults is not an ad-hominem unless it's used as a (faulty) foundation of an argument.
---
Roll PvE. I’m on Grobb and nobody I know is happy they rolled here instead of a regular RP server. People get...weird when it comes to PvP. Your odds of being corpse camped are twice as high as a non-RP PvP server.
---
thanks!
---
Just make sure you supplement vitamin D and go easy on the adderall.
---
Classic warlock mindset.
---
I win about half my games. Around half the time it's a quick 15-25 minute win. Alliance usually win within 15 minutes if they win.
---
Welcome to osrs
---
I did link golemag.
---
Sure, that makes sense.
---
\&gt; I want to see no BS in here tonight
---
Literally as he's saying this, he keyboard turns.
---
It’ll reduce your general attractiveness to the majority of women but it’ll help you find one okay with you playing WoW
---
Really, how much do they make pr. viewer?
---
Good lord now it's just sad. We're done talking.
---
You’re not 10 hours away hahaha
---
An alt is moving the goalposts. If I just say "well I have an alt" you can justify nearly any purchase for any reason. If I had 10 alts all with an xmute, sure you can do that...
---
...but one has to assume from the outset a single character (as really this is the norm for most people, despite what many people who have alts might think), and if you're going to be using an alt you gotta explain that's what you're doing. I did not see this assumption in your original post. With an alt...sure. You're going to be making that money back...over a huge timeframe. Maybe.
---
But even then, you're giving up 700g (at current prices - I wouldn't buy that recipe until it drops well sub 400g), and if you have any alt that has ANY valuable transmute you're competing against two things:
---
1) 700g buys a LOT of goods. If you planned on purchasing something, 700g will get you significantly closer to your goal...and you don't have to work for it. You already have it in this scenario. The first opportunity cost is whatever goods you would have purchased with that 700g that you will lack for the next 4-6 months.
---
2) You can already make money with a standard Xmute. The profit is not the differential between undeath and water, but of course the 2nd opportunity cost (traditionally defined as just the cost of the next best good, but you're making the money by forgoing a second choice - so this transaction has two costs tied to it) of the next best Xmute. For most single-character people, a Fire -&gt; Earth and a Earth -&gt; Water Xmute are readily available, so they have two options on 24 hr cooldown and are more resistant to price shifts, while gaining quite a bit of cash. I've been able to gain anywhere from a low of 7g to a high of 16g every time I use these Xmutes, without losing 700g.
---
Even arcanite (which is a terrible Xmute, and really based on the AH prices I've seen would easily go for 10g if people just paid attention...but for some reason goes for 5g when they offer. SMH) which is nearly ubiquitous, provides approximately 5g / day (based on my server price of efficiently using the Xmute to buy the mats for \~40g and sell the arcanite for 50+g for 10g every 48 hrs, not a direct sale of the Xmute which for some stupid reason people think should be 5g). 
---
Also, you're making an assumption that water prices will remain stable. As we've seen in the past week, that's clearly a poor assumption. We've seen water come down by approximately 50% on our server, which severely cuts into the profitability (and hence the payback is significantly extended) of the Undeath -&gt; Water Xmute. 
---
Lastly...this is exactly investing in the AH, and to a greater degree in fact. You're assuming that the price of water will remain somewhat consistently higher than that of undeath in comparison to other Xmutes. You're completely hinging yourself on AH prices (and, amusingly enough, using the AH to make the sale) on a long-term scale. You may not even be able to earn the money back based on the continually dropping water prices.
---
For example, Classic wow came out...in September? I forget. About a month later (Late October? Early November?), a few of the recipes came on the AH for approx 1000g. Due to the drop in price of water, I would still not have been able to pay back the Xmute recipe cost. Since then the recipe has dropped to \~700g, but due to that drop in water price, the payback is severely extended.
---
TL, DR? Ok - If you're an alchemist and you've got 700g, either get AV rep and buy your epic mount or earn the extra 200g and get it that way, if this is what you're looking at. If you have a different goal for your character, 700g goes a long way in funding it, and if you're going to spend 4-5 months on the game in order to pay this back every 24 hours, you have much cheaper ways to make similar money while keeping your 700g in your pocket.
---
OOF
---
.
---
Hey you get that hippie-dippie 'everyone has their own perspective stuff' outta here. This is classic wow where we torture ourselves to get ahead and anyone who doesn't is wrong.
---
Maybe you should stop queuing without premades. Anyone queuing alliance without premades is bound to play with 60% mounters, afkers and noobs.
---
I'm not really criticizing the essence of capitalism. Just pointing out that Blizzard's Hong Kong stance isn't irrelevant, since it shows that Blizzard really won't budge if they think it won't help their cash flow
---
How’s that? I’ve been playing Poe since alpha and I’ve never used a bot.
---
&gt;but consumes especially for melee essentially double their DPS output in raid
---
What? Consumes don't give nearly this much damage for melee, not sure why you think consumes matter that much. Full consumes + world buffs might be about double damage for warriors but consumes alone are much less. These players aren't doing their rotations, specs, or gearing correctly at a fundamental level, it's not a consumes and buff issue besides maybe not putting melee in proper WF groups.
---
This is a weak response, but he played off any criticism nicely by saying its an echo chamber for the people he doesn't like.
---
A shadow that dispells.  Nice.
---
farming ZG trash I assume
---
Yes, with my point being that this is something every company would do. Blame the system, not the player.
---
I don't understand why you would alienate a market as huge as China. The only reason you would do that was if you weren't and wasn't going to be active in that market to begin with - nothing to lose.
---
Besides, there's lots of countries to avoid, not just China if you care about human rights.
---
Not all servers and players are the same. Some servers are balanced or alliance-heavy. Not all players were camping people. But all horde players are effected by the queues.
---
It's an essentially irreversible choice (barring a gigantic sunk cost time sink) once you pick your faction. If this was practically any other video game people could switch teams and would happily balance them themselves. But in this game we cannot. So yes, it's blizzard's fault and blizzard's problem to fix.
---
Mother fucker- my alt is about to sing 60... you mean I’m going to have to level another toon to experience this. Seriously sounds amazing. GG dude
---
I thought I was missing a joke or something.
---
Every class has one I believe, they've been around for years.
---
You misunderstand sir, the horde are the winners of this AV Premade stuff.
---
The game has been game breaking for Alliance for months but when you point that out you get told to stop being whiny or how you're "Alliance crybabies". But now that Horde has one (1) disadvantage suddenly talking about issues isn't being whiny it's serious discussion that needs to happen.
---
Only if you count PVE servers. Without PVP servers it's closer to 60/40. I still laugh at the maniacs telling us that queues won't be a thing for the Horde.
---
2 hours for the run itself? I assume you’re accounting for creating the group and travel time?
---
Generally, no.  If it's significant or damages the health of the game, yes.
---
Yes, but lets concentrate on the important thing.
---
Are you having fun ?
---
This is probably how Skynet started
---
Love how you're post is sitting at zero. People want to argue that long games are worth it for the honor but they really aren't. Chances are you aren't even approaching that amount of honor. Likely 3-10ish people either AFK, fishing, or doing random quests (like in the caves). Another 10+ are most likely not engaged in much PvP for the majority of the match (defending things that don't need it, sitting in advanced spots they don't need to be at yet, etc). In reality you're probably getting most of your kills from the same 10-20 people. 
---
There's some benefit to engaging in actual PvP but trying to act like you're getting maximum honor by HK farming for 30 minutes is ridiculous.
---
This man is a living stereotype.
---
Botting was a huge problem in Vanilla but I honestly have not encountered it at all in Classic *shrugs*
---
Means just about all of the resources go to the horde, so they must be extra cheap from the increased supply.
---
Nope.
---
The biggest problem with pugs is you always see new faces every week. Whereas in a guild run you'll eventually get the best items that you want after top prio gets it, in a pug you might always be rolling against someone.
---
I felt that way until I got a job doing manual labor. I’m in the best shape of my life. I can’t do the desk job thing. I get fat and hurt all the time. Now I’m only hurting some of the time and not as fat.
---
You endlessly level alts, pvp or raidlog, it is what it is.
---
F
---
Yeah this is what I’m thinking as well. Considering I’m pretty nooby I would feel a lot better running with a guild after I’ve done a few PUG runs.
---
Does anybody have a video an actual solo pull of Van? I’ve never seen it
---
it makes AOE farming on a mage even easier. in pve it's not great, it doesn't have standalone stats. not great for PVP either, but great for anything gold farming related.
---
Some the high end alchemy stuff comes from rare dungeon drops, such as flasks, greater fire potions and so on. Alchemists does a lot of dungeon runs for this stuff and this would be a none issue if the recipes was bop.
---
My opinion is that whatever drops in dungeons should go to someone in the group that can and will use the item itself. If none need it then it can goes to whoever wants the money. Do you understand how frustrating it is to see a rare BIS BOE item drop that you want and loose it to someone that straight away put it up on AH?
---
I’m am just trying to point out how ridiculous the current situation is, where we could actually end up with people needing on bop stuff other actually need. It is what it is though, so I do only play with guild mates these days.
---
The thing is with bots, game devs don't like to ban people one by one. They want to first understand the bot, so they can add it to their detected Bots
---
 List. Otherwise the bot programmers would just rewrite enough for blizzard to lose all the progress they made on it. This is why banwaves are so popular. Its better to cure the disease then the symptoms. So no worries, there will be a banwave coming for sure if ppl continue to use it mindlessly.
---
No, I would much rather be in WSG. Competitive premade WSG is much more entertaining that any form of AV. Vanilla PvP is a grind though, and if this is what we are grinding then so be it. I'll have fun once I'm done ranking.
---
This isn't how a corporate office thinks about new hires. They assume that adding new staff is highly unlikely to increase productivity, or profits. They prefer to see the most replaceable workers stretched thin, and assume adding more workers will just cause their current staff to work less, in many instances.
---
Lol. Wait 2 seconds. Vanish.
---
It's really not that hard
---
Gather mats, make money on the ah, help guildies questing or do low level dungeons, wpvp, do quests to increase rep with the odd factions, level professions, fishing.
---
I find PLENTY to do.
---
You can sell tanking services at 60.
---
If I honestly cared about messy AV games I would find a premade.  They're more fun as a hot messy romp to me than just zerging in an orderly fashion over lackluster competition.
---
But I love messy AV games.
---
Now if I was Horde I would have a problem.  Maybe.  Thankfully I am not Horde, and they have everything coming to them after making servers literally unplayable for alliance when the balance was on the other foot.
---
In fact, Horde pretty much made their bed by their previous actions.  More than not pitying them I am greatly amused.
---
AV bots need to be banned before anything else.  
---
Why should I play 10 fucking hours a day only to be down 100k honor because other people simply bot the other 12 hours.  
---
It is ridiculous that blizzard lets this happen.
---
So much this. Or even just letting the premades queue together is better than letting them queue simultaneously and then make holes in other games trying to get together.
---
I used bots in rs to max alll my stats and they were free.. they had paid versions to do more complicated things but i was a broke kid.  This was back in 2008 btw. Machine learning and the use of deep neural networks have come a long way since then
---
It's because exp is based on average group member level.
---
Top teir pve and pvp.
---
Yes, most of leveling will make you hate life.
---
Gearing technically is no harder than any class outside of everyone and their mother competing for gear.
---
They are not hard to play persay, but other classes are way easier. 
---
They are a ton of fun if you can get used to the playstyle
---
Stepping into the lions den with thag argument in a place like this lol
---
I’m a /chicken kind of guy
---
It's inaccurate but it still shows a pretty clear trend. The proportion of people it tracks relative to the entire player base should stay roughly the same
---
Hardest part would be releveling so you can be in a profitable area.
---
You realize that the longer the Horde queues get the more Horde are out in the open world doing exactly what you're crying about in the first half of your comment? Doesn't seem like you've fully thought your position through lol...
---
Yes and no. Technically if you are human the extra weapon skill means you need less hit cap for pvp (five percent), but yeah in general for pvp it is useless. Didn’t know if you were planning to raid
---
&gt; And no don't expect this to come to TinyThreat any time soon.
---
https://github.com/dfherr/LibThreatClassic2/blob/master/ClassModules/Classic/Paladin.lua
---
 
---
Its already in the lib &amp; I can confirm blessing threat appears on TinyThreat when using it because I am the guy who wrote the first pass at making it show up there.
---
So unless there is some reason a mod maker will refuse to use updated libraries its gonna show up for everyone.
---
You'll be able to do BWL and AQ40 up to Twin Emps - especially if you can gear up in ZG and AQ20, which I think your guild will really enjoy.
---
A casual guild can do some of the bosses in Naxx (even if you need to skip the end of AQ40).
---
You never know what happens between now and Naxx tho. Your guild is still pretty new.
---
I haven't done any PVP but from reading this subreddit, it seems like you have to either know somebody inside the circle, or be insanely geared out. You might even need both of those things.
---
Meh that’s what I thought with OSRS. The game is more successful than ever (more so than RS3 now) yet the botting never gets better. Hopefully that isn’t the case with classic too.
---
What mod is that, that shows the price for vendor/ah? Thx
---
Here's hoping they find a way to nerf premade for av.
---
My whole guild xfered off Christmas eve game feels fun again on a real server and not the grizzly containment cesspit.
---
So a week at most? Unless Blizz can catch them in that window there's fuckall else they can do, the bot turned a profit.
---
Everyone vastly overstates the damage bots do to the economy
---
Like what rewards?
---
You don't even know what you're talking about, you're just parroting what you've heard online. 
---
There was no 1.05 AV. It's 1.5 AV.
---
&gt;In retrospect, waiting around for Blizzard to act doesn't work! The community needs to **force them** into action, and hopefully before people are even more negatively effected by botters.
---
I do not know what kind of leverage you think the community might have other than mass posting and harassing the community leaders. People are not going to put their subscription on pause and fight with their wallets. Blizzard bows to a certain world superpower and which violates human rights and we still give them our money. And you're concerned with botters?
---
Let the downvotes begin.
---
Honestly, people are already hitting the dps requirements for fights like patchwork, without buffs and flasking. I dont think dps requirements will be an issue for any half decent guild.
---
Thank you! Damn autocorrects
---
There are plenty of other options.
---
Because not everyone is on a PvE server?
---
Vael is gonna be pretty easy with 1.12 talents imo. I'd be more worried about the suppression room.
---
The pickpocket gold is that good?
---
Yall can pull Vann the same way too...
---
I have about 15 to 20 mc runs on my back and don't posess a single piece, I wanted to save dkp for weapons, as anyone else, and nothing drops. We had one brutality blade (when I didn't come). Main hands as rogue are a terror. We didn't have a single vis'kag either and I had to run ubrs 40 times to get the dal'rends. It starts getting annoying and I swore to take it easy aswell.
---
After the 1st mana gem you should use dark runes or demonic runes because they restore more mana than a lower rank of mana gem
---
Adopters of the Game, when will we teach the "top" of influx of new players and the game will decline in actice players.
---
*reach
---
Well I kinda have to for some epic gear, especially a weapon to last me through AV rep grind
---
If you’re all having fun, it doesn’t matter. But that is WAY too many healers. Mostly druids. You only NEED 8 Healers. We also have too many healers (currently sitting at 10) but we can still first phase rag. 
---
Make a few of them go boomkin/feral dps if you want to keep them. But quickest solution would be to drop all of em but one and pick up rogues/warrior dps.
---
It’s incredible. I’ll fire up a laptop and grind out like 80-100g once wife gets home and wants to watch Netflix with me.
---
Is there a video of the circuit? I’m leveling a rogue right now.
---
source?
---
So games aren't innovations? 😂 Innovation = "The process of translating an idea or invention into a good or service that creates value or for which customers will pay."
---
We’ve had 5 lefts drop with no rights.
---
Nice work man.
---
I want a mage now :-)
---
Literally everybody knew Horde was going to way more popular than Alliance. If you wanted shorter queues, then you should've gone Alliance
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/
---
Ok but things aren't soulbound automatically, so that is *literally* how it works. You're using this idea of what Blizzard intended the game to be to justify getting priority over other people on expensive BoEs and recipes while ignoring the actual game mechanics.
---
Have fun convincing every stranger you meet to pass on 100+ gold because "muh game design." I hope you succeed, it'll only increase my odds of winning :)
---
Right - both sides has petty assholes. Best we all stay unhappy.
---
F to pay your respects. Came from CoD: Advanced Warfare at a military funeral for the main character's best friend.
---
He’s talking about trade
---
Yeah blue or epic or bloody green. No1 gets to roll need for an off spec with the main thing right there. Not without asking (and accepting a no) first. I’ve never had a group that wouldn’t follow this philosophy - when someone disregards it, they get told off every time.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
Did people struggle with the suppression room? I feel like all of bwl should be easy but people are struggling with rag and we’re unable to kill lucifron on their first raid.
---
so far, i've seen it proc on every spell besides blizzard. not sure about percentages, but on average every 5-6 damage spells it procced for me. and it procs AFTER i cast a spell and lands on the target.
---
Vanilla had bot farms, there was a news segment on TV about WoW botters and account sharing where 2 people would share one account and play 12 hours each just to sell gold and the character once it hit 60.
---
People bought/sold accounts based on gear and server reputation.
---
Botting and account sharing/selling was everywhere in vanilla.
---
"To comment “F” comes from a meme dated back to at least two years ago, originating from Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare, in which the player character pays respects to a dead comrade in-game by pressing the “f” key (as seen below)"  
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
Open AI. I believe they had to turn down reaction time values though holy crap no way anyone can counter react that fast humanely to a blink blackhole combo.
---
Oh that is neat, like a gamers’ salute, thank you
---
I'm Asyouwish in this pic
---
As the main tank for a pretty solid guild, I'd really love to have the R13 gear to maximize my potential.  But wpvp on a tank is awful and I missed the first 2 weeks of BGs to finals, so I'm still sitting at R4.  Just the first couple days of AV grinding (not even grinding that hard) is already starting to wear me down.  Not sure if I'll be able to hang in on the grind, but I definitely don't want to quit over it.  Hoping I have the wisdom to know when too much is too much.
---
I dont know how much has changed since actual classic wow but back then i religiously played pvp servers and it was part of my routine to pass through known bot farming areas to ‘clean up’ the bots.
---
To be honest i just love ganking people and trying to goad them into bringing help to start a bit of a war but i did learn after a while who the bots and real people were. Even the chinese farmers would bring backup after a bit of bot camping 😂
---
"Literally everybody" as if all tens of thousands of people who signed up for this game were tactically making decisions based on private server data and wow forum polls?
---
It won’t stop you from getting snared a second time or stop poly
---
Noted, thank you.
---
OP will never get a purple/orange parse if his guild is taking 2 minutes to kill Lucifron.
---
That’s fine. If you weren’t healing in the dungeon but dpsing tho, would you still roll need on gear the dungeons healer wants?
---
You can't "foresee" something that is already happening. Lot's of horde have been ganking the areas around Alterac Mountains literally since the day BG's came out, while waiting in queue for BG's. But if you really think standing around an empty LHC/Chillwind Camp/Arathi Highlands, picking off single kills here and there, is better than joining AV's (even when losing), then i don't know what to tell you.
---
So you want a system where there could be thousands of reports at any given time, across multiple servers, to be investigated by humans, every time? You understand how much work a system like this would take, yes? How many people it would require and how perfect their work would have to be without reddit firing up a shitstorm?
---
&gt;loot system is ms&gt;os
---
This is typically a bad idea for a progression guild.
---
It is far more effective to i.e. gear one healer completely as opposed to spreading gear out randomly to seperate people.
---
You are the only one talking about rep.
---
Obvious to whom? I played vanilla and on my server (Eonar Horde) we were drastically outnumbered. I believe that alliance  had the majority overall as well if memory serves.
---
Thank you for sharing this and remembering your friend !
---
Imagine this many people in one raid wanting to be poor.
---
Podcasts bruh
---
Fuck Blizzard they already ruined it. Guarantee they don't give a shit as long as they're making money.
---
Have you ever played WoW? Alliance was only the dominant faction for PvP like Cata-WoD
---
&gt;I believe the chess problem has been solved.
---
There are more possibilities in chess than there are atoms in the observable universe. AIs are good enough to beat grandmasters, but it is very much not solved.
---
Yet he participates in society. Curious.
---
Yeah, I'm expecting a lot of guilds to feel pretty proud after killing Vael and then get brought down to earth by wiping on the next trash pack.
---
Ok sorry I didn’t understand. Umm is this like chat bots in d2? I’ve always just used the in game function for sales, if I remember correctly before they implemented the in game shop you had to make a shop page on the forums and link items to it.
---
No worries. I just googled it myself, 'cause I didn't know, either.
---
I always think these posts are so heartbreakingly bittersweet, though. I haven't lost any WoW friends, but I empathise with happening upon experiences that remind you of someone no longer here. I can imagine after 15 years this is has happened to quite a few people. It's so sad. But play on, honour them in your own way!
---
lol dude MC is just ez, bruv. y u min maxing and playing ur pve spec in the raids, just go arms and sub, we have all day to play and raiding is EZ. fakkin min maxing meta slaves.
---
I've got an addon that's claiming to be adding people to friends - just gives the yellow text in my chat bar. It doesn't actually do that (im guessing addons cant anyway). Can't seem to find out what is causing it.
---
Why would so ma has people want that
---
Forgive the noob in me but what am I looking at
---
Think about it what it means to own and wield a legendary weapon. It's not 'legendary' because the color of the text its orange, its legendary because of the accumulated weight it holds. 
---
Go back to retail if you want the spa treatment, where everyone gets a toy!
---
Played since alpha btw
---
&gt; Down ranking in a 5 man is just as likely to cause problems as most 5 man situations are more about hps (health per second) and not mps (mana per second). 
---
This is completely incorrect. 
---
Unless you want to be oom and drinking after every little pull, you definitely want to use downranked spells in 5 mans.
---
For example, as a priest I use Flash Heal R1&amp;7, Heal R4, Gheal R2&amp;4.
---
Flash Heal R1 is insanely efficient for consistant healing once you're around +350 healing.
---
Must be useful then for the instant cast aoe spells
---
Wtf are you talking about? Your experience isnt everyone's experience. There were plenty of servers where alliance outnumbered horde and horde had a nightmare p2. And there were even a bunch of balanced pvp servers where p2 was actually enjoyable.
---
Ok, you enjoy the game how you want to... and I will enjoy how I want to.
---
I'd like to see you win 10 to 1 fight 24/7.
---
The suppression room requires some on-the-fly coordination. Some guilds had no problem with it, and other guilds really struggled. It requires a decent raid leader and for raiders to know their role and take initiative spontaneously. 
---
If people are raiding by rote and need to be told exactly what to do, it can be a struggle.
---
Not false
---
Ok you just want to be right so I'll stop replying I guess.
---
Hell yeah, grats! We got 5 bindings, only 1 complete set. Zero eye.
---
Maybe we actually didn't
---
guntz definitely hates u
---
South Korea actually does send bot makers to jail.
---
I'm confident that the heal neck that's supposed to drop from Rammstein, as well as the heal chest from Baron, don't even exist. I'm 12 runs in I haven't seen either item.
---
Granted, that's not an incredible amount of runs, but it's starting to piss me off lol
---
Think it’s 9, not 10. I forget why exactly but it had to do with a group of 4 hitting the node, then all 5 of the second group hitting it.
---
Classic is in a horrible position. The demographics are made up of people use to speed playing through private servers (and classic is just a new launch to them), people will extreme nostalgia, retail players just wanting to see what the hype is about, and the more moderate players hoping to have some fun with it again.
---
At this point I doubt many people actually truly enjoy the game. The majority that do are just hoping some aspect will satisfy their nostalgia. Sooner or later the thing they were hoping they could relive will occur again and the grandness will wear off. For a lot of the others, once the phases are rolled out they will quit out of boredom and look for a fresh pserver launch.
---
Joe Shmoe is the kinda guy to ask when LFR is coming at the Blizzcon 2020 Q&amp;A (if they have one).
---
He's the guy making blogposts on the forum about why they need to change Paladins with just a few TBC/WotLK tweaks and they're perfect! He even responds with "sure, as long as my ideas get in" when somebody suggests big changes to other classes too.
---
Joe wants dual spec and a queue button on the UI. Yes, for dungeons too.
---
Not the best person to use as an example when talking about the health of the game.
---
Leveling an alt has been way more fun than farming prebis/raids for me. Haven’t touched my priest in weeks.
---
It's absurd, all the bots make me feel like I'm playing on a cheap Russian private server. Why am I paying 15 a month for this again? 
---
Wait, no, even on private servers I saw less bots!
---
I’ve already canceled my subscription and a large part of that is due to botting that has been allotted. 
---
#MakeWoWGreatAgain
---
Botters tend to prefer ranged classes.
---
Much less risk of pathing issues.
---
players got smarter. it happens.
---
It's almost as if the tens of thousands of individuals playing this game are not the same person, and those saying to suck it up may or may not be the same people advocating for change now.
---
Phase 2 was terrible for Alliance. Blizzard should have done something to fix that. This phase is terrible for Horde. Blizzard should do something to fix it. Both things can be independently true.
---
My point is we are *all* playing under a system of rules and incentives designed and maintained by Blizzard. Phase 2 could have been better if they wanted it to be. But since they won't fix the obvious flaws (that hurt both alliance and horde) we are taking it out on each other. Why not just fix the system? :-/
---
Yeah, I saw an UD horse in the AH the other day
---
Slowly leaning down for that present while holding the tree. Perfect.
---
Does it have a chance to proc on mob hit? Ie if you hit 20 mobs with one frost nova, could it proc twice? Or is it 10% per cast?
---
I didn't say I wanted them to cater to joe shmoe.  Don't be blind and think they don't do it.  How do you think all those changes happened.  They love that guy.
---
He's not good for the game and I never said he was.  They shouldn't cater to that situation but they do and the game suffers.
---
Yeah having constant 20 minute breaks while ranking instead of having to play 24/7 is soooo terrible :\^)
---
NO CHANGES.
---
WE DEALT WITH THEM BEFORE AND WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM AGAIN
---
Zugzug gorilla warfare
---
Blizzard: we removed multiple skeletons so people couldn't be offensive.
---
Shaman players: hold my beer
---
Blizzard: wait that's illegal
---
every mob has it's own table. a minute ago a used arcane explosion on 40 lashers in DM:E, and it procced 8 times on different mobs.
---
Few things to help clear time:
---
- Help guildies get pre BiS. Downtime in between raids just run brd/brs/whatever the hell people need to get geared up. If everyone is able to get most pre bis setup that'd help the clear speed a lot faster.
---
- Consumables. Gather a list for your different raid types (melee dps, ranged, tank) and help to get them their consumables including food items like blessed sunfruit, and sharpening stones like Dense Sharpening Stones/ElementL Sharpening stones.
---
- Raid grouping. Identify those with solid DPS and maximize their dps meters if possible (Also look into shaman/mana totems if necessary for healers). This means Windfury, Battle Shout, Trueshot Aura, the druid Pack buff, moonkin even. Ensure your "buff members" are spread as much as possible to affect as many people as possible.
---
Its the godtier PvE class. The only "real" tank, and the top dog in DPS. I guess it paints a picture when you see that speedruns have as many warriors as possible. In PvP, it is quite prone to getting kited, you will absolutely WRECK anybody who has no gear and doesn't know how to keep distance. But a skilled player will fuck you up if you don't have proper gadgets and consumables.
---
Probably the hardest class to gear as dps pre-raid and inside raids. You have very few items that are actually and upgrade from MC, and you share them with other physical DPS. Tier pieces will be mostly useless as a DPS. Gearing as a tnak is extremely easy though. 
---
Leveling is a pain, but in my opinion it is still quite manageable. It gets much easier if you have a friend to level with you, especially a Shaman. But yeah, it is usually considered the hardest class to level in Classic.
---
I would never consider playing anything other than a Warrior as my main in Classic. Once you get gear, you're the hero-class of Classic. You just need to realize that it's gonna be high investment, high reward type of deal. If you can manage to farm the gear, and you are willing to put in the effort for consumables and world buffs, you're gonna be an absolute monster.
---
An example, in the top 100 overall molten core parses there are 13 rogues, the other 87 are warriors.
---
kickass AI able to beat pro-players aren't impossible to make.
---
they are just not profitable for anything other than some research project.
---
blizzard created  some crazy 5000-apm AI that could perfectly split zergling VS siege tank, something that no player could do... but there's simply no point in developping it further.
---
Bots can take inhuman advantage of spell batching with instant reaction time. Like being able to counter-cc an instant CC, HoJing a blind before it takes effect, or gouge a psychic scream, or squeeze in a spellsteal on a divine shield to actually steal it around the immunity. These were actually pretty rampant before the spell batching changes on to live as assistive scripts (probably still are to some level).
---
Everyone has the same queue times, game exploits aside. People aren't going to rank slower because of longer queue times. Ranking is actually much more enjoyable on Horde side because you get mandatory breaks between games. Meanwhile on Alliance, every second not spent in a BG is missed Honor.
---
It will be a very long time before they kill 2 bosses in BWL if they are still struggling with Rag at this point.
---
Yeah, it's honestly pretty trash gold/hour. Only reason I like it is because I can do it semi afk while watching something on other monitor.
---
Ah yes, water and wow. Two mandatory things In life
---
Allright. Just thought itd be funny of they first fan from South to north, back to South from North, and then back to north of defend south after that. Had it been hordes
---
Have you ever actually watched one the vids? A lot of times he has good anecdotes or stories about the subjects in the videos that can in some cases add more to the video he is reacting to. 
---
There are some times when he’s just staring at the screen but if we recorded you watching YouTube you’d probably look like that a lot too.
---
I enjoy horde players complaining about insta av queues.
---
Do they not understand that there are simply more horde players and not enough alliance to fill the avs for the horde?
---
Like what so they expect blizzard to do? They can't force more people to play alliance so the horde have shorter queue times...
---
The entire honor system in Classic could have been left out and I would have been delighted. Battlegrounds should be for the reputation rewards and for competitive play. Instead they are based entirely off time.
---
are you trolling ? Launch of course
---
be social and make some friends.
---
It's a small realm after all
---

---
I queue premades for honor farm. Our primary rule is no defense unless it is a stall while both sides are on faction leaders.
---
We cap as many towers as possible with dedicated groups and kill lieutenants. We don't care about winning. We are farming honor.
---
To win as Horde, have 5 to 10 strong stallers like frost mages, or even warriors and priests on defense slowing ally down. A competent push of 20 horde will then push through and win against most ally premades.
---
For ally it is not worth the time or effort to ever defend, because we can just instant pop another queue and go kill more lieutenants. If Horde have enough back to slow our push and have their own going, we will not stop them (or at least my premade groups don't.)
---
What makes us rage are the games that take half an hour to win with 25 horde on defense and the other 15 puttering around failing to take a graveyard against our 5 randos trying to defend. They would get more honor taking objectives and ending then sending more than half their team to get 10 honor per kill x 40 x 4.
---
Just the mount which was the gold value apparently.
---
It’s kinda shit that they seem to care more about players who buy than the ones who sell.
---
It would be awesome/scary to see the same for WOW!
---
https://www.newscientist.com/article/2221840-deepminds-starcraft-playing-ai-beats-99-8-per-cent-of-human-gamers/
---
Does the proc/mana scale with sp?
---
Found Asyouwish
---
Since it’s a PVE server our faction imbalance doesn’t matter much but DAMN is it alliance heavy
---
There are about 5-6 solid raiding guilds on horde side, maybe 10 or so that are pushing 150+ members.
---
The one place it’s very noticeable though is the auction house. With a smaller player base things just don’t sell as much, and it’s become very easy for a few people to corner the market on specific items. I’m really enjoying it though and love that I see people I’ve run around with in the past just in Org or running to raid. Would recommend
---
So if all ypur going to use the alch recipe for is making money, why isnt it a gold coin as well?
---
I’d feel less bad about playing WoW lots if it helped out in other parts of life beyond stress relief. Reading novels or going for a hike, having a game of tennis, etc, don’t have that meta-stress because they seem to improve other aspects of my life in more apparent ways. Whereas WoW has that nagging, almost nihilistic itch of ‘why am I doing this? What does this NPC‘s slowmo walk add to the experience?‘
---
Yup, that's why they introduced blood elves in tbc.
---
I understand that. Subreddits for specific hobbies or interests are always going to reflect the opinions of the more dedicated people than those that are more casual because the casual hobbie-doers don't seek out a place to specifically discuss their hobby. They just do it.
---
Unfortunately asking the post's question in game would get me a ton of responses from people that are not only playing the game, but most likely enjoying the game. I'd also need to pay the $15 to ask the question because I'd been unsubbed since around November 12th or so at that point.
---
Honestly, /r/classicwow is one of the few places where I can ask this question and actually get answers from people that are a bit more complex and diverse than just "it sucked so I stopped (if I *somehow* found a way to ask the group of people that quit)" and "wow I haven't been able to stop playing since its release!"
---
I'd love to get some answers from more casual players but that just isn't possible. I think there was a post a day or two ago from a player on Stalagg's Alliance side that said that their auction house was nearly dead because the casual playerbase just stopped playing altogether. There's no one to post items on the auction house that no one really wants to farm.
---
Can I ask why you're commenting on my 21 day old thread?
---
Blizzard doesn't give a shit about you.
---
Still works
---
if you alt f4 your character will stay online in combat for a couple minutes, maybe he could feign death while refreshing the timer. and maybe if the warrior gets in combat it's still on the loot table even if it goes offline?
---
Some of us just want the rep. /Shrug
---
FEED ME A STRAY CAT
---
When you're outnunbered 60/40 (that's 50% more Hordes, btw) or *worse* on servers with 10k-15k people?
---
I think once 8.3 retail drops there will be more people jumping back to retail, but the success and failures of each version will result in people going to wherever they think the “grass in greener.” Having both versions available to all people will result in more people playing WoW, in some capacity, rather than losing people when someone gets bored with one of them.
---
Well a lot of people quit after the game launched but I think it's pretty stable no all the people who weren't interested left already.
---
There's just a big lack of content right now, people are waiting for BWL.
---
Or just let horde face other horde teams. We're already at war with our own faction for PvP ranks. Why not in BGs too?
---
Probably a mix of bad leadership and a lot of slackers who don’t know much about the game. Didn’t see a tldr but this is most likely the case
---
Wow I never knew it got THIS bad... yeah, if Classic gets this botted I’m out
---
I need to pick one of those up.
---
i wish you all the rng in the world my friend. happy farming
---
Then you realize they don’t want to pay you $15 an hour to remove hundreds of $15/month subs.... :(
---
Sure it does. (-1)^3=-1. Triple negative means “not.”
---
I mean, "not wiping" in mc is an extremely low bar.
---
I got 8piece as shaman in 4 weeks dawg, versus when I was a maintank in vanilla and it took over half a year to get full might
---
You are either very lucky or an insane leader then.
---
What a journey. Best of luck.
---
actually one is a 3% drop (garr) and one is a 1.6% drop (baron geddon)
---
Sure but too much inaction in an arms race is dooming yourself. It is an endless back and forth, the bot makers will be moving as fast as possible, Blizzard will never win, predictability of any kind is dangerous,
---
It absolutely is. Stop spouting misinformation you know nothing about.
---
You can biy carry runs. No way you can do it legit.
---
Why are there so many people rolling for what is, just not that great of a weapon really...
---
Do they not realise it's going to cost 6-10k+ gold to craft the fucker?  If they're not enhance shamans I'd suggest it's really not worthwhile.
---
Most of the AV and WSG alliance premades I've seen have been pretty fucking terrible lol. 
---
Also, honor is relative to our own faction, so it doesn't matter when everyone on horde has the same queues. It just gives us time to afk or farm gold while we wait instead of having to fall behind just to take a break.
---
Unpopular opinion, in response to your second point: Horde can make premades too
---
Before the raid have a group do a DM north tribute run like an hour before raid. Get a couple locks to summon people there, get buffs, then summon to MC. Then they log off to save the buff until the raid is ready to move. (Same can be done with dragon buffs you get in org for turning in a head.) These buffs are pretty strong and are how many of the top guilds get such fast clears. 
---
People need to at least be bringing in items for food buffs, elixirs for AP/SP/crit/etc. Casters need demonic/dark runes and mana pots. Bandages for self healing to alleviate the healers which can help you bring in less healers and more DPS. Do guilds runs in BRD and BRS to help gear those who aren't in pre-BiS. Bring fire pro and cleanse pots. 
---
Make sure people have enchantments on their gear. No serious need to have them blow 100-200g on wep chants to items that are just ok but things like agi on cloak, +3 stat to chest, and many +5-7 stat to bracer/boot/glove are cheap. Even a rugged armor kit is better than nothing. 
---
If you guys are still struggling on some mechanics make sure to go over the fight and what's going to happen before the pull. Groups should be organized to make use of shaman WF/fire resist totems for melee along with other classes that like to be in a group together.
---
Might need to help some on understanding down ranking so they don't go OOM so fast and can maintain constant DPS when they begin getting low.
---
Just a few things off the top of my head for you to think about and maybe pass along to your guild.
---
Fuck that. Why would you get punished for letting someone go in front of you?
---
Stop pugging AV.  There's plenty of cross-server discord premades that will generally get you around 9/10 winrate.
---
How do you differentiate an AH bot from someone with a TSM alt? I sit in org for hours on the AH while I play my main and will snipe and relist. If someone mailed me all that junk I would report them lol. 
---
Is there any obvious signs so you know you’re not messing with a goblin?
---
Please tell me more about this junk mail script?
---
no the majority is people who were t0 wearing noobs back then who didnt make a step forward in life in the past 15years and now go all in in classic to be the guy they fancied for his shiny epic armor 15years ago. how toxic and addicted so huge numbers of people are rn because of honorgrind is amazing and how they exploit everything to achieve something they couldnt 15y ago.
---
We also can farm Bloodvine solo when ZG comes out, along with Bijou farming trash from gators.
---
P2 did serious damage to wow but it's back to normal now at least, even on Mograinne.
---
It would win what it should but classic has a ton of Rock/Paper/Scissors to it and short of massively outgearing or outplaying someone, you will lose to your counters often. 
---
GCD and the limitations of classes would hinder AI's ability to do what it does in other games where reaction time (DOTA/SC) matters and where a game is inherently equal (chess). I don't care how perfectly you play that warrior, an equally geared mage is shitting on it and you'd need to depend on RNG from resists and bad procs to do otherwise.

**Do you want to be on the winning team, or watch from the sidelines?**
---
Raid Times, PST (subject to change):
---
Team One: Tuesday, Thursday 5:30pm
---
Team Two: Wednesday, Monday 7pm
---
Team Three: Saturday, Sunday 7pm

Apparently a lot of mages don't seem to know that druids can shift out of sheep - the number of times I've been sheeped and they start evocate, only for me to shift out and apparently blow their mind by interrupting Evo is rather high by now.
---
You should all have mostly blues from 5 man's. If your expecting to collect your first decent set of gear inside a raid then you guys won't be able to clear the first boss in bwl under any circumstances.
---
Laying dead on the floor?
---
Man i played this 15 years ago and i dont think anyone had this mentality then. Need if your char legit needs.
---
only face premades like %10 of the time. stop being a bitch, thats allies thing.
---
I think if a 300g blue boe drops in a 5 man pug and its your best in slot you should get need priority on that too
---
**Should be bringing:**
---
Elixir of Mongoose(25 Agi, 2 crit) - "Agility Elixir"
---
Elixir of Giants(25 Str)/JuJu Power(30 Str) - "Strength Elixir"
---
Grilled Squid(10 Agi) - Food buff
---
1x Ground Scorpok Assay + 1x ROIDS - "Blast lands buff"
---
2x Sharpening Stones if Horde, 4x Sharpening Stones if Ally. Use to replace poisons before Garr+Rag. Ele version is better.
---
A few fire prot/greater fire prot pots, a few major healing pots, and at least 1 greater arcane pot if your guild is killing Shaz properly.
---
That's the bare minimum for MC, imo. Blasted lands buffs are easily farmed once a week, pop Scorpok before the first boss and pop ROIDS an hour later. 
---
**I would also suggest:**
---
Winterfall Firewater(30 AP)/Juju Might(40 AP) - "Attack Power Elixir"
---
Elixir of Fortitude(120 HP) - "Hp Elixir"
---
3x Free Action pot(Gehennas, Harbinger, Garr)
---
1-2x Restorative pot(Lucifron, possibly Shaz)
---
Rumsey Black Label(15 Stam)/Gordok Green Grog(10 Stam) - Alcohol Buff
---
I would also try and get World buffs. DM buffs are really easy to get as a rogue(5g to a hunter will usually do it if you cant get a group together). Ony buff is basically every 6 hours on raid days so get the timer. Not horde, but I imagine WCB is similar to Ony. Songflower is also nice, but is shorter and the least important. 
---
There are a few small things you can do beyond what I listed, but I wouldn't worry about them unless you are really min/maxing.
---
The botting script tells the botting client how to play, it doesn't have any relation to whether the accounts used were banned or not. It's much easier to create a script to automate functions than it is to detect that the accounts using it are automated.
---
If you just wanna have fun with your buds in WSG - you should make twinks mate. If you're main complaint is queuetimes - you should've been well aware of that issue by picking horde.
---
I thought I was on the OSRS sub and was confused, bots have been around since the dawn of time
---
Gz! You got the 6-10k gold you need?
---
Authenticators got compromised around the end of Wrath. All g now.
---
Are bots still a major issue in WoW. From my understanding the major players in the Wow Bot Community have stopped producing wow bots, afk Honorbuddy is the only major one I know.
---
According to their site Blizzard can just now see everything you are running on your computer when you run their launcher or program.
---
What if we dislike life and just use WoW as a timesink until we finally kick the bucket?
---
Unless you poopsock you will never get the rewards before they are obsolete.
---
Sorry, what advantages do horde have?
---
It sounds good in theory, but banwaves always end with some non-botters getting banned, causing a whole new problem for Blizz.
---
Comparing all time to any other point in time (especially a time where most players are starved for the next phase) is highly disingenuous even if the numbers are accurate...which they aren't.
---
patchwerk dps check is 371 not counting tanks
---
3.9M / 25( dps players) / 240seconds
---
Sure over 7 minutes casters have mana issues but if you had only warriors and rogues it will be a breeze you can do 400+ in pre raid gear with a few consumables so 370 is ez.
---
* makes a bot that's sole job is to act like a bot
---
* collect junk mail from whole server
---
* become richest person on server overnight
---
In Honor
---
Yeah go drink some water saltyboy. You dont know shit about me or what i have or havent failed at. You sound like an angry little child trying to start an argument for no reason. Go get fucked
---
Level 58 warrior who wants to spec fury at 60 for raids, but still expecting to tank quite a few 60 dungeons for gear. I've just bought devilsaur set and have Blackstone Ring - aside from that, gear is average. 
---
I'm herb and alchemist, both 300.
---
What is the best way for me to spend the next 2 levels? EPL and Silithus quests with a focus on herbs? Arena and angerforge till my hair goes grey (this is what I've been doing - still haven't even seen SGC or HoJ)?
---
Much appreciate any tips here.
---
Definitely would give it to a guildie but if I'm pugging I'm trying to get stuff, not look out for other people!
---
Calm down - I thought your life was so perfect?
---
Yep, he is just a self hating nerd. 
---
Bro If you have addiction issues then that’s fine. But you can have a healthy relationship with wow u know ?
---
It’s 100% possible with current gear lol.
---
I know this post is already really big and u wont see this op, but blizzard allows people to mutlibox because it is extra money..they are going to allow people betting for a long time before a banwave hits because its extra money right now and shadowlands is coming up so most likely the ban wave wont hit until they hit their budget numbers probably..I quit playing classic mid November because it was impossible to lvl up..so many max lvl alliance ganking people on benediction
---
If they are paying I don't think Blizz will do fuck all about it.
---
Yea but even that one super good AI they have still gets beaten by pros.
---
And thats a game with..4 spells.
---
Mmm horde tears, so delicious
---
It's not just WoW. It's pretty much any PvP game these days, and I don't see it getting better. 
---
Meet the newer generation of gamers.
---
Is it a Dev in green colors? :P
---
When I started playing classic, I never thought, “I’ll never play retail again.” I always knew that as soon as new story and gameplay were released, I’d just start bouncing between them both and play whatever has the freshest context out. I’m not comfortable not knowing what is going on in either game.
---
Sounds like bad RNG, with a bigger sample size it would probably even out
---
That’s just like, your opinion, man.
---
shaman -&gt; paladin
---
The fun ones for me, rep and honor aside, are the ones that last long enough for me to recall as alliance and punt Vanndar into unsuspecting horde trying to pull out a Marshall. Or run into a small group attempting Vanndar, using my bubble and death ray/stun their tank. I've wiped them a few times like this, to much dismay of my fellow alliance who were calling out for a "quick loss". I had a blast.
---
Not sure, we’ve been fortunate enough to have 6 other guilds agree to help us out with their elementium as we need 20. And thanks :)
---
Weekend warrior dad here: I've given up on WoW (retail and classic), long before the bots got there. I love the game and I always have fun playing, but I just... I've just been in this world for so long, and there's an infinite amount of other experiences I could be having, even just in the realm of gaming.
---
I just played Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice through the first boss and holy shit man, that thing is incredible. I'm so glad I'm not stuck raiding "generic-world-ending-boss-1487" in Retail or grinding harpies in Classic. I feel for you guys, though, so an upvote it is.
---
Do you want Skynet?  Because that’s how you get Skynet.
---
They only kill goblin boys.
---
More updoots
---
Full prebis is not required, but if you have people running around in quest greens, then that is definitely not helping you progress
---
Sorry but what's the advantage there when I'm trying to place my character at an exact range?
---
What addon or weakaura shows the instance resets? Gratz!

So you'd rather have 2 healers arguing about who heals the dungeon 8nstead of running the dungeon?

Jealous? You sound jealous. Why dont you be dead ass honest about your life for a second. If not with me then be honest with yourself. Take an introspective moment literally right now and contemplate all the things about your life that make you so bitter. Its literally dripping off your text. 
---
If youre so mad about people who have moved on with their lives and left world of warcraft behind, its probably because you cant. World of warcraft is in the way of everything you have the potential to achieve. Yet you probably played all day today and youll play all day tomorrow. You think about playing it even when you cant. I doubt you have a girlfriend and you probably have some sort of self loathing that wow is your self-perceived cure for. 
---
The problem is it isnt. Its a blackhole thats sucking your life away and turning you into the bitter tryhard that you are. So as cliche as this may sound, you really NEED to get a fuckin life. Everything youve typed so far has solidified that as the truth.

Im done with you and your negativity. Last response because im blocking you. I know my pride will make me continue to respond and quite frankly, youre a fuckstick and not worth any more of my time. ✌️
---
Somehow community is very toxic toward dps shamans 😀
---
Typically bots are banned in waves so it's harder for the bot creators to work out how they are detected.
---
For sure. I love our Horde population. Small but mighty.
---
Agreed. If you have to craft this thing solo fuck that
---
Join our guild.  Druid loot every week!  No one even needs it anymore.
---
How do you premade AV ...?
---
Yeah they are fucked, I'm just transmuting arcanite bars and stockpiling them for now. Some dudes cleaned the AH recently before transfering and the AH got fucked even further (black lotus were 33g~)
---
Well to be fair evolution doesn't happen in 1/2 a generation.  So just wait a a few centuries and see how we're doing with Classic wow then.
---
Then all you need is a geared warrior AI to spam overpower to beat the rogue, and then we will have come full circle
---
We can't change queue times, but at least allow us to join as group of 5 into AV,(nochanges?) so at least we can play with our guildies/friends and have more chance against ally premade. More drastic would be allow 40 people join AV.(changes)
---
Which one ? He has 3 channels, "Asmongold" in which he used to post guides for raids and achievements which he stopped using pretty much, "Zackrawrr" in which he posts his thoughts on topics coming from him as a person, not the asmongold persona he created ( I recommend this channel for some actual opinions on the game from a passionate fan that doesn't kiss ass or hate for views ), and "Asmongold TV" which contains stream clips.  
---
Any other channel isn't his, coordinated or supported by him. Just leeching money off the views.
---
&gt;	So doesn't really solve the issue IMO.
---
Not trying to sound like an asshole but your opinion here is pretty irrelevant. Blizzard has 20+ years of experience on how to deal with hackers &amp; bots. They have people specifically trained and educated for this. Your opinion on what seems best is pretty insignificant compared to what is tried and true. 
---
Yes, their games have bots but any game will. If there’s money to be made you can bet your ass that people will find a way. Even if it’s unethical, shitty or dumb.
---
Just run dungeons to gear up. SGC is a waste of time unless youre a no lifer. Focus on getting other easier items first.
---
I loved 10man premade WSG's back in the day.  Pre battlegroups you could get some epic drama and rivalries.
---
Now we have battlegroups, no one even does WSG for the honor because we also have shitty AV meta.
---
But it's all good.  I just saw this stuff develop and knew I couldn't compete with the honor grind at this point in my life.  So I said fuck bgs I'll just keep enjoying the other stuff!
---
I thought I'd hella miss the thing I spent the most time doing.  But it's oddly peaceful playing at a different pace and taking a different perspective.
---
Well not completly. Weaponskill is the counterpart of defense, so if a ememy wears +defense/or a priest with skilled inner armor u can miss with only 5%hit, with weaponskill its less likely
---
The biggest problem is that the warrior needs to know how to clump a separate pack together with the mages adds. They then need to not get bored and wait for resists/stragglers to pull off the mage. 
---
Ime, warriors generally do okay with the first part, but horribly with the second
---
I once queued arena with someone who proudly announced that he was a writer of scripts that would play the character for you, and that he was using one.
---
In the minds of these “programmers,” they think that what they’ve done in figuring out how to make the game play itself automatically is some sort of accomplishment. 
---
The depth of my rage towards this sub-human filth and the way it fucks with real players cannot be described with words.
---
Anywho. I don’t even really play this game anymore, just saw that this and felt like commenting.
---
The guy thought I would be impressed and would want to like buy his scripts or something. No respect for the integrity of the game whatsoever. No years spent building his own skill. Just a fuck up with a keyboard.
---
&gt; I mean, how hard it is to detect bots that move in literally the same exact pattern for hours?
---
I don't know, but will acknowledge it may be harder than it appears at first look.
---
I'm confident that I am an exception and not the rule, but when I farm a mat I tend to kill the relevant mobs repeatedly in exactly the same order and near exactly the same spot for several hours.  The only way you're going to be confident that I am not a bot is by sending me a /whisper.

---
You seem to know, so why whore yourself out for some easy karma in hate threads ?
---
If you don't have the dps to burn Ragnaros before he submerge Vael will not be a cakewalk
---
I agree that WSG in the right case can sometimes probably give more honor.
---
That being said in a premade you will make way more honor in AV than WSG.
---
8min AV vs 10min WSG while AV even gives more Honor.
---
That is not how it should be. But you are correct though.
---
And yeah I know this was just a big assumption with the AFK. Sry :P You took it well though m8 :D
---
I'm playing less and less because classic experience can't compete with TBC at all (for me).
---
I just feel super nostalgic for TBC whenever I log in
---
The only class that can speed a mages aoe farm relatively effectively is another mage. If you wanna carry your warrior buddy, go for it, most likely he will be getting more xp per hour than he can solo, but don't pretend that you're not carrying
---
&gt;I mean, AI are already way better than players because they have 1 frame reaction times and can plan out different courses of action in a fraction of a second. Two AI could play an entire game of chess against each other in literally 1 or 2 seconds. Playing vanilla PvP against each other would be significantly easier.
---
Perhaps might be possible for supercomputers to play a match out in 2 seconds with AI, but normal computers would need significant more time to figure out the most optimal move depending on how many moves the AI is set to calculate ahead (the more moves calculated ahead, the more CPU time the AI calculations will need and the time needed increases exponentially).

---
A lot of the good caster gear available now had very different stats in Vanilla up until patch 1.10.0.
---
Every caster item from BRD that's on pre-BiS lists now had awful stats until after AQ was already out.
---
What exactly are you talking about? What does he do that panders to the LCD?
---
likewise playing alliance and getting wrecked by 20 man horde groups all the time in open world pvp wasn't fun.
---
i didn't see any horde complaining when they had the advantage then?
---
guild hosted pug are ok
---
make sure you have to pre sign up for it otherwise it's gonna be a shit 4hr raid
---
....and name it Jeeroy Lenkins?
---
It's pretty chill if you got the gear to manage your mana. But, it can be stressful because it's your job to keep the group alive. Especially if your group isn't great. They may be leaning on you to carry them.  Tanks not holding aggro, dps standing in aoe, pets pulling mobs...stuff like that.
---
Premades are OK. Pulling Drek withour guards IS NOT OK
---
Which one of Shadowcraft Tunic and Cadaverous Armor is individually the best one for a combat/sword rogue? I will have the amazing 6 set bonus from SC regardless.
---
I asked him after the raid... He came as a pom Pyro pvp mage..
---
if you allow 40 man raid queues you're going to give the advantage to whoever is a member of the largest/best guild?
---
Yeah in a perfect world my friend. We’re still working on recruiting more. Got a few people leveling alts as we speak getting ready for P3
---
Have not tested, but many use it - if it works for you, go with it!
---
Other than the Druid crit aura, what's another buff for ranged dps casters?
---
I dropped mining for herb and have been doing lashers with herb for 2 weeks now, a lot easier then zf imo I’ve been making 50g an hour at least   And have gotten 3 epic drops so far one of them being the epic quest that sold for 500g that night
---
&gt; Ive personally witnessed the guild leader, Mousline, AFK botting BG's.
---
&gt; 
---
How are you so sure, that he is botting, and not just afk leaching like most other afk'ers while watching a movie or something?
---
It's only useful to level cooking. Not thAt cooking really gives you much. If you level it a couple skill points at a time it doesn't seem bad. If you go 1-300 at once you will have youraelf
---
If you  also take that into account then yes, you should definitely go for the Hauberk.  However, IMO you should probably still roll on the Chain if you're around when it drops.
---
RIP
---
and the bot wars begin
---
Im having a blast. And most people paying to play are too. Some of you legit sound miserable. Maybe it you all that need to quit, but stop projecting. 
---
Game is great and Im having a blast. Can't wait for the future phases and hopefully even TBC Classic.
---
Morgans vigil is a death trap that takes 3 to 4 deaths to finally escape.
---
Trash are the real time sink
---
That's a pretty nice set, especially if you also plan on starting up in MC. I'll have a look what the prices on the AH on my server are.
---
it is great. the echo chamber effect of whiners is so strong you wouldnt know it if you only read reddit and didnt play the game tho.
---
Depends. If you're the orc, about 1%. If your opponent is the orc, 99%
---
Which would be a problem why? Nearly 1.5 years for a museum project isnt that bad at all.
---
But that's what I have been wondering about OPs raid. My own is also fairly casual and PvP speccs + no consumables aren't uncommon but we still nuke rag before he submerges. Sure, there have been kills where he was 2sek away from doing so but its far from a hard DPS check with 1.12 itemization and talents. They even have 40 people. When I'm at 32+ I'm happy about attendance.
---
If I’m not wrong it was on one specific map and they could only play with the selected races.
---
So as with most things better at a specific task but if they changed map or race the AI wouldn’t be better.
---
^^
---
What's the problem with that? Vanilla wow took about 2 years to roll out, and then there were actual patches instead of just new content.
---
i have one on my warlock and can tell you it is affected by warlock +shadow dmg talents
---
it also procs off any offensive spell cast, as i have had it proc off curse of elements, shadow, and reck
---
My own girlfriend rolled and won the 40 something healing pants in BRD. I was a holy priest and she was a warlock.
---
They might do that but they aren't going to be ranking with that kind of terrible honor gain. They'll either stop because it is dumb or continue cause they are enjoying it.
---
Or rather, “be honest” means “say something I like or agree with or is funny”. It does not mean to say what’s on your mind or how you really feel.
---
It should be easier than that, unless they stealth nelf it
---
Post some logs
---
Having like 1.5 to 2hrs of raidtime per week (excluding travel) for half a year isnt all that great either. There is enough time to slow a tad down with the first challenging raids in AQ and Naxx. 
---
There really is no reason to keep the exact same timetable for 15year old content thats also running on an easier patch than back in the day.
---
It's literally the best AOE farming weapon for a mage I believe. 
---
The proc is nothing too impressive when shooting at a single target; decidedly better than any mage pre-bis weapon and worse than a mageblade. But in terms of spamming arcane explosion on a pack of mobs - oo la la.
---
I have 7/8 SC equipped and Cadaverous Armor in my bank. Since 8 set bonus isn't really something to cheer for I just thought it'd be better with Cadaverous Armor equipped instead of SC Tunic.
---
Yeah I think I got 330k first week of av. Maybe 100k now due to queues.
---
They have something like this in dota 2. There are a lot of vids on it if you search YT, fairly interesting.
---
Isnt retail in a content drought again anyways ? I’m not keeping up with the raid releases
---
Game gets a little less players 
---
„Is it dying?“ 
---
Nah no way 
---
Even if it’s kinda empty now it’ll be back up once they release next phase anyways
---
I’m one of the people you didn’t project. 3 sixties and I’m still having a blast. It’s just a game
---
That's a rumor some people spread. I've seen zero evidence of that and have never heard of anyone actually offer anything in the way of a convincing reason or evidence to think its the case.
---
Also the physical disconnect. You see how comment absolutely hateful things on Facebook with No anonymity.
---
Just imagine if your guild doesn't see any elementium ores for months... man that sure would suck.
---
The one with the button? That one isn't USB.
---
Let me just drop some of the $-80 in my checking account rq and I'll get on that.
---
true, the ideal 6set is without legs+gloves for devilsuar, but honestly it's so irrelevant, raid for a month and you will be throwing out the set you spend so long farming for.
---
Congrats are in order, that’s only double the baron mount drop chance. That’s dedication
---
Possibly Omnibar. There's a lot of good addons especially for pvp mentioned in this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4I9-hwhL4g
---
Haha enjoy it horde
---
Murderers have been around since the dawn of time. More murderers will just be born.
---
Guess we should stop caring about murder then, right?
---
Hearthstone CD? Queue in Og and go RFC. Leave a group to get porter to your hearthstone location
---
Found the botter
---
People were super toxic back then as well though. In the original DotA for example there was obviously no system in place to report you for being a piece of shit, so people were just that.
---
Yes
---
They do it in their queue time. It’s an addition not the only Honor farm
---
This is good news for all Horde. Getting a 10 min break between queues is welcome by most.
---
Really depends on the realm. My realm is so dead on alliance side you won’t find alliance to kill between queues :)
---
Definitely. It’s just for me wow has that strange ‘meta stress’ that tugs at me, I think partly due to the nature of the grind and the large amount of downtime (especially since the downtime isnt as engaging now that I’m not experiencing it as a 13-year old boy for the first  time).
---
I've been away from WoW for around 10 years. It's good to see people are complaining about the same old things.
---
 XD
---
That's just wrong. Lots of guilds are looking for dps warriors.
---
I'm hit-capped already. I had Devilsaur before SC. Good set indeed, but not as good as 6 set bonus from SC and all the Agi you get. Truestrike is only good if you're struggling to get hit-capped. Shadowpanther.net says 6 set SC gives the most DPS for a pre-raid BiS player. 
---
... and now I see that my original question is answered in there too, haha. MAEP for Cadaverous Armor is 42 and MAEP for SC Tunic is 26.
---
Making that work in RS is a lot simpler than WoW.
---
Whoa whoa whoa... whoa
---
C'mon now. No need to go around spreading anything crazy here.
---
We have two tanks with 2/2 bindings, our third tank with 1 and even an alt from an alt Raid with another 1. 
---
We were really blessed with bindings. Only 1 Mageblade though so far.
---
Looks like lezonta as a sun tbh
---
Elixir of greater agi and mongoose elixir stack as long as you drink the mongoose first
---
Nah man. Staring at those pixels has consistently been when my life is at its best. Fuck being "productive", I'm just trying to have a good time until it's my turn to die.
---
y r u mad
---
Even get extra slots in your backpack in Retail for using it.
---
So level an alt dude. I find endgame kinda boring too, so im just leveling and getting prebis on all classes. My friends dont understand why i keep playing a different char every day and never sticking to one, but for me this is fun.
---
I don't mind it. I just wish neither side had to fuss around with the que to do it. Would be nice if both sides could join AV as a raid group.
---
Cannot relate to this post at all.
---
I'm horde on DD, where alliance has a higher pop and I'm still not even a little mad about AV queue times. Gives me time to farm wintersbite between games and once AB is out I'll never run anything else. AV is only really worth playing for the rep. But I do love seeing how absolutely butt frustrated alliance still are about getting camped, it's a real incentive to get back out there and camp some pinkskins so I can come back here and drink their tears.
---
Pretty sure 42 is the minimum level to enter BRD
---
ESH.
---
Really, are you gonna use it? Gonna farm all your black lotuses and herbs and make groups to go into scholo each time you want to make flasks?
---
Having 300 skill doesn’t qualify you for a boe epic, but that’s beside the point at this point because they were dumb for rolling greed on a super expensive epic.
---
Same. Got 3 lvl 60s now :D all shit gear, but leveling is much more fun than farming gear / gold.
---
Obvious to the private sever community. I think most large private servers had more Horde than Alliance.
---
The signs were there but fully understanding the entire chain (Horde has better PvP racials+game is largely theorycrafted to death by now -&gt; Horde will be the majority faction -&gt; Alliance will be camped to no end in phase 2 &amp; Horde will get long queues in phase 3) before launch was a bit much for the average player IMO.
---
There are certainly machine learning AI bots, and some of them even have K/Ds in the high 20-30s. They're currently more than good enough to kill your average pker, but not good enough to kill a good one. Thankfully there's very few of them out there, and the people who have made such bots has said that they have no intention of selling it, they're simply doing it because they think it's fun and interesting.
---
Nothing wrong with a melee cleave, my group ran 2 healers 2 warriors 1 warlock and we cleared mc/ony week 1. Got 60 with 3 days 20 hours played.
---
In Vanilla I payed some gold to two Chinese mage gold farmers to level me while they farmed this. They did not speak any English, so we communicated via emotes only.
---
You dont need key for dm east and no special build needed: i use fn, fs, coc, ae. Even a fire specced mage can easily farm lashers and even satyrs with fn, fs, coc.
---
You don’t need to do a super crazy 2 pull to make this efficient. I do the bottom courtyard in one pull, then the top in one pull. Then do the cath in 2-3 pulls depending on the comp of my boost group. I used this method to level my rogue from like level 26-45 and easily made 900+ gold this way. I did free boosts but I reserved all loot for myself.
---
Might be late to the party but you are much better off leaving this guild for a better one. I had to do this many times whenever I felt my ambition exceeds what the guild offers/ wants. The officers and GM's were always understanding and I retained alot of friends from all of them. It just doesn't seem your guild really gives a shit to improve, otherwise we'd see your gm/ officers/ raid leaders coming in here asking for help, not you. Not improving further is fine and many players stop trying after a certain mark, but you have to be honest to yourself with what you want. Do you have fun atm? Then by all means, keep going in this guild and have fun. Do you wanna clear naxx? Then might as well leave now.
---
In straight up 1v1 one duel absolutely due to 2 blinds, 2 cold bloods etc.
---
Where the warrior will start to be a strong contender is in best of 5 duels.
---
The rogue needs to carefully plan ahead to not blow all cooldowns by duel 2, then losing the next 3.
---
Lucky for us we have 6 other guilds that haven’t got the bindings that are going to help us! But you’re right
---
Drain Soul doesn't discriminate.
---
Nice I will give this a go.
---
I started in tbc and you could buy all the gear with marks. 30 for most, 45 for the bracers. Still quicker than exalted.
---
You also bought 2k gold a few months back for 500$. Lol. Pretty pathetic behavior.
---
&gt;"For me, it makes way more sense to spend $500 buying 2,000 gold than spending a week farming it myself"
---
Weird one, usually premades would take that big of a queue. Maybe they had a lack of healers or something.
---
yeah definitely too many healers and tanks. ideally half of those should be dpsing most of these fights and only do the other role in the specific fight that requires it
---
I mean consider the fact that such a bot was successfully made in a game like dota. It's definitely possible to make a good enough bot to beat most players in PvP and especially PvE. I don't like botting, but I still think it would be cool to see a full team of self learning AI clear all the raids in classic.
---
actually wrong, that isnt how melee attack tables work
---
caster attack table yes, but not melee
---
hence the ability to crit cap easily w/ world buffs
---
look up attack tables
---
"a Pug had won it," don't be dumb, sheesh
---
Getting the top ranks on my server is 16-18 hrs of AV a day I think, Im not sure it has all that much to do with your class. From what I can tell none of them are doing WSG, so clear your schedule and cut your sleeping hours I guess. I don't know how many are botting, but a few R9-10ers recently got caught on my server.
---
In regards to winning, Im honestly not sure what an individual player can do to tip the chance of winning in their factions favour. I try defending after Bal myself. If there aren't any healers in a particular situation use ItemRack to pop on a full healing set.
---
There is nothing to like as a pve player. As somebody who played only tbc-wotlk classic is meh. I am just raid loging now hoping BWL is at least mildly fun.
---
Well maybe it is different in your region. In my bgs the last week the horde shows no interest in winning...they don't go for balinda, don't cap towers or graveyards. They simply def with 20-30 people.
---
People are going to enjoy it way more if they stop minmaxing. Not just wow, but life.
---
A true progressive
---
Thank Mr Wrecktangle
---
If you buy gold you’re part of the problem tbh
---
Your animations always make me happy!
---
How do you get essence of the firelord?
---
+1
---
The problem with AV or ranking in general now is that you not only have inter faction competition, but also intra faction competition.
---
While you are doing whatever you are doing to bargain more honor out of premade, there are small group of leechs just looking for solo/duo kills.
---
So you know what I do? Stop trying to win or get more honor, only get more honor than other people in the raid. Follow leechs around. Join fights only when you know you'll win, stay semi committed all the time and keep looking for small skirmishes.
---
Bargain honor out of leechs as well.
---
Ye I know it's a ridiculous amount of hours I've been doing 16-20 a day since AV launched. In world pvp I could compensate hours with efficiency but it seems now in AV the spriests on my server are pulling way more honor per hour than I am and I'm not sure how or why.
---
I switched from my healing gear to more spell damage stuff and playing more selfishly today, maybe my numbers will improve :)
---
Yeah, distracting mounted enemy players so that you can get a sap off is rogue 101.
---
Can you go into more detail as to why? In terms of tanking, I don't really see how the Anger Management/Tact Mastery and some dps boosts competes with ~17 points in prot. Sure you get easier WWs, mid-combat intercepts, and mocking blows during taunt CDs, but that's compared to extra rage from shield blocks, faster taunt CDs, and the massive threat boost from Defiance.
---
What is RS?
---
Hey shut up.
---
Did you win?
---
Again, if the group agrees to it so be it. But if not, then yes it's better to farm gold. 
---
Let's say we have a 300 defftank and mage alchemist.
---
The warrior alchemist will likely have no issues getting into groups while reserving the recipe. A healer, fairly likely too. 
---
The mage will only rarely get such a group with a loot agreement because DPS are a dime a dozen but can easily farm the gold and then buy it off the AH.
---
Lol have some empathy and admit that it’s tricky for people.  
---
It’s really not that hard.
---
Im confused as to why youd quit just from 1 weeks decay? Its only 20% of your current rank so either just take the one time hit of 20% and probably not even lose rank, or stack a tine of av and wsg tokens over the comming weeks and then 2 fays prior fill your mail box with as many tokens as possible, hsnd in the week you are away if you habe the 5min to do so to prevent decay and continue where you finished before holidays
---
the ones not pvping
---
I didn't even think of that.  I play a shaman so I get 5 hearths an hour.
---
Why though? Second place damage as shadow clicker :)
---
“Chase joy whenever you can”
---
This is probably much of the problem.
---
Responsibility is what gives life meaning. Chasing pleasure is like living on candy, you just feel empty, even when you get your fix. So to the people not enjoying it, what are you prioritising wow (short term joy) over that you know you should be doing instead?
---
Shadowmeld is actually super good, unironically. Other races have to vanish after oneshotting a clothie or low hp target. I just shadowmeld instantly after and wait for stealth cd (which is short af w/ 4-5/5 in Camouflage).
---
Yeees yees do that &gt;:]
---
Like 6-8 healers, even then having 13 is super overkill.
---
You sound really salty. Point on the doll where the bad orc touched you.
---
tbh I feel the same as a mage. I have 30+% crit on my scorch and sometimes I can go 5 mins without a single crit. Its sometimes so bad that I developed paranoia and im constantly checking details over a longer period of times gor my crit %. I cant put a finger on it, but it feels "off", like there are times where I think my +crit talents aren't working or I'm constantly re-equipping my armor in hopes its just a bug not counting all my crit gear.
---
I always wanted to do a thorough test, but didn't have the time. Since there are no test dummies in game to test it, I guess we have to use those servant of alistars in blasted lands.
---
I doubt you’ll get a solution. I doubt Blizzard cares.
---
I submitted a ticket the other day because a really difficult quest bugged out for me and the quest item didn’t drop and I was basically told by a gm Blizz didn’t have the resources to help me.
---
And if you were horde on alliance dominated server you were getting fucked then and youre getting fucked now just perma fucked
---
Is it worth learning dm n tribute runs asap or do I need to wait for a certain dps mark to make it worth it over Mara solos? Most hunters say they started it with much better gear than I did but is there some constraint here preventing a lesser geared hunter to do these?
---
It's exactly what's happening.
---
I think a lot of people in your guild don't know their preraid bis and bis lists. Getting a lot of the preraid bis and bis for warlocks is fairly quick since it just entails buying +of shadow wrath or felcloth items, felcloth gloves and Robe of winter night (if they don't want to get tailoring for Robe of the void).  Doing this will have the the following slots sorted: bracers, head, chest, shoulders, cloak, gloves, pants, boots. Trinkets are easy as well since you get 1 of them from the ony quest chain and another easy one from the book "harnessing shadows". 
---
I would say all this is fairly minimal effort, but even with that they should be pulling 300+ dmg on Golemag.
---
You are not going to hit R13. It’s not even worth trying if you are at R4 right now. You should be R9-10 by now.
---
I remember earlier this month after coming back to the game, I saw 2 bots in the Barrens. Both of them low levels, both of them hunters, both of them with similar names, gear, and pets. I figured it was just someone and their friend questing - except after some time I noticed they weren't questing, instead they were only killing certain mobs and skinning them. Then there would be a 1-10 second delay, then they'd target something else and start all over. I came back a few days later, saw them doing the same thing again. I had reported them the first time after trying to offer them free gold if they'd simply trade with me. (I left the trade window open with 5g in it to see if they'd take the bait, never did) I have no idea why they wait to do it in "waves" because it doesn't deter them at all, in fact it just gives them enough time to transfer all the gold off to another account. I don't know, just my two cents.
---
I found myself going back to OSRS. The past 2 weeks I've just been raidlogging and playing OSRS the rest of the time. WoW is simply not a fun game to play 10+ hrs a day for months. Gameplay isn't varied enough and you're always working towards a goal that won't matter eventually. Even in classic, the only "meaningful" grind that gives you rewards that lasts more than a couple of months is rank 12-14, everything else becomes more or less meaningless after a couple of months..
---
Gotta love the guy who went AFK by the fishing pond with zero KB's zero deaths, zero HK's and full honor.
---
There are ways around this though. Go has a massive search space and yet Go bots are able to beat the best humans.
---
Mostly these advanced game algorithms use neural networks, so we don't know exactly how they do it, but they are able to evaluate game states better than humans.
---
The main issue with wow classic is that it isn't turn based. And I don't know if you can make a bot that's both fast and good enough to beat a human.
---
*laughs in Alliance*
---
Adding to this, with 5 piece nightslayer and 2/2 in Dirty Deeds you can CS BS Gouge (same concept but way more damage) and then do whatever it is you re doing.
---
Specifically for the common death ray combo where you usually do this opener it makes it so you can ca bs gouge ray into either 4-5 cp kidney or 4-5 cp evisc.
---
On my server there are some horde wpvping outside the AV cave or spending their queue time farming fire elementals in arathi.
---
I still enjoy the shit out of this game, come fight me &gt;:[
---
If you re pve focused then human.
---
If you re pvp focused and dont care how you look dwarf/gnome.
---
If you re pvp focused and care about how you look then Nelf cause shadowmeld is actually great in pvp both for the active and passive.
---
Any priests with this dagger here? I gave up farming one, but some that have it are saying that it does in fact proc off Mind Vision. This seems to have some insanely broken implications, such as pulling mobs from across the dungeon, or griefing PVP.
---
You are laughing at him for being subbed to retail when clearly that's only so he can play classic and he likely doesn't even have retail installed. people can talk down on things they are subbed to. In fact it makes little sense for someone to talk down on something if they are NOT subbed to it. Why would they care or even know anything about it if not subbed? You insult my reading comprehension but it is your writing that is poor.
---
If only your dream girl could hear that. You aren’t something else than a toxic piece of shit.
---
Leveling to 60 was my favourite part hands down
---
Now I just enjoy raiding with friends and I do a bit of farm for gold so I can gamle it in drunken death rolls.
---
Completely agree. I find bots posting auctions below the vendor price some times to sell shit. Free gold for me! But really it fucking sucks to see "modern" classic. Honestly multiboxers too. They farm xp to sell accounts on market places... bane em all with fire! (Yeah too radical I know...)
---
Potato potahto.
---
Accomplishes the same shit, breaks the same rule. The difference is in technicality alone
---
What you’re looking for is an IG-11 model.
---
I’m so happy someone understood what I meant, everyone thought I was on drugs
---
You should try to punch it from underneat. Maybe it'll drop a mushroom so your gnome can finally grow up, or at least several gold coins.
---
I'm sorry, but having 340 as their top DPS isn't a decent amount.
---
Im not 100% sure how it all works but im in the same sorta situation i work away for 2 weeks at a time and last week i got my 15kills to give me a rank and i went from 10% through rank 6 down to 90% rank 5.
---
Aren't they BoP?
---
ooohh, interesting...
---
I formed a scholo run over 2 hours to get one last valor token for the mantle quest. I didn’t know you could get them outside the dungeon. I had 8/10 invaders before we started and 10/20 minions, obviously no corrupters. We did every boss, the basement, and even Vectus.  
---
I didn’t get it. I even asked if I could roll need on the last one. I should have but felt guilty as someone objected.  
---
I think we all know - that’s how luck works. Those of us that never get HOJ fail to mention how they won their tier 0 chest on the second run. Those who weren’t that lucky don’t mention that they locked up a 200g boe while questing. Some of us still haven’t found luck, but it will always come around and if it doesn’t balance out in classic wow, it probably will somewhere else down the line.  
---
By acknowledging this, we can work off of a rational base of thinking in order to not get too frustrated or upset over something that is out of our control. Being empathetic, listening to each other stories, and understanding how the game works is the best we can do.  
---
But to anyone seriously wondering - of course there isn’t any rigging or collusion against you. I always get a little chuckle when I read hyperbole like ‘I’m seriously starting to believe...’
---
I take pride in trying to push horde back, make them work for it. Still need 2.5k rep here so I'm close to exalted. Getting to exalted will actually make games more enjoyable for me because I can just play them without worrying about rep. I'm not in a hurry to reach my target R8 or R10 so all this maximizing honor gain doesn't affect me.
---
I'll join the initial Galv/Drek zerg. People usually start whining from the moment we get wiped at Galv or horde kills Balinda before we kill Galv. That's when I run to FW keep, talk to all the Wing Commanders on the way there (hope that 1 or 2 make it to the base). I ask people to loot corpses and hand in scraps/medals/crystals, they give decent rep when a few do it. 
---
When things are close to an end and the horde inevitably start killing marshals, I recall with a pack of snowballs. Get behind Vanndar and punt Vanndar into unsuspecting horde trying to pull the next marshal. It's great fun, like firing a rocket you have to aim well. If they are attempting Vanndar, I can still recall, use bubble and stun/death ray to try wipe their tank and cause mayhem. If I get lucky with death ray crit, I sometimes end up causing a full wipe. Then those who are just in it start flaming me for costing them a precious loss and the game goes on for another 5-10min before horde kills Vanndar. 
---
Then those same flamers come here and complain that AV is making them burn out and it's just a boring PvE experience.
---
Start actually doing the objectives and you'll have fun. If no one else helps you, make your own fun and do meme'y stuff for laughs.
---
When we were losing a game horribly, I snowballed a guy standing on the edge of a higher platform into a pack of horde below. He got obliterated. If that happened to me, I'd burst out in laughter but he didn't take it well and started calling me names. His loss, agzin I've had my fun.
---
Rank 7 with less then 100k/week... ROFL, never
---
Most premades also don't know you can reset warmasters by standing on a ledge to the left.
---
We found the horde player. I bet you are horde on Flamelash and still think that’s the two times they got ganked is what we are talking about.
---
The botting in WoD was so insane. I paid for a 1 month membership of honor buddy and was able to level all 11 classes for each faction to level cap within a month. 
---
I got a 6 month ban for it, but it was well worth it. A $10 bot subscription to cover $1,320 worth of character boosts was awesome.
---
Best part was? I was banned during the Hellfire Citadel raid. When I came back, it was still on Hellfire Citadel. Like I didn't miss a thing.
---
Sadly that's what reddit is usually, a place where you go pick arguments :(
---
I left and came back at Christmas, as far as I can see there is no alliance left on dreadmist-EU, maybe it was just because of holidays tho, or nobody is in the 50 range anymore, feralas seems empty
---
Also itd be mlre than 40, you keep the 40 in your bags then grind hard 2 days before reset and fill your mail box woth as many as you possibly can, wait for reset and hand those in. Could easily savr up over 100+ tokens
---
honestly, and not even trying to be offensive, but that seems like a guild full of keyboard turners and clickers mate. get out of there.
---
If you guys wanna find back the joy of pvp,  wait for AB and make 39 twinks
---
We have a few issues, but none are insurmountable.  Auto shot turning off if a mob breaks our minimum distance is a big one for me.  We don't have a convenient way to scale as the expansion progresses like other classes.  Itemization is dogshit while leveling.  Etc.
---
There is much more to it than coded entertainment.  That coded entertainment is built upon hundreds of years of capitalism pushed inventions and r&amp;d dollars.  From the invention of the microprocessor all the way to the imagination of the writer - coding the game was one of the easiest steps.
---
Also, just for comparison sakes - name one movie and or video game created outside of capitalism.  And before you do, you likely should get the definition of capitalism so you don’t say something like “tencent made x game” as an example.
---
Because the map is imbalanced as fuck in horde's favor. They have such an easy time defending base with a tony handful of people. Alliance cannot do the same. After zerging fails, they cannot attack and defend at the same time the way horde can.
---
What you're seeing is not some quasi behavioral alliance-only mentality. What you're seeing is a Hard result of a map imbalance and an entire faction playing out exactly how the map dictates.
---
You see the same shit on every independent region from EU to NA to OCE and there's a reason for that.
---
You’re a orc. Use axes.
---
Yup. Someone in guild chat today mentioned that they had done 10 anger runs today and won HOJ only on the third time they saw it out of the ten.  
---
I couldn’t help mentioning in g chat - damn, is that unlucky?... or really lucky? Or both? :D
---
Ahhhh, me n my boy used to spend hours on there not really knowing what we were looking at, arguing about stronger looking waifus.
---
You have a pretty good grasp of it. If you wanted rank 10 your best bet would be to just casually grind for the next 4 weeks only constantly hitting bracket 6 or 7, take a hit for your one week vacation, and then go HAM when you get back. You could possibly get rank 10 in these 4 weeks but you’d need bracket 12-14 each week to pull it off; possibly even 13-14.
---
It takes about 220-260 wins to get exalted (including all the marks you hand in). The bracers are fantastic for warriors if you werent too sure.
---
Well that’s 1/100 people so there are likely many others in your predicament. Solidarity!
---
You reminded me of this bot that used to always farm in Deadwind Pass back in original vanilla WoW on my PVE server...I'd flag up for pvp and stand on whatever mob he was fighting, and eventually he'd target and attack me which of course flagged him up. I'd grief him for quite a while till eventually the guy running the bot would take over and start spamming emotes at me lol.
---
Yes I understand this frustration.
---
What I do while in queue is either watch some netflix (with background sound on in wow so I can hear the queue pop) or travel to a nearby grind hub (winterspring, azshara)
---
We horde are simply better at PVP, you guys won 1 day of AV, then we figured it out and we barely loose now :)
---
The logic is that is what was allowed in AV for almost the entire game's lifespan.
---
Then why you play it LOOOOOOL, some people are so fuckin miserable jeez :D :D :D
---
Actually you want cadaverous imo
---
The community keeps moving the goalpost. Oh MC was easy, but BWL was hard... BWL was easy but AQ was hard... etc.
---
No raid will offer any sort of challenge for the average WoW player, including Naxx. If TBC comes around, you'll see T4 getting cleared with level 68-69 players within 4 days of release. Pugs by the second week.
---
I think it's because i am danish, so my phone-keyboard wants to make a lot of the words danish and think some of the words like Will is names insted of words. So it can be quite frustrating to type manually. Sorry for the bad spelling.
---
Did you check the comment i wrote in reply to the other guy who replied to me? I think i explained it pretty well.
---
What stabah said. Really easy once you get the hang of it. Watch some videos on YouTube for reference.
---
The question is: how do you win against mages as most of the classes/specs? As a paladin myself, horde seems made up of at least 30% UD mages every single AV game. They have such an overpowered amount of AoE damage/control and almost no drawbacks. 
---
I feel like most AV games are dictated by how many smart mages a team has. 
---
On topic: they have an answer to pretty much anything. Sure, you can follow them for a while with BoF without being slowed but you have no way to connect with them. Stuns are blinked out of, so save your HoJ for after blink. Repentence is usually Ice Blocked. You can get lucky and catch them with grenades and then hope for a few juicy SoC/melee crits when you do connect, but overall the matchup is way too one sided. This is usually when I give up and smash a rogue/warrior's face in to retaliate. Find happiness in the little things.
---
Because whining is so much easier
---
Can a warrior 2 man this with a healer? With pre raid bis
---
Warrior heavily counters rogue
---
That's why they brought it back in line with vanilla... You realize they are correcting a change so that it is closer to "no changes"
---
What?
---
Low key love how I don’t have to invoke print statements as a function with python 2. But you’re right...
---
I am a C# dev these days anyway.
---
Its new thats why you didn't know
---
I just play it casual now, family and work now. Can't get more than 1-2 hour a day, having super fun since I know there is no need to stress about gear
---
To be fair, basically everyone who followed Classic since its announcement and that of the Phases knew what would happen with P2. And what did most people do? Ignore it and start complaining when the Phase launched, blaming Blizzard for their ignorance.
---
It's like walking towards a cliff, seeing the warning signs and choosing to ignore them just to fall the cliff down in the end and blaming everyone else but not yourself.
---
Maybe it was 15 ppl from 2 different premades?
---
If you’re a rogue or tank, you should roll need in it if you want to use it. If you want to sell it, you should roll greed. Greed has the coin icon next to it. That’s means you want to convert it into money for your own gain. That’s what being greedy is.
---
Stop being so communist. We live in a capitalist society.
---
Add timer when dropping queue ,already fixed wsg anyway
---
love me some salt mining with snowballs
---
I am on a horde favoured server and it took me 30 mins to get to BRD during P2. BRM always had 10-30 organized alliance players camping both entrances and the chain.
---
This alliance v. horde cry fest is getting super old. P2 sucked for everyone who simply wanted to lvl or do dungeons.
---
There are more than enough people who love min-maxing. Instead of telling people what they should like why not just let them do what they want. I thought that was one of the main appeals of Classic?
---
And? I'd love to hear how an AI warrior consistently beats a mage 8-9+ times out of 10. You're not really understanding that AI can't magically overcome the inherent rock/paper/scissors nature of classic pvp. There are counters which, at equal gear and equal skill, you simply will not consistently win and no amount of AI play will change it. They won't have infinite ways to break poly, they won't have infinite ways to remove slow, the same tactics a human uses as a mage to beat a warrior will work to beat AI.
---
As an alchemist, I can tell you that there are many more reasons to pursuing my profession and acquiring recipes than making money. Let me know if you’d care for me to elaborate, I wanted to simply make the point.
---
Lol, yes they do
---
That's pretty sick
---
??
---
I'd be interested to know too. It probably wouldn't proc on a pve player though. I guess it would be abusable in low level pvp zones like redridge, where players may have 500 health on average and could be easily griefed. But 10% procrate is not that amazing, I don't think it'd really have a use in pvp.
---
In dungeons though ? Could have insane uses.
---
I am not sure if the witch hunt rule applies to WoW charakters
---
I have raided with a pug for the last 5 or so weeks, cleared MC and Ony easily every week. Depends on the pug though, disc and assignments make it nice and smooth.
---
My guild's MT does them on his fairly badly geared hunter alt so pre-raid BiS should be absolutely fine. It's a steep learning curve though or so I am told.
---
how do you know this
---
Demonic Rune
---
Alliance declining them and just keep seeking new ones is problem for both sides.They either get a unfair advantage of full premade in AV or leave their own faction to start 7vs40 and just get stomped on.
---
11
---
That is some tough logic there.   
---
Rocking two green dags abd alcors drops? I don’t need it though, because if I did, I’d have already shelled out 600g to buy it!  
---
It’s not so black and white.
---
It won't have a damage use in PVP, but popping rogues out of stealth or maybe putting people in combat seems pretty broken.
---
On a next level, imagine a party of priests spamming it.
---
810g, but yes, someone else can buy you the mount with a discount and trade it to you.
---
Don’t give up, a lot of people going on vacation around this time, a lot of people will get decay.
---
Just get back on the horse and keep on grinding
---
Sure, if my main role were heals and I'd let em know beforehand.
---
Yeah because of the effort of your own team while you sit back like a parasite
---
Gear is pretty irrelevant in this fight as you will mainly use serpent sting and arcane shot rank 1 (to keep him on leash) to bring it down.
---
Just keep your aspect of cheetah on all time and dont go within 30yd range. 
---
Start with frost trap an pop a swiftness potion / use concussive shot up the hill where he is faster than you. I also highly recomment restorative potion of he manages to curse you. In this case just drink resto pot and slow him to get out of range.
---
Hardest part is getting him to the road where you can also run into some mobs. You could have a friend to help you hold their aggro or just clear them yourself before you start the fight.
---
Best of luck.
---
You can use it while sheeped as a non mana user? Guess I will have to start carrying a couple around then. Thanks for the tip.
---
Poisons I’ll assume
---
Like Pewdiepie, right? I'd hate it if he became a big creator when all he does is literally look at memes and record it
---
Realm transfers were in Vanilla, Faction transfers were not.
---
Like I said before: banwaves dont make sense with wow bots. The point of banwaves is that the hacker get less information about how their bot got detected. In wow, a large amount of bots is found and reported by players. This doesn't help hackers. You can always detect a bot in wow due to lack of communication. It's just a lazy solution by blizzard. They could use personal to manual check and ban botters that have surpassed the report threshold.
---
AI is completely different to bots. There is no real "intelligence" to bots, they are pre-programmed with instructions and do not do any thinking as such.
---
I don't think those are actual premades, there's just so few Russian servers that it always looks like a premade (since they only end up with each other)
---
It's not exactly what you ask, but i can recommend the NugRunning addon to track your own debuffs (including multiple targets).
---
:D Thank you! I had to redo that scene a few times to try to get the weight right, so I'm glad you liked it!
---
I didn't say that anyone got warned. The second paragraph is a metaphor.
---
Anyway, this sub in general is or was stupidly crazy about PvP. I remember getting downvoted simply for stating that I did not want to play on a PvP server because I didn't want to get ganked or camped. I saw replies in the form of "PvE = carebear", or that "you miss half of the game if you don't PvP" are straight up hateful messages. Who would bother telling anyone about the shitfest it is gonna be  during P2 if you are just met with pure disdain?
---
Baron mount has a drop rate of one in five thousand or 0.02%. Not sure what the official figure is for this one, but 500~ runs does not seem like double the drop rate. I am aware that single drops cannot be used to gauge the overall drop rate though.
---
The more content that came out the worse the game got. I'm glad I came back and leveled again with a full pop server but I'm done.
---
Ofc it's a shadow priest. The coolest of dudes.
---
Not if it is with randoms.
---
I made this post from a ret paladin PoV, which is my alt I'm currently playing more than my main warlock. I PvE on my warlock so I don't have enough experience 1v1ing mages on him but from what I've read, yes warlocks counter mages.
---
Yes cause thats what made him Big and thats all He does and have ever done. He has never made Big creative and funny peojects that were the things that had the most amount of views on his channel
---
It happens when ally try to premade but not everyone get a queue pop. Then it’s only that poor solo guy who accepts the queue and.... picture explains the rest...
---
The BG will shutdown in 3 min unless it’s more then 10 players on each side tho
---
Uh, yeah.  So am I lol
---
You do know that asmon does other things than just sit there and stream YouTube, yeah?
---
You weren't using ML or neural networks though back then, you were using bots that relied on pre-programmed instructions and didn't really do any decision making of their own. 
---
The way you have written your post implies that you think these methods were being used for your free RS bot, they most definitely were not.
---
idk if people are being intentionally daft or something? The bots can't ruin the economy in retail because there's no economy to ruin. That's all he _and_ everyone "correcting" him is saying.
---
Should not do that, since it is not a magic effect.
---
* 11 hours of BGs + afk
---
* beats
---
* 10 hours of BGs + ganking
---
I know which one I prefer.
---
This pvp stuff costed me 75€. Transferred all my allies to pve server like a coword. Don't regret it for a minute
---
Use gap closer consumables and items like this guy suggests. Against a mage who knows what he's doing will not be enough still, as he can just poly and reset the fight or get away, but at least u will live. That being said, best chances are to catch them in hoj when he has no blink. So I'd recommend to use hoj only when blink is on cd.
---
Well I didn't spend all my living time on this sub before, literally saw it same day it came out, picked a server. Yes the players did it, they were the toxic one
---
I almost feel bad for the horde because my first thought reading this was “why would anyone need it”
---
r/boneappletea for sure
---
Reminds me of the farmers in Lineage 2. They'd be a dwarf girl farming the same area for days, and if you came near, they'd say "give adens." If you attacked their mobs, they'd say "you go," "rang rang," "hit you," and eventually try to PK your ass.
---
Some do that. Most don't.
---
So basically, the only option is to fear em before they reach me?
---
No offense but this sounds like some fantasy made up by someone who hasn't actually played a random dungeon in a long time. You'd have to be very lucky to be matched up with a full group of people from your realm in the first place, and even then _nobody ever talks_ in a random dungeon. I try it every now and then just for laughs at how stupidly anti-social that game has become, and literally 9/10 times people don't even say hi back.
---
Why would you even pug when there are soooo many discord AV premade channels out there? 
---
Pugs are simply horde dominated because they dont braindead zerg, and then cry about losing.
---
You get in a premade and destroy horde all day long in a good premade group, even without gear.
---
If you are more active in searching for sollutions instead of whining on reddit, you would not have these problems... jezus this read was depressing.
---
Never seen that happen. It always fills up with poor alliance players who queue AV as intended and get thrown into a lost game.
---
They have “paranoia” which detects stealth. Can’t remember what level you train it, but it helps.
---
Felhunter has paranoia. Basically improved stealth detection
---
Jesus, you are boring
---
I think its more about this. 
---
How many people become road-raging assholes just because they got half an inch of glass seperating them and the next person?
---
Its literally a 3 min walk from southshore in a nearly straight line or a 2 min onetime death run from cwc in wp.
---
Yep, I did the same. Now we have to log pictures on our computer, instead of the actual items on a character.
---
Honestly, I doubted whether this game provided the fun it once did when battlegrounds were released. I feared that premades were going to ruin the casual fun of battlegrounds and after a few hours of wsg it was just as I expected. Some matches we (horde) didn't manage a SINGLE honourable kill. Simply because the Alliance were all premade, probably on discord screaming out when it looked like they might've been caught out and healers to the rescue. Although part of the #nochanges crowd, today's gamers have the tools and mindset to suck the fun out of everything that something needs to be done. That is, having a separate queue for groups larger than 5, and perhaps a leaderboard. That would solve the premade problem AND essentially add content for premades as it would give them something to play for.
---
In the meantime, I created an alt and taking it really slowly this time. Leveling my professions (mining and blacksmithing) and using as much of my smithed items as possible. I wander around storm wind doing errands, tidying up my inventory and selling goods on the AH, all in an extremely inefficient manner. Yet, this is the way the game was meant to be played and not playing with my friends is a completely different and positive experience. Nobody rushing me, or breathing down my neck with what I should or shouldn't be doing. I haven't even looked at what I should be spending my talent points on, I'm just putting them on what I believe fits my character fantasy. And I legit have more fun on this level 22 paladin than on my 60 warrior. Idk. Low level content is more satisfying at this stage, the current phase is pretty garbage for a lot of classes.
---
Like, as a warrior, my only upgrades left are either an extremely low drop rate (savage glad chest), cost a lot money (lion heart) or have very high competition and it's a complete grind to get. Which is fine, however a good few of those upgrades will be replaced in the coming phases. Bgs, in their current state with premades, is miserable as a warrior. I don't actually mind the coin toss of who has a better pug - that's always been part of WoW. But premades WILL kill this game. It's like back in MoP when they merged Russian servers and people were complaining about Russian premades ruining the experience. It's exactly the same, but times 10.
---
There is no earlier version where it wasn't.
---
I don't play lock myself, but I'd imagine either Succubus seduce to stop them or force pvp trinket, or you could trinket out of stun -&gt; death coil -&gt; fear + DoT + kite or pewpew.
---
A large portion of ore comes from goblins that surround Vael. The catch is, they start running away as soon as you enter the room, so you need to be very quick to catch them.
---
Yeah, fair. As paladin relying on class abilities alone to win vs a mage is not enough.
---
I've been saying exactly this as soon as I saw every single player in Arathi was a Chinese bot. It's fucking disgusting and will kill this game when all the real players realize they can't compete with the bots destroying every avenue of the game.
---
Yeh what do you need it for with zg?
---
So a billion dollar company fixing one bug every 2 weeks is proof that they "care"? Wew lad.
---
Or randomize queue times by like 30 seconds (internally delay every queue request randomly by 0-30 seconds). Not long enough to be inconvenient,  but enough to prohibit this group queue bullshit.
---
Grest video. A mage duo in my server does this and they bring low lvls withthem to boost charging 20g per run each. Would of liked to see what gear you wearing.
---
Gear would be a major issue. My nature gear would be pointless, I wouldn’t own a single piece of plate, they’d have swap our tier pieces. 
---
It’s fun to think about, just never going to happen.
---
why would they do something so ridiculously stupid?
---
So far the wpvp in retail feels a lot more enjoyable than in classic :)
---
When your favorite all-in-one-guide shuts down your own thinking so much that you start copying weird beliefs written there. 
---
Also, just in case you didn't consider it by yourself yet, not following guides 1:1 makes content less dull as you actually involve your own brain.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/originalmermer/clip/CarelessFaintPonyWoofer
---
This is why you PvP with them.
---
Are kane ite
---
Procs on non-damaging debuffs too. IDK about sheep, but definitely procs for priest silence and mind vision (!).
---
Fascinating. Its rare to eat dinner after 18:00 here in Scandinavia, but people often eat a last, small meal in the evening.
---
Dead server though
---
Okay so I was farming honor today and I restarted my computer and when I logged back in and I was missing about 9k honor. I know honor goes missing for some people but does it come back?
---
Limited Invulnerability Potion. Rogue won’t be able to do a damn thing while you have that.
---
Also poison resistance potions are really helpful. 
---
No clue on any tips as a warlock, but I know these are key potions to use vs a rogue as a caster.
---
That dagger dropped on our first maura run, but the disenchanter got it because none of us can read. We all thought it triggered on melee hit, like most of those mods do.
---
This is something I tried explaining to my friend, he got into WoW Classic after never playing any MMOs and really enjoyed leveling / gearing up in dungeons. He was all about the BiS lists and being efficient. 
---
He got into raiding - cleared MC twice and then quit because he realised loot wasn't going to come as fast as he hoped for. The thing that sucks is I couldn't even get him to stay as a casual - if he had of come to the last few MC raids, he'd be dripping gear because everyone has a lot of the stuff in there now.
---
Also i'm a Warrior Tank and he's a Priest Healer so I miss him even more.
---
Gaming isn’t any more a waste of time than watching television or reading a book is. Atleast you’re being social under most circumstances.
---
I used to care, but as long as you're in a good guild and don't have to be concerned about clearing content, I really don't give a shit. There's a small handful of iconic items I'd like to get but for the most part it's whatever.
---
Guess it matters that I'm playing a healer and don't need to concern myself with min-maxing DPS.
---
What are the main offence engineering made weapons used in pvp? Grenades etc?
---
BWL + MC + ONY takes about 4 hours. Less than 2 for better guilds. And you're pretty much going to run them until Naxx.
---
Gold probably?
---
Nope, there's still a tonne of horde between Thorium Point and BRM at all times since horde queues are so long.
---
They are tradeble 
---
First discount is 10% at honored
---
And 10% for print pvp tank 3
---
Source: guildy bought my epic mount for my alt because he was rank 3
---
Horde was likely better, but it's not like P2 was fun on Horde side if you were going somewhere on your own. Every dungeon I did was at least two corpse runs, solo farming or leveling was equally impossible. P2 was a shit show all around, just worse for alliance.
---
so since you are two people its basically 25 - 75g/h?
---
That's a new one to me. The plot thickens!
---
played 3 games today, all three had fewer than 20 alliance 6 minutes in.
---
I doubt that for tbc tbh. I played then and while the pro guilds did clear everything fast a lot of casuals were stuck in progression raids all over the place. Entirely different than mc.
---
If you want to pvp, enhancement shaman is very fun, less kit, so you actually have to be good on timing of totems and knowledgeable of cooldowns. Also....you get to 1 shot everything nearly.
---
Hey now I drink and raid responsibly
---
3 friends group up as a team, you have 2 randoms. The amount of times I saw people get vote-kicked over seriously petty shit was ridiculous.
---
I'm not against the system (in Wrath and beyond) but it definitely had its own issues.
---
Now imagine how annoyed you'll be after clearing Razorgore, when some moron walks into Vael's room while you're ressing/dealing with loot.
---
Gz btw, we've not got a set yet, 3 tanks with one binding (the downside of running 4 raids a week).
---
Ahh yes...just do something about it! The answer was right in front of us all the time!! How did we not see this?
---
Do freaking happy I got the choice to do just that. Mograinne was cancer p2 but now its quite good! Anything like that again and my ass is out!😁
---
Nothing was done apart from releasing 2 BGs way earlier than planned you mean?
---
You can't mind vision a rogue if you can't see him. Mind vision would be insane otherwise.
---
Putting people in combat could be useful, but at a 10% procrate you'd have a better chance by just attacking your opponent directly.
---
A party of priests using it to kill someone slowly at any range does sound fun though. Sadly I don't think many people have the blade. The droprate is so low most people won't ever get it even if they try.
---
I'd love to have a proper group queue, it's an mmo after all, organized play should be possible and rewarded. Just add it for both sides then.
---
My wife got it while farming Princess for gold. Yes, it does proc off debuffs like silence or mind vision
---
I understand the sentiment and i'm sure those mages appreciate it. I generally will only tip more than 1g if they come to me, like if they teleport themselves to UC to tip me to org or vice versa. otherwise I still feel at 1g i'm still giving them a reasonable "tip" for what amounts to a 20 silver in mats and a few seconds of their time.
---
I just dinged 60 on my warrior yesterday. I've played warlock, druid, rogue and warrior. And warrior was the only one I hit 60 on and still play.
---
He will get bashed instead, interrupts spellcast but no knockbacn.
---
If it was on cast chance to proc wouldn't you assume every lasher would get hit? So that would actually be even better
---
You can use it before they use stealth and it lets you see them, then you can re-cast it as much as you want (unless they vanish). It's pretty handy for tracking their movement, and if they get in range you can SW:P them immediately.
---
I have never had a problem doing this as a tank. You may think its rude but if i'm running a dungeon specifically to get a piece of gear or help my friends, I'm going to do everything I can to make it as efficient as possible.
---
Its no skin off my back bringing a Mage, Lock, Priest to Strath when my friend needs to get the Black Baron Cape.. inviting those players just means I have a 50/50 chance of running til it drops again, and if I didn't cherry pick the groups it could repeat itself all over.
---
I played LBRS as main warrior tank last night and the priest healer was swearing at me telling me what do to the entire way. Getting so angry if there were "mistakes" and any wipe literally blew his fuse.
---
It made my experience A LOT less fun but I handled by relentlessly thanking him for his advice and call him the leadership etc. 
---
Players like that really need to stop playing they surely cannot be enjoying the game if they're that rude. 
---
I hung on in there because I didn't want to screw the other three people in the group.
---
Is ZG croc farming the best option as a mage (gold/hr) once phase 4 is released?
---
And is the point of ZG croc farming to farm bijous and sell them on AH? That's the information I've been able to gather thus far, but I would love to hear it from someone who has actively farmed it.
---
Classic example of moving the goal post.
---
Unless the bashed and interrupt are ranged spells, he won’t, as long as he stands in the dead zone (kind of like the hunters dead zone)
---
Death Coil. During those 3 seconds they’re running, place a Curse of Agony, and Corruption on them, maybe even Fear if you can get away with it (a lot of people have the trinket that takes Fear off). Use your hearthstone when a chunk of your health is gone. The benefit of mingling with the Voidwalker is that you can sacrifice them and take advantage of the 2k shield it gives you. I haven’t really ever lost to a rogue 1v1. 
---
Soul stones will help you have the last laugh as well.
---
Farming any trash solo with aoe
---
If the tank didn't state that he's rolling on DPS gear, yeah, the shaman has every right to be mad about it.
---
It's 100% ARK-uh-nite. But you do you brother.
---
Racials way better suited to PvP for example
---
It’s going to come down to the pet. A felhunter can help you see them coming; a succubus can CC them. Either way you need distance, either by movement or by fear. Get those dots up and try to squeeze in soul fire anywhere you can, be it while they are seduced or running slowly toward you with CoEx. Rogues are simply a tough matchup for locks, and will continue to be into TBC (and then they’re worse than they are now).
---
Blizzard slows better (when specced) than coc and has a longer range. With melee leway coc kiting is far more dangerous and with clear casting procs blizzard can be more Mana efficient also. Yes you deal more DPS with coc ae but you are also a hell of a lot more likely to die
---
Whats the que time for horde nowadays?
---
Grenades are mostly used for CC, especially considering most people opt for iron grenades over thorium due to much cheaper price.
---
Goblin sapper charges are the main damage tool, a dozen people using them simultaneously can wipe out an entire raid. In 1v1 situations, gnomish death ray is very good on some classes like rogues that have reliable CC and need that extra burst.
---
Locks might seem easy (and in some aspects they really are) but I would argue the skill cap is highest on this class. The sheer amount of dominance you can exert in each scenario (except pure dps in raids) by having the right tools and know-how to (especially in pvp) is insane. The subtleties are just so great.
---
Tl;dr you can be bad as a lock and do good. A good lock drops a steaming shit on most people in outdoors content
---
Well, AV is so skewed when it comes to balance that every single rush game ends with an Alliance victory. If you don't defend as Horde, you lose 100% (really, every single one!) of games. That's what we got the first few days after BG release. But then, queue times were reasonably quick for Horde too, so they didn't mind too much.
---
When queue times increased, Horde quickly realized that they had to actually win every now and then to make decent rep and honor gain per time played, so they started defending. It's the only way horde actually wins, ever. It used to be 10-15 people stalling Alliance when it was still random vs random. Now with premades making up half the games, Horde is getting increasingly tired of 7 minute rush losses and defends with more and more to the point where offense is non-existent. The shitty alliance premades (I assume without voice, experience and real lead, about half of them) often break apart when their brainless head-into-wall push fails, so Horde can actually play a proper game of AV after that. That's the reason Horde now defends with 25+. It's the only way we get to play a game at all. And when we finally get a random alliance, it's hard to break the habit.
---
And then read all the "warlocks are so OP OMG" whine
---
Bloodvine
---
Just like reddit?
---
Doesn't matter, you're saying it wrong.
---
Two people playing 12 hours/day each is not botting. Bots weren't very prevalent in vanilla in my experience. Got worst after TBC with bots farming elementals
---
Dude dota has been around since like 2004
---
Dota is older than WoW mate.
---
It is more mana efficient, yes. It is safer, yes. But is it faster, no. Which is all that matters.
---
It's not a rare drop. They will always be able to get at least a few each raid.
---
The person you are responding to referred to the original Dota, the mod for Warcraft 3 that was released 16 years ago. You are referring to Dota 2 released by Valve.
---
Hi, Warlock here.
---
I wrote some pet macros (Devour Magic) and wanted to replace my macro with the normal skill in the pet panel. Then I noticed that I can't place a Macro Shortcut into the Pet Panel of the coresponding pet.
---
Is there a way to put a pet specific macro into the pet panel?
---
You lie!
---
In a way, that’s only 1 away from 100! Just gotta tweak that luck a bit
---
could have been a BG Invite tho
---
Just this morning, 4/6 games were premades with 15+ R9+ players from the same server, all of them we lost within 10 minutes. The other two were the alliance left-overs who wouldn't make it into a premade with their 60% mounts, crappy gear and no idea how to play, and we won almost clean games twice, just took about twice as long. 
---
It's just not fun game play. Your hourly honor gain depends largely on how lucky you are when drawing your opponents, and balanced fun back-and-forth games don't exist.
---
Just throwing this out there: Could I have bought a swift tiger on my elf and proceeded to trade it to my gnome and use it there? Apologies if I'm hijacking your thread :3
---
So stomping PUGs in premades is what alliance calls 'real PvP' nowadays?
---
You are clearly just being a contrarian at this point, intent on just causing conflict. If you want to pronounce it incorrectly, go for it.
---
auto attack and pray for rng wow such fun.
---
If you want to play a lottery game then go do that.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9030/restorative-potion
---
Is a lot cheaper...
---
It's really a shame because this is a legit gripe that kills the game for everyone except the honor grinders. A 40vs10 isn't fun for anyone. Alliance have no shot, and horde are wasting 20 minutes a queue for a boring game.
---
Yea it's this way because blizzard failed to implement the proper version of AV. Playing this retail AV in classic causes this shitshow...well I'm almost exalted so I won't bother anymore.
---
....dude, I was joking with you. Don't take it too seriously.
---
Tink tink
---
Oh, I had no idea that you can actually use them while sheeped. I guess I can use Demonic runes for something other than to occasionally kill myself to avoid repair cost on my warrior alt.
---
Its the same as how you typed it out. Just typed in a better way. 
---
R-Can-night
---
I've reported several bots &amp; players selling gold, I don't expect anything to happen with this.
---
There were about 500 posts every single day about how terrible wpvp was for alliance and pretty much everyone agreed.
---
wha
---
You know what, you're right. I shoulda paid some Chinese guy to do it for me.
---
This is the way to play. My guild loves to raid together, so we do. But we're not min maxers who hate the game because we feel we have to play a certain way. We have a boomkin, a shadow priest, and a handful of enhancement shaman. Is it optimal? No. But we have a great time every raid.
---
As others have said, Pure pugs can be rough. But if you look for guild hosted pugs they're usually better. These are the guilds that have a solid 20-25 people and just need bodies to help fill the ranks, they can usually still down 8/10 relatively quickly and will usually do domo/rag a 2nd night with the pugs that came the first night getting prio into the raid, at least in my experience.
---
I'm sure a lot of players smash as Lock, what I mean is it actually takes quite a bit of practice and Locks aren't an auto-win class contrary to popular belief.
---
Yes, if you sit back and DoT/fear people in a BG while no one is focusing you it can feel powerful but that changes quickly with a melee on you.
---
&gt; This is called privilege. Assuming everyone has access to a doctor or therapist or the time to visit one.
---
What else is he supposed to do?  That's what you do if you're depressed, you have to see a doctor or therapist. There are ways to cheaply see a doctor.  If he's really using WoW as a timesink like he himself says, then he should have enough free time to see a doctor at some point.  Nobody is so poor and destitute that they can't make it to the doctor, ever.
---
&gt; It's also ridiculous for you to tell someone how to live their life.
---
He suggested he see a doctor for his illness, what are you even on about?  We shouldn't tell people to see doctors now if they're sick because that's telling someone how to live their life?  Are you constantly in a state of being offended at stuff 24/7 or what?
---
Are you implying you're skilled? Because there's simply no way to measure skill in Classic.
---
Thanks, will start that then. I honestly love learning new methods for things, it will be a great way to break the monotony of av grind
---
Step it up blizzard this is fucked up

If it's shallow enough that you won't swim in it, you'll obviously take fall damage.

If it's deep enough to swim, you won't.
---
Additional tip: hold both mouse buttons down (as if you were running forward) and aim for the water if you have water walking, or are in group with a Shaman that might buff you mid fall.

I was discussing this very issue with a Guildie last Saturday. I'd had a day of reasonably quick wins or losses (10-20 min wins by and large and quitting matches that weren't going to end and taking a 15 mins break) and he was laughing at me saying he'd had it way better with a good few games where they'd really gotten into it and grinded out some great honour.
---
On Sunday he found out that while he had over 3x HKs than I, he had made 75% of the Honour. Only thing longer games are good for is handing in for Rep and even then you'll be all done with that by minute 25-30 at the latest. Useless for Honour. The Math isn't that hard like, if you end the BG and 400 Allies have been killed, while they had maybe 30 active players then likely even before the halfway point of that BG people were killing allies for no reward at all. Not exactly efficient.
---
I enjoy classic, but only the raiding part which I knew I would stay for also. :)
---
If only rogues had an ability to completely wipe all threat
---
You misunderstand the patch. Dropping target is different than stealth being broken due to a batched attack and being *retargeted*. Before the hotfix, some vanishes didn't drop target at all, as in, even in the next batch you would be attacked and taken out of stealth because the mob never stopped spotting you, similar to how corehounds, wolves, and bloodhounds will keep attacking you after a vanish.
---
Bosses have a 5% crit suppression.
---
If you don't care about all the AH stuff, you can get an addon like [Better Vendor Price](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/better-vendor-price). It shows you the vendor price per item, the vendor price per current stack size and the vendor price per full stack.
---
Ahh okay good point.
---
There's a sci-fi book about this. War becomes so complex when we reach spacewar, that we create gigantic ai(also sentient) controlled spaceships. After the war ends there are some ethics discussion about what to do with these spaceships.

Dunno the name.
---
Has anyone done this with a swastika?
---
No one consented to be born. You don't give a damn about me or my depression so quit trying to pretend you do. 
---
&gt; Are you constantly in a state of being offended at stuff 24/7 or what
---
That's a pretty telling statement from you buddy. 
---
Keep on living in denial about the pointlessness of your life if you want. The only thing stopping a lot of people from suicide is because they actually care about the people they would be leaving behind. Otherwise, suicide is an option people should be allowed to explore. And you saying they are just "sick" is fucking ridiculous. 
---
Life isn't all happy and smiles. It's a lot of pain and stresses and you literally have no idea what someone has gone thru in their life. If they want to die it won't affect you at all. You are trying to shame someone that is already depressed and guilt them into going into financial debt because YOU disagree with their assessment of their life. 
---
Go fuck yourself you ridiculous cunt. Let people chose to live OR NOT LIVE their own life if they want. You have no connections to that person and he most definitely didn't ask for you help.

I am playing rogue and currently rank 5 without ever experiencing cheapshot or kidney resisted on, say, mage / druid or another rogue. I must be supa lucky or just dumb, there's a chance of that too
---
Av mount requires exalted, no ranks required although you need rank 3 for the discount, if you don’t mind paying full don’t worry about rank, it’s super easy to get exalted with Av and looks really nice too
---
If they had no restraints. Bots would pick micro heavy heroes and just stomp the shit out of everyone.
---
I'm a functioning and contributing member of society that cultivated a marketable skill set, and can now live comfortably off of my years of hard work and dedication to my profession. He's a whiny neck beard that shouts about big dick energy to mindless legions of fan boys like yourself. All while encased in a fortress of filth and rotten garbage. If you really think I just get off insulting him your delusional. We're in a sub about WoW not asmongold, I didn't seek him out just came across this thread like everyone else. Go back to throwing money at him in the hopes he'll watch the youtube video sent.
---
Nah one resisted coc while that close with melee leway and an unlucky daze isn't about being bad that is death and happens to the best mages. Shit happens. In zg when farming Crocs in the future it can be an even bigger issue as they can nearly one shot you 2 hits and you're dead
---
If you like strategy games, Total War Warhammer 2 is an amazing game that will make 8 hours feel like 20 minutes and thats not an exaggeration. I play it when im burnt out on WoW.
---
My internet cut out for a moment while I was in champ select on LoL. When I loadiled back in, we were still there, but someone ended up dodging. I got five 20 minute waits because the AI thought I dipped.... it's bullshit to let AI decide things like this and the punishments are way too steep. "Ah yes, let us annoy the people that want to play our game and punish them for things out of their control. That'll make them want to play more!"
---
Barrens to 30?  Nah lol.  The minimum level for all the quests is 17 other than the last 4 which are 20, 22, 25 and 29.  You'll be leaving the Barrens between 18-21 at most unless you really want to take several days /played to grind mobs from 21-30.  The level range of quests in Duskwood is much more practical for leveling to 30+ with, and it's right below a starting zone and right next door to 2 level 10-20 zones.  The Barrens is also not as large as Westfall, Duskwood, Redridge, Wetlands, and Darkshore combined, not even close.  Just that trio of Westfall, Duskwood, and Redridge are larger.  Go look at the in-game maps.  Not to mention large chunks of the Barrens are (surprise!)  BARREN mountains with no purpose other than to increase your travel time from one area to another drastically.
---
Oh, and what do you know? Alliance ALSO have an uncontested level 30 major leveling zone that just so happens to contain some of the best AoE grinding areas from the upper 20s to mid-30s and is in very close proximity to a capitol city.  But you're just gonna gloss over that I guess because it doesn't fit your narrative.
---
No, we don't have constant rooftop campers in ours, we have constant rogues ganking anyone who steps foot in the main quest hub who also just go kill all the quest-givers in the other quest hub when they can't find enough victims.  Failing that, we have priests MC griefing causing durability damage - something you don't suffer from by being killed in PvP.
---
I also played horde and alliance in vanilla so you can't fool me with your false claims.
---
If you haven't played hunter before, then I suggest just making one and getting a feel for it yourself. The class is great, but has a lot of bugs that has been fixed (most were fixed before BC and wrath).
---
The biggest issues for me atm:
---
- feign death delay / bugging out (just not dropping combat in pvp).
---
-pet ai is horrendously slow and require you to spam commands.
---
-traps can be walked through without being triggered, as well as the arm time that was not there in vanilla is present from BC (delay before trap is put out on the ground, delay for trap to activate) making it borderline impossible to trap someone without using scatter shot or a stun of sorts.
---
- scatter shot sharing DR with trap, magic dust, rocket helm, wyvern sting for some reason. (This was not the case for the majority of vanilla, and was removed with BC pre-patch)
---
Also, melee leeway is a mechanic that is designed to counter hunters in particular, we gain 0 ranged benefits for it, yet casters get bigger aoe radius, melees can hit us from the other side of a trap.
---
HoJ was hunter bis in P1, jokes on you.
---
Warrior with ravager farming low lvl instances here. 
---
Currently have it with the "lifesteal" enchant which can proc on multiple targets at once when ravager spins. However, want to do it with crusader enchant this time. Anyone know if it's worth it?
---
FAP.
---
Or its been confirmed it isn't a bot, and your all just wrong.  Players reported that frequently get checked into.
---
Probably your servers discord is better for this
---
&gt; caster attack table yes,
---
no
---
You're better off looking at your chosen server discord.
---
&gt;Got not guaranteed leveling times I can play.
---
Highly doubt this would make you an appealing leveling buddy.
---
It's common to reserve 1 orb each run. Reserving more than 1 is quite greedy and may not be a good idea since Strat living isn't exactly hot spot for loot which could lead to being invited in less groups. The only classes that want to run strat live for "loot" (Star of Mystaria) all the time are mages and warlocks.
---
Mage or lock
---
Blizz didn't do jack shit against bots in Vanilla. They didn't do jack shit when all bgs were flooded with Honorbuddy bots during Cata. I'd love for them to act, but they have a long history of letting people exploit with impunity.
---
Dota openai was nuts. They learned many tricks while only interacting with other versions of the AI. Some things players started copying(mango ferring mid is one).
---
R-ca-night is how I say it, I don’t pronounce the N twice
---
Yeah that's Kronos server I guess that's how they did it /shrug
---
Bullshit. When I did Rank13 I still had to play 24/7 and I was on a super small realm.
---
You can buy every epic mount with rank3 that isnt a rank 11(?) mount.
---
Rank 3 gives you a discount, not a permission.
---
Loosen up a lil sir
---
Takes a while to do. Remain calm through the process. You can use pre-BiS gear to finish it.
---
Just be patient. You don't need anything other than mana potions and shadow protection potion (for silithus).
---
Its the discount genius - What makes you even think this is about the rank 11 mounts or the AV mount? Educate yourself pls
---
I think you care too much about the game man. Maybe take a break, play other games etc. Botting is annoying but it’s nothing to get overly dramatic about.
---
I always said it as Are-can-nite personally.
---
You telling me that it's not even Transformers that are going to take us down ... that it's the fucking Gobots!?!
---
never think like that about your dps especially in trash heavy dungeon as ubrs
---
One scholo run drops 2 to 6 normally. And u can farm the souldbound ones in felwood and make some money off felcloth that drops too.
---
Well I was just trying to answer your question about what mount. I thought by rank 3 you meant Exhaulted. The trading thing was new to me though. I know for sure once you’re revered with your regular city, (I’m an orc so Ogrimmar) I got a discount at revered and I CAN trade those. Was just trying to be helpful in some way
---
You do realize there is anti boting software and bans everyone day right? There is no such thing as a "ban wave" just blizzard finding out how a popular bot works and then a bunch of people get banned all at the same time because they updated thier anti cheat software.... Long story short if there is a ton of bots its because blizz doesn't have the ability to detect the bots at this very momentum.
---
Playing dominant faction deal with it :&gt;
---
Golemagg is a great test of dps.  What I am seeing is that your meters are very top heavy.  We clear MC in ~2 hours and none of our DPS does more than 40k total damage because there isn't enough time.  Our DPS meters are a lot more even.
---
See this parse to see for yourself.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/yhm1CQ8TpWrHNJBw#fight=60&amp;type=damage-done
---
Well it all depends on your personal situation. Is crusader going to be free or can you spare the gold for it without worrying or hindering yourself down the line? Yes? Go for it.
---
But you will be changing that axe eventually and it might not be a great idea spending gold on an end game enchant, if that makes sense. What's the opportunity cost here?
---
I believe you will be able to get it proc multiple times, same as lifesteal, but the buff wont stack- just refresh itself.
---
I wouldn't do it
---
Haha exactly my man lol

Go dammit, another clueless horde. Alliance rankers never leave AV because they have instant queue. While horde rankers have 30min queue so they spend that time ganking lv 55s alliance that are out in the world.
---
&gt;When you get either one of the Binding
---
It's not both? For some reason I thought you needed both to start the quest. Never played a melee class so never rly thought about it
---
If you’re not in a party, you tag and friend kills you should earn 100% of the loot and xp.
---
Once you hit around the 55/56 mark dungeons should be fine
---
Yah but it's probably good etiquette to follow. No one wants to hear a ninja cry post that could be made up if it's has no proof
---
I feel like people that are miserable are obsessed with getting the best best “thing” in the game. Some item that will give them a dopamine release. If you aren’t finding joy in playing the game for the world and the people in it, then you should move on.
---
When this all first came out were people like hella confused as to what to do with the bindings?
---
Totally agree with this post. Oddly this time round I was really looking forward to being a fishing merchant and trying to make some gold off that. I accepted that there would be some bots lowering the prices, but now the market is totally decimated. Other than the top 3 or 4 fish, everything is only worth vendor price on my server.....which has totally ruined one of the aspects of the game I was wanting to get involved in.
---
You forgot the part where the op told him beforehand that’s it’s not for his class tho :)
---
Pet is named like some existing npc and addon is bugging reporting it as civilian ?
---
That's a gross generalization. On my server A outnumbers H by 3:1.
---
I never ganked anyone because i chose a fucking pve server.
---
Didn't count?
---
He can rush you through the entire game and you’ll still get exp, but it won’t be as fast as you may expect from other games (or retail) so you two will probably get bored before you reach even 30. Convince your guy to make an alt your level and do things as they were intended to be done. That 60 can still farm and earn money for the progress of both characters.
---
It's a mineral, not an element. Had to be said, for science.
---
Sorry let me clarify. Under the character tab for daily honor I had farmed around 50k honor today. Then I restarted and as soon as I checked my character tab again it said 41k honor. I know this is incorrect because I watched my honor gains all day up till that point.
---
man, your reading comprehension is dogshit. He’s implying super casual players that don’t understand pvp minutia well can still farm a shit ton of honor in phase 2.5 due to av
---
Or getting a job.
---
People were stuck in MC progression when TBC came out, and it is tremendously easy.
---
TBC will likely have a similar thing going on.
---
How does botting even work in WoW and why is it not being punished? 
---
Is there just some program that will take your character through complex patterns? I didnt even think that was possible
---
The biggest weakness of rogues is group pvp. Try to stick with your allies in BGs and make sure to fear rogues and other melee who are trying to attack your backline.
---
what does "trying" to rank even mean? just going for r14?
---
i'm doing fine being among the top 30 standing on my server without ganking in between which would be even more effective on my server considering its 75% alliance.
---
just want my r11 and be done.
---
&gt; 409,315

You can't just multiply sub count for 15, there are countries where the subscription is way cheaper. I pay around 4 US dollars for my monthly subscription for example.
---
What does this have anything to do with the WSG fix on horde side?
---
Thank you I corrected it... FOR SCIENCE!!!
---
no... you can only affect your life to a certain degree... but mostly its about chance, random encounters and decisions other people make for you
---
More like 2002/3.
---
&gt;plunder and pillage
---
I like your attitude, the RP is strong, and much more funny then the usual ganking and griefing
---
Idk what that is but Blizzard support used to have a GM on your server respond to you within the hour back in vanilla. Like they would spawn in wherever you reported a bot and just watch with you. Have a small chat and do the deed. It was one of my favorite things about Blizzard support. 
---
I have multiple memories of this happening in Silithus and Feralas with the fire and earth eles. Haven’t had any positive interactions with Blizzard the past 5 or so years so not sure if it’s changed or I’ve gotten a bit bitter as I’ve aged
---
i've done a TON of AVs. i got exalted in the first 3 days, really 2.5. i play a lot of AV is what i'm saying. and i've never, not once, had a game go over 52 minutes. my longest was 51, and that was once. i've had a few mid-40 min games but not a ton. most are either 9-12 minutes or 20-35. 
---
regardless, a hour long av isn't even that bad of a "thing" for horde honor/rep wise. 
---
&gt; They’d rather take their chances getting the bonus honor and potentially winning the game quick 
---
there is literally no "winning the game quick" for horde. alli will always be quicker. unless the alli team is utterly beyond inept, even a terrible random alli team will beat a horde team in a "win race" 99% of the time. 
---
&gt; over forcing a defensive turtle game. 
---
this isn't a bad thing for Horde for both honor and rep

Have tanked UBRS on my Warlock spamming Hellfire
---
SL/void and ~2800 armor
---
Oh wow, I didn't know that. That makes it far less severe. 2500 pts. is not THAT bad. :) Thanks
---
It would be awesome if we can get bc and wotlk back some day. But there should be option to play what ever exp u like. Maybe transfer all ur classic characters to bc to continue journey but left classic as it is if u don't want to play bc or u just want to finish all the content before.
---
Yeah usually you pick very wide open areas amd make tight way-points so it never gets stuck.
---
How? I know I can clean my dots with ice block twice, but it seems free for a warlock to reapply them, and I still have to deal with a pet demon. I can only win if the warlock is dumb enough to stay close to me himself.
---
That means every swing is hs queued though
---
Yeah I can't wait to hop back on myironman. Was new to wow when I played classic. It's an awesome game, but osrs is my MMO of choice.
---
Ironman btw.
---
you have a great team. lovely damage man!
---
Nova cc bolt with shatter should kill the demon. Cs locks cast while you do this, block the dots. Reset fight with poly and melt him.
---
Typically everyone would roll need on boe epics or expensive recipes like gfpp regardless of actual need.
---
Haha, I came to WoW from Runescape back in the day so I always thought it was weird how little punishment you received for dying
---
Same as the Pokémon but with a t
---
I am almost always the party leader and i tell everyone when a high value item drops to press need. Unless its something gear related a party member will wear obv and they will need to equipt it.
---
In this case a recipe is rolled need by all regardless of proffs as its 180g+ depending on server. Makes it fair for all.
---
Exactly what he said, people keep saying the next raid past whatever raid is going to be a challenge, but the issue is, the content was water ages ago, people know every bit of the fights. And even if you are coming from retail and never played vanilla or TBC or whatever, despite all the problems modern wow has, the raids are many orders of magnitude more difficult and complex so any of these older raids will seem simplistic. There will always be a subset of players who struggle with content, but the vast majority will never see much challenge in classic.
---
Funny how fast they fix this but do nothing about some significant botting issues.
---
Hours? Oh sweet summer child you need a few weeks of playing daily if you want the good rank10 blues, months if you want the epics.
---
EU Horde here. I am currently on 28 game AV winstreak... We deff all the time and then win 25+ minutes in. I dont know what that dude is talking about lol.
---
The nice thing about the internet is that in a situation like this you can just throw them on ignore and get a new LBRS group. Don’t subject yourself to 12 year old ragegasms over a video game. You know you weren’t being an asshole and that’s all that matters.
---
Level the 60s and slowly prepare for tbc.
---
Se my comment. 
---
But in your example you would decay 2500 RP since:
---
Earnings = 0, the adjustment will be negative and therefore cut in half. But it is still larger than 2500 so it will be reduced to that. 
---
So you would stay rank 9 with 35000 RP.
---
Looks like the right job for OpenAI: https://openai.com
---
They already made bots which can stand up to pro players in Dota2, it might be worth sending them a mail since this would be for a cool cause.
---
Bro delete this
---
Yes you can trade mounts as long as you have not used it. You can use the exalted rep of a guild member for a discount.
---
I wouldn’t know and probably would just roll need if I just checked quickly what it was used for
---
Will try, thanks.
---
Interesting. Havent seen that one before
---
There will always be one mad person when they lose a high valued item. Not I’m the wrong that’s just how wow works.
---
Blizz is definitely not the same blizz 15 years ago
---
i'd love to listen in on one of your raids or see it. do you have any vods? you seem like a great raid leader. must be fun in your group!I really appreciate you taking the time to write all this down. it's great information for us. 
---
I will definitely check out that 30 minute skip! That's huge!
---
GFPP is mandatory? even for ranged dps casters? I thought the regular pots for ranged was okay. Do you have any suggestions for submerge? we can't kill rag fast enough at the moment and im wondering what we need to do for the sons of flame.
---
What if those bots turn on us!, we need to make a guild that hunts bots.
---
4k honor 8-9 min loss &gt; 5k honor 25-40 min win.
---
bad troll, keep trying
---
I remember it being hard, but I was 16 and using Thottbot, with no gear lists or stat weights other than the hit cap.
---
When was the last time you played a BC raid? I’d be a bit suspicious if classic is this easy and the last time you played was forever ago.
---
In TBC the furthest I got was mid SSC.
---
You'll have that in a warcraft 3 mod
---
Wasteful Anthropology 
---
**I want to know also**
---
Not sure what server you're on or faction. If you happen to be on Kromcrush horde shoot me a DM and I can help out with buffing/clearing the area.
---
Nobody gonna notice he has more killing blows than kills itself?!
---
Just Google "BRD Pickpocket".  You'll find better videos than some random person on the internet, no offence to /u/AvgBro.
---
Yeah, sounds like a bait at this point.
---
Depending on your realm it might be accurate. On mine they are 15-20ish now, a month or so in they were ~100. Very low drop rate cosmetic pets.
---
I agree with you. But this is a game where people grind Timbermaw rep for a green healing offhand. Where people solo Princess 750+ times for a purple dagger, and pretty much every DPS warrior somehow has SGC
---
I mean, 550/5 lock outs an hour.
---
Why would you ever bring a prot warrior to a DME jump run when you’re expected to also be the dps??
---
Soul Link warlock is the [best dueler](https://cdl.gg/tournament/season-1-regular/) in the game, not a mage
---
\^ this
---
3 - druid and priest afaik
---
Oh man, that post dissolved fast! It’s no wonder blizzard hates us, we’re all just toxic whining babies.
---
professional bots don't look at the game client, they look at the data the client is receiving and actually can play the game in a very simple way. for example they don't look at where the character is at and what direction it is facing, but at the raw data that the client is also getting that information from.   
---
if the data says you are at 5/5 and there's a mob at 6/5, the bot knows how to run south and engage it.
---
You'd think they could afford to have 1 gm in 5 servers just watching trade chat and banning gold advertising bots.
---
I would say no as a form of fast leveling.
---
But you can 100% aoe grind once u are higher levels when ur targets are undead because of the speed u can kill them and the talent points u get for reflecting damage back by then. Think cemeteries of undead in wpl.
---
I do run dme  thrasher runs solo farming gold on my pally which currently is the fastest way to make gold for me other than orb res strat runs.
---
Oh, but why bother AOE farming faster with the blade? You can AOE farm slower without it! Hell, you can also kill mobs one by one and it'll be even safer and slower! No difference at all!
---
Thats one of the downsides of Fury prot unfortunately. Most i've seen will swap to sword and board for AOE pulls and keep DW for single/double pulls. I imagine aoe tanking in dungeons as fury prot wouldn't be ton different from deep prot except for dumping your intitial charge rage and waiting until after you swap to defensive stance to pop blood rage.
---
I imagine you would do something like prepull pop berserker rage, swap to battle and charge, use demo shout/sunder to drop your rage then swap to defensive stance and do your bloodrage into sunder/bloodthirst/HS rotation.
---
This is purely my theorycrafted opening though as i've never tanked a dungeon as fury prot, i've mostly stuck to deep prot. I'd like to see some input from someone who actually does fury prot tank dungeons though as i've heard its much harder to keep threat than deep prot is on big packs.
---
&gt;For a lot of us, bots serve to bring the prices of trade goods dow
---
You actually have no way of knowing if that's the effect the bots have. If someone bots a limited resource for their own use only, this would drive the price up, not down.
---
Yes! I am leveling a paladin that way atm, and its going great. I couldnt find a good guide so I’m figuring it out as i go along. PM me if you have any specific questions.
---
Mate, you're delusional. Go read a book and you can see all the ways people use the word. Notice how I told you to Google steal and not stole? 
---
Checking post history is the easiest thing in the world. Especially when the post was made a day apart. I know you're dense but there's no way you have the iq of a used tampon and the mental acuity of internet explorer
---
100 bars.....i’m not really impressed with bindings, that’s just pure luck, i’m really impressed with all these mats cuz that’s some serious time investment and dedication, those cost 5000+ gold on my server, as a poor warrior it will take me forever to get all those mats
---
If you can get a thorns buff it’s kinda cool.
---
Ret aura, consecrate, thorns, shield spike, makes for a lot of small numbers popping up. 
---
You’ll need to swap to concentration aura to heal yourself to avoid pushback.  
---
Spec holy/prot.  You’ll need Spiritual Focus and Redoubt.  I personally went deep into holy to get Divine Favor because once every 2 min it acts as a free Lay on Hands.
---
The thing is it takes a lot of time to make sure you only catch the botters.    People act like catching them is something trivial but it is not that easy.   Catching just the botters and not getting other people in the banwaves is absurdly difficult these days.   There is a reason why every major MMO does waves like they do them and don't do them any more often.   The fact is that they are already doing the best they can.   
---
Personal reports are honestly worthless as your only medium because they are way to easy to abuse.   Hence why pretty much no game uses reports as a method for banning.    I used to GM back in the day for everquest and have known people who have done it in games more recently and the fact is you get multiple false reports for every legitimate one.   It was to the point where it wasted way too much time to investigate hence the modern automated system that doesn't do shit.   
---
Were people not idiots and report for stupid things constantly a report system might work, but honestly they don't really work do to people abusing the systems.  This guy was farming and beat me to a node so I will /report him for botting is all to common and literally more common than a legitimate report for someone botting.  Then they get all their guildies to report the person as well so you can't even rely on volume.    All they are useful is to flag the system to do a log check to see if it is a bot, but bots get better and better to the point where they are almost indistinguishable from players now which means you typically have to log known bots you find for what amounts to months to figure out what they all do that players don't that way you can ban them.  Even once you do that typically the bots will be fixed in a few days so you will have to spend months relogging new bots to figure them out so you can detect them.
---
They don't ban in waves they find a way to detect a popular bot then a bunch of people using that bot get banned.  All a "ban wave" is blizzard patched thier anti cheat software
---
I feel like it's only applicable if you've played before and are expecting to get something in an "exchange" for doing a dungeon. Our time is short,  and people care about their time especially when they know what to do with BiS, add-ons, and honor. That goes for every older game as well.
---
Raid composition includes spec
---
I’m a mage so I can really only speak to that but since all we do is spam frost bolts it’s heavily influenced by gear and RNG.  That being said, look at total number of frost bolts cast during boss fights to measure performance. 
---
There’s no reason someone should be in MC as Pom/pyro. It’s not too much to simply ask everyone be properly spec’d and to grab 10-25g in elixirs
---
If you’re warriors aren’t tanking they should be FULL dps spec. All of our top damage comes from warriors (literally 1250 DPS on a 30 second Shazz fight)
---
So I would really focus first and foremost on proper spec for everyone participating, you’re simply not geared enough to sacrifice performance that is entirely by choice
---
 nochanges
---
Some with all of the above ;)
---
Why on earth do you bring 6 druids... i cant even... so hots dont stack thus most guilds only bring one druid to MOTW and hot the tank... you need more raid heals i.e shaman. Absolutely ridiculous to only have 2. Tremor totem in every grp. WF totem all melee and tranquil air ranged. If you want to progress go to 11 healers and remove at least 4 druids for shaman.
---
Should have put that in your title. Same thing happened to the last guy who posted the 900k picture. My theory is that this actually is you guys. And your low-key slum bragging.
---
On Grobbulus there is a troll, multiple trolls, that path from the bank, mailbox, AH with their guild name as a gold website advertisement. Its an auto bot path. I report it everyday, and everyday hes still there. Or has a new character doing the same thing.
---
HELLO HOLY PALADINS. would any of you be able to show me a screenshot with your keybinds/ui setup? looking for ways to improve mine as it feels a little clunky, especially the keybinds
---
thats now unraveling as horde ques have reached 30mins. Rogues are back at menethil and city ganking for honor grinding
---
Not an option at early+mid levels. Once you get access to Seal of Wisdom and enough talent points for both consecration and BoSanctuary, you can start trying.
---
Consecration is decent AOE damage, but fairly heavy on mana. When you get Seal of Wisdom, that helps immensely on mana.
---
Retribution aura + Blessing of Sanctuary + Holy Shield is pretty good reflective damage.
---
Caster mobs and ranged mobs are troublesome.
---
So ... at level 41ish, you've got the kit and you need to find spots full of melee mobs (preferably "green level" mobs).
---
From there on, it gets better at better - and at 60, you can use AOE to grind gold several places (including instances - stockades and SM in particular).
---
&gt;Nobody who starts with and only does the same reaction content Will take over YouTube.
---
RayWilliamJhonson with " =3 " did just that, and he was good doing it.
---
I botted back then and had contacts with a middle man to Chinese farmers where I would sell gold and accounts to them (or we'd have a deal where I level a char to 60, then give it to them, they farm gold and I get a cut for supplying the account). Just being in the scene I was super aware of the complaints on the forums about bots and what not. Especially around banwaves people would rejoice q: 
---
They were definitely a thing back then but maybe less people were aware of how they functioned and couldn't point it out where today it's really obvious compared to your average player.
---
No, you don’t know anyone who has gotten banned from being afk in bg’s.
---
Lol this is so untrue, they patch the anti cheat software to detect new bots asap.
---
It's jus tone of those pets that follow you around and do nothing. Prices will vary from 15-45g. They're not an easy sell though, not a lot of people want them, but they are rare. 25-30g could definitely be a reasonable price.
---
&gt;especially when you can write it off as a business expense.  
---
I'm pretty sure if someone actually tried that, they'd be denied at first and would have to take the IRS to court over it. In which case there'd be a publicly documented case of this. Which there isn't.
---
Do you really believe some tight-ass IRS bureaucrat would look at a business expense called "World of Warcraft video game account subscription" and allow it without precedent?
---
So you played on two servers that were horde heavy? You didn't see how it was for horse on Heartseeker. It was exactly like playing ally on stalagg...  People are delusional on this sub.  Hurr Durr horde bad!  It's all about which faction outnumbers the other.
---
Please, seek help. I have been in your position. You won’t internalise this message now, but hopefully this helps you to do it in the future.
---
My warrior needs allots of food
---
It is. If you check my post history, I made one a week or so ago about a bot I broke so many times it was fighting unnarmed. Post was removed because I didn't hide it's name. Bot is still there btw.
---
As an alch I’d be pissed if someone got mad because I needed on a flask recipe. So much greed on this subreddit. I bet half the people here don’t actually need on everything.
---
It was definitely a step up from Classic in general difficulty, but now that everyone is aware of the theorycrafting world, and have had a ton more xpacs worth of difficulty ratcheting up for the hardest content, it will feel like a joke to today’s raiders, especially the Mythic ones.
---
The elementium? What?
---
layering wasn't in vanilla
---
&gt; What if that is simply a self deprecating joke?
---
Could be, but from the rest of his replies I doubt it.
---
&gt; Also, what do you care about judging people on the internet whether they are taking care of themselves properly or not.
---
I don't, I wasn't judging anyone based on how they're taking care of themselves.  I was responding to Steemwitness seemingly getting upset that somebody suggested a depressed guy should see a doctor.  That seems perfectly normal to me and not something to get upset over.
---
Were you able to find the name of the sound files for the Ram footsteps? Having a hard time finding them.
---
How can I remove [this](https://i.imgur.com/t8SIHgg.jpg) part of the UI? can't find the option for it
---
They have 20+ years of experience yet their game is still plagued with bots. Yet from what I heard, one of the private servers, run on donations only by some norwegian living in his basement had 0 botting whatsoever because you'd get banned instantly. Not sure what that says about the effectiveness of Blizzard's anti-botting measures, but doesn't seem great.
---
When did u stop reading the post?
---
"Don't worry blizzard will ban in waves".
---
This means fuckall if the ban waves are only every 6 months, because that means the bots have half a year to run rampant and fuck up the economy and the honor rankings.
---
Oh wow. Please think before being aggressive like that. And read again.
---
I said "source of most problems addressed by OP", not "what I am saying addresses the problems mentioned by OP". Do you even understand the difference?
---
Ok, so what part of my original comment was wrong? Sounds a lot like you're agreeing with me here.
---
We?
---
I like farming gold, but botting makes my efforts much less meaningful. I'd rather have an economy supported by exclusively goldfarmers rather than goldfarmers and bots.
---
Every spot on Azhara on my server has a 50 ish hunter on it...
---
Yeah, it's your leisure time spent doing something you enjoy. i don't understand what you were trying to say with that :/
---
The real wisdom.
---
Where is he now?
---
actually grinding mobs non stop is the most efficient leveling route for mages.   
---
the fact that they're \*not\* outleveling him  makes it dubious they actually are bots.
---
Sounds like you need to see a doctor too buddy, I hope you get the help you so clearly need!
---
Hold the phone. How the hell are people solo pulling Van?
---
Why the fuck is this downvoted?
---
He was absolutely talking about trade.  As someone with over 2,000 hours in PoE I can back this up.  Trade fucking sucks in PoE.  You have to send whispers to 20+ people before you finally get a response because there is no AH in PoE.
---
But the currency bots are a godsend.  Trying to convert one currency to another is the only not shit part about trading in PoE.  The currency bots always respond, always have stock, and always trade in a timey fashion.
---
I hv like 16 now, always just greeded on them. What are they for anyway?
---
Nah fuck it it's ridiculous.
---
Ingots.
---
He quit because he got a big offer from Facebook or something.
---
This.
---
It's the same reason they allow multiboxing even though 99% of the community (basically everyone who isn't doing it) is against it.
---
That's why I rephrased to include the part where the reader understands how deathrolling works.  yeah, if you look at a graph without considering any of the context, anything could happen with the data points not shown on the graph.  I think its fairly safe to assume - given the function we're considering - that the plateau simply continues with increasingly large first rolls.
---
That quote is from a theoretical physicist, obviously he is going to want to think there's more to science than how we can apply it to our surroundings.  Again, you're forgetting to consider context.
---
“A Physicist is just an atom’s way of looking at itself.” – Niels Bohr
---
This fella knows whats up.
---
Position yourself right, attack Prospector Stonehewer (the Female Dwarf NPC near Vanndar) until she runs away into him. He'll pull without any of the Marshals if it's done right.
---
Bots is bad but it have always been there and will always be there so deal with it. If making this whine post helps you out, great.
---
Pm’d
---
I don’t think bots ruin the game.
---
I like how you provided easy to use alternatives.   
---
My screenshot program even has a direct upload to imgur feature, is there anything out there that matches this?
---
Name checks out.
---
It certainly happened before BGs
---
You gave me goosebumps. Sorry for your loss mate :(
---
And was eliminated as soon as possible.
---
Sounds like a killer anime, if you ask me.
---
Perfect example of my point.
---
By the same token if I wrote a bot to farm for me, I earned those mats.
---
Thank you!
---
It's your bag bar. Just disable it with whatever bar mod you are using.
---
To compare Path of Exile with World of Warcraft is a bit stupid, don't you think?
---
Yeah I am talking just about classic and comparing it to tbc and not vanilla -&gt; tbc since I didnt raid then. 
---
But idk man, the stuff we have is so easy even complete morons like my guild can do it. I really cant see half my guild (which clears mc in 90min but is honestly clueless) do well in smaller raids on harder bosses where you cant have people be useless.
---
Why not just transfer your main? Get the rank you want and then transfer back in 3 months. Its gonna take a couple months to get it anyway, so by the time you're done you can just transfer back
---
It says in the video that it was 50 - 150 per person
---
He's probably level 60. He says he is farming low level dungeons.
---
I just want old av long as fuck fights. I dont care that you want rep
---
Ally on heartseeker were just as bad as horde on stalagg.  It's all about which faction has more players.
---
I'm not entirely sure about vanilla, but in TBC I leveled this way. It's not nearly as fast, but it is a lot of fun. You need a lot of stuff that damages mobs when they hit you. Ret aura and shield spike, consecrate, seal of light and wis, reckoning, etc. I didn't try this in classic, though, I leveled ret/holy, but  [this might interest you](https://classicwow.live/guides/860/paladin-aoe-farming-build-a-complete-guide-for-going-against-the-stigma-classic-wow).
---
But with your formal compliance. Big difference.
---
Then I apologize. Working atm so didnt have the time to watch it yet!
---
Libram of constitutions
---
I think there's a lot of people who frequent this sub who are in denial about this.  The people that are constantly bitching about mechanics and balance really need to just move on..this isn't your normal live game where if you scream loud enough the devs will make drastic changes to  game mechanics.  This game is a museum. it's not going to get better.  It's always going to be like this. If you hate it now you are still going to hate it in phase 6.  Blizz isn't going to rework the honor system so everyone can get Grand Master, blizz isn't going to fix AV or any other nonsense.   They will fix bugs and that's about it.  
---
Out of about 10 friends who joined up for vanilla 3 of them have quit and gone back to retail so far and that's ok.  It sucks cause I was excited to play with them and I hate retail but it is what it is.
---
Ark ah neet - Say it the French way! Always better!
---
 My condolences
---
[Nighttime version](https://imgur.com/a/ybFipaN) of your tribute
---
300 dps over a 5 minutes fight is pretty impressive.
---
I’ve never seen rogues topping meteres this early, usually hunters and warriors are the ones at the top, is this not normal?
---
Except 5/8 tier demonology lock pet would resist most of those spells you cast on it while the lock gets his melt on with immolate and searing pain. I loved when mages went after my pet. If you want a real chance it’s not letting him cast and aoe the shit out of the lock. I have only lost to one mage and they did that.
---
I respecced my alt mage to AoE at level 22 yesterday following https://de.classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-aoe-farming-leveling-classic-wow#aoe-grinding-talent-build-level-22. I tried AoE grinding the gnolls in wetlands which worked ok after some learning experiences. But reading your post I'm thinking that respeccing fire and again frost after lvl 40 would be the way to go? It's not that fun when major skills (CoC, IB) are missing.
---
I think a lot of the 'anger' comes from trolls posting on reddit. Alliance doesn't stick together and doesn't stop when horde go mass middle. If we stopped and put the clappins on the horde in middle we'd probably be fine.
---
I think maybe that taking IBGY is the optimal strategy atm, would let us cap mid towers and force horde to trickle in past IB.
---
Alliance needs a more.methodical approach to the game. Forget winning in 15 mins outside a premade, prep for a 30 min game.
---
what do you mean?
---
All of this just shows how terrible people are at math. Diminishing returns is a big deal, and as I posted in another thread, people probably aren't getting nearly enough from those HKs as they seem to think they are. Even if you kill all 40 allies to exhaustion (4 times), unless you're somehow managing to solo kill them, you're probably making somewhere between 18 (base value 10) and 27 (base value 15) for each of them. That works out to 720 to 1080 more honor.  And that's also assuming that they're all actively fighting you, and not off AFK in a cave or fishing somewhere (good luck with that).
---
I’d say generally these items should only be needed if you can actually use it on the character you’re playing, but if everyone need rolled anyway I’m not sure where the arguement is. Rule of thumb for me: talk about loot up front to avoid disappointment. If it’s not discussed up front then /shrug
---
You mean the people who were bragging about how Classic was going to be, going to clear MC week 2, play 10+ hours a day, etc are somehow getting bored and/or burnt out?  Gee willikers how could that have ever happened?  It isn’t like they knew before hand that there would long windows between when content phases would be released or something.  
---
Classic was always going to have limited content, so people who play so excessively are going to invariably get bored/burnt out.  The number of people I have seen with Wintersaber mounts since week 5 is perfect example.  
---
Also expecting reddit to be an actual barometer of the health of Classic is cute.
---
Are there any macros for mages that are must have? I was thinking about one to clear curses as soon as I click on someone, like for MC and late game dungeons.
---
Mages definitely have access to much harder farms later in the game - particularly when ZG comes out its the only class that can solo-farm Bijous which will make insane gold in the opening weeks. 
---
Its also possible to farm Bloodvine in ZG with Invis Pots + Blink IIRC. Tribute is the hardest farm ATM but not in the future is what i’m saying I guess :)
---
Yeah skill cap isn't an issue for me, thing is I probably won't be able to get big killer gear on these characters so this might be a limitation
---
I’d go mage.
---
Its not about looking out its about using the looting system as intending.
---
If you ask me... bis boe drops and someone in the group wants to equip... its the rest of the group that rolled need thats are the ninjas.
---
What they are saying is there is no built in display for Honor gained today in the default ui.  If you have a value for Honor gained today, it's just some add-on calculating that.  Since it's an add-on, if you don't exit the game correctly it will not have a chance to save its data correctly and will display different values depending on the last time it was able to flush its saved data.
---
Not over a warrior who will keep it until AQ40.
---
That would be a dick move.
---
The Horde defense are a bunch of leeches.  Here's why.
---
Any gains the offense makes from taking towers, killing LTs/Bal, or killing Van, goes to everyone including the defenders. Meanwhile, the defenders are busy trying to kill the allies for additional honor.
---
And remember, in the honor grind, your competition isn't the Alliance - it's other Horde that are making more honor than you are.
---
Well lucky you, at least experienced some pvp. On yojamba I recently run into premades only and games last no more than 8 mins
---
If you ask me its you and the rest of the needers in that situation who are the ninjas.
---
I was watching a video a few weeks ago on this. There was a portion of an interview with the creator, who said it got to a point the bot could win any PVP fight. For this reason the guy didn't release it to the public.

When i leveled my warrior on launch i was close to quitting since i couldnt beat a single centaur in the barrens. (Died 3 times in a row vs a single monster)
---
 Leveling a warrior can be a pain in the ass. They are gear dependant as hell. 
---
The thing is that on launch there wasnt any gold for alt equip or even stuff put in the AH so it should be a bit easier now
---
Thanks! I think you’ll need to adjust your approach if we are on the same page. I know I’m going to and will have the conversation with guild mates as well. The community seems really split in the issue so there are plenty of people out there that will have a problem with you rolling need when you think it’s perfectly reasonable to.
---
Wow this is too cool!! Ty!!
---
Bwls second boss is a big gear check. You only have an hour to kill him too

---
Hey! Who let r/the_donald users in here?
---
My goal is to raid and to be the best geared I can be for my guild when I’m in raid. This game already requires a giant time investment and anything I can do to speed up the process of getting BiS pieces, I will do so. 
---
Whether that’s hand picking classes to reduce competition or reserving items on runs. If I can get the group together and people agree to the terms I stated when looking for more people, it’s all well and good. 
---
People who complain about losing rolls on pre-raid BiS gear over and over I don’t feel sorry for. Obviously it’s harder for certain items like anything out of UBRS, but, for the most part, it’s pretty easy to get gear out of the 5-mans as long as you form the groups.
---
The examples you just cited are either HEAVILY exaggerated, or they’re doing another run or something else. There’s absolutely zero chance someone waits 3 hours to fill a group. If you play during peak hours, it’s very easy to fill groups especially the endgame 5-mans. The last example, has nothing to do with what I mentioned and is just some dude who is clearly operating illogically.
---
Fuck your bullshit. Some hippie talking shite isn't going to magically restore my serotonin production back to that of a normal human.
---
Don't just stare at it, eat it.
---
To be fair, a priest is very boring once you get to 60. Sure shadow is fun in PvP. But you need to respec every week. If I Mained  a priest I’d have a 60 alt by now.
---
Blizzard doesn't care as long as they pay their subs.  It's all about the money, kids.
---
&gt; Bots are predictable, they just blow their interrupt on the first spell so you can just make them waste it.
---
A good AI isn't just based on what is happening now but also based on what it thinks will happen in the future.  Where AIs typically do much better than humans is in the latter part - evaluating more possible futures and evaluating those timelines for longer periods of time.
---
I got one from Dustwallow while farming crocodile meat but nobody seems to want it on my server. Even listed it for 5g and no takers so probably gonna use it on an alt (not my main rogue cos it’ll give stealth away)
---
Sounds like you kind of agree with me anyway. 
---
Sort your shit out. Just get over it.
---
Tank Strat Live once and watch this dungeon loot table and you will know why there's no tank wanting to do it and why you must pay them.
---
as a rogue who kills all locks regularly I would go scubbucus.  Charm when your stunned then insta fear bolt.. Fear.. Immediately fear again this is important cause rogue will use trinket on the first fear. Dots and then kill.. If he vanish do it all over again
---
Unpopular opinion :
---
My server isn't full and there is an overall greediness, people aren't that rich and don't farm that much : So bots, in a way, help us.
---
Bots in my server obviously farm things people sell AND ALSO don't sell at AH, that's the important part, they fill the empty markets and keep the prices low, it saves players farming time. The overall amount of gold in the server inceases too.
---
Also, if you want to make money, don't compete with bots markets, find your own.
---
The reason why this is possible is because of spell batching. People can google what spell batching is, it's explained in detail on wowhead I think. So you need to time the rune use right before the sheep goes off in order to put it in queue for when you are in sheep.
---
I found fishing to be a pretty productive thing to do since you don't spend so any friggin time walking, running, roaming, vendoring.
---
You sit down, turn on a podcast. Catch fish worth maybe 1g or 2g. In low levels, that's a fortune!
---
I am only using Bagnon.. and its not a part of bagnon

We raid from 9pm-11pm EST on Saturdays. Usually start pulls a bit early if enough people are in the instance already. This weekend is a bit of a free-for-all since it's a major holiday weekend. So we have a few regulars who won't be attending, a few fresh 60s looking to come, and a couple of alts. Because we know people are going to be absent we modified the loot rules for this week to just MS &gt; OS instead of our normal loot system. There is a very strong likelihood we will all be very drunk and it could possibly be a shit show. This weekend probably won't be the best example of how our raid operates. But, if you're still curious I will try and remember to stream it to Twitch  [https://www.twitch.tv/bonerbucket](https://www.twitch.tv/bonerbucket)
---
Ok boomer
---
I'm sure what you're saying has merit but you're literally criticising somebody for using anecdotal evidence while you're using anecdotal evidence yourself.
---
That's crazy. Also frustrating that people resort to that kind of thing for a game..
---
Tauren also can't ride Undead Horses. Night Elves also can't ride Mechanostriders.
---
Not true, they were actively fighting Hong Kong supporters :D
---
You are limited by 5 lockouts an hour having that dagger vs not having it won't change that. And if you need the dagger to get 5 clears in an hour you're doing something wrong.
---
Get it boiii
---
It is easy they just have to invest some time and money.
---
Patch 8.3 for retail is January 14th so January seems very unlikely.
---
I mean purely for pve there's no discussion. Warriors should still be fury with a 2hander if that's the route you go. Arms is dogshit unless it's a short fight with multiple adds, which to be fair half of MC is.
---
You mad bro?
---
Because you don't have unlimited wealth and crafting Thunderfury is more important?
---
I’m slowly coming to terms with the fact that I probably don’t like this game anymore.  I’m at the stage where I only log in to raid.  The raids aren’t challenging.  It’s just something I feel compelled to do a few hours every Sunday.  I guess I feel compelled because I’ve spent these past months leveling and gearing, and I’m still missing t1 pieces.  Based on my dkp and the greater dkp and needs of others in my class, it will be months more before I am fully geared. I’m down to about 100g.  The thought of logging in on some other night to farm for potions sounds like an absolute chore.  I think after this Sunday I will be finished.  I’ve been forcing myself to play other games to try and get my attention further away from classic.  I’ve even rolled a fresh character in bfa. /shudder.
---
What would be the best response for you to read honestly?
---
Do you want us to tell you that yes indeed your life must be miserable, that sucks and there is no changing it? 
---
Cause we honestly don’t feel that way, nor would it be a good answer.
---
Is it good ? Idk
---
There is a skeletal horse-specific riding skill, just like there is one for raptors, kodos and wolves.
---
Aim for Frostbite + Flurry Axe. Cleaving with earthshaker on trash could be worthwhile. It's not black &amp; white between DW and 2H. The best warriors use 2H on cleave fights and DW on single target.
---
Hilarious that this comment has downvotes.
---
Join a pvp server and kill him
---
Found the lefty.
---
The Horde absolutely dominates in AV, I’m not sure what you’re complaining about.
---
Seems to be fine for me, although it did take some practice. Since I go arcane power for raids it's a respec either way for me, but the nice thing is while I'm ranking right now, and with horde queue times, I can queue in TB, fly to Mara, a do one ghost mushrooms + tinkerer + princess run in between queues. So I can kinda rank and make some money at the same time.
---
That, and ZF farm is mindlessly boring to me by this point.
---
Do you think this isn't a good warrior weapon or something? 
---
It's still got massive top end and mace spec in PvP is pretty good.
---
If there was a blueprint to get depression the people of this sub followed it step by step. I get downvoted everytime I call the people here out, but using WoW to avoid issues in life will make depression greater.
---
Warrior is probably the most documented class for all of your questions.  Just open up youtube or google.  There are literally hundreds of videos on the classic warrior experience.
---
I can assume it would be good on a shaman as well
---
Was also possible with shadow word death in BC. Fun times.
---
FYI, lock pvp trinket doesn't clear stuns.
---
Currently Hunter is +150g/h doing tributes with enchanting while mages can make up to 110+/h boosting ZF runs.
---
Make which one you like more, have a hunter myself for an alt and haven't regretted one bit.
---
True. Whenever I log into the game and just don't feel like doing anything, I log off again and play something completely else. Usually last for a few weeks, maybe even months. I eventually log back in again, but then it's because I want to, not because I feel i have to - which in turn makes me enjoy the game much, much more. 
---
Many of us have been playing this game for 10-15 years. At one point you run out of things you want to do and that is completely fine. Take a break. It's healthy both for your sanity and your fellow players. Those sixteen alts of yours between levels 48 and 113 will still be there when you want to level them.
---
....wait, I've had an epiphany. Certainly the right pronunciation is "Urkel, a Knight" and we're all just wrong. All hail the legendary sir Urkel, renowned enough to have a mineral named after him!
---
Terrible, what a waste of time. You would think they would fill from the first available.
---
Ah yes, should've been more specific. I am lvl 60 farmin low level dungeons.
---
Lotta people trying to tear OP down here, we get it, it costs a lot of gold and mats to make.
---
Congrats on the roll dude. F for Asyouwish.
---
ok boomer
---
Well yeah. You could. Or you could get a discount from your guildie who is exalted. I will explain a bit better.
---
I am an Orc. My Guildie is an Undead. They are exalted with Orgrimmar. I am not. Normally buying the mount would cost around 900g (or whatever it is). Instead of paying the full price my guildie buys it with the Exalted discount, then trades it to me. Effectively saving me close to 100g. It's sort of like how like when your buddy works at Chipotle and doesn't charge you extra for guacamole.
---
&gt;  melee boomkin that spams moonfire, fishing for clearcasts
---
If you're "spamming moonfire", you won't be able to melee.
---
the problem is that there is no internal motivation to do it. they just follow opinion leaders without paying attention to what they actually wanna do because they're scared to miss out or to make a mistake and be judged.
---
If you don’t like it, you should have thought that this would happen and played alliance instead.
---
Botters often do anything to make their bot seem human - that includes for some a delay between action
---
From what i've been hearing this seems to be mostly a Oceania region thing. In EU even if Premade drops the queue it seems that the games get instantly filled with random right before starting. 
---
Maybe this happend in Oceania only because of the smaller player pool?
---
 i appreciate that they keep the costs of mats buyable so idk how i stand on this.
---
Or the person you're replying to was talking about the AV rep rewards.
---
&gt; We all thought it triggered on melee hit
---
I mean, the tooltip says "DAMAGING SPELL". How did you think that was melee hit?
---
Yes, it’s better than DME lasher runs. You can also herb inside ZG and even sell rep runs.
---
People who want to commit suicide *are* unwell, many people may have had fleeting thoughts of suicide but pervasive suicidal thoughts are a sign that something is not going right inside. If you are having such thoughts I would urge you to reach out, the suicide hotline is free and there are people who care and want to help.  There is no shame in mental illness, just like there's no shame in having a bad back, or a broken bone. Take it from someone who has been there before, it's not normal, and I don't mean that in a way that you're wrong or abnormal or weird for feeling that way, just that it's not the normal state of life. Yeah, life is hard and full of pain, but it's also full of joy and wonderful experiences if you give it time. Pain is temporary, too many people give up on a lifetime of joyful experiences by giving in to temporary pain. It's sad, and it's a serious loss of a potentially great future. Very few people are irredeemable or in hopeless situations forever. If you or someone you know needs help you can call 1-800-273-8255.
---
Hopefully the find some way of patching this. It really is making a mess of the system.
---
No one was saying that though, they just said the only person who could change their life is themselves and they are right.
---
 I have depression and been dealing with it for over a decade, I don’t think validating the “doomed” mentality is healthy and the person was obviously looking for some kind of response.
---
There is no e after the n, therefore the a is a short a, not a long a. Not to be mean, but this is basic English stiff. 
---
Ar-KUH-nite
---
Goddamn that's brutal. Think it will ever get better?
---
you could use use consumables like dense dynamite for initial aggro on bigger pulls in case you have engineering or simply just dont care about aggro in trash pulls at all
---
Or just default the horde a minimum value win for the wasted time that wasn't their fault.
---
Check out Ooze on twitch, that guy is a fountain of shadowpriest and general game knowledge
---
Please link your logs so we can see if you're actually having debuff issues. If you're pushing off things like winters chill or shadow vulnerability it's certainly an issue.
---
Honestly even with debuffs aside, arms is just an inferior spec in PvE. Flurry is a fucking bonkers talent and you really should be going fury weather you're using a 2hander or a 1 hander.
---
There is actually quite an insane slam fury spec you should check out for 2 handers. Do some research on it, very potent.
---
Uhhh.... m8
---
not entirely useless as if one person is rank 3 and other is not they can save 100g
---
I have a lvl 60 and 50 char. Instances farmed, raids are boring, just trying not to aggro, that's all I do. PvP is uninteresting to me. BWL will be pretty much the same as MC afaik. The pve in classic is lukewarm, at this point I just await BC. Leveling was fun and raids the first few times but that's it.
---
What do you mean it vendors for 20g /s
---
WTF how do you spend only $15 at the bar? 
---
My bar visits are $150 each time, $100 uber home too.
---
Do you not drink much? I’m in Australia btw
---
my server it's not uncommon to see people looking for a tank and already reserved the first orb for the tank that joins
---
Not really. You depend on selling loot doing DMN tributes in order to maximize profit per hour and if you don’t sell loot, you’ll make as much as a mage or warlock. 
---
It also depends on what you want to do and what you enjoy the most based on your preference. Tribute runs require attention, AOE farming is half AFK and effortless.
---
IMO:
---
Hunter is far superior in gold per hour. Hunter is way easier to gear due to MC bow being relatively easy(leaf is 50% and sinew from ony can be 20 manned, shouldn't take long, + t1 from pugs is great. As for prebis you can win 1 AV for bow then get most prebis gear from just running tribute itself). Both classes are roughly even time to hit 60, mage should be faster with aoe farming, but hunter can play any time of the day where as mage has to wait for spot to be free
---
However what mage lacks in gold per hour I think they make up by overall just being more fun to has as a real alt. Mage is incredibly versatile in their farming methods which keeps it fun, and overall for alt raids and pvp I just think they scale better. Hunter is great early game but then they fall off, so with an alt that means its easy to become decent, but mage can go all the way.
---
Why not? #2 in the world is an awesome achievement. 
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#metric=speed
---
There was a private server that buffed the raids to the state they were in when 2.0 launched. These were cleared by level 68's in greens. If classic tbc were to launch you better bet it will be 2.4.3 which means the content will be nerfed and the gear available will be of a much higher quality making the content even easier.
---
Can't FAP if you resto pot.
---
Or maybe they understand, and that's why they're pushing folks to get help. Being that angry and flippant about suicide is not the normal condition for most folks.
---
EU
---
I ran UBRS as a fresh 60 and was only one of two warriors. He passed on deflector and I'll prob never use it. I wish I could give it to you.
---
Not necessarily right. Sometimes you are dependent on others and help
---
I had the very same experience. As a dps my only job in MC is not to aggro anything, it git stale fast.
---
Iron grenades for extra CC. 
---
Thorium grenades for extra CC and solid damage. 
---
Death Rays on some classes with long CC affects. Mostly used by Rogues.
---
Goblin Sapper Chargers in group PvP for AoE damage. Mostly used by melee classes and Mages.
---
Goblin Mortars for extra CC and solid damage. Requires a trinket slot but is on a separate CD to grenades, has twice the blast size, is cheaper to refill, and causes a stun rather than an incapacitation.
---
Goblin Rocket Helm for CC in 1v1s. Gives you time to swap out your helmet, bandage up, drink, etc.
---
Goblin net'o matic for catching people in group PvP. Costs a trinket slot, so it's not frequently used in 1v1s.
---
Discombobulator Ray for dismounting people. Limited number of uses but it can be used from your inventory. The slow and weaken effects are extra.
---
Probably. I know a lot of people that are still grinding out rep. As they hit exalted the amount of horde queueing will drop. Maybe not by a lot though.
---

I've been watching videos of hunters doing the DM:N tribute runs and decided to give it a try. I made it as far as blowing the door with a seaforium charge but died about 6 times to get that far.
---
I'm having issues with part of the packs targeting my pet and some target me as I run by. Plus it seems like there are mobs in places not shown in the tutorials which forces me to tweak my gameplan a bit. 
---
Any tips that may help me out? I feel like it's something subtle that's throwing me off. Would a carrion bird with screech help hold aggro? 
---
I'm in mostly pre-raid bis with some lower items if it matters.
---
I don’t think you saw his username
---
&gt; OP is talking about people not enjoying the game in general and suggesting that quitting is the healthy option for some people.
---
And I feel that this is because being forced into mindless AVs does that to people.
---
Oh I think they're all mindlessly boring tbh so which mindless bore I do doesn't affect me much. And I'm the WC mage so I guess that makes a big difference too. /Shrug
---
But "arcanum" is pronounced arcane-um and it also doesn't have the e after the n?
---
Or the word "canine", same thing with the first n. No? I'm not sure about these tiny grammar things in english...
---
Telling someone to seek help or get medical care for depression is not "deal with it" or "get over it". It may be somewhat "do something about it" but it's not a bad recommendation by any means.
---
Someone boost my alts on incendius kthnx
---
Incoming downvotes to hell, but remember when people said MC would be hard and take days to do when they first announced Classic? :P
---
Maybe some people didn't. Reddit is mostly a place for people who want/need to complain. Most of the playerbase is not on Reddit and most likely dont have a negative opinion on the game.

Shouldn't roll need on stuff for your alt, they are rightfully upset.
---
There will be a Ban wave, blizzard has  done it before they take data in for a while to make sure they get all the bots at once.
---
I want to Max alchemy on my lvl 40 rogue and I have a few flask recipes on hand. To make the flasks am I able to clear an instance on my main then invite the alt to craft em?
---
That sucks, first time i see this on EU then. I'm playing Alliance on EU and havent see a AV start with less than 37 (i think) ppl.
---
DM:T is not 150g+ an hour, unless you are selling every piece of ring/rod that drops within a very short time frame or getting eternal on every DE. Realisticly it's about \~15-25g per run, with &gt;15 min runs that's 60-100g/h
---
What? How can you tell hes left handed from that comment?
---
Mage for sure, but the Tarnished Elven Ring is always in demand in DM Tribute so a hunter isn't the worst idea. Selling chest loot isn't as good as it used to be but even if you vendor everything it's still 60g/hr
---
Clinical depression here. 
---
Unless you have someone who physically drags you to a psychiatrist at some point in your life *you* need to realize that you have to make the step and make a phone call. It can take years.
---
Telling someone to "just get over it" is ignorant. Telling someone you care about them and they need to do something about it might be the best advice you can give someone.
---
I’ve done about 140 jumpruns to get my epic mount and lionheart, and I would definately do alot more if I got either sulfuras or thunderfury. Sulfuras might be a chance, but thunderfury tank prio so will never see one of those. :p
---
Sure, I dont doubt t4 would be cleared fast by the top 0.1%. But I think the number of casuals doing it would be waay lower.
---
With the small difference that a properly working BG queue is easily implemented with an overnight hotfix, while faction imbalance is almost impossible to fix from developers side (not saying they did a great job at dealing with it though). Also, faction imbalanced WAS predictable weeks before server launch. Everybody knew what was coming. I have not seen any posts back then about how Alliance would be able to cheat group queue battlegrounds though.
---
There is no exalted discount. You get a 10% discount at honored and a 10% for being rank 3.
---
&gt; the only real enjoyment I've had in classic were lvling to 60, grinding my pre-bis and the first few MC's and Onys.
---
Hahaha holy fucking shit are you me!? I feel exactly the same. I literally deinstalled the game today and posted my goodbye and thank you message in my guild's discord, and thought I'd come check out this sub one last time and here I am. I loved launch and  took 2 weeks off to level to 60, but ever since I got prebis I only ever logged in to raid with my guild even though I wanted to play classic purely for the pvp, but the endless honor grind, and elitism of the pvp community and shitty meta just don't interest me at all and I've finally decided to stop my sub.
---
Decursive works great for that.
---
Good shout ! I am racing to 60 (currently at 58) and plan to respec to holy once done. This sounds like a good route to go.
---
I think you are misconstruing a logical explanation for complaining.
---
But I mean sure, just brush it off, not like you listening to reason will change anything for me  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Were all apart of the larger crowd wether we like it or not.
---
I'm a holy priest myself and I use the ElvUI raid frames with the Clique add-on to bind heals to various (7, to be exact) mouse buttons. Clique turns all those bindings into mouse-over bindings by default. Makes for really easy healing.
---
I also have my (mass) buffs bound to F1 and F2. Could do the same with your blessings, but I guess you're already using PallyPower for that?
---
As for UI, you could use ElvUI, but that's a full overhaul. Most people use a different raid-frames add-on such as Z-Perl, VuhDo or Grid2 to customize the look and feel of their raid frames.
---

Its because players like you are bad.  If you dont understand why we want 100% mounters i dont want you in my bg purely for iq reasons
---
I just stopped reporting. See the same bots all the time since launch
---
Well, it's hard to not take seriously since there are people who aren't willing to effort or learn.

I am one of those who rages in chat but I believe I have good reason for that. Can't win there if more than half are acting as lemmings.

I also went back to OSRS. my injured wife is pregnant(she was 8 weeks pregnant when hit by a car, shes getting better now, baby is also ok) &amp; we don't really have much time to play wow together anymore. shes not very big into osrs so I find it very easy to just hop on mobile when I take her to the doctors or PT. I can play at my own pace and never feel like im falling behind. My childhood best friend also started playing osrs again and we've been having pure fun. Glad to be back
---
Well good on ya then! To each his own
---
It would have to be an utterly obscene amount of gold to ever do that over just banking the ore for when bindings do drop.
---
Ty for input.
---
Yeah cause nothing ever drops in dungeons and you make 0 gold from normal runs, right?
---
I bet certain streamers that have been cheating this way are going to be fuming.
---
Probably happens when a guy is fighting a lt and you just swoop in for the final 5% damage. You don't get any honor for that (I know that as a fact), but it might count as a KB.
---
Hey, I'm a warlock who farms Mara occasionally to top up my coffers and get ghost mushrooms for raid consumables. I heard that A warlock can enter Mara purple side and get a bunch of mushrooms. I gave it a shot but there is this one pack of imps and Satyrs at a chock point early on in the instance that I can't sneak past. If I could this would allow me to possibly icnrease my gold per hour.

Anyone happen to have any ideas?

It should automatically cast the first one of aviable and the second one if the first one isn't.
---
If you die to a demonic rune you don’t take repair damage??
---
You are probably right, but I'm too done with Blizzard. I'm just gonna stick to WC3 from now on. Save my money.
---
those BGS and the honor system should have been released day 1. We are seeing the issue of why releasing it so late has ruined classic for most players.
---
I guess you're *blind* to it
---
Tribute is hard to master. But really rewarding.
---
tribute runs dont give BoEs.
---
It's not that it's un fun, I love playing my warlock, but I do see the alliance side of the server slowly declining. So it's really a matter of long term investment. 
---
And starting a new character is kind of a drag when you can't finance it.
---
Meanwhile I’m farming stockades as a priest for 10-20g an hour...
---
They're indeed worth 3.300 exp each hand in. I've done some shameless leveling on my paladin there. Dinged 60 halfway to exalted. I usually did the initial zerg and when things exploded (read: we wiped) and ppl left I made for the harpy cave and grinded exp. You can prob get up to 30-40k an hour with grinds and handins.
---
Selling anything is a waste of time. 15min runs are slow. Also, if you get 15g a run you must leave the potions in the chest, I suggest picking them up.
---
I actually really like his streams, and I quite enjoy his gameplay. Though, like many others, I laugh a lot when he enters the enrage timer and there's no hunter to tranq shot. I understand my previous comment may come as offensive, but it was only to poke fun at him and nothing else. Hope this helps, I do suck at writing stuff.

How much gold can you expect from a run vendoring that phat lewts?

A level 46 in my party yesterday was getting a bit over 3 bars per pull, so you’re probably right. I was charging 5g with greens+ reserved until yesterday, when I swapped to 8g with no reserves. That allows me to start the next run while the boost buyers are still looting - saves quite a bit of time and increases max XP/hr to over 100k.
---
Not all servers were horde dominated, mine was alliance dominated during P2, it was bad. But in some ways I actually preferred it. You had to be good to rank, not just no life.
---
Arcanine, like the pokemon
---
No, macros can't do that, or else it would be too easy to automate your rotation.
---
If I go out to dinner, and have a few beers, I'll be spending $50 easily.  At a different time in my life, I'd spend $100 a night easily (often more) when out with my friends, and engage in risky behavior to boot.  I've played thousands and thousands of hours in WoW and I am certain that it has kept me from wasting thousands and thousands of dollars, and has kept me away from trouble.  
---
My preferred outing now involves a six pack of boulevard 6th glass quad (of which I'll probably only be able to drink 2 or 3), and a quiet evening in WoW.  The beer is pricey, $14 for a 6 pack, and if I drink 3 thats 7$ for the night.  I've paid 7$ for a single miller light before.  
---
If I'm doing anything in the game that is a drag, I'll just quit and do something else that I want to do.  If I find that I'm bored or not having fun (which almost never happens),  I'll go to sleep or go do something else.  Man I do not understand people who play this game and feel compelled to do it against their will.  I'm rambling now but yeah...  
---
Dude if you're still reading this go out and buy a 6 pack of 6th Glass by Boulevard brewing.  I've never been a huge fan of that brewery, but since they've put that beer out it's now my favorite.  It is something like 10.2% alc and honestly you don't need to drink any more than 1-3 before you're sated.  I don't say it lightly that this beer is now my favorite.  My previous favorite was La Fin Du Monde by Unibroue brewing, which is a fantastic triple.  I think in the last couple years though, La Fin Du Monde hasn't tasted quite the same (I guess that can happen with craft beers year to year) and 6th glass has taken it's place.
---
Heres the thing though, you are a rarity. The vast majority of people are not you. You are in a very specific and more well established position in your life and have a much more accommodating mindset. Thats not common. 
---
And honestly you thinking my mindset is “pathetic” is pure fucking hilarious and unadulterated irony.
---
You’ll never be able to premade without an epic mount, people are way too elitist - so just farm
---
Everyone says this but so far I’ve been out dpsing almost every fury warrior in 5mans/ubrs/MC. I’ve been arms since 14 years ago, I wont ever change.
---
Sweeping strikes cant crit. 
---
Due to the nature of attack tables things like dodge block parry glancing all affect how much you will crit them. 
---
Just comming on here and saying you think theres an issue with warrior crit chance but then not posting any logs or data to back it up is going to get met with alot of skepticism as I'm sure you're figuring out now. 
---
Go log what you're seeing and post it if you want anyone to take you seriously.
---
When I was setting up my grid it was driving me crazy that I couldn’t see durations of hots on other people. I think it’s a limitation of the game.
---
Aren't bots part of the classic experience? I remember playing alongside bots in vanilla wow and it wrecked the economy. Gotta keep the experience 100% legit.
---
We had Kuroma on Daggerspine hold R14 for....two years I think?  Vanilla was crazy XD
---
There are rotation bots out there that pretty much guarantee legendary parses with just a click of a button.
---
They're all pretty situational. The mage will try to poly you again for sure, resto pot makes that a lot harder.
---
There is also the [Crystal Spire](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11567/crystal-spire) item from gathering blue+yellow crystals in Un'Goro and turning them in at the Eastern pylon for thornslite consumable.  
---
Probably not worth the time by itself, but if you are farming in the zone you should pick them up.
---
Pls tell me how this makro has to look :D
---
Yes, just like the Alliance has.
---
Khalgosh Golemagg, mate.
---
because i let my kids play wow or because i dont let them have a phone?
---
See here's the thing.
---
There used to be bots in vanilla. This isn't "classic except there are world quests and mythic dungeons."
---
This is classic. Exactly as it used to be. (except ventrillo/ts is now discord but whatever)
---
You wanted it so bad and you got it. Be careful what you wish for. I hope you like losing combo points when you switch targets. I hope you enjoy walking all the way to alterac just to que for av. Do people even fight in there or is it the same "run past the enemy and just steal a guy/cap one tower/pull the boss bullcrap that it's evolved into? How you gonna patch that? At least retail still has hope. Classic is predestined and doomed to be without a future. Is it really fun to be like yay I'm finally 60 too bad half my friends are on this server and half my friends are on another so f me I guess I'll make ANOTHER 60 even tho my bank and professions will never be able to link up?
---
Eat that shit and chew on it and it better taste so good. A harder more uncomfortable game is more fun right? Because that means that if everyone else hates their life every day they turn it on that will deter casuals and children right? The hope is that someday when you're on the top of the mountain you'll be surrounded by those basement trolls and weekend dad's who both have no life or personality outside of the game whatsoever. What a fuckin promised Land. Hope u get to see it.
---
I've been using a wolf with furious howl rank 3 and I has been a godsend, it pulls all aggro to the pet.
---
There's never a good reason to rage in chat, fam. This game is meant for enjoyment. If you are raging that means you are simply not enjoying it, and you are most likely ruining other peoples enjoyment, double whammy.
---
Right on man.  Don't do stuff you hate.
---
hey mate, great video! I didn't watch all the way through, but i was wondering, what's the addon that shows your instance reset timers to the right of your screen? looks like it'd be really useful, i am able to do princess runs in mara at around 10-12 minutes and i keep locking myself out. Much appreciated, and keep up the good work!
---
It scales with casting time; Google up "mage spell coefficients".
---
If you vendor everything, one run is probably 8g raw + at least 10-12g in items. The issue is inventory space; I usually trash non-stackable items under about 80 silver to keep from having to vendor almost every run.
---
Its +18 vs. That particular mob. They could have frost resist, magic resist, be a higher level than you, be a player on pvp resist gear, etc. The actual math is ridiculous, and unfortunately is never 1:1.
---
yeah self correcting wont happen until AB, which isnt till phase 4. If anything horde queues will reach 1hr+, forcing them into WSG, which will also increase in queue times as alliance ditch premading it entirely for AV instead.
---
Historically they haven't.
---
Obviously some will, but AV very much earned the reputation for being the Alliance dominated BG back in classic. We'll see how things go this time around.
---
I dont get how this is a problem. Premades only have 1,5 minutes to accept, if they dont, other randoms will join in like the next 2 minutes, so its not a big deal. Or am i missing something?
---
Back in the days of BC I used to run bots (yes, I know I'm a terrible person) and there were ideal areas for botting that tended to attract more botters than other areas. These high value farming areas would be a battleground of bots. Most botters don't have PvP on but if there were other bots in my area, I would unleash my little bot army to endlessly gank them and set mine to only PvP. Those were some good times.
---
An hour? Can't you just do jump runs?
---
I play both sides mate, but i main horde.
---
I see populations and problems on both sides
---
this is your opinion and 20/80 is an absurd exaggeration
---
empty low level market? sounds like a good place to make gold.
---
55-60 dungeon runs is a pain on both sides bc everyone is 60 or pvp
---
no one actually cares about grizz, take the reigns and lead then.
---
Look for guild mergers to recreate a bigger community out of remains
---
Stalagg is not "dead"
---
this is p2, world pvp is dead aside from resource war and world bosses
---
people dont even need world boss loot anyway if you're raiding at 60 its really not that good.
---
this is p2, everyone is q'd for bgs and bgs are cross realm so again not dead. 
---
the game was essentially a pve experience even on the pvp servers bc players dont flag themselves for pvp when they are leveling lowbies or avoid contested zones if possible
---
AGAIN reiterating that 60's are logging for raid night or afk in bgs so there is no world pvp anyway in p2. 
---
There wont be a resurgence in world content until AQ events become available and even then people will still be making these negative ass posts just to have somewhere to vent and complain instead of making the most of a bad situation.
---
week 1...
---
You probably shouldn't be wasting money on gear at 13. You're right that it's not worth the cost, specially because you'll replace everything in a few hours of gameplay. At low levels the difference isn't big enough to justify (unless you're making a level 19 pvp twink)
---
What rank frostbolt are you using? +Dmg isn't always 100% applied
---
It's better to go with stats such as int / Stam due to this while leveling as fast spells generally get less spell power benefit
---
Elitists because they don't like carrying dead weight?
---
OPie. It changed my life
---
I found it too
---
Then fell thru the ground and was under SW
---
Found a big square hole, jumped in and fell thru the world and died
---
Ran back, couldn't reach body, had to Rez at graveyard
---
its not rng if you do it long enough.
---
Some guy on my server bought all of Them for 3 weeks and reposted Them at 19g a pop. He thought these were pristine black diamonds which everybody recommended to stock up
---
This is a great point and should be stickied in the official wow classic forums.  
---
I will say out of my 5 RL friends who joined for vanilla, all have continued to play very regularly which has been cool.
---
This. Also spells taught at below lvl 20 has an additional coefficient penalty. So honestly don't even bother with SP before mid twenties.
---
Been struggling with aoe pulls on my mage with mobs that have any sort of ranged attack/spell. This is on a mage aoeing roughly equal level mobs. I see people saying to ice barrier and mana shield, but those break super fast and drain my mana too low to even kill the pack. Any tricks that I'm missing? This seems to happen even if I only have 2 or 3 ranged per pull
---
Thank you! I use WeakAuras 2 for the lockout timer. I think I went with the one from Wago.io, but if you try that and it doesn’t work I can send you the script I’m using when I’m at my PC later.
---
I carry level 30s through sm all the time. They get less xp per kill but the speed usually makes up for it.
---
Just trying to get exalted for a cheaper mount I suppose
---
I see populations and problems on both sides.
---
this is your opinion and 20/80 is an absurd exaggeration.

---
Its completely fine man, he is just being an ass cuz he disagrees.
---
Yeah! I farmed it with my 59 WL alt and died 15 times on my first run. Now I'm back to mostly deathless but I still have to focus hard
---
When someone calls you out for afking and you try to justify it for le reddit karma
---
Sorry for your loss. Very cool of you to remember your friend like that
---
I’d take a 60 speed mount over 10 afkers a game.  Plus that whole dead weight mentality is for people who literally sweat over wow bro.
---
Haven’t really experimented much with DM
---
I was fucking around with snowballs on the alli bridge, and then we lost the GY and some guy whispered me because “im an idiot who lost us a graveyard”. Also im level 51 fucking around what do you want me to do when 20 horde come for the gy?
---
Thanks, Dr. Phil.
---
You type exactly like a horde playing Rick and Morty fan
---
If u want a rly chill farm i Can recomend a holy priest with herb in Dm E lasher farm. Currently on My server i have 51g/h acording to FarmLog 20 hours collected so far and All you need is 6.5k+ mana i prefer 7k mana, holy nova, mage water and a movie because it might get boring pressing holy nova. This farm is better with mages/wlock but Will req. more than running into a pack with full mana and press holy nova. Currently im leveling a wlock for When i just want to get My gold Quick and efficient. Hope This helps you chose.
---
Though that in group content people would play for group. 
---
I'll begin to afk in AV then since it seems not to be problem.
---
The people complaining about the queues being too long need to switch factions. Its a pain in the ass to level another character, but that's the only way to fix it.
---
I would say being a hardcore PvPer and not playing in premades are mutually exclusive.
---
Is it possible to horde a fuckton of the Alterac Valley Marks of Honor and turn them in all at once?
---
Yes you can have windfury from a resto shaman, but we're not talking about resto vs enhance. The point you were making was subbing the enhance shaman out for a warrior for more dps. This argument presupposes you're already full on healers. A warrior does more damage, but he's not giving his group windfury. That additional damage given to the party has to be taken into account.
---
And in regards to nightfall, the shaman has flurry granting faster swings and more procs.
---
Feel free to arrange your own 60% mount premades then
---
wtf so many ppl rolling and no one in my guild wants that shit :D
---
If they had been released day 1 (something I personally agree with for the record) you'd still see Horde complaining about queues and AV Alliance premades and you'd have a bunch of #nochanges people complaining that Blizzard killed wPvP, which was an integral part of Classic.
---
Personally I think Blizzard made a bunch of bad calls (too high server population caps, not doing anything to address faction imbalance, transfers not restricted by faction etc.) but on this particular issue, I think there wasn't anything they could have done that wouldn't have pissed off a segment of the community.
---
What an extremely mature way to go about things.
---
It's just a game, calm down.
---
Actually you’re 100% wrong. The organized people from day one were farming rep that is correct, but the people who are organized and now farming honor have moved into using discord as a way to hyper organize premades and avoid all of the people who are not good at the game. They still rush galv and then drek and they still win those 10 minute games consistently. Only now instead of the 700-1100 honor the rush strategy was getting, now it’s 2700-4500 honor because it’s been refined. These people are wanting and needing to avoid the questers, the people using AV to get to 60,  and the people who are “just there to have fun” aka are bad and aren’t there to be competitive.
---
I have a problem with binge drinking, while I don’t drink for weeks or months at a time - once i get a taste its game on.
---
A beer at a bar in Australia costs $10, a 6-pack for home sets me back $20. My problem is I can drink 15-17 beers on a normal night and more if I am ‘partying’ 
---
Christmas time + no family I want to spend time with has led to a very lonely holiday every year around this time. Last 2 nights I have consumed about 34 drinks.
---
I wonder if I can get that beer in Australia, I will have a look for it. I’m also working on fixing this thing, its just hard because alcohol makes me careless.
---
Thats why my nights are so expensive anyway. I just need to work on it.
---
Oh and its purely because they are addicted. I’ve met too many of these people in Overwatch who come into a game, say how much they hate the game and then try and ruin it for others. They can never answer why they don’t just stop playing Overwatch lol.
---
Botting is an arms race.
---
Botters build more and more complex scripts and routines that carefully avoid automated detection. Any big software company has tons of resources dedicated to collecting data on bots and analyzing how they work, and how to detect them using automation.
---
Then they write the banning routine, and a wave of bans is issued. Botters start over with building bots to avoid the new detection routine.
---
This is how modern software works. Twitter and other companies have MASSIVE departments dedicated to analyzing bots and how to find them.
---
The problem is that some bots are really good at avoiding detection. You can spot a bot relatively easy by physically looking at it, but analyzing it's behavior for automated banning is really hard.
---
___
---
Sniping one bot at the time accomplish nothing. It just let's botters know their weaknesses easier so they can build better bots.
---
The BG queue is properly working.
---
sadly, priests didn't have Penance back in vanilla yet...
---
I found myself in the same spot you're in, last week was my last week of raiding and it was liberating. My guild did /roll for gear and I didn't get a single drop in the months of raiding we did so it just got stale.
---
"Deal with it" and "get over it" are obviously terrible ways to talk to someone dealing with depression.  But "do something about it", while perhaps worded insensitively, is very important for a depressed person to hear. 
---
I was depressed in my late 20's to early 30's, and thankfully reached out to get help.  I only went to see the therapist three times, but the very important takeaway she gave me was that I needed to be the one to recognize my depression and want to get myself out of it.  To that point, I had been laying around waiting for others or some great outside influence to come swooping in and make me whole.  But obviously that isn't realistic.
---
I didn't always do it, and I'd be lying if I said there aren't days when I'm back in that mindset.  But I recognize that I want to be happy, and tiny step by tiny step I acknowledge my small victories (which most might not even think about).  I accept that I'm the only one responsible for my happiness, and it works for me.
---
I can happily say that I'm not depressed anymore because I savor the small things.  I remind myself that I HAVE to do something about it, because no one else can.
---
Ever since I started playing back in TBC, the Tauren and Thunder Bluff has always been my favorite race and city, by far.
---
Peace friends!
---
it's a weakaura, the instance timer one is this https://wago.io/OXlZupyKm
---
I've been farming my 100 arcane crystals for my Thunderfury for the last two weeks. I'm running the same Thorium route over and over. But I do it with the TV on and I'm actually really enjoying myself!
---
The videos and tutorials I've seen sometimes use a wolf successfully. I figured dash was the important pet ability but if it continues to be an issue I may have to go out and get a cat.
---
I may just need to wait an extra second before sending my pet running? I'll try again tonight but dang can it be frustrating when a mob seems to randomly decide to change directions and come after you.
---
yeah theyre easy once u learn all the mechanics, gear up etc and have it on farm but during progression theyre still difficult for any guild that is not a hardcore guild. even the most hardcore guilds in the world will practice for weeks on ptr to get a first day aq/naxx clear
---
It does benefit me. I am alliance and already exalted. I took my lumps with world pvp and now am enjoying the benefits of fast queue times (and everything having a fast queue entails).
---
Moba players have always been some of the most toxic shitheads around. Not sure what it is about that genre but it attracts some real fuckers.
---
I forget how to do it but it’s like /console max300 best bet is to google it.
---
The formula is something like cast time/3.5 * spell power. Cast time is taken as base, ie not reduced by talents. So a 3.5 sec cast time spell would have 100% sp scaling. Also as other have said there's a penalty for certain low ranked spells. This is why warlocks scale better than mages- shadowbolt has a longer cast time than frostbolt.
---
to be fair,i knocked out five runs of princess in 30 minutes then chilled on overwatch, this farm isn't that bad. besides it's decent gold so why not?
---
It's called being a great player and min/maxing. I for one see the casuals who randomly stumble into the raid, no consums or buffs and no drive to compete, as total trash that should never get loot.
---
What are you killing? Most good AoE pulls specifically try to avoid having more than a couple of ranged mobs in the pack for that exact reason.
---
I stopped reading after you unironically used “I digress”
---
&gt; also use a ~~felhunter~~ Succubus 
---
FTFY
---
Marks are Unique (20), so only up that point. After that they get sent to your mail box with a 1 day duration, so it doesnt help as much as it used to (they lasted 30 days in vanilla and even did the first day BGs released in classic until they hotfixed it to 1 day)
---
“Just work a part time job for a month” lol
---
I have furious howl rank 4 on mine but turned it off for some reason. Guess I figured dash was all that was needed. I'll try turning this back on... didnt realize furious howl generated threat!
---
Sadly, that's what people think about nowadays. They don't care if what they're doing is wrong, they don't care if there is a way to solve it for everyone. As long as they benefit from it, they'll keep doing it, even if it ruins the experience for others. Personally, I think having a Solo Queue and a Group Queue separately would be the best, or something similar to retail's Casual and Rated Battlegrounds, where in Casual you can only go with a group of 5 or less, and if you want a group bigger than that you have to do a 100% premade match (every single person in your team will be premade). But anyways, we can't have big changes in Classic like this I guess.
---
Yeah I’ve watched the Witcher, dark, and a few other shows while leveling and farming.
---
Upvoted for visibility. Didn't encouter any bots in the open wild, but can feel the effects on prices of goods.
---
Okay, but in this case it works with the runecloth bandages, just tested inside and outside AV, it tries to cast both, but since outside av first one won't work, it uses the normal bandage. Inside AV it used the AV bandage, since it's the first line of the macro
---
This. This is good advice.
---
I like it as it is :-)
---
IMO they implemented these and had more plans for them then made it into the game
---
It's an exploit. An obvious one. You just dont want to admit it.
---
What does a DM:N cache run entail exactly? You must
---
get the shackle key, right? How do you do that solo?
---
Even people on a tight budget deserve some entertainment. WoW is cheaper than buying a new game every month to play.
---
\+Spell damage is applied in full only to spells with a cast time of 3.5 seconds, if the cast time is less than that then the +spell damage is applied as a percentage equal to the cast time/3.5 seconds.
---
So a 2 second cast spell will have 2/3.5 = 57% of your +spell damage applied.
---
Instant casts are considered to be 1.5 seconds for coefficient purposes.
---
Considering how much money it has made them, yes.
---
Once rep is maxed the motivation for AV crashes when the game functions as you’ve nicely described.  There are many honor farmers who keep at it - bit many, many more who rarely/never play it again.
---
Does that detract from the absurdity of having one faction able to premade and the other not? 
---
I think wPvP ganking was a huge problem on my server before p3 - even if it was just “pure alliance salt” I can acknowledge the imbalance...
---
I knew there is near gate that leads out of trade district to mage quarter side, you can jump under SW
---
Create a post asking someone if they want to trade X gold on your server for Y gold on another server
---
&gt; Why is everyone trying to solve this? Premading has been a thing for the entirety of vanilla
---
Premading where you could group queue always existed, premading AV never existed. Stop revising history.
---
League, Dota, Fortnite, Apex, Runescape, Warframe, Path of Exile, hell even one purchase games like fifa, overwatch, cod, Battlefield etc provide better value, if that's all you're after.
---
&gt; running MC/Ony/BWL/ZG/AQ20 with alts (or mains) will be pretty fun, I hope. As long as the servers aren't totally dead by then.
---
Outside of good raid teams, occasionally going back into those for specific pieces, I think those instances will be pretty quiet when P6 rolls around.  
---
Unless you join a team that’s progressing through them at that point. In which case...good luck. Since said team is likely not going to be competent.  
---
As you mentioned there’s a good chance most servers will be pretty dead by then.  I know my servers pop has dropped dramatically since launch, and that decline doesn’t appear to be slowing. 
---
So. Hopefully you’re right and you can still raid those instances in P6. My concern is that we basically will not be able to, due to lack of fellow players and interest.
---
Lots of good information here - let me just add that it takes a lot of practice, and you're going to have to put in a lot of work to get it down.  You're going to figure out ways to survive when you mess up, and things don't go quite right too and that's probably the most important piece.
---
Soft reset as in reset all instances? Or use a new raid leader not locked to reset the trash in the zone but not the bosses obviously.
---
https://discord.gg/avpremade
---
Coooooooooooool
---
That sounds less like enjoyment and more like the gamblers fallacy.
---
I think u just look at server pop for ur faction on the potential server try to get one that's fairly even for the faster ques as a low pop wont have enough people in it to speed up the grind. So ur prob just moving from full to medium is the best way. 
---
I'm no expert tho just trying to help.
---
Okay, but that is something any player could anticipate - faction imbalances and toxic attitudes aside. 
---
Nobody could have predicted the state of wPvP to the degree it got to at launch, but everybody could’ve told you the breakdown of racial abilities... pick something else to complain about lol
---
&gt; I've seen it done just ONCE
---
You're full of shit. I see it at least 5 times a day. You're either lying about that, or lying about 'living in AV'
---
I'm gonna call BS on this. Odds are you've seen at least several bots and you just didn't know they were bots. There's no way you hit 60 without seeing one. They're fairly common on every server.
---
It's very obviously and visibly broken, and you're clearly not interested in a fix because it benefits you personally. You were probably also one of those kids who would insist to keep playing when a player from the other team was injured, because winning is more important to you than fair competition and fun games.
---
It doesn't work out like that sadly, the games usually either end up being a 10v40 stomp or the bg ends.
---
Thanks!
---
Good God you're a super nerd
---
Hey as a warlock shadowpriests and boomkin crits are always hugely appreciated 😉
---
The only thing i learned from this thread is that there are a ton of toxic alliance players on this sub still baby raging about phase 2 and they have become so warped by this toxicity they've been wallowing in that they now simply hate people that don't play the same faction as they do on a videogame. If your response is either a "They deserve it" or "I'm happy because horde suck" then you should probably take some time off and reevaluate how you are interacting with the game world
---
Thank you very much good sir
---
I’m so upset I’ll have to make lunch and gold while I wait to get the same amount of relative honor as you :((( 
---
Hey, think you’ll be able to poop without going deserter? Just alliance problems :)
---
Depends on the reputability of the chosen establishment. If the beers are real cheap you might get away with a 15dollar bill:)
---
Ive also been having a damn good time in AV now that its not 10min zerg fests!
---
The ingots tend to be the bigger problem, both in server supply and general cost.
---
&gt;You sound like an angry little child trying to start an argument for no reason. Go get fucked
---
You're accusing him of that? You're pretty aggressive for someone who has their shit so together.
---
laughs in osrs
---
I won 80% of my games.
---
Better to just hide the BG numbers altogether so they won't know it's the wrong one until they've already entered.
---
That’s my point lol - I would never roll on sulfuras and I have no idea how someone could casually tell someone else to play for 4 hours a day for a month straight just grinding, without realizing that is not an absurd request for a majority of people
---
Is this 2 accounts or one? I’m leveling a warrior and was wondering if you can clear on the hunter and relog as the warrior to loot on the same account.
---
Pretty defensive there kid.
---
I quit the day after BGs came out because (1) I can’t play with my rank 14 grinding friends (2) I don’t have enough time to play to get high standing to rank quickly. I was getting top 100-150 before BGs and if I can’t get that easily anymore it’s not worth my little time I have to play.
---
Before the price of ghost mushrooms went down I’d run through orange not purple. It was a guaranteed 3 mushrooms but sometimes like 5. It took 5 min then I’d kill tinkerer and princess. I didn’t have much luck with purple.
---
Honestly high pop is not great. Farm spots are taken, people hop guilds and trick others. I switched to a lower pop server and everyone's nicer since you see the same people everywhere you go. I can actually farm in places I'd never dream of getting a tag before.
---
You’re really going to bring up a sportsmanship metaphor after the shitshow of world pvp? I could not go anywhere outside of a major city without being killed, repeatedly. Give me a break.
---
Holy crap congrats Jegue!
---
...I hope Drewy isn't dyin' about this!
---
I feel that. 
---
While you're in-game, can you do something productive with your time? Help lowbies, answer questions, etc. It's a nice baby step to recovery to do nice stuff for other people. And it's a game, so, if they get annoying just block them. Spreading the misery isn't a valid way to cope with depression though. Making other people suffer doesn't really feel good, it just lets depression win. "Look, you really are a piece of shit, look how much of a dick you were to that other player?" Depression can never, ever win. But when it does, just kick its ass harder next time. 
---
Idk, it's been pretty helpful to hand out bags to lowbies. Nuking a mob before it kills the other player is very fun. Healing another player just when they think they're about to die, also great fun. Rezzing random bodies is a new way to gamble. Curbstomping a whole lowbie instance in 20mins, beating your previous time, great mood bump. WoW (well, Classic is, anyway) is full of tiny opportunities to do good. And they're tiny to you, but they're usually game changing for others. So it's easy to get a feeling of accomplishment, which is amazing when you're in an emotional dark hole. Good luck mang.
---
Because alliance are fragile children who spend all their time downvoting horde, even when they are obviously making a joke, on reddit instead of playing the damn game, as is obvious by the upvotes and downvotes in this thread.
---
I enjoy everything except gay ass pvp. AV exalted was enough. Who wants to sit through 20 minute queues to do the same thing over and over and over for 8 hours a day for months? Super boring. Even without the queues. Rankers need some motherfucking endurance, that's for sure.
---
I'm having a blast leveling an alt and raid logging.
---
How do mages solo bloodvine? I thought that was a Druid rogue thing
---
🦀🦀🦀jagex wont respond to this🦀🦀🦀
---
I did. No premade like this exists because it will get absolutely rolled even by a competent PuG.
---
A man of culture
---
yes sir.
---
what most alliance need is for horde to end games or just dont turtle 40 man, what would just be awsome. they legit zug zug goes around trying to find alliance in the mountains on the side where they afk, i mean wtf, why dont you just end the game and get on with it,  
---
legit. you made alliance quit/trafere to other servers in wpvp, now you're making alliance quit/only play wsg cuz of this im amazed     
---
gonna try get my premade in 1 game cap everything and just go turtle horde cave and MC/snowball all horde out for hours. just to show, how we feel.
---
Also add in oil of immolation
---
idk, raids were hard and challenging the first few times for some people. on our first attempt we only got to garr since we had 28 people, next 2 runs we simply didn't have enough people with the questline to get ragnaros to spawn, only after that it became ezmode
---
world pvp wasn't particularly fun because of ganksquads, but everything else about phase 2 was true for us
---
meh I am married and work 50 hours a week. I'm fringe hardcore/casual. Having an epic mount by now is hardly difficult. It is like 10 hours of farming.
---
PM me I'm on sulf in a sub 2.5h mc raid guild I'll hook u bags some g and some runs my man 
---
Our server is fantastic for both horde n alliance imo
---
Two things about this. Firstly, there have already been 2 ban waves, and it didnt stop the botting community, so that wont really solve anything. Second, the original reason for botting was exactly what you mentioned. People not having enough time to play as others, getting left in the dust and not being able to do much or having any money because they cant keep up. I see both sides of it, because you make a good point about it ruining the achievments, but in a game where those achievements are pretty crucial, if you cant keep up with the server, you get left behind. While many abuse it like crazy and DO ruin it for others, I dont see a problem with the casual botter just trying to stay on par with the server and be able to have a good experience when they do log on and play it themselves.
---
If you're not intoxicated while raiding, are you even raiding?
---
It's infinitely more feasible than faction transfers, which will never happen. What...do you expect shamans to turn to Paladins and their gear to magically transform into plate?
---
Unsubbed?
---
I do like vanilla, a lot. I just very much dislike how incompetent Blizzard devs are.
---
Nostalrius was honestly a lot better of an experience than Classic.
---
 I did a closer look using [this run](https://youtu.be/nhmQhV9IzOk) as an example, and we're both abit off i think.
---
* Blade 7.3g
---
* Leggings of destruction 3.5g
---
* 2 mana pots (\~2g per) = 4g
---
* 2 healing (50s per) = 1g
---
* Oddly Magical Belt 79s =&gt; DE to eternal for good measure. (\~4.2g on my serv)
---
* Elemental Plate Girdle 99s =&gt; DE Large brill (2g on my server)
---
* Barrier Shield 3.45gRod 7.15g
---
* Mud stained boots 1.5g
---
Including eternal that's 31g. Without luck that's 27g.
---
Average that to 29g per run, 13 min runs, that's \~135g an hour. So Pushing 150+g on average is possible, but not likely. However 60-100g is also not correct.
---
Yes.
---
Lol no one consented to be born? Are you fucking kidding me.. you sound like all the rest of those Whiny little bitches in r/thelostgeneration... dude you attitude is complete shit. You do need to see a therapist.
---
Your post history has comments about traveling with laptops so you have enough money for multiple PCs, wow subscription, travel, and bitcoin..... like fuck off man. You’re a lazy shit who just wants to be angry at the world instead of taking control of your own life... you use the most idiotic cop out excuses like “no one asked to be born” 
---
And sure life has suffering in it... that’s literally the first Buddhist Noble truth... but you don’t see Buddhist monks wallowing in their self pity. You accept that not everything in life is rainbows and butterflies and focus on the things you have control over and enjoy life.
---
I’m so sick of hearing people complain how they are stuck and have no way out. 
---
You have all the power to change your situation but you’d rather not get help and continue to be toxic and try to drag the rest of the world down cuz your so “woke” and realize life is hard. Boo fucking hoo
---
You don't want a solution. You just want horde to suffer because of some victim complex you have.
---
I hate it, at least on alliance. If you dont premade you will lose 90-95% of all AVs. Alliance has such an unmotivated playerbase. Half the team is AFK and reports dont do anything now. The other half of the team doesnt even try to win, they just rez and die at SH repeatedly and refuse to group and push a southern GY. 5 players try to get south and get farmed by the 15-20 horde that defend and that's the game.
---
Can’t do that, don’t you see all the alliance cry babies?
---
&gt; It's called being a great player and min/maxing
---
Its literally called, padding against stupid.  
---
If you're a great player you don't need to min max, these bosses are laughable the only reason why buffs are "required" is so folks can make more mistakes, literally the same reason why in Ulduar the #1 raiders in the world cleared the place (including hard modes) wearing blues while other guilds wipe for weeks. more health/damage etc after a minimum survival benchmark is reached is just padding against stupid.
---
There was a glad botter during WoD
---
RingMenu just gives you actionbars in a circle callable upon any keybinding. You drag whatever icons you want into it.
---
This is 2 accounts but can still do it with 1 acc, but you get like 100g per hour from this and you can buy what ever you want
---
No, the problem is that you can see what game popped before entering.
---
1/10 winrat isn't that bad, im more at like 1/25
---
when I get matched with a premade im 100% tho, which is what most of total wins concists of where you get that luck.
---
Frostbolt R2: https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=205/frostbolt  
---
SP mod: 0.269  
---
18 * 0.269 = 4.84 additional spell damage
---
ZF zombies is the best for me at least, just due to how braindead it is.
---
I pop on a TV show in my other monitor and mainly focus on that while farming practically unconsciously.
---
DM takes a lot more attention to avoid accidentally pulling pats or dying.
---
Yeah, see, I just play wow to hang out with my friends who are also playing. I don't feel any stress, or urge to get better gear or be level 60 outside of my own desire to reach goals, I don't feel behind if I don't achieve, I'll get there when I get there. The stressing out about it is the part that I think is ruining the game for people, they're acting like wow is the same rat race. They need the bigger car, the bigger house, the best wow gear, the best etc. People need to live life at their own pace instead of looking at their neighbor all the time, but its an easy trap to fall into, I get it. If it's causing you stress give it up my man.
---
There was one in dota 2 that got so good pro players couldn't beat it.
---
Yep this is what happened in starcraft
---
Mostly, yeah, but if you stand there and tank them all, your shield will break early and the rest of the run gets a little rough. After a couple of initial blizzards, you want to move back to LOS the sprites. They run up the ramp into the kill zone for the rest of the mobs, so you can finish them off before they deal enough damage to interrupt your blizzard.
---
Also an important note, mage armor gives significant nature resist. Use it instead of ice armor if you ever find yourself taking too many sprite hits; I normally do but just happened to not need it in the video.
---
I'm on the most populated NA server and Alliance were the ones with 20 man wPvP groups. All you're doing is being salty and advocating for people to quit.
---
Its hard to say if Blizz wants Classic to die or not.
---
Should of done your research, if you wanted to do pre-made AV you should of rolled alliance. It was obvious what would happen.
---
Yep, it's sadly a very present attitude in a lot of areas. 
---
Personally, I would have liked to scrap the entire shitty classic honor system and replaced it with rated BG altogether. With non-rated casual BG honor as currency for accessory PvP items and maybe a T0-level PvP set, and the two good PvP sets spread out over the rating range. It would reward playing well in a team, not spending the most time, and support organized play instead of AV botting. At the very least they could dumpster AV honor and force PvP rankers to play WSG (and later AB). But ... #nochanges, I guess. TBC can't be soon enough.
---
Nice framerates, you must be part of the no changes crew
---
All I was saying is that it's doable for the average person. So don't do it over a month, do 2 hours for 2 months. 
---
Maybe you get a Saturday and just put your nose to the grindstone for 12 hours.
---
This is an MMO. The game is about setting long term goals and working to reach them. The enjoyment comes from crafting a fucking legendary weapon after putting in hours of work.
---
Time enjoyed is not time wasted. All time is a waste if you wanna look at it that way. It doesn't matter if you read a book, have a great job, have a nice car. You're gonna die and be forgotten and none of it ever mattered. Do what you like while you're here, for some people that's playing wow. They aren't any worse than you, maybe it's not right for you and that's fine. You don't need to tell other people what is a waste of their time.
---
This also goes for the official Blizz forums too. People (in general) come online to complain. Gotta take these places with a grain of salt.
---
I dont think failing to clear MC with 28/40 people ur first try is evidence that the content was challenging.
---
duels too? You certain about that?
---
Wpvp was fun as hell. I have very mixed feelings about what battle ground queing does to the world population, but my farming routes have never been better!
---
Yes, how dare people have fun in a way that appeals to them. If you didn't clear C'thun 15 years ago it doesn't matter at all if you do it now, so you may as well just go ultra casual and only raid MC in greens.
---
&gt;  Instead of one premade, you'll have four WSG premades all doing the same thing.
---
Except in WSG horde can make premades too and premades were intended to exist there. It's amazing how little critical thinking it takes to realize that, but you still couldn't muster it.
---
It's called classicons_reborn
---
You guys are still doing galv first?  That's the issue right there, still doing galv first.
---
You don’t need prowl at all. I’ve tried to use it and my pet always gets seen.
---
&gt; Horde can make premades too
---
No they cant. Next?
---
Ok doomer
---
It’s not “hard” but it’s a hefty time commitment. Not everyone is inclined to spend a majority of their playtime just slaving away for gold. Especially not warriors, who probably have the most bullshit grinding for their bis of all classes already.
---
Shouldnt a warrior + resto shaman be able to do that too?   
---
I'm on average around 900-1200DPS with BRE and BiS raid gear in dungeons such as scholomance when tanking for 5men groups having all the rage.
---
no lol, you shouldnt go through someones post history so you can be proven right, this is the internet, you being right isnt going to change a damn thing, its extremely pathetic to look for something damning of someone just so you can win an argument against them.
---
Why would people recommend lock to solo dm east when he wanted something less tedious. The guy already is doing dm tribute runs which seems easier that a lock solo from videos I see.  Just go mage and aoe farm somewhere
---
"We had this unfixable issue in the past that was bad for me. Now we have this very fixable issue that is good for me, so we don't fix that one either."
---
Whats it do besides put the class in the icon?
---
&gt; Maybe you loved the everloving fuck out of this game in 2006. But in case no one has told you, you are not the person you were 13 years ago. And that is perfectly okay.
---
That's really what I've come to realize.  I can't keep playing like I'm a teenager with tons of time.  I've got a house, wife, job, etc.   And it took me quite a while to realize that I was mad at myself for not being able to play constantly the way I might otherwise do.  =P    Which is stupid, because I love my life.
---
I haven't tested it myself, but that came like literally off of WoWHead or some site like that, can't remember now. Seems like uninstanced PvP, the game probably treats duels just like wPvP. Doesn't really matter either way XD
---
Agreed, wasting 40 minutes to get a real game is just terrible.
---
Hero of the Horde.
---
This is not an issue that needs to be fixed. It is part of the game.
---
Paying $15/month for something you hate but play compulsively is not a good deal.
---
I dual wield tank in strat ud with fury prot spec. Make sure to have 4-6% hit rating and use demo and battle shout with every pull. If clothies want to be dumb and try to top the damage meter with aoe too fast then they’re gonna die quick. 
---
If you don’t have enough hit then use a shield with a spike and make sure the dps give you time.
---
I would imagine you could, Ive seen a video of that comp doing it. Cannonball wing might be the only issue because the CC, but it should be fine. Test it and let me know!
---
I'm not quite sure, the way we did it back in vanilla was to exit the istance and stay out for 30 mins.
---
We did like:   
---
BWL up to 2nd drake --&gt; Port Orgri and go kill Ony.  
---
BWL trash  
---
MC up to Geddon
---
BWL trash (leaving someone inside MC)
---
finish up MC  
---
Finish up BWL
---
If they are progressed guilds they will either sell the elementium to someone who can use it. Or gift it for future elementium to be returned as bindings drop.
---
That's reassuring and it would be much appreciated! Are you horde or alliance?
---
nothing else. that's literally it. i've seen some people use the classicon portrait version, but that removes the character's entire portrait and replaces it with an image of the class icon
---
22 aint terrible. Nice job
---
Transferring is actually an option.  Pagle is high pop and ~80% Alliance with tons of raiding guilds.
---
Great post with a good message. Glad I heard it in such a fashion
---
Also as fury prot you never get out of def stance when tanking.
---
I have the same feeling about Teldrassil.
---
Here I am complaining that it took me 65 runs to get my HoJ. Hats off to you sir, that’s commitment (and a very cool piece of loot to boot).
---
Haha eat shit horde
---
Seems like your main problem is getting too close to the mobs before they are all targeting your pet. What happens is  if you are in LOS with the mobs and in aggro range of the first mob, the other mobs in that pack will attack you if you get to close. I made this mistake on my first attempts too. I would send my pet in and just follow it in, dont do this. Send him in, let him attack the first mob, as you see the animation start of the mob attacking is usually when you can press pet stay to send your pet back, and once all the mobs are targeting your pet is when you can run in.
---
I'm sure it is profitable.  But I'm also fairly confident that WoW Classic exists to shore up revenues this quarter.  Blizzard has always had a Q4 spike, most companies do, and the next year of their stock prices will be based largely on the delta between Q3 and Q4 revenues.  
---
Now take a look at their product stack:
---
Overwatch is late in the games dev cycle, so revenues are down.  Pile on top the ramped up expenses that comes with new development, Overwatch 2 - their most profitable game right now is looking less appealing on paper for Q4 2019.
---
Diablo 4 is nearing peak expenses as marketing starts to ramp up, the development teams are at their highest numbers, and there is zero revenue coming in for it yet - driving up expenses with zero revenue.
---
WoW subscribers were continuing to fall, and they were still moving forward with a major expansion - Shadowlands.  Their long time tent pole IP was sucking up money, while not putting a lot back into the coffers.  The game is staffed by well tenured employees who are capping their salaries, pulling in maximum benefits, and are well rutted.  It's a legacy system running on legacy hardware, anyone who works in tech knows how much of a sinkhole these can be. 
---
It makes sense that this year, this quarter, was strategized by Blizzard for WoW Classic.  It's sole role is to soak up subs and revenue to strengthen Q4 2019, and Blizzard absolutely hopes to convert the Classic wow subs into Shadowlands sales and engagement next year.
---
Sorry to hear about your wife, hope everything turns out fine!
---
No this is a lie
---
I'm intrigued doing so. I hate DM:E with a passion by now, because it's so very dull. 
---
I like hulksmashing stuff and in DM:E you kill 5 mobs on perfect runs which is very boring.
---
Would be interesting if judgement gets eaten by grounding totem.
---
&gt; brings fire to a place literally on fire to kill things that are literally fire
---
hmmm
---
thanks! much appreciated :)
---
Assuming you have a job or class or do anything that requires being a normal functioning person, you'll normally need to wake up around 7ish to get ready in the morning. Consistently staying up until 5 am on weekends keeps you from having a consistent sleep schedule so it is terrible for your physical and mental health. It's not just about the quantity of hours you sleep, it's also about quality and consistency.
---
Thanks you! Cause it does the same for power word shield + weakened soul. Both show the duration on my frame but not others
---
Eat shit horde. Enjoy your queue. Why are horde crying? Just reroll alliance, sounds like pvp happened on a pvp server.
---
I mean if you're ranking, there's really no benefit to not having a queue since everyone on your faction has the same deal. At least horde can farm gold or just chill while they wait. Sucks if you just want to do bgs for fun though.
---
Yeah I was bored with ZF and at least this gives me someone to grind with so it’s not as stale.
---
Since you mentioned it uses Windows 10, would this not work if I play on a MacBook then?
---
Sounds like a neat app and I’m hoping to try it out.
---
Drawback of mage is low health low armor. Frost mages obviously fuck me up as a rogue but if they have no shield and are focused on something then an ambush -&gt; grenade -&gt; backstab combo will kill them in a few seconds.
---
Then perhaps spending 15 dollars and dozens of hours a month on WoW is not a wise decision?
---
Real pepega hours here. We're not talking about the av mount
---
Back when every ally was pvping for rep?  Yeah good luck winning any game now
---
Solo DME with mining and herbalism
---
Make sure you are watching up to date videos, i came across a lot that were from private servers that were not accurate. Second, once you get the first part down (opening the courtyard door) you will start getting more consistent. I get that door open at around 1:20 (if i dont have to wait for pats)
---
Step 1: camp BRM and every single busy flight path for weeks
---
step 2: omg why alliance mad??? ally so toxic hur dhur dhur
---
10-20 an hour? Oh no. Get to dm east like yesterday. Even with the worst rng in the world I still make 40g/hr fro, the lashers. A good hour yields 100+
---
This, DM east is a solo dungeon for locks as you can virtually pull every single pack in there with little trouble (enslave demon). Something along the lines of this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfspmZBGkWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfspmZBGkWo)
---
This made no sense.... you wouldn't have two healers in the group. If the druid went in as DPS they are DPS and roll on that gear. It's that simple the only exception would be if no one else wanted it then you can take it for off spec and no one would care.
---
Mages are basically the kings of PvP. They do everything so well and have an answer for any situation. Sure, a SL lock is better 1v1, a warrior is better with healer backup, an ele shaman has higher burst, but mages are right behind in every respect while also being #1 in many aspects, like CC and mobility. 
---
And there's SO many of them. Definitely regretting being melee this time around.
---
I'll check this out too, thanks
---
welcome to spell batching, where nothing you should be able to do, is now possible. 
---
also got interrupted after a warrior use pummel. Amazing :D
---
Shouldnt rune of duty [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21568/rune-of-duty](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21568/rune-of-duty) be ingame? My understanding was that the caster trinket wouldnt be ingame because of spellpen but what's about the melee trinket?
---
I’m currently playing as a sword rogue and the only reason I’m doing so is because I managed to get the Dal’rend set sword in UBRS(won via greed because no-one else needed them). I started off as a dagger rogue and love playing as a dagger rogue more instead of swords so I’m planning to go back to dagger rogue again after I get the daggers from MC. 
---
Me and a small group of guildies have been joining either pug MC or MCs hosted by our friends in other guilds and most of these MC is MS&gt;OS. This usually means that I can’t roll on any dagger because often there are dagger rogues so they to roll first for MS. Does this mean that I’ll just to have roll back to dagger in order to get a chance to roll at daggers? Im willing to give up rolling for swords as well because I don’t want to go sword.
---
Can horde not get better qs for premade wsg?
---
I'm a moderate, having a blast. If it stops being fun I'll stop playing. I don't do games as chores, I don't understand people who do. I have enough chores irl. For now though, it's a lot of fun and doing goofy drunk runs of end game instances is a hoot.
---
Has anyone had luck with getting ItemRack to auto-swap spirit weapons for Evocation? I've got it set up, and it works fine when I test it in town, but never swaps right in combat.
---
DM north solo as mage?
---
As far as im aware (and im a mage) we can only do doggos, bettles, and first guard solo, atleast thats all i was able to do. Might be wrong tho. DM east is far better option for mages especially with herbs.
---
I don't know. Top end guilds won't be doing Anything but AQ40/Naxx. But those below that? Pretty sure there will be guilds still progressing AQ40 in P6, those will probably run Ony/MC/BWL regularly. There will always be fluctuation and the need to gear people. But only on high  pop servers. Low/mid pop will probably be pretty dead.
---
You can affect your life far more than you think you can.
---
I don’t think people quitting the game equates to them not being appreciative of you helping them farm. People chaining themselves to a game they don’t want to play would be a pretty bizarre, masochistic way to show gratitude.
---
60/40, the balanced server that Skeram and Stalagg Alliance dreamed of.
---
But Total Warhammer 2 is infinite enjoyment forever.
---
They just hit the major bot with a ban wave. People just don’t realize it even when it happpens.
---
I'm still just reting to get lionheart and my epic mount lol, playing a warrior is hard to make gold
---
&gt; So honestly don't even bother with SP before mid twenties.
---
Hell, even in mid twenties you want more int so you can have a bigger mana pool and actually kill mobs without running out.
---
Spellpower doesn't really come into play until 40s or so.
---
Awesome info ty
---
Who told you it was 3k?
---
Expensive sellable item = all need. End of story. Anyone saying otherwise is delusional and deserves to lose items.
---
Might be slightly off, but it's not far off. I run out and just mash the reset button solo. Only stealth the absolute minimum, use a dash for speed, should be able to murder it down fast. 
---
I'm definitely doing it well faster than lockout rate. Can only do any dungeon 5 times/hr.
---
Not everyone can brainwash themselves. I'm not being sarcastic. If positive thinking works for you that's great. But all it does for me is make me think about how I'd rather actually feel good then just pretend I feel good.
---
Can't even imagine doing it without a prowl. That's how I learned it.
---
This happens in literally every game
---
I just want to say that while this comment is probably gonna get buried and seen by very few, I really appreciate it. Thank you for writing it, and a very delayed Happy Holidays!
---
WoW has this infectious binge/purge mentality amongst a large chunk of the community.  Almost a fear of missing out of being the first person to have an item.  AV launches and there are people exalted in 2 days while grinding 200k honor and then complain about the grind or how there's nothing to do, how the PvP rank grind is toxic.  Yeah, it is because this mentality is the problem.  Rather than endlessly queueing, do it in moderation, just like the advice Blizzard gives you during the loading screen.  People chain queue instances and run them 200+ times in a week for one single item and then are bored.  I understand the behavior but the people doing it can't seem to take in what is happening and they're the problem entirely, or at the very least ruining their own play experience over some abstract form of social pressure.
---
We do, but its the holidays and blizzard is a tech company, we wont see nearly any action until Jan
---
They aren't speaking out against China, hence nothing will happen.
---
They’re just having fun in their own way lol. Don’t rail on them because they find doing bosses with minimum effort as boring. Some people enjoy trying their absolute hardest and pushing their limits.
---
Gratz on being on a balanced server where alliance is toxic? That... Huh... Idk... Somewhat nulifies the fact that the vast majority of PvP servers are mostly horde, and they made the game unplayable for weeks? And... Also... Stating that horde dug their own grave is, like, the same as blaming you, idk...
---
???
---
But does the top end damage specifically matter? A bow with 70-130  damage would yield the same average dps as a 90-110 damage bow, no?
---
Alliance are all PVE players at heart.  A lot of allies are really salty over the fact that they got fucked in world PvP a LOT, so anything that affects the horde in a negative way they will always say “I told you so, you deserve it.”   I’ve seen so much of this it actually is comical how divisive the factions are.  After BGs hit I went back and counted over 50 COMMENTS in ONE DAY of people claiming horde will have endless queues while mine was popping at 30 seconds.  It’s actually really funny.
---
Tell me more about it
---
It’s not a “new generation” of gamers making games toxic. It’s just how games always have been
---
Can't swap armor in combat, that's why. Only weapons can be switched in combat.
---
That’s stupid considering they vendor for way more?
---
What if it was blizzard running the bot just to catch the people buying the gold?
---
Wtf? 20g per person?  Holy shiy
---
Oooh. Yeah that shit never drops
---
Grats on your massive bill.
---
Only weapons (and wand) can be swapped in combat, all other slots require you to be out of combat to change
---
Fuck that shit
---
In fairness, levelling was hard and took long compared to retail, especially for semi casuals.
---
Its not useless if you're trying to improve against yourself, or to know how well you COULD be doing with your current ilevel.
---
Asking for a friend (really).
---
Let's say I'm a woman and have an abusive ex whom I played WoW classic together with. We broke up, he is still bothering me ingame. He knows my battletag, char name of my main, we share a guild.
---
I don't want to leave the guild, blocking is not enough. What are my options to change identity?
---
So far the only solid option seems to be completely new account and re-leveling. Any more options?
---
Way more common than bindings
---
Are you farming low level instances for gold? Which instances? 
---
I'm asking cause I am extremely broke and my gear is beyond shit lmao
---
well good for you. atleast you go for gy ect. not like horde, literally looking for alliance players in the mountain, and if they move you do everything in you power to catch em for the 0 honor cuz you killed them 5 times. ''Slow'' clap.  
---
im ranking, i just want honor, frankly i just want to do WSG. but i cant as the honor/hour is better in av, and i've to do it or people doing it's getting more honor then me.
---
&gt; As a priest you should downrank, even in 5 man dungeons,
---
I can't entirely agree with this, as max rank carries you through 90% of the fights in any five man. Even as a raid healer with over 650 +healing, I constantly just toss a max-rank renew and a standard heal for the tank. I might PWS a DPS who is low until I can get to them after the fight or to mitigate spike damage.
---
I'd estimate around 450 +heals is where you should start using downranked heal R2 in five mans. And probably a few R2 flash heals. 
---
Before this, those heals aren't enough health restored. Yes, it's "mana efficient". But it won't keep people alive fast enough trying to cast a R1 heal or flash heal when incoming damage is faster than your 500 health heal every 2.5 seconds.
---
The exception to this is spamming R1 flash heal to get an inspiration proc on the tank so you can go have a cigarette while he's finishing the pull.
---
The basic thought process is that max rank will *always* overheal a target after a certain point with bonus healing, even at 5% health, so then use a lower spell rank to heal the missing health.
---
There's very little reason to conserve mana in a 5-man. **If you are going OOM in a 5-man, either your gear is not good, or you are using incorrect heals for the given situation** (i.e. "git gud"). 
---
The above presumes a good group where the DPS isn't pulling threat, where the tank tab sunders and isn't tanking in leather, etc.
---
Chat can be useful, report and ignore the toxic players IMO.
---
Honestly that orc racial stun resist can very well mean the difference between winning and losing. Even grenades...
---
Well... It takes 20-60 minutes to get that 1 WSG game on one toon. It's enough time to grind a lot of honor for a serious ranker.

---
Well, it’s logical, Isn’t it? The biggest problem and most of the whining going on is a result of faction imbalance - directly or indirectly. So, who are to
---
blame for this? Alliance players? I guess you could say that is it blizzards fault for allowing it/not preventing it. But in the end it is the horde players who made the choice, and consequently is to blame.
---
Classic wow doesn't have to be the only game you play. I love that I only have to play 3 hours a week right now. Once you farm a little gold for pots and repairs and do your raid for the week, go play a different game.
---
I've never heard of anyone getting banned for buying gold.
---
what you like is wpvp, av is about taking objections and winning not about mindless killing your enermyr. sorry to say it.
---
Where the hell do people even get bots
---
Wouldn’t worry too much about it. Even the best guilds still haven’t downed the first boss in BWL yet.
---
I don’t think you have read this Reddit latest then. There is so much crying from the Alliance side.
---
We have things we're unhappy with in life, but we also have ways to deal with that. We have depression and suffering, but also elation. You're whining about "How complacent idiots are", while you're the one complacently wallowing in your own self-pity while the rest of us actively find meaning and joy in our lives.
---
yeah... thats the point, whoever is the best team in any sport or competition has the advantage.
---
Then this doesn’t really apply to you. Unfortunately you’re suffering because of a bunch of sweaty horde on pvp servers.
---
Eh, bots didn't ruin osrs. Pvm drops ruined most of the market prices. Also ironman mode isn't effected by bots at all.
---
Cry more Alliance *and* Horde. Its not about faction. It's about character.
---
No, people didn't think it would be that bad. It had nothing to do with classic wow. Only people who had experienced the wpvp honor grind on private servers knew how bad it would be.
---
It does limit the speed but I took that time to make more water and mana gems. Around 50 I was able to pull the last group with no IB. Just be ready with both shields up, and have a health pot if needed.
---
That's the PVP symbol.
---
If horde exploit, it's horde's fault.
---
If alliance exploit, it's horde's fault. 
---
hmmm...
---
But muh Don Julio's :/
---
Also, warrior alt who wants TuF and isn't 60 yet :)
---
The meta shift over the last few days confuses me.
---
Apparently horde has decided to make their plight all the more arduous with the 40-man defense strat. My game time average is up to 20 minutes the last few days, so it's surely slowed down my honor, but this still confuses me. They still get smashed, it just takes 12 minutes longer. I don't think they're netting more honor proportionately with the 8 minute games and they're definitely getting less games/day than before.
---
Maybe it's a matter of principle thing?
---
It would likely result in the sweatiest fucks imaginable rolling there thinking they would have an even bigger advantage
---
I am a level 52 mage (new to the classic gig). Am I hurting myself from a mana and damage perspective for taking the reduced frostbolt talent?
---
nope, people just need because they are greedy and they won't be held accountable for stealing it because they convince everyone else to also need.
---
AV proves this, with everybody needing on trash green boes.  it has nothing to do with a random value of the item.
---
He doesn't. He's literally here to bitch about ally bitching about horde.
---
Transfer to pagle
---
Well, horde did make it a possibility for alliance to queue as premade. However I agree that premades is a problem for everyone (both horde and alliance), except the players participating in the premades.
---
imo still need is need
---
I used to feel like the player for whom it is BiS should get it, but I've changed my mind. I had Krol Blade drop in LBRS as the only DPS warrior or rogue in the group. This was full on BiS for me. But you know what it was for everyone else? 250-300 gold... Which is ALSO a need.
---
You could make the claim that's true if any item, given that they all have value. But that claim becomes significantly stronger when a single item contains so much gold generation.
---
I think you are happy if you get it and chalk it up to RNG if not. What goes around comes around, and there is other gear out there. Not having that piece isn't going to ruin the game for you.
---
Lmaoo you forgot to change accounts? Your pathetic dude and didn’t deserve that recipe over anyone else in that group. Gold is gold
---
&gt;  bop ones drop at a lower rate
---
These drop pretty frequently. I farm a half stack of 10 before raids on my holy-spec priest in about 30-40 minutes (this is a raid healing spec). I imagine it would be faster specced to actually do damage.
---
It is against rolling etiquette to claim you're rolling need "for your alt". If you accept that you can roll need for an "alt", you must accept that everyone else can roll for their "alt".
---
If you're rolling need on patterns/recipes/formulas, the standard etiquette is that you must learn it on the spot, or else you should be rolling greed.
---
&gt; Horde is turtelling every single game to a point where the only way to overcome this is by joining a premade group.
---
This is likely a positive feedback loop.  Alliance started losing when Horde began defending.  Alliance found that forming premades was more efficient honor/hour.  Some Alliance left the queue after getting exalted.  Horde face more premades.  Horde queue time grows.  Horde begin turtling to win more.  Alliance get tired of turtles.  Cycle begins intensifying.
---
Me as a priest and a warlock in the mid 40s we cleared those packs to do the quest where you kill the khans.
---
The warlock would use enslave demon on one of the elites, otherwise we would never of made it through. Try that maybe?
---
waow, uploading images to reddit too complicated, must have one click upload. Jesus, dude.
---
There's something wrong with your guild having open rolls but still not identifying or passing gear to people who get nothing.  They are oblivious or selfish, neither is a good base for a raid that I'd want to be a part of.
---
You don't bring shame, you just took your time and enjoyed the journey.
---
I think if you made your own, you’d get plenty of people who join.
---
60% mounts are not useless and it’s a stupid excuse for people who don’t get into premades and lose. The horde have as many 60% mounts as we do, they just focus on all the objectives and know how to play. The only time they even make a difference is galv/balinda but that’s one part of a game with many parts.
---
Thanks for that. I'll admit I'm not using all the tools in my arsenal, I need to get better at adapting and using the variety of talents/abilities at my disposal.
---
I'd pay a little extra to play on a server/battlegroup with a limit on how much time you can play each day/week. 
---
The amount of tryhards on my server is astonishing. I know a guy who lost his job, because he was pvping too much and kept calling in sick.
---
Yeah, wanting to make money and not do a job so one entitled twat can get theirs is so communist.
---
Oh wait.
---
It’s just interesting to me because the whole horde vs alliance thing I thought would have played out by now but yes I realize there is a lot of bias and the same things being parroted by the same vocal minority and this subreddit is probably the worst I’ve come back to and questioned why I did every time
---
I burned out a little on it. Taking a break for now, might be back next year. Nice to see this thread. :)
---
Is prowl the max rank and is your pet 60?
---
Part of the game is the grind.
---
Wth is gdkp? So you have to buy your gear?
---
People need trash greens from AV because it's a trash green and you can't rely on 39 other people doing the right thing, so the result is the same.
---
People need expensive BoEs because they're essentially the same as gold, and everyone needs gold.
---
Same but when the item is 500g+ not many people will roll greed out of kindness
---
See the title and move on if you don't want to read it again.
---
Thanks for the guide!! Cant wait to try it. Get the addon farmlog, will keep good track of your gold.
---
Big oof
---
No, always go for the full cast time reduction.
---
No, only the base cast time is considered in regards to determining the coefficient.
---
It is elitism because people that have 60% mounts win AV too...
---
You're not understanding what is happening. Plenty of horde are queueing BGs, that's the problem. 
---
- 20 alliance attempt to queue AV at the same time.
---
- Queue instantly pops
---
- The 20 alliance check to see if everyone got the same AV 
---
- If they dont, they leave queue and try again
---
Horde queue times are 20 minutes or longer. Thousands of horde have tried simultaneous queueing, it never works, and they dont have the option  to retry instantly.... they would have to wait another 20 minutes to fail again. You could literally spend all day trying to get even 5 people into the same AV and never succeed, never play a single game.
---
It's almost as if the overall attitude of the alliance on here is shaped by what happens on the vast majority of pvp servers... Aka spending 45mins corpse-running to BRD / UBRS and whatnot. But... Alrightyyyyyy... Let's aknowledge this one guy whose experience differs. What now?
---
Just leave the guild. It's going to be an unavoidable situation with both people in the guild, and I don't think you're going to convince an abusive ex to leave on their own accord. A GM isn't going to do anything for you. You can change your battle tag on the bnet website however.
---
You can't avoid ppl rushing to 60. 
---
You can choose to play on a low pop realm.
---
 Botting is getting taken care of but. The way not banning is done is that it is done in waves so that people programming the botting can't precisely figure out what got them banned. 
---
Don't like wPvP? Don't roll on a PvP server.
---
People complain but you can actually fix 3 of your 4 problems yourself.
---
Bruh warlock is THE caster counter to rogue. If you have 1 GCD free to get sacrifice off he looses everytime.
---
If you think I wasn't angry and miserable when I was placed on a team of idiots in vanilla then you're dead wrong. People get angry because they care. People don't get angry because theu don't care. You're allowed to get angry - even playing games.
---
No, but fire is naturally stronger and you get enough good gear by then that it starts to shine. Fire is pretty strong.
---
You'll still be spamming Frostbolt if you do MC or BWL at that point, but your gear will be so good that it won't gimp you.
---
There's a boss that requires you to spam Frostbolt in AQ as well. But you won't need to respec.
---
Ignite gives stackable crits so that dot can become completely op. One lucky mage is gonna stomp dmg done while all the others does decent
---
In theory, but if you get multiple resists you have to take a few hits before you can get them regrouped.  If you get more than 1 resist per CoC several times you gonna die or OOM yourself reapplying Ice Barrier
---
Also, multiboxers. I know Blizzard likes the extra subs, but that never sat right with me. Seems like cheating but I might be wrong. 
---
Just seems shady and could be exploited, in some way.
---
Hopefully not. Mine has a few 60% people in it. No idea how they got in, probably am oversight from when the discord was growing. They are being told to get their 60's, though.
---
Basically a 60% is most likely not going to make it past the half point of the map, which makes them more or less useless.
---
There are some people who stay behind to defend or take other objectives but they still should have a 100% so that they don't get picked off when relocating.
---
From another perspective -- whenever I see an opponent on a slow mount I kill them... 95% of the time. Because it's just a free kill (they are usually undergeared people, too).
---
Oh, so like /say
---
You don’t lose durability to PvP kills.
---
People pay upwards of 60-65g for just 1 level? Wtf
---
i have 2 manned it with priest warrior, we skipped the cannon master wing because of the stuns there 
---
we could have possibly used mind control and done it or if your healer is pala he can freedom you 
---
i feel like it can be done with 2 man healer combo especially if you guys are arms can just cleave the lot of it
---
Oof, letting a paladin roll on Mageblade over casters sucks.
---
MS&gt; OS is the generally accepted etiquette. If you want to roll on something else just ask your groups 8/10 times they wont say no. What pisses people off is people rolling for offspec without even asking.
---
Our guild's been pretty lucky so far. We've gotten 4 bindings (3 garr &amp; 1 geddon) and 2 eyes. Thankfully our MT has both bindings so we're in the same position. BWL can't come soon enough.
---
I would make a support ticket asking this same question. You might get an automated response but you might also get someone who can help you.
---
No it's not, which was exactly my point :)
---
Actually living in a cave lul
---
That only works if the mobs are green for the level 60.
---
That is not true, the buff icon still shows but you dont get the stats
---
Yeah, check the link at  [https://youtu.be/6AemVOnzKn0](https://youtu.be/6AemVOnzKn0)  for how to solo for the key
---
Once you have one [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwAd\_LO0mAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwAd_LO0mAI) shows how to loot the cache (you basically stealth + aggro on a ledge and get naked/suicide after jumping down and looting)
---
Nightscape boots are good for this but thankfully those are BoE
---
Problem with 60% mount is that it is, on average, reflective of character progression. YES, every ten years a leet PVP’er has a 60% mount at this stage, but that’s not the case the other 9,99 years.
---
I’m realistic.  I know that 100% is significantly faster.  But I also know that people with 60% mounts can equally contribute in AV and my point is that the exclusionary parts of this game (like saying you can’t play with us because you didn’t get 1k gold) are really toxic and make it less of a game.
---
Alliance premades rely on an all offense strat. A couple warmasters and a clean Drek pull is the fastest way to win. 60% mounts do not lend themselves to an all offense strat. You're basically bait for Horde mages to slow. So I guess your only real purpose is to stall and die behind the epic mounts.
---
Who was I 13 years ago?  I forget.

Lmao, anyone else see the dude who left the snarky reply without reading the post then deleted it once he realized it made no sense?

LOL I remember being so upset in vanilla about the Christmas hat turning my female troll bald that I put in a bug report ticket. Some things never change 😂
---
&gt; You can change your battle tag on the bnet website however.
---
He could still add the characters as friends to spy on them. She wants to be completely anonymous.
---
This sucks.
---
Ya. He was laughing about it. Like it just showed how dedicated he was.
---
High value items should always be rolled need even if you cant use it, that way you avoid drama, tue dude that says he needs it cuz it bis or whatever and then put it in the AH, etc.
---
Are you sure it doesn’t proc for boomkin? I literally swing my staff as a boomer
---
I mean, why not? You can farm 65g/hr as a mage, why waste time for doing less?
---
Still can't really setup a flight path hellcamp in that timespan.  Might go hunt levelers in azshara or plaguelands though
---
This post is so cringe lmao
---
No, but make sure you also have 3/3 Elemental Percision on the first row. It is a bigger damage increase than the casting speed due to less full misses.
---
Yes all gear is bid on. Then at the end of the raid all profits are evenly distributed throughout all raid members.
---
Watch Frostradamus on YouTube and go to his stream. He does this with mage and mines nodes with the rogue alt.
---
You click on it and you get a dusty tome with no name or icon and it disappears without it going into your bag. I've tried shift-click and regular click, it can happen with either method.

I'm upvoting this to lower the righteous orb price haha
---
Heartseeker?
---
"Everything I don't like is an exploit, wahhhhh"
---
if you can't rely on 39 random people to do the right thing then you can't rely on 4 people to do the right thing.  the standard loot rules according to this should be to need everything all the time no matter what.
---
nah, the real reason is there's no accountability in AV.  just like the real reason all need epics is a thing is because you can easily convince a few people to need on something worth a lot, and then everybody has to, and then nobody's held accountable for stealing it.
---
Ignoring is not an options because she wants to be completely anonymous in regards to him. Maybe leaving the guild would be an option (main has raid spot/some gear) but he would still be able to stalk her albeit not being able to communicate with her.
---
Most toxic subreddit I’ve ever been a part of by leaps and bounds. In-game is actually pretty chill.
---
Months ago my buddy made a bot that is ridiculously simple. He didn't try and make it act like a human at all. I was astounded he wasn't banned after the first day. He is still going strong with it.
---
They very likely got banned unless people doing actual mob grinding/BGs were less detectable. I used it for leveling because I had just joined a high-end guild on a new server that required multiple alts, leveled 3 characters to 100 and never touched it again for any reason, 3-4 months later 6 month ban.
---
This occurs only occasionally, I have gotten legit tomes as well.
---
That will never happen.
---
Rip game. Fun to see the unfinished parts. Hope we’ll see some of them finished someday.
---
&gt; you can't rely on 4 people to do the right thing
---
exactly right, which is why everyone should need any BoE's of value.
---
In Raids yes, but so far I've never seen anyone complain in Dungeons if somebody rolls on a different spec gear, especially since specs are pretty meaningless in there (your tank might be a Fury War and your Healer might be a Shadow Priest).
---
I have a feeling this is it. I did have a sense of urgency to get past the mobs and FD, maybe to keep my pet from dying. I'll try to take a deep breath, be patient, and slow my roll a hair. Thanks!
---
Agree, probably better for tank to have it.
---
Retail gets a new patch in the middle of january. So BWL comes out most likely at the end of february
---
Except horde wins 85% of the time if you're not in an alliance premade...
---
nerf the honor, you'll all premades go wsg. its simple, the premade wants it , and everyone elses want it :D
---
not an AI person myself, but wouldn't that be because the machine learning essentially picks up patterns in a way like humans do and they aren't considering all of the possibilities every time? Much like a grandmaster isn't considering every move, they are considering the moves that have worked in the past or moves to deal with a certain situation with a favorable outcome. For example, you're in check, you can't even bother thinking about moving a pawn 1 or 2 spaces if it doesn't capture the piece putting you in check or block the check, so there's no need to even waste time on it. Or is it more to do with the fact that they don't need to consider those permutations after they are no longer viable and they follow patterns until that point?
---
I didn't know that I'd want to read up on chess ai...
---
vendor price doesn't change either.
---
if you plan to equip an item, that means it's worth more than the gold value to you.
---
Usually MS&gt;OS doesn't apply to weapons... It's more like, holy priest vs shadow priest, feral vs resto, etc. DPS is DPS.
---
I'd talk to whoever is running the pug beforehand and if you think they're gonna screw you over just put two daggers in your hands and pretend.
---
&gt; I think bots are going to destroy this game. Honor bots pushing people with jobs and lives even further down in standings.
---
You must have missed the post describing his rankings work. 
---
The amount of time you’d have to put in to reach R10 and beyond would pretty much force you to quit your job and have no life. 
---
Just like it was in Vanilla. 
---
Honor Bots are likely a response, in part, to that reality.
---
Discuss it when it drops with ur group. On pve/rp servers its all greed, on pvp servers its all need. If you need without asking youre a douchebag, if you dont let someone need it after they asked and its their BiS its rude too.
---
&gt; Except for that the tank threat at this gear level is not equipped to deal with a close to bis arms warrior threat nvm fury.
---
That's interesting considering there are plenty of tanks holding threat from warriors doing over 1k dps. 
---
&gt; It’s also beneficial to the raid team to let you stay pvp specced for the grind to the blue pvp set,
---
You know what's more beneficial to the raid team? You come to the raid as a proper pve spec and still grind your honor when you're not raiding. 
---
If you just wana raid as Arms that's fine, you do you, but pretending that there are valid reasons outside of 'because I want to' is incorrect.
---
Looks more like a black Christmas to me
---
&gt;10 hours of farming
---
Right.  Because 80g+/hr farms exist.
---
Not all classes can farm at equal speed.  And not all farms available to certain classes pay the same.  Assuming that everyone can farm at 80g/hr is the perfect example of how out of touch with lower geared players you are.
---
And yet you call others toxic. Perhaps it's time to look into a mirror.
---
Is it a valuable BoE item?
---
If yes, Roll Need.
---
If no or you don't care, defer to group.
---
I wouldn't ever leave it up to chance with random's that they will all act altruistically.  Even if everyone agrees to pass to a certain person someone can still hit need and then their internet accidently 'drops out' and woops now that guy doesnt get it.
---
Even if it were going to be passed to someone roll need and hand it to that person.  No one can Ninja if everyone rolls need.
---
Really think if the type of people who lose their shit about losing a roll on a BoE epic are the type of people who would pass on an epic for someone else or if they need it to fund some other prebis crafted item they need...
---
Same goes for patterns regardless of profession.
---
1.4 
---
Aq patch mostly added new items to dungeons, that aren't available in classic yet.
---
Most of the buffs were in patch 1.4, it was the big overhaul patch for caster gear
---
A low pop server is an unhealthy server tbh.
---
&gt; vendor price doesn't change either.
---
Right, equipping an item like Savage Gladiator Chain is more valuable to the person equipping it than the ~3g pittance vendoring it would give anyone who ninjas it. 
---
&gt; if you plan to equip an item, that means it's worth more than the gold value to you.
---
No it doesn't, you could literally go buy it 10 minutes later for the same gold value.
---
Is this good for Spriests or should I go after something else?
---
Yes but if they're struggling to clear he should be consuming his health, and he doesnt want a dps loss so he  shouldn't be bandaging unless completely necessary.
---
Issue is players are queue dodging.  If they don't like the comp the other side has, they change queues.
---
Biggest fix is for Blizzard to put the 'deserter' debuff on anyone who declines a BG pop up.  This would fix a ton of problems with the Alliance dodging games.
---
Theres voichat next to the chatbox, use it for pug raids all the time!

They usually do ban waves because they’re throwing a wide net and also analyzing what code is being used and how it works. 
---
WoD has massive ban waves and many people I know got their accounts banned. 
---
I’m sure a couple of people you know got banned.

---
Well just knowing what zone somebody is in is not inherently a problem, so what is the issue? There's either harassment or there's not.
---
Hardcore grinding SGC is a little silly. Mind you, me saying that is a bit hypocritical because I have it as a paladin, but the only reason I have it is because I help out my guildies farm hoj and second wind all the time. When SGC dropped for us, the warrior already had it and I got it. Felt good.
---
Imaging thinking you can Ban people for "Abusing" the ah.
---
by Abusing he means literally using TSM for Scans and Sniping Items.
---
I'm just speaking in generalities since you said it didnt matter when you sleep but how much you sleep. Routinely staying up until 5 am and wrecking your sleep schedule is, outside of getting addicted to a drug, maybe the worst thing you can do for your well being.

I think undead and orc are really cool, I was unaware of the ramifications of making that choice!
---
&gt;You still can farm instances and make money, farms.
---
Yes and Blizzard has spoken about how this is a problem. They introduce money sinks like mounts or the Black Market AH on Retail in an effort to take gold out of the economy and reduce inflation rates
---
Or you could just do DM N and get Ogre Forged hauberk (easiest) or Breastplate of Bloodthrist (expensive) :)
---
OSRS is also plagued by the bot issue. It’s a sad thing that seems to happen with these reinstated games from long in the past. Anyone have any guesses as to why? Does blizzard/jagex just not care that much about these specific titles and only their retail servers?
---
Hunter can do solo tribute runs. Lock can solo jump runs with path glitches. Mages print gold. All are viable.
---
Interesting. Can you explain why?
---
And this is why despite all its faults retail is superior in so many ways.
---
I'll be honest here, I don't think buying gold is a pathetic thing to do, if you work a lot of hours and don't have the time to farm mats yourself etc, and just want to have fun in-game when you actually get to play, I see no issue with that, yeah it's against the rules, but that's life.
---
I solo DME jumprun as elemental shaman. I kill satyr patrols, Hydrospawn and Sacrifice boss, then i take last boss to 50% and reset so i can get the rich thorium. Once you get the hang of it, you can easily get 4 runs per hour. Really good g/hour.
---
That’s bullshit it’s way easier to sustain cooperation with 4 people than with 39. The more people there are, the harder it is.
---
ItemRack has been broken since the patch. Doesn't let you swap weapons in combat even though it should.
---
in short yes - every item is sold to highest bidder and at the end of the raid profits are split between participants. You either get your items or make a killing.
---
The majority of people grinding for honor right now shouldn't be.  Not that they should do nothing but because of the massive competition and few slots for gaining max rank points, waiting to start the serious grind after the first wave gets their R13/R14 is only going to help your sanity.
---
+SP will be worth it later once you hit endgame dungeons and raids, but while leveling Int and Stamina are more important.
---
Disagree.. barely any aoe, cant do DM solo runs. Am i missing something or u talking about efficient leveling with selfheal?
---
Because I have extensive Private Server experience playing vanilla for the last 10 years or so, I knew that Loliance would fail hard after the first few days, when the geared Raiders would quit AV after they got Exalted status.
---
So, I made sure to queue all day in the first 2 days the BG was out and Alliance were winning 9/10 games, even as PUGS, because we Raiders with full epic gear and consumables were carrying all the bads.
---
I haven't even touched PvP at all since the first 2 days AV was out after I got exalted. 
---
I really like raid logging once every week. It allows me to enjoy WoW while having a life too.
---
it 100% procs off each mind flay tick. only activates on initial swp application
---
"bye everyone I have a dream girl, house, car and career"
---
r/classicwow: Lol fuck off no one cares
---
"YOU'RE ALL JEALOUS OF ME"
---
&gt;Right, equipping an item like Savage Gladiator Chain is more valuable to the person equipping it than the ~3g pittance vendoring it would give anyone who ninjas it.
---
you can't know that either.  someone can value 3g higher than you could possibly imagine, because these values are all subjective 
---
&gt;No it doesn't, you could literally go buy it 10 minutes later for the same gold value.
---
assuming you have the gold, that it's on the AH or whoever wins it sells it to you.  anything on the AH has a variable price as well, there is no "same" gold value there
---
They are helpless in game: were heavily camped in wPVP to the point the game was indeed hardly playable for them, are losing most of the matches in AV now and WSG isn't popular since AV hph is better. PVP ranks require way more honor for the alliance, so people burn out far more quickly.
---
They come here to vent: people who are toxic enough do it more vocal by talking shit, people who aren't just express their silent agreement by upvoting. 
---
Not a rocket science: to me, that's a completely understandable behavior.
---
Some people have friends and resources.  People who want to craft them gear like this so their group becomes stronger.  I feel like anyone who is tasked to do this alone is in the wrong type of group or raid, but that's just me and how I experience the game.  I feel like if this item is open-rolled it comes from a pug, so I guess grats on the luck.  This type of weapon though was meant to be a group achievement and used to further progress the raid you got it in.
---
i see the problem. but again, its the best honor/hour, so we have to do it. if Wsg was better we would be in there  
---
plz nerf av honor :&lt; coming from a ranker.
---
That would kill the price on pristines sadly
---
Not libram of focus to be more specific
---
Engineering is pretty cheap to lvl up using a guide my server I got my 19 twink to 150 for under 40g and that's farming nothing but holding my moss agates n tigerseye or w/e it's called while leveling. Like a week ago
---
When I hit 60 I dropped it all for eng n Alch on my main. This was in p1 tho and I did it 1 to 300 in like 30 mins for around 150g
---
amazing when it procs off mind soothe
---
Look, she said it's bothering her when he knows when she is on and what she is doing.
---
Sub money doesn’t know it’s source..
---
You mean kind of like how it is in classic? Bwl, AQ, and Naxx all will be cleared day 1 by serious guilds such as onslaught.
---
Just like TBC, it's old content that everyone knows the ins and outs of by now.
---
I’ve been addicted to having a game to devote a ton of time to. First runescape 2, then wow, then osrs/wow back and forth and finally classic. 
---
I adored leveling up but realized like you said, I’m not the same person anymore. I don’t want to commit 2-3 nights and 4-10 hours a week to raiding and especially not in 40 man raids where the spirit of the game isn’t the same as before and you’re very likely to be boned over loot because the content is easy and figured out. Despite this I leveled two more 60s and thought I was just playing the wrong class. 
---
Luckily a couple of days ago I realized that I’m not going to have fun in classic no matter what as dungeons are side content after phase 1, bgs are cancer due to the players, and I just don’t want to raid. I’m sure I’ll play classic and retail more in the future but it’s nice to know I at least understand my stance and I don’t have to enjoy the game or have a game I’m devoting my time to. I can play single player games, do art, and other hobbies. 
---
This sounds stupid but I’m sure many of us are in the same situation because we grew up like this. I hope this helps even a single person.
---
I guess the tanks I play with are shit then, but instead of throwing a hissy fit ill let them do them, stay arms and still let some rage go to waste, even looking at heroic strike lands me face flat on the floor doing 0dps
---
That’s because arms is a better dungeon spec. It’s better for AOE and bursting, but not as good for sustained dps on a single target (raids).
---
He’s joking. Go hunter if you want easy mode and want to never die. Mage has aoe farm and can go faster but you can sometimes get overwhelmed.
---
With enough resto shammies the extra windfury from an enhance goes to no one.
---
TBC doesn't neccesarily have to be 2.4.3 like classic is. Classic had the issue of missing information prior to 1.12, but that is not the case for TBC as they stated doing full logs at 1.12.
---
But it'll be easy content none the less.
---
Totally agree with you. Alliance would not have done anything different.
---
However, that does not change the fact that the players who chose horde to have easy mode pvp is responsible for the mess we are in.  The massive overpopulation of horde players is because of the superior racials.
---
well i'm holding out hope most of the botters will eventually get banned but who knows with blizzard
---
Proper prep for this matchup begins at level 1 by rolling Orc Warlock
---
Nope. I straight up did not see the word "gold."
---
Downvote the sh%! out of me!
---
Projecting.  XD
---
&gt; you can't know that either.
---
Lol, I can be pretty damn confident with a small amount of common sense. 
---
&gt; assuming you have the gold,
---
Not my problem. 
---
&gt; anything on the AH has a variable price as well, there is no "same" gold value there
---
The point was if a mage looks up the price of a freezing band, and a warrior looks up the price of a freezing band, it will be the same. The price doesn't change depending on who loots the item. It's worth the same amount of gold to everyone, the price it currently sells for.
---
it's pretty good but not worth the time cause you get anathema quickly
---
&gt;  Let me be completely clear; you don't know how to play this game.
---
If you want to get world buffs and pad damage logs so you can compete for the luckiest RNG on Warcraft Logs, that's cool. But the rest of us are playing World of Warcraft Classic, not Warcraft Logs
---
Join a rp pve server and you get everything you wish for! Player-reputation is important, alot of chill people and noone of the toxic shit like u read on reddit (unless u join cross-server BG)
---
&gt;I just want to have fun in-game at the expense of other players experience! Yay!
---
Yeah, nothing pathetic about that *at allll*
---
Congratulations, youre **literally** the problem!
---
The DPS in the fastest run we’re running with the Windsor’s frenzy 10 minute buff that they are switching people out with. It gives 65% melee attack speed to everyone in range. 
---
That is a serious contributor to how much damage they are putting out and it’s not a realistic buff to use unless you are pushing for the fastest clear time. 
---
Comparing this guild to a 1.5-2hr MC run will do more for improving them than comparing to a speed run.
---
Due to how threat works, I'm not standing within 10ft of the tank just so I can hear his voice chat.  I would much rather be 20-30 from the tank and healing with less threat, cleaves, and random AoE.  
---
This is why proximity based comms are a bad idea.  You don't have an indication of who is nearby.  So the guy that got split up or is slightly behind the group is going to lose 90% to 100% of what is said because he is just out of range.
---
WoW does have proximity chat, it is /say.  If you want to use a proximity method that badly, use it instead of party/raid/bg.
---
That implies that the maximum value for any BoP is equal to the vendor price. I guarantee that the value of a bis bop is far greater to that person than its vendor value. If somebody needs on something that they genuinely need as an upgrade, and you roll need because you want to vendor it, you are a ninja, and in my opinion, an asshole. That's why there are two options. 
---
If you want something that you dont NEED, but would like to sell for cash, then your desire for it is rather greedy in comparison, hence need and greed. And also, people shouldn't have an equal chance at all loot- why should somebody have to share the chance for bis so somebody can get 10g? That's absolutely ridiculous
---
And you're helping by saying "Eh just don't bother"?
---
What's the deal with your A1, A2, S1 etc.. keybinds.  Can you set the A key to act as a surrogate Alt key natively, or do you need an addon to do this?
---
There are emote wheels you can import, too. Just search for opie snapshots! Easy to import
---
No one cares.
---
This is the way
---
because if you are at a disadvantage because of the faction you chose and simply fix the problem by throwing money at it you're paying to win
---
Such a weird feeling when the one or two offweeks something like this drops.  At least you kept it in guild, grats on the high roll buddy.
---
How do you start the next pull with everybody still in can you walk out reset go to the portal and when they're done just walk out and back in?
---
nope, there is not enough mobs, once you are done with ashenvale. its almost nothing.
---
Pretend you are a Chinese government official and I'm sure Blizzard will remove them.
---
Can confirm. 
---
Officer of guild, threat capped on bosses, still spent 100g to come to raid yesterday despite being on the pvp grind. 
---
Lead by example
---
Get Eye of Rag
---
Profit
---
Yeah that's true. I have money to burn so I'm buying my warrior upgrades every few levels
---
Literally all of the other warriors in my guild have it but me. And I'm one of 2 MTs lol. It's become a meme for me at this point lol
---
Money brick
---
Hate to be the party pooper but this sounds like a bug. You shouldn't be able to use any consumable while sheeped.
---
I doubt that, since the premade I run lost 3 games total of the hundreds they have going daily.
---
&gt; Classic had the issue of missing information prior to 1.12, but that is not the case for TBC as they stated doing full logs at 1.12.
---
If they cba to do that with vanilla, why would they with TBC?
---
and remember when they also said that the vanilla client didn't even exist?
---
Agreed, but the people who cared already did it and now they're farming honor.
---
The raids are still more fun than classic raids, and in TBC we also have a ranking system in the form of arenas to separate the noobs from the good players unlike the rank 14 grind wich is a pve snoozfest in AV, where the only limiting factor to your success is wether you have a job or not.
---
Then you would surely have bought it already?
---
Thousand needles is *like* thunderbluff but ya know not as green
---
We’re talking about AV, not arena. You don’t have to have a team full of leet pvp’ers to win/get decent honor. You need people who know what the objectives are and to focus on them.
---
I know a bunch of people who have bought gold, no action so far. Probably the site or he was a bit obvious in game maybe?
---
black diamonds matter
---
Horde is better for PvP at the character select screen.
---
This led to the idea that horde is better at PvP, which led people who wanted to PvP to the horde. 15 years later they rerelease a game where horde is better at the character select screen, and more serious PvPers picked that faction.
---
As a result, Horde randos are better than alliance randos in two ways.
---
Most of the time I don't sell DM loot because I can do another run in the time it takes to find and get a buyer in. Still do good gold/hour.
---
TBC has inherently much faster progression than classic, sure the raids are cleared fast but it still took people months to reach 60 and start raiding.
---
in TBC ppl will reach 70 in lets say  3 days and then clear most raid content all the way up to mt Hyjal in 2 nights, easily.
---
So my assumption of what will happen in TBC is: ppl will level up to 70, enjoy it for a month and then quit after the initial tier4/5 rush. As thats what happens on literally every TBC pserver where they aslo start at lvl 1.
---
Yeah I agree this is way gross but I guess the game from 2004 has a community with a sense of humor to match. :(
---
Tell guild leadership of this behavior and see if they will take action. If they don't take action against an abusive stalker, then leaving the guild isn't that bad of an option. You can always pay for a server transfer. Create a character with the same on the new server and you will be prompted to change you name when your transfer. 
---
I forgot if battletags are still changeable. Contact customer support to find out?
---
You can have the 60 follow u not in group and u tag the mob then he kills. U get everything as if u were solo.
---
He can run u thru dungeons. But the way dungeon xp works is it takes the number of players and their lvls and give u a group lvl which everyone gets xp based on that lvl so if u are running dungeons just take a few mins and spam for people to join on alts for runs with 1 60 and 4 20s u can get 40 percent lvl in 1 stock run rested.
---
Can get alot of gold in tips for ur 60 pal too I know when I run a Guildie or something they norm spam for alts paying 2g a run ea in stocks.
---
Hope this helps.
---
This... I can get on board with this.
---
To be fair there are a few disadvantages, it usually creates a fairly mercenary attitude to get the content done with as few people as possible and the item goes to the person paying the most.
---
Oh and you absolutely have to trust the raid leader. We're talking about sometimes 10.000g worth of trust. 
---
Its very good for casual content though and a very easy way to dodge loot drama.
---
You would probably need to count satyrs...which I think are a form of long-corrupted Night Elves?
---
60% mount doesn’t exactly go hand in hand with proper PVP gear and game knowledge, no matter how you want to spin it
---
&gt;The addon would simulate real life talking distance. Anything outside the 10+ feet you wouldn't be able to talk/hear, unless of course maybe there would also be a settings option that would allow range to be unlimited for dungeon groups.
---
I guess you didn't read this.
---
Good for the AoE section of the AQ40 tunnel, no?
---
Because diamonds are not best friends, even vendors don't want them
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20030/pet-rock](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20030/pet-rock)
---
....no, I just don't want people to be able to have alt accounts to populate pre made groups with 80 people and roll them with their mains and run the honor through the roof...
---
I don't see the problem with having queues for av honestly... it's exactly how it worked in vanilla, it does not put you at a disadvantage...
---
the problem that horde have is that they think being in premades gives them some kind of advantage.
---
here's what's actually the best possible outcome for premade alliance and solo queue horde...
---
8 minute games where horde get between 2500 and 3500 honor from capping towers and killing lts/cmss and then the game is over back into queue and go farm stuff while you wait...
---
alliance will get in an extra game or two between every horde queue due to FACTION imbalance in favor of the horde, but both teams will get a good amount of honor and be able to progress.
---
I think the DOWNSIDE to alliance having instant av queues is what we already see where people are able to play 18 hours a day chain queue av's and make the honor caps upwards of 2 million honor a week...
---
but yeah, victim complex, got it.
---
Tldr; Could find tank for Wc, so dpsdruid went tank. OP likes the social interaction and pace in classic more than retail.
---
If you want to split honor by 8 for 8x times the money sure I guess.
---
can we fucking stop suggesting that poor people don't deserve to have hobbies, please?
---
Been saying this since day 1, wow is easy. The only difficult part is having a competent circle of friends to play with. I laugh so hard every time I see these tryhards on classic, like go play a different game if you’re trying to treat this game like ur job hahah
---
This. You can't "need" gold. Need should be reserved for equipping and the only reason people are forced to all need is because of ninjas. You have to protect yourself.
---
Most of these 'myths' are not even myths.
---
&gt; Leveling will be hard and take time.
---
Relative to retail, it is. Go back to posts from September and you'll see a ton of them relishing how punishing it was to accidentally pull one too many mobs, or 5 minute corpse runs in the Barrens.
---
&gt;Raids will be hard and challenging.
---
Nobody was talking about MC, and in Vanilla without 1.12 itemization even  MC was relatively hard and chalenging.
---
Meanwhile there are still raids that wipe on Ony due to phase3 transition or deep breaths.
---
&gt;Open World Bosses were fun and promoted good PVP.
---
Have you got into any big world boss battles yet? Because they're still amazing and as good as advertised.
---
&gt;World PVP is fun and what real wow players do.
---
Without the honor system and/or inflated server pops and/or imbalanced factions due to Blizzard's lack of foresight ... world pvp is fun.
---
&gt;If the opposite faction ganks you, call your friends for back up.
---
Happens all the time.
---
&gt;Epic 100v100 PVP battlesw are fun.
---
They are fun, when the servers can handle it.
---
&gt;Warsong was the most effective PVP grind and was a true show of PVP skill.
---
Warsong was the most effective PvP grind in vanilla. Classic is using a broken late-game version of AV that ruined it, so this wasnt a myth this was something Blizzard fucked up (royally). And yes, compared to other forms of PvP, it was a much more significant show of PvP skill.
---
&gt;Queue times for the horde won't be that bad because of cross realm battlegroups.
---
Finally an actual myth. 
---
For the first few days this was true. Nobody could predict just how much more willing to PvP horde are than alliance. Across all servers alliance have the majority, yet horde queue at almost twice the rate. Alliance raid log way more than horde it seems.
---
&gt;AV is fun and took hours to complete. &lt;----------------- You are here.
---
1.5 AV was fun and took hours to complete. Now i'm convinced you never even played Vanilla
---
&gt;Molten Core is a faceroll raid, but Black Wing Lair is actually hard.
---
When it's no longer to pug in LFG for every raid, this will prove true.
---
&gt;Black Wing Lair is face roll, but Zul Gurub is actually hard.
---
I dont know a single person that has ever claimed ZG is hard. You're just making stuff up now
---
&gt;The AQ opening event was fun and promoted great PVP.
---
On balanced servers this is true. This goes back to Blizzard being stupid and not regulating faction numbers from day 1.
---
&gt;Zul Gurub is face roll, but AQ 40 was actually hard.
---
AQ40 was fairly hard, but I dont think you would know one way or the other.
---
&gt;My guild skipped the one hard boss in AQ 40, but Naxx will actually force a challenge onto us.
---
Fewer than 100 guilds in the world ever cleared Naxx in vanilla. Part of that was due to time restriction, but if it wasn't hard it would have been cleared by everyone within a month.
---
We think we did, and we actually did.
---
&gt; The massive overpopulation of horde players is because of the superior racials.
---
Right.  Because the top clears of MC and all content going forward are Horde guilds, amirite?
---
Oh and escape artist, stoneform, and fear ward would like a word with you.  Have you ever fought a dwarf priest with a warrior as a horde priest and anything else?  Good night sweet prince.  Dwarven racials, priest and race, are OP in pvp.  More so than Will of the Forsaken.
---
The idea that people went Horde because of racials when the min/maxers are mostly Alliance is extremely funny.  Top guilds chose Alliance for the racials.
---
The massive overpopulation of horde players is because the races and zones are more interesting as a whole than the Alliance.  Not because everyone min/maxed to orcs and undead.
---
You're* and no I am not, as I don't buy gold, I make enough through playing myself, I just sympathise with people who have a hard work schedule and just want to enjoy certain aspects of a game in their spare time, I understand other peoples frustration at it, but I think when you get to a certain age you realise that things like this really aren't that important in the grand scheme of things, wow shouldn't be considered as something that important in your life that you think other people are pathetic for trying to make their enjoyment a little easier to accomplish.
---
I got bombofucked with honor rankings. I wake up at 7 and am home at 6. I can't play 20 hours a day to keep up with bots to get a decent honor rank.
---
It isn't that often that an item drops that reveals the true character of the random person you are with. If I am on my 50th run for a recipe and it drops I am not trusting in the kindness of strangers on the internet. I also don't have to; everyone just roll need ffs
---
Thanks for that, I'm glad people are enjoying the game but these blog posts are getting a bit out of hand &gt;&lt;
---
So just to clarify, you’re saying 5% crit and 140ap is a bigger upgrade than a fully raid geared bis warrior with all mc/ony drops?
---
Gotta love the Reddit armchair psychology lmao.
---
You talk about Vanilla progress as if it was better but guess what? I dont know who was the first 60 15 years ago, but i do know who was the first 60 in Classic, same thing about the first MC, Onyxia and the first 10 MCs of my server. There are still logs, speed runs and competition, just because you're not there it doesnt mean it isn't happening and right now, it is much harder to compete than 15 years ago.
---
You said it yourself, the bosses are laughable easy, then why would i go to raid every single week for a couple of hours if the raid simply isnt fun, it would be so boring, by trying to top the meters with a class that shouldn't do it i'm having a lot of fun, i add a lot difficulty to the game and make it a challenge, i didnt have to scout and farm Skul or do solo Lord Incendius runs but i did to get BiS items to do more damage and be better overall, if it wasn't for my desire to be a better player then i wouldn't have anything to do, what i gain by min maxing is fun.
---
I guess i should just quit a game that i enjoy tho, if i dont sit in TB at lvl 30 watching netflix while fishing then i have mental health issues.
---
Show us the logs of out dpsing fury warriors in MC, just curious.
---
&gt;  settings option that would allow range to be unlimited for dungeon groups.
---
So the wow voice chat client?  I did read it.  And the idea that you are making an addon to replicate Blizzard's voice chat and make it worse is not worth discussing.
---
Nowhere did I say that. But sure, if I'm not with you I must be against you, and theres only one other school of thought I could subscribe to.
---
Do you split honor with group members per kill?
---
Before you roll greed, it is definitely worth asking the group "hey that is my BiS, does anyone mind if I roll Need?" Worst that can happen is they say no.
---
The problem boils down to the fact that in a public group, they cannot verify if you legitimately equipped it, or if you already had the same item in your bags and are planning to sell the new unbound one on the AH. Rolling Greed also opens up the possibility of it being stolen by a last minute Need roll, which is why a lot of players adopt the "all need" mentality.
---
there's no common sense here, everyone has different opinions otherwise there wouldn't be ninjas in the first place, and it's not my problem if you don't win the roll for savage glad chain, we both had a fair shot at it and I got 3g for it.
---
if the mage is going to equip it than it doesn't matter what the price is, the mage values the item higher than the price.  it's worth more to the mage than it is to the warrior.
---
Best way to roll on black diamonds: is to bet on what number your roll will be with a friend(s) in discord. Then if someone guesses right, everyone else who betted x amount of gold, have to pay up the amount of the bet to the person who predicted their roll accurately.
---
Do you mean the Goblin Sapper Charge? o.o
---
Woosh buddy....
---
Losing with a high roll or losing by a small margin will always be more painful
---
Only boe world drop I've ever seen was calibrated boomstick and lost the roll by 1...
---
Go do DM E jump runs
---
If you are mining run in a loop in WS/EPL sell crystals
---
Herbalism self explanatory
---
Mages can farm DM
---
Hunters can farm DM
---
Warriors can reserve Orbs
---
Rogues can pickpocket BRD
---
etc etc
---
I am not out of touch people are just bad at the game. Even if its 40/g hour that is still 20 hours and wholly doable and easy to accomplish in 4 months.
---
I've just been using multiple ranks of mana gems to save money, the runes are stronger than lower ranks of mana gems if you need as much mana as possible though.
---
I was accused of botting just because I was auto attack farming winterfire veils (netflix). I think people are overblowing these issues
---
This.  Every DPS with a brain cell knows that tanks and healers are hard to get, but DPS can be replaced in an instant.  If you’re teamed up with a tank and the two of you each knows how the other operates, you can handle anything.  You might get the occasional DPS who complains (typically because they’re idiots who don’t realize it’s the tank’s job to lead) but you can dump those guys and replace them in a heartbeat.
---
I go to deadwind pass. Bot there. He ruins my farm for 4 weeks and i report him over and over again. One day he is gone. I rejoice. Next day new bot is there with a slightly different path.
---
I give up and go to badlands. First spot, bot there.
---
I try the second badlands spot. Bot.
---
I give up and play an alt.
---
Or everyone rolls greed unless they actually need it. You don’t NEED it if you’re going to sell it.
---
Remember, they also take up a bag slot, this could be a consideration to many.
---
Weapon procs shouldn't work in form
---
I cant even clear a dungeon in 26 minutes.
---
I’m not saying they should. 
---
But it’s adorable to pretend people will “appreciate you forever” if you help them gear up.
---
Kromcrush is sweet as horde.  We have advantage but Allies are not weak.
---
Gold can buy BiS though. It’s the exact same two sides arguing these two things every time this topic comes up.
---
We could call it something like a Terminator Bot.
---
Yep, grinded the Guardian Trinket from Timbermaw :)
---
Some people enjoy the grind, some people don't. I'm glad WoW has something to offer for both kinds of people.
---
Mostly MC geared Warlock thinking of swapping to Mage. Please convince me why I shouldn’t.
---
can you get banned?
---
53 rogue with leatherworking?  Which of the big 3 should I take?  Have plans for stormdshroud pieces already in the bank and a few dragon plans as well.  Devilsaur legs and gloves are bis, but I've got the legs stashed in the bank already too.  And tribal seems a bit useless.  Which should I take?
---
These are classic myths... he is talking about myths of how classic will be, not how vanilla was
---
and he's a ninja for it, because it was worth more than 600g to the mage.  the mage item dropped, not the warrior item, sorry ninja warrior.
---
What you are looking for is called a private server and they already exist...
---
I am not telling anyone how to play the game lmao. Someone I asserted obtaining an epic mount was difficult. It is not. People are shocked when they want their premade to actually function which requires an epic mount. 
---
Again. There is no more *important farm* than an epic mount. It is the the single biggest upgrade in PvE/PvP in the game. Period.
---
Hitting 60 and having 300 professions is not a "1% trait"
---
&gt;1.12 AV is the most retail version of a game which everyone played specifically to escape retail
---
I agree with you that 1.12 AV is the most "retail" part of Classic.  If you're trying to escape retail and you feel like AV is too retail like, pull a pro gamer move and don't play it.
---
Well when most of the alliance refuses to try and win, the ones that want to win will group up and exclude the idiots. I got tired of half my team dying in mid bc they have shit mounts. Tired of RP players turtling and summoning the tree. That’s great if that’s how you have fun, I don’t want you to not have fun. But when over half the alliance is consistently shitting up every AV because that’s their idea of “fun” this is what you’re left with.
---
Might get downvoted by RPers and that’s okay. I enjoy RP too. Let’s not pretend that everyone (esp in pvp culture) shares the same enjoyment from it tho.
---
Honestly I hate the macro/bot massive farm groups.  I remember recently at the start of 8.2, people in mechagon were getting pissed at this one group of bots that farmed rust feather.  They’d kill the thing every time it spawned, and wouldn’t give a callout that it appeared (which is what everyone was doing in Terenas at the time for all the rares)  it wasn’t even subtle, it was like ten toons named JohnOne, JohnTwo, etc.
---
That’s not to mention the auction house.  I think it balances out on big servers with super active guilds, but on med pop servers the prices of practically everything tank because of bots auto farming it up.
---
Yes. Take an Orc who's got full preraid BiS. With normal consumables (food, jujus, elixir) He's got **818** DPS (from classic warrior DPS sim)
---
Take that same Orc and give him every upgrade possible (Deathbringer, Onslaught Girdle, Quick Strike Ring, Ony Necklace, Puissant Cape, Wristguards of Stability, etc.) and the same food/consumables. Now he's doing **892* DPS.
---
Go back to the first Orc and simply give him the Onyxia buff. **944** DPS.
---
Obviously these are estimates but even within a few standard deviations the difference is clear.
---
The mage can still go buy it for 600g 10 minutes later, yet somehow it's worth more than 600g to him?
---
To be fair, as a mage, I reckon everybody should roll need on freezing band. There are a number of BoE BiS items in the game - freezing band may not be yours, but you can use the profits of the sale to then buy yours. Rolling need on freezing band then transitively results in you getting your BiS and so the argument could be made that you were rolling need on your BiS, just with some extra steps. And if you dont have a boe bis, then the gold goes towards your epic mount, which I would actually consider to be as important as a bis item.
---
What bed?  I picked Heartseeker as a Horde transfer from Sulfuras.  Then Alliance on multiple servers fled to Heartseeker and ruined the balance on their old servers and Heartseeker as a result.
---
The mechanics of the game encouraged toxicity.  That's all.  And as gamers, we exploit mechanics to the best of our abilities.  So if camping flight paths and towns resulted in the most honor per hour, guess what?  It doesn't matter which faction you are, if you want R14, you are doing it.
---
The noble Alliance Chad doesn't exist.  Both sides are scum for what they did prior to release of BGs.  Stop trying to blame Horde for the same exact thing I saw Alliance doing.  You are wholly misunderstanding what happened and trying to place blame on everyone who either disagrees or rolled a different faction.
---
WoD was great for raiding. Highmaul was okay, but visually beautiful, BRF was a great raid tier. Loved the train boss and H&amp;F. HFC was pretty good as well but was spoiled by being stuck there for a year.
---
Not in the way that the premades do AV. They will still be hoofing it to the boss when AV ends.
---
Dude. Fucking. Please.   
---
Every single player on every single server on both factions who isn't an absolute piece of shit (99% of players easy) spent 45 minutes getting corpse camped at every single flight path in every single zone for weeks.   
---
How can you be so fucking stupid and think this is an alliance only issue.
---
Think about it this way, I can make up the fact that I have an alt ready and waiting for a recipe, but at the end of the day you dont know if I am telling the truth or not.
---
&gt;We had Kuroma on Daggerspine hold R14 for....two years I think?  
---
what the fuck
---
Most of the minmaxing guilds chose alliance because of paladins and dwarf priest. Most players chose horde for the favored racials. 
---
Looking at guides on what class/race to chose leading up release, it is quite obvious at which races (and faction) was regarded the best for pvp. 
---
What apes and other try hard guilds did is not relevant for the average person. 
---
Hordes zones and races being more interesting is strictly subjective. As a curiosity, alliance was much more popular in vanilla. Why was this, if horde is so much more appealing?
---
How many times can you say "you don't like wow and it's okay" in one post lol sounds like projecting
---
nah, my advice is for everybody to appropriately greed items they plan to sell, and hold ninjas accountable for their actions like we did back in vanilla.
---
I agree, that's just obvious... but this thread became a circlejerk about how people who min/max are ''playing wrong'', everyone should play the way they enjoy the game but making fun of people who try to be better might be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen.
---
Dont forget the ammo, pet food. Where as mage u make ur food n water. :)
---
Their concern is that others are choosing to play it which is making it hard to queue for wsg games as there aren't enough players.
---
They have already pulled that pro gamer move, they're just waiting for others to as well.
---
&gt;Beep boop I'm a robot
---
I'm uncomfortable and unsure; his username.....Uh...hail to my new overlord?
---
Time man, TIME. Saving time when you have work, kids, etc. You can't put a price on it. I paid 250g for lvl XP Grinds. It just saves you so much time. Of course that was AFTER  I did my first 60.
---
For one it's not possible and for the other it is..
---
Archeage Unchain is even better..
---
That’s insane
---
Can't find a job, at least playing wow is a good time. Only got a week or so til my next rent payment that I can't make, so I'm enjoying my last few days of, ya know, having a house.
---
It is possible right now, but you pretty much need to be boosting a healer who is helping you. I had a mage boost my priest in Cath, and he would do the full instance in two pulls. He just had my priest helping bubble/heal at clutch moments.
---
So I'm not sure it's possible unassisted...
---
A Charles

FF 14 for pve and GW2 for pvp
---
You've missed his point. His point is that if you've seen it 100 times already, regardless of the slight variation, nothing compels you to read/comment. 
---
I like that it comes up often, as each time you get different people commenting, sometimes offering different perspectives. And as he says, if you get bored of it or dont care for added perspective, just keep scrolling
---
This was already a thing several years ago. Many top arena players were bots.
---
In my experience chat has got so much less toxic since the rep rush.
---
Good for you. I personally would have hated to do WC for 4 hours.
---
People are different. Thanks for the blog post.
---
There was a speedrun video a month or two ago that had stupid clips from other guilds run and shit, it was so obnoxious. I don’t think the West realizes that shit is a fucking turn off.
---
Also, bad music. Holy shit, some people listen to the worst goddamn music ever created. I’d rather stick my head inside a hurdy gurdy than listen to most of it.
---
There are mmos that are community focused but they have no community.
---
You’re not taking a break tho. Rankers don’t take breaks. You just fill the wasted time with world PvP, which takes more effort.
---
How can you afford to get mats for both Eng/Alch? TF
---
They used to, but its just not feasible. 
---
Lets say you worked 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year. It took you 15 minutes to indentify and ban a botter, and you took no breaks. 
---
in an entire year, you would manage to find and ban 8000 accounts. But in that same year, those 8000 accounts would only have to average 115 gold each before they were caught to still be profitable. 
---
In the same time you managed to reduce the profit margins of the botters marginally, blizzard would pay you 30,000 dollars plus benefits to do it. 
---
Its just not economically feasible for blizzard to do anything about it unless players stop buying the gold. Its why they've made gold buying and selling part of the retail experience, they literally couldn't stop them so they beat them on price and reliability.
---
And so the Bot Wars began....
---
BoE’s have always been a sticky situation. Since I usually tank that kinda defaults me as the group leader most of the time, and my rule is everybody needs on rare/epic BoE’s. Otherwise 99% of the time 4 people roll greed and the last person rolls need. Like clockwork.
---
When it comes to green BoE’s though most people don’t care if you need on them, but those are always greed rolled for the most part. If I need on something though I equip/learn it right then and there.
---
OK Boomer.
---
Important farm?  For who?
---
For priests, the most important farm is Benediction.  Epic mounts have 0 uses inside raids.  Getting your best weapon by miles is critically important.  The second most important is the Truefaith Vestments.  Again, best by miles without running Strat UD for ages for a robe that all healing classes need on.
---
Hitting 60 and 300 professions is not 1%.  Hitting 60 and then having 4 months to farm for your epic mount is.
---
A poo!? I could be selling my poo???!?
---
I've actually joined the AV premade alliance discord and snuck into the same channel if they're in my BG number (Horde ofc). Relay their strats, when they're pushing and if they're hopping fence. Had a 30 D 10 O game that lasted an hour. But to win against a premade felt good. Alliance turning AV into a glorified PvE dungeon is toxic.
---
They are part of a repeatable quest chain that craft the enchants to head, shoulders and legs, cant remember exactly, i know the +100hp to head was my best seller
---
Doubt it: https://youtu.be/wuZ2lwDc2Eo
---
Your computer is able to record what’s on your monitor.
---
Not being able to kill Rag... I mean your guild is most probably a bunch a downed syndrome people. Good luck at bwl.
---
&gt;the only people who buy it value it higher than than price, otherwise they wouldn't buy it, they'd keep the gold they value higher.
---
please stop repeatedly asking the same question I have answered several times
---
In my 125 jump runs I have yet to see Foror's. But, I have looted just about every other class book, and like 2 weeks ago I ran into 2 empty Dusty Tomes. So I'm not sure, because I still have yet to get my Foror's. About tired of farming DM-E lol.
---
That's some SERIOUS dedication
---
Getting into OSRS territory there.
---
&gt; the only people who buy it value it higher than than price
---
This just doesn't make sense.
---
They clearly value it in accordance with the price, which is why they're buying it.
---
Oof, these motherfuckers and their parses, shit. Our guild's ony strat is simple, if not the most efficient. White hits only in p1, wreck face in p2, no dps in p3 until tank is solid, and start slow. But you just *know* that some asshole is going to use their abilities and pull aggro, resulting in a breath on the raid. 
---
This strat is a bit slower, and won't get you a top parse, but if everyone can just chill, it works like a damn charm. Sometimes I want to tell the rogues to sit on their damn hands like a 5th grader who can't calm down.
---
I’ve used Nug combo and Nug energy. I like those.
---
Bots were definitely around in Vanilla, but ignoring that for now. The new versions of wow have a lot of protection against botting and if you go back to the old version it will have loads of problems. Any botting/hacking program that ran on 2.0 - current could be ported to potentially work on it (probably less true with hacking).
---
Trying to prevent bots is a losing game, you just want to make it so the people making the bots think its too much work and preferably go elsewhere. This is pretty much true for security in general, physical, or cyber.
---
Runescape
---
I love to see posts like this - feeling as if other players are aware of all this shit the same as me. 
---
It would actually be amazing to ser Blizzard take a stand and try to maintain the fact that they want to see their game live thru the ages and stand out as one of the last true MMOs. Then I think of the fact that they gave us Classic with a tweak, boosted items, nerfed elites, bosses that doesnt deal dmg - they made us suffer thru world PvP for 1 month and scared away even the most hardcore players from playing the game, encouraging zug zug mentality and taking every aspect of the game to a complete halt regarding enjoyement - then pumping bigtime streamers to blame private server community that the game is unplayable unless you find a spot so far off the grid - most players dont even have that spot explored in retail even if it gives you 10 achievements. We all thought - fuc c it - we wikl suffer thru it and WSG will be the new home for all the PvPers and even the casual players enjoys a solid fun PvP match of flag running and laughter, killing blows and murder. Little did we know that the pain had just started - we are now stuck in a Meta that allows bots to not only outfarm us in PvE - but also in PvP. Running to Drek as an alliance -  watching a green geared Warrior on a hamstring mount, killing every single Horde player on the way, Lt and commander - only to see our premade get ready to pull Drek perfectly and have OTs picking up War mastera while the rest of us burst down Drek like a sweet melody of thunder - and seconds before we start this symphony - this horses ass of a Warrior - just arrived after a long ride down south - he is programed to run to Drek and thats what he will do - running inside, pulling every single thing in the room and chaining them all to us - wiping us like a bunch of fruitloops and forcing us to start from the top of the map since none of the GYs are capped yet. 
---
This bot will prolly be rank 14 at the same time as me, maybe even earlier. 
---
Then I remember that this is not Blizzard - its activision and their puppet “you think you do but you dont”
---
I love what this game gave me in the past, the friends I made on private servers all the way from Phoenix Warsong, Emerald Dream to Nostalrius and even Vanilla retail - Wrath. 
---
I only see frustration everyday I log back to Classic, ppl losing hope, motivation and Blizzard cant even reply with ticket answers that makes sence - copy/paste shit which is only confusing players until they give up and then sends a fu c cing “you have been chosen to fill out a survey” 
---
I wanna send you a survey Blizzard - regarding wtf you want to achieve with your company
---
Have a nice day
---
we have 3 left...
---
I'm really surprised by this.  I get that there's a queue of tickets for them to go through, but if say 100 people are reporting Player X, I thought those tickets involving Player X would jump to the front.
---
If they leave attunements in, in their 2.1 state, then it would take weeks of clearing SSC/TK before you can even start in Hyjal.
---
You’d also have a week or two to get everyone attuned to Kara. Plus the OG SSC and TK attunements would keep you out of those for a few weeks while you got nightbane down and cleared heroics for those.
---
So. You’d only be correct if they release tbc without the attunements.
---
sometimes i feel like people on this sub really really don't like pvp
---
Thank you
---
That's going to depend on how many priests and druids you have. 
---
And a warrior takes a huge dps hit from spamming hamstring right? 
---
Final question for you, since efficiency is more important than class diversity; does your raid group allow hunters? Why bring a hunter when you could grab another warrior who could do significantly more damage?
---
Why not? It doesn't take all that long to identify a bot, even for folks without Blizzard access. Let's say a person can find a bot account every, I dunno, ten minutes. This seems fairly easy with server side access, and looking at trends. Once you find one, obviously, you can link across the account to every char on it. Plus, you can easily identify trends and find people doing the same thing on multiple servers. So once you find one, you can find others pretty fast as a GM. Plus, you have player reports to do most of the initial detection.
---
So, with all that, one every ten minutes. 
---
Assuming you work a nice, 40 hr work week, that's 240 bots/week. For one dude. If they'd had one dude on this since the game started, they would have indeed banned thousands.   
---
If they hired, say, ten GMs, well now we're cooking with gas.
---
maybe in your case. not in mine. spoken to other people on my server that have similar experiences to mine. i'm glad yours is a good one though. doesn't mean everyone elses is.
---
did you just say stalagg and easy rank in the same sentence?
---
bots farming honor is just stupid.. you will get banned eventually, and all that was for nothing. Bots farming gold is something interesting. 4 of My RL buddies and I once had a whole guild full of bots. A few years ago we probably farmed something like 2 mil a month each. All the gold was laundered in the guild bank. So even when we got banned we never really lost much. We all had a shared bnet account for the bots and for our mains. We went through ~10 accounts botting (2-3 actual bnets). Though after a while it got a bit boring, we had all the interesting tcg mounts (which we could all use since on a shared account xD), had connections with a guild to run us through the harder raids at the time. It was an interesting “experiment” but really killed the fun in the game. Our mains still remain unbanned, we should probably think about selling the account..
---
Stop worrying about what others are doing. Has no effect on you.
---
I guess for new wow player it is necessary.  My wife constantly asks me what class our encounter is. She even is confused by the concept of meelee and range.
---
You really need to read up on the TBC attunement process. The T6 content was locked behind a several month attunement process. They nerfed that process later as a catch up.
---
Yea, stop tryharding with your god damn keybinding!!
---
Ha, exactly this. Was leveling in the mid 50s with my wife in blasted lands and had multiple solo 60 horde try and fail to kill us. We are lock and priest and they always have a bad matchup, but they keep coming....
---
Hunters raise dps with trueshot, have tranq, longer pulls and do pretty good dps
---
No. No im not. I’m actually upset that my guild isn’t clearing mc faster at this point. I can’t stand not being the most efficient possible.
---
Ahh okay, thank you for the link!
---
LOL what are you talking about [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpuRcmPnSTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpuRcmPnSTM)
---
Don’t mind me - just waiting for my queue to pop while getting some work done
---
And they call it a mine. A MINE!
---
Sounds like you guys had much cheery memories of classic WoW than most of us did.
---
Early wow was defined by blatant cheating, botting and griefing with zero intervention from mods.
---
People literally make a living from bot farms on osrs, you don’t think that negatively affects the game?
---
Fake news, Taurens can use the DeathCharger mount from Baron.
---
One way opens the door up to for you to be a victim and the other way insures that everyone gets a fair shot at the item. This isn't difficult to understand.
---
10 ft is still out of meele range
---
Warriors too busy wiping their tears off their keyboard to respond :’(
---
Tell me more about how they weren't? I'm dying to know more about what playing as a horde character is like?   
---
How is me taking 45 mins rezzing and getting ganked trying to get into BRM different from you?
---
See, that’s what was holding me back at launch. But every raid I’ve been in has 2x the warlocks as Mages. I’ve not had a mage in a 5 man with me in over a month.
---
“You don’t take something someone can use.” 
---
Gold can buy a BiS item, you’re effectively taking that gold from everyone in the party because YOU want a BiS that’s available on the AH for gold value. Essentially what you’re saying is that a single person has more right to the value of the BoE than the other four people who contributed for it to drop.
---
Why not give us a general idea on how you’re aoe farming?
---
Spec? Rotation? Any items needed?
---
Mages don't have banish. Warlock tier sets look cooler.
---
Depends on where you live, I suppose.
---
I can understand if zero is really popular in the US, because the damn cornsyrup they put in everything is absolutely disgusting.
---
The U.S coke is not very good imo. So yeah, zero is definitely an upgrade there.
---
Personally I prefer regular coke where I live, but each to their own.
---
Leather working in general does not make money.  I would check what your guild needs.  Tribal certainly has the most relevant pieces for making money, and contains your BIS, but many people have already gone tribal, so the decision is yours.
---
&gt; Also you won't get gibbed running into BRM and moving with your guild to raid.
---
Was only relevant for a few weeks.  Prior to and after the Phase 2 roll out, you wouldn't be gibbed running into BRM.  Moving with an epic mount during Phase 2 didn't increase your odds of survival either with raids of Mages and sapper charges waiting for you.
---
&gt; accumulate gold much faster starting a snowball effect.
---
This is flat wrong.  The majority of your travel time is on flight paths or on foot.  Going from 0 to 60 is a huge boost.  Going from 60 to 100 is helpful but hardly relevant.  When you compare the time spent farming in dungeons to the travel time to the dungeon, you spend less than 5% of that on your mount and if anyone has a 60% mount, you didn't gain anything by using a 100%, you just got there faster.
---
The mount speed matters the most for open world farming of herbs, nodes, and certain mob drops.  If you have to travel for a significant distance in the world on mount, then it makes sense.
---
&gt; greens and 25 people
---
No, you can't.  You can clear in greens.  Or you can clear with 25 people.  You aren't doing both.  The healing required isn't massive but if you want to clear in under 2 hours, you need gear or more people.
---
&gt; roll into BRM with raid buffs
---
If your guild is rolling with raid buffs, you are going for a speed clear.  If you can clear in greens or with 25 people, raid buffs and the time it takes to acquire them is irrelevant.  And if you are going for a speed clear, you are already in the 1% which makes this moot.
---
&gt; Also you won't be able to PvP in any premade so you probably don't have Don Julio as BiS or your OHs.
---
Okay?  Why do I need to PvP in a premade?  I'm horde and we can't really premade AV.  Also, the OH from AV is good but not as good as Benediction, so while I'd like it, I'm not losing sleep over it.
---
The fact of the matter is that casual players do not gain substantial advantages from epic mounts once you look at the underlying gains and time saved.
---
It's not really a dream for some people though.. I just hit rank 6, on track to hit 7 soon no reason I cant hit rank 8 over the next several weeks. All i want is the rank 8 chest and legs anyways. Rank 14 is obviously a pipe dream though. 
---
That being said I will be spamming AV to get there as WSG honor is garbage in comparison even though I'd rather do it over AV.
---
Yes, worth trying but you might find very mixed results.  A 75% guild run with a few pugs is different than a true full pug.
---
This is one reason I'm so glad I decided to stop playing classic after the first couple days. It just wasn't the same. It isn't vanilla, it's "classic". And I quickly realized it would be the same bullshit on repeat. bots and IMO addons killed this game more than anything. It gets to a point where you don't even have to play the game because the addons do all the thinking and paying attention for you. 
---
This game, with the original vanilla UI, and NO ADDONS of any kind, is what classic should have been. And also active in game GM's because you know blizzard can afford to pay for it.
---
There are goblin technicans that drop the elementium ore required for TF that hang out in Vael's room but run away when someone enters the room. If you're quick you can pull them for the possibility of ore.
---
But really most of the ore will be farmed off the goblins in the room after Broodlord.
---
Only similarities are the bluffs. Otherwise Mulgore is nothing like Thousand Needles.
---
Phasing without accurate content sure is a cluster. 
---
Honor values in the AV they gave us, were implemented *after* blizz had announced the honor system was going away soon. 
---
From what I’ve read the amounts provided per win/objective were dramatically increased he has a catch up. 
---
That sounds super broken to me. Almost like blizz needed to revert AV honor levels to pre 1.12 for it to make sense. 
---
But they didn’t. And now the top honor player on my server/faction is someone that is skill-less in PvP, and that afk-bots av 24/7.
---
Plenty of servers lol yeah okay bud
---
Sure. Another thing to know is that when you lose threat, sunder repeatedly on one target under you get it back. Also keep in mind taunt resets your threat to just slightly higher than the person you’re pulling off of. So make sure to at least do one sunder after taunt before moving to another target. If you don’t they’ll go back to attacking whoever you just pulled off of. 
---
One more thing when you’re undergeared (less than 5 T1 pieces) you should max out the sunder rage reduction talent.
---
&gt; premading AV never existed because you could never group queue in AV.
---
Premading AV did exist.  It was just harder than it is now for Alliance.  All the group trying to premade got in a voice server of some sort and counted down to queuing.  It was less reliable since faction balance was a bit closer.
---
Have you become renown yet?
---
No, it's worth the gold value to you because you could spend that amount of gold and buy one to equip.
---
ive never tried it myself but every time this has come up ive only heard of using it like right before sheep to break it. never heard of it WHILE sheeped already.
---
I've done some half-guild half-pug MC runs. We even cleared Rag once. With the right amount of coordination and a good lead, you can make it pretty far with randos.
---
Zug zug me obtuse on purpose. Me know most PvP server horde imbalanced kek, but me get ganked too so zug zug all equal.
---
Why would you suffer through the current phase, where almost no hit gear exists and it is so brutal to gear a warlock , only to bail now? You've almost made it to the promised land.
---
Every phase you will take a significant step up in power. There are better days ahead and you're almost there.
---
Without a doubt. Kronos went full scorched earth and virtually genocided an entire country. Definitely extreme, but it worked 100%. Problem was solved immediately. Machiavelli would have been proud.

Reroll ally! I was horde for 15 years and remember the long queues way back so me and a bunch of others swapped for classic. Harder wpvp for sure, but the bg queues are amazing, especially when I dont have a ton of time to hop on.
---
Odds are people didn't roll for the PvP racial exclusively as anyone who knows WoW would have gone dwarf/gnome.  There are more factors that you are just glossing over with your generalization.
---
People got pissed, fine.  I understand that.  But blaming players because they picked red over blue when the people aren't any different is moronic.
---
Dunno. ask the Horde players who made the game literally unplayable for Alliance during phase 2 why they take it so seriously.

I don't know why people keep saying turtle matched are fun.. they're not. 
---
I was in one yesterday for an hour getting farmed at my own GY in Dun Baldar.
---
&gt; But if more people on the Horde decided to queue for BGs, then they could make premades too?
---
Actually that would make it harder for Horde.  Forming a premade for AV is really only possible if you have near instant queue times since it requires the premade group to sync queuing and decline the queue if they do not get the same BG number.
---
Lol now the bit works for you!
---
It isn't, but it's...somewhat similar. 140 AP is bonkers. It's 70 str. Toss in the crit, and it's a significant dps upgrade. 
---
However, gearing up also gives other things, like sta, resists, and so on. So gearing still helps in various ways.
---
It sounds right other than taking 30 minutes to "get crushed". Crushed takes like 7 minutes.
---
?
---
And still in the increased threat range.  I believe it is 20 ft for the threat change.  Also, hunters are not standing at 10ft, their deadzone is at 8.  Standing right at 10 means that any mob movement towards you makes your dps 0.
---
Garbage spec outside Pvp imo. Just go  deep feral/resto or moonglow
---
I mean I'm a mage and dont even really know the pvp rewards, I just like to slowly raise my rank. I'm now at rank 5 and 50% to r6
---
You are playing an MMO that has many different ways to play it and is supposed to be more social than anything else. If you feel group content should be played a certain way, find likeminded people and play that way (I think they call them premades? Hmm). Expecting every single persom playing this game to have the same mindset and goals as you is insane. You wouldn't expect that in the real world, and thats exactly what WoW is, a WORLD.
---
a Vern
---
Just the case where its negative, so example 1.
---
I feel you, just bringing in a little different perspective. I still remember and appreciate my boys from RuneScape and CoD4 more than 10 years ago, even though I've long since quit the games and don't interact with most of them anymore.
---
This is relevant to my interests, as I play on Benediction. What's the server discord?
---
why does it suck if you do it for fun? I just do bgs for fun and I'm happy that there's no queue
---
What server are you on where there are a) 4 pugs a day and b) they take 4 hours?
---
This is why I'm waiting for 'phase 7' before I'll create an account.  
---
By that time, all the farmers and elitist ass-hats will have moved on, world PVP will be fun, earning 1k gold will be comparatively easy, etc.
---
Unfortunately, if phase 7 involves TBC, it will never end and I'll be glad to have never started.
---
I did my last 40 levels with thorium grenades and made serious profit. Dont know if prices have dropped though
---
It's funny that you all seems to start replying with 'zug zug' the minute  you don't have an answer to a very, very simple question. 
---
OP was right, Alliance are getting toxic. The whole tribalism thing you got going is weird as fuck.
---
Other than weapons for melees ever once in a while though you’re right. No other gear should be bought. It’s probably a waste of gold lol
---
I’m sure Sir Pugger is working on breaking the bot farms, no need to worry boys
---
Time to vendor...
---
It happens more often than people realize. I also hear about people who became friends over WoW and kept in touch personally for years, but one passes away before they ever got to meet IRL. Wow is just a microcosm of actual life itself in many ways. I’m deeply sorry for your loss.
---
This needs more upvotes
---
This^ 
---
Once you have decent heal gear you can spam lower ranks to never go OOM. Or spam a low rank for consistent heals and switch to situationally larger heals as needed.
---
You are correct that I made a typo when I typed the version.  It was 1.5.  Played it 1000s of times, no parroting.   Sorry that you feel that insult is all that you have left to prove your point.
---
It’s not a bug, it’s spell batching. It’s the reason two mages can sheep each other at the same time. It existed in vanilla.
---
Lol 5 orbs in a run. I’m a multiboxer who has solo 5 manned this 41 times and I average 2 total orbs every 3 runs - so less than 1 orb per run
---
You’d be lucky to get 20g for it. I remember they sold for much more during actual vanilla, but I think people don’t really give a shit anymore. Possibly because of the collectathon retail has become.
---
Why are you so concerned about how other people play the game? The sweaties that rush to 70 and clear everything instantly are like 0.5% of the population.
---
I'm only trying with weapons
---
I've been stealth farming on my druid to try and get a book for my warrior. Been at it for about a month and have gotten multiple tomes that are unlootable like this. Damn book is between 1500 and 1900 on my server and can't afford it. I keep wondering if I literally cannot loot a foror's and am continuing to try for nothing. I've gotten every other tome though.
---
Pimp
---
Y not sure if OP knows but key is one use only
---
OH BOI YOU SO SMART YOU FIGURED ME OUT
---
Lol fair well I have a warrior too, the farming is actually for my warrior haha. It's just I saw some videos making like 70g per hour or so. Anyways, got an epic mount and doing like 45-50g per hour now. Woop
---
Horde was doing this when we ruled wpvp too. There's shit talking on both sides tbh. All of it annoying.
---
mods help me omfg mods pls
---
Me white man who experienced racism. This proof that all race experience racism on same level yes. Me big brain. Something happen to me too so all side equal. Yes.
---
It's not just RP, this widespread toxic mindset shows in your second sentence. Instantly excluding people because they haven't managed to farm an epic mount and it *may* *slightly* affect your chance to win is peak toxicity, and it shows when you see how the game culture has reacted to what's meta.
---
The math is simple but the amount of factors to take into consideration is obviously complex. Don’t be a jerk.
---
They don't initially, but information spreads fast.
---
And you know, "everyone" is already min-maxing on classic already so I don't see why it would suddenly stop in TBC.
---
Alliance propaganda!
---
That little fucking Spider Man dildo. God damn my sides.
---
This sub, along with all other gaming subs are rich salt mines.
---
Phew, glad you are not in charge
---
Not a bug.  If you open the time and there is nothing in it, it means....
---
A. You have completed the quest and can not get it again.
---
B.  You already have a copy of the item intended to drop, this includes in bags, banks, etc as they are unique.
---
C.  It was downright empty which is possible as well.
---
I think tailoring is a bit useless rn after you build robe of archmage. Ok money in it selling mooncloth bags if you get that pattern but other than that nothing is important until ZG like ppl have said already.
---
Engineering is amazing for pvp but it is very expensive. If you don’t plan on doing a ton of pvp I would stay away.
---
If you are a big raider Alch/Herbs is the way to go. If you get some rare recipes like greater arcane elixir there’s some big money to be made. DMe is an amazing farm for the herbs and gold. Materials for flasks are about to go way up with BWL coming out. This is what I would personally.
---
Thank you for taking out the entire context, which is literally someone coming on Reddit to whine about alliance being pissed off at horde. Aka the minority who got bullied by the majority. But no NO **NO** . We've got mister AuditoryCheese here who's part of the majority, but still got bullied. So fuck off, EVERYONE WAS IMPACTED EQUALLY.
---
Oooooo kaayyyyyyy
---
Great now his cover is blown.
---
There was plenty of sympathy, you just choose to cherrypick the messages that fit your victim mentality circlejerk.
---
In the case of gear ask them to equip and inspect. For alchemy ask to see their philosopher stone (not guaranteed max alch level though) for enchanting the runed rod (arcanite indicates almost maxed).
---
People just get way to excited and go 0-100 when a content patch comes out. Right now all the people with a APES mindset are trying to get to rank 14. In several months it will be easier to get rank 14, but not easy. Those super hardcore players will look down on those who rank late, they did on private severs too, but who cares that's how classic wow is.
---
Same thing happened when phase 2 came out, a lot of people got way to excited and started transferring realms, making mass rage posts etc. Things will settle down with ranking in time. 
---
Just try to have fun playing the game, some people play just to acquire gear, but when they get the gear they do nothing with it because playing the game isn't fun for them. 
---
When BWL comes out it will be cleared within an hour and a half by the top guilds on the server, and then you will just be doing the same thing you are now with BWL thrown in the mix. Many people will get way to excited for phase 3 and then make endless posts on here about how easy BWL and how classic sucks.
---
Classic was in the end made for the passion of people that played endlessly on various private servers, the most famous being Nostalrius. Those players will keep playing and are not surprised at all by the things that are happening. Classic isn't meant to be this giant mainstream game in 2019 that is what retail is for, so if you don't have fun just don't play, or do i don't care.Just stop complaining about how the game is played.
---
I lost a bis tanking cape to a rogue. And I was the groups tank. Was pretty mad.
---
You could roll in naga and high elves then to. There are also a large number of night elf ghosts.
---
I think most people rolled mage at first but dont use them to raid. Our guild has had major trouble finding mages to fill a raid. So many rogues hunters and locks, way too many healers. Fury warriors and mages are hard to come by for raiding, at least on Heartseeker.
---
What's wrong? You depressed? Haha dumbass go to a doctor or just get over it. That's what Reddit thinks
---
I believe boomkin form uses your weapon to attack, allowing weapons to proc.
---
I've leveled to 300 doing thorium widgets too, you'll never burn through that many so it's a huge waste.  Even if you had to make a ton of thorium shells to get to 300, it would still be worth it because it's a useful item.  I paid 20g for the plans, I don't know what they're going for these days, but I'd probably be happy to pay up to 50g.
---
No, but people at least have to play together more cohesively, and being a solo player is much much more punishing when there is a mine-layer, or all the NPCs are a huge threat.
---
My claim is that more people chose horde because they wanted easy mode pvp. It is irrelevant and another discussion if the horde racials actually is better. 
---
The consensus going into classic was that horde was the superior faction for pvp because of racials. This led more people to choosing horde, and thereby making the imbalanced factions we have now.
---
Starting games low on players is rough.
---
But expecting to win as alliance by letting horde burn stonehearth and icewing bunker uncontested every game and making no effort to cap and hold horde towers bothers me way more.
---
They matter a lot and when theyre gone theyre gone.
---
So you can pay 3 gold to break sheep, epic.
---
you can upgrade the NPC's Armor/ weapons health with turnins
---
I’m in the opposite boat. Been raiding for 6 weeks and have 2 pieces of gear, since every raid has 5-8 mages. We have like 2 locks.
---
Semi related note, my buddy just raided the first time as a Druid yesterday and has the same amount of epics as me,
---
The game is lacking content currently. Once BWL and ZG are out, you can easily raid 3-4 days a week. Even on private servers, the game was VERY boring pre-BWL. There's just nothing to do.
---
Once AQ comes out, there's always something going on. Once Naxx releases? There's not enough time in a week to hit every raid. The schedule is hectic, yet I love it.
---
MY FRIEND DIED NOTICE ME
---
The report feature is barely used mainly because there is no feedback loop to inform the player that their report ever lead to anything. If players knew that the gold sellers were getting banned *because of their reports*, more people would do it. Why do you think FF14 publishes how many gold sellers are banned roughly every month? It informs us that our reports do something meaningful and encourages us to continue fighting the good fight.
---
It has nothing to do with them being stupid. The only stupid person in this topic is Blizzard.
---
Yeah there wouldn't be nearly as much solo backdooring etc.  Every time I solo backdoor SP aid station I'm always surprised how quickly the flag guards flop over.
---
let's start an irl guild VICURIOUS BUT STRAIGHT
---
Blizzard legit doesn't give a fuck anymore as long as you pay them $15 a month huh?
---
That's right, if PvP progression isnt fun, don't do it.
---
The “Are you SURE you don’t want to delete this Black Diamond? Type D E L E T E to confirm” didn’t raise any eyebrows??
---
These exist for quite a few games these days, including 2D platformers like Mario and mobas like League of Legends. MIT researchers made a LoL bot that got so good professional players couldn't even come close to beating it in a 1v1.
---
I refuse to do any pvp. Week 1 WPVP, did 3 days of about 5 hours a day(15hours total), got 35th in the server gained 4 ranks. Week 1 of BG PVP 5 days of 5 hours a day(25+ hours), got 4000 standing gained half a rank.
---
You can't bot WPVP as effectivially like BG's, Anyone I see if anything higher than Rank10, they are botting, or account sharing or both. Its just not possible.
---
Fuck it I'm resubbing. Love my ironman.
---
In pvp spellpower in general is better. 
---
You use every school of magic in pvp.
---
If you want to do DM T solo for gold you also want enchanting because you make more gold and it helps with bag space.
---
Always hit need.
---
Going into our 13th MC clear. No sign of any bindings. I really would love to be on the cutting edge and have it early in BWL but that isn't seeming very likely at this point. However, with RNG being the fickle beast it is, only time will tell
---
If you're cold, they're cold!  Let 'em in!
---
I dont know why but I am only at 4400 mana. I guess I need to equip my INT gear to get to 6k-ish. I heard the DM:E got nerfed but 30g/hr is still pretty good. 
---
I need to drop skinning and get my herbalism up then!
---
Used to work with the priest self damaging attack, power word death or something. Used to use it to reliably escape polymorph.
---
Wonder if hellfire works
---
A lot has changed in the IT world over the years. Hell I remember hearing Pixar lost an entire fucking movie but thankfully an employee had a local backup. Shit happens, even at big companies.
---
And look at the backlash from just 1.12. Blizzard probably knew this was the case, so "we dont have it" is easier than "we only have 1.12" because people will just accuse them of lying about THAT.
---
FFA and they fend for themselves. Theoretically, I should probably use group loot for fairness, but this gets everything looted a lot faster and keeps items from going to waste when some of the party members don’t care to loot.
---
Reported, gz!
---
Unlike private servers, Blizzard gladly turns a blind eye for $15 per month
---
Coefficient something something...im not 100% sure how the math works, but it scales with level. Im sure someone else can explain it better. I wouldn't even waste the time/effort/money on SP gear until you are approaching end game, when that SP makes a **huge** difference in damage.
---
Reading these comments make me feel like i should be botting
---
That was a really helpful video, I'll likely watch it a few more time. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Or you can use the search to see if what you're thinking has been discussed. Unless you just like beating dead horses.
---
Hahaha i read that in the voice of yoda 🤣
---
You can torrent the client. That's how pservers work. Having the client is irrelevant without the server.
---
is there an addon that shows some sort of distance markers so you know how close you are to stuff?
---
There go my dreams... Still, I think user configurable shift keys is a good idea if it can be implemented.
---
So you’d recommend the Therazune branch regardless of spec right?
---
what is best method for farming afk honor in av ?
---
cappinv the main base graveyard is easy if you know the backdoor jump and right route to avoid all the non-flag guards.    
---
You still have to be able to kill 4 guards with lower HP due to tower archers but I can do it as a warrior quite easily, rogues can start at 100%, mages simply root and aoe, hunters feign death,...
---
Chasing joy and chasing pleasure are to extremely different things in my book. Based on your reply, I think we probably see eye to eye on this and I just wasn’t very clear in my post.
---
Sorry for your loss. It is amazing what kind of memories we can create in a game. Thanks for sharing yours.
---
Well then that would mean you’d have to use the rune right as you get sheeped right?
---
LUL
---
MP5 is your go to stat as a SPriest after spell/shadow power. Mana is your bottleneck, so stacking things like Mindtap Taliaman or even Shard of Afrasa is good until you can higher regen.
---
Definitely. What's also worth mentioning is gold-selling. If there are gold-sellers present, these runs basically create a shortcut of $-&gt;gear, which is not really healthy for the overall game state.   
---
But I love it for its simplicity. No drama, no "but I am a better raider", no "this is only your second run, he's a long-time guild member, he deserves it more", no "but this is much better for a warrior than a hunter". Just a very straightforward exchange of gold and items.   
---
I make games for kids in a summer camp and simplification of rules is something that I very much enjoy, so this just immediately got me hooked.
---
that one looks legit compared to most others like this 
---
like blizurd on realwowdotcom.com
---
Yea thats a valid point
---
Telling someone how to be a good healer is a tough thing to explain, because healers generally don't have a strict heal rotation like a dps would. Healers need to be much more adaptive and react accordingly to whatever the current situation is. However in a broad sense a healer is playing three mini games within a dungeon or raid. First is positioning, keeping yourself in a good position to heal everyone in the group without exposing yourself to danger.  Second is keeping everyone alive and, the third is making sure you don't run out of mana. The third is where down ranking spells come in to play. Overhealing is defiantly something to keep in mind and is a real problem in raids, but it is important to be as efficient as possible with your mana, because if you go oom it might result in a wipe.
---
Yes, that's the way to go for PVP
---
Turtles are NOT fun. If the match is longer than 25 minutes it's a huge waste of time. I'm not here for "EPIC PVP BATTLES THAT LAST MULTIPLE DAYS"  im here for rep. AV sucks in general, I don't want to spend more time than i have to to hit exalted and play something actually enjoyable or better yet, get back to raiding or farming.
---
I don't think my comments convey the level of emotion you're attributing to them. Everything I've said to you has been quite mild. I'm just bored at work on a slow Friday and find your inflammatory reactions to be quite out of place. Perhaps you read comments made to you in the same tone that you project toward others? You keep accusing other folks of being worked up and yet you're the one who seems to be lashing out at everyone and exhibiting a pretty negative attitude. This particular response of mine that you've chosen to respond to with vitriol wasn't at all condescending of you or negative whatsoever, it's a genuine response to your assertion that gaming is an utter waste of time. I disagree. You seem to think I'm angry or something, I'm not at all. Nothing you've said upsets me, but I do think it's interesting how aggressively you're responding to everyone. You may want to consider that personal reflection yourself. You've gotten very angry with a bunch of folks where it didn't really seem warranted. You assert that your life is where you want it to be, and yet you're lashing out at everyone. Why? If you're so composed, why are you acting so unhinged and angry?
---
This is a know exploit. Archvaldor made a video about it. Check out his youtube
---
Yeah in vanilla we dealt with plenty of people raging over basically the same stuff as today. I don’t remember people going as ham on the honor grind on my particular server, but the rest lines up lol
---
Anytime!
---
Ok lol
---
Wait for Naxx/AQ40 and get better gear through raids. Ignore PvP if you dislike ranking up or play Warsong for fun and just ignore ranks until you get better/similar PvE gear later on.
---
Just curious what your Dota 2 MMR is if you've ever played it?
---
Mage is an awesome 1v1 class and warrior is the #1 worst 1v1 class, if that's something that's important to you.
---
No, too generic. I think we need clones.
---
A factor but not exclusive.  Due to mega servers, if 'easy mode pvp' only added 10% more horde, that would have been enough.
---
It's just reddit that convinced themselves they hate the game. Everyone else is having a blast.
---
Dont ask me why but the toxicity in classic led me to being a complete solo player. 
---
Sometimes when i want a break from the toxicity and just want to chill i go to bfa and play/socialize with some random people in voice.
---
Can I learn primary profession to 300 without being level 60 myself?
---
SE do it right with FF14, every month they produce a report of the number of accounts banned for RMT this encourages players to keep reporting it as they know that while it is still happening at least SE are dealing with it
---
Yeah this same crap got me to grab two-factor way back in wrath. I got on the wrong website for addons, next thing I know all my characters had their loot vendored and I was being flagged for scam behavior. Thankfully, CS got me my gear back and gave me the good advice to enable two-factor. No issues since.
---
I've never botted before but I've been banned 2 times for betting with ban waves, I've had character deletions for no explanation I think I'm good on forced ban waves. I've had my account for 15+ years and shouldn't have to ever deal with opening a ticket or waiting hours to contact blizz just to argue and still have a 50/50 chance of getting the ban removed.
---
there are a few inconvenient things such as having to dismount when going from the center to one of the outer bluffs and the AB warmaster being in a completely different place from the two others. that being said it’s still my favorite capital city, due to al the reasons you (and OP) mentioned, as well as the proximity to great grinding / farming zones like Feralas (DM), Silithus, Un’Goro, and Felwood
---
you rank up at the same speed as everyone else if everyone else is subject to the same queue times though... so... it's not like it slows you down from ranking up ?
---
Vael is simple even for guilds with low DPS. Tank swapping is far from ideal, but not exactly hard. Lots of guilds burn through 4 tanks on Vael believe it or not.
---
Of course, burning Vael even before the 1st tank death is ideal...
---
You can literally farm gold and purchase an epic Mount by the time you even find a premade that accepts 60%. The AV Mount is only 600g at exalted.
---
Reminds me of Red XIII and Cosmo Canyon from FFVII.
---
Well the class books are unique, including forors. So if you have some class book on AH , waiting for a sale, or maybe in your inventory or bank, it will be empty I believe?
---
The op is using the death of his friend to garner karma...
---
Exactly, ZG/AQ20 gear is BWL equivalent, and basically free for the taking. Then they can just have a fun time in BWL, and easily clear early AQ40/Naxx bosses.
---
Maybe, maybe not delusional. Your experience isnt a blanket statement for every player, its just that. Your experience. Go join them on heartseeker if you're so butthurt about your experience on stalagg or go play another game. Stop coming to reddit to spread false information and crying your little heart out
---
HOW DO I DELET POST QUIK!!!!!
---
We had the same free transfer options as alliance though.
---
Have 60 of them in bank just for subtlety enchant when the phase drops
---
Fair enough. Being out of the loop since the train wreck that was WoD (and generally not caring about statistics or demographics at that stage) I went into classic the same way as I did vanilla, with no real expectations about demographics. Just annoying and even a bit disgusting how some people behave on here ever since the PvP system was released. Maybe it'd be better just to stay away from here for a bit, unfortunate as that may be.
---
More importantly, they introduced the WoW Token.
---
In 5 man content and possibly ubrs, sure. But there's no way you're out dosing any half decent fury warrior in MC. Any logs? Or at least what does do you get on rag?
---
I disagree. All it means is the person has other priorities and chose to farm their crystals or farm for raid items. This game has been out for 15 years and all an epic mount means in classic is someone has more time. In most premades, there isn’t even much pvp going on anyway.
---
No, taking a boe item for yourself is selfish. Everyone rolling need on it, is the opposite of selfish.
---
Yeah... I can honestly see Razorgore being a problem. Adds won't die remotely quickly enough, and they'll just get overrun.
---
Nope. The fact that people still rush doesn't deter from the fact that pre 1.5 av it happens WAY LESS. 
---
If murder were legal, it would happen WAY MORE.
---
Not sure how you can't see the comparison, but I hope one day you'll be alright.
---
A few days have passed already but I just wanted to thank you for your detailed explanation of the situation! I appreciate it.
---
Yea and I think it's fucked up that America throws asylum seeking kids in cages but I still pay my taxes lol.
---
Or maybe it's just a person in pain.
---
If it didn't work, they wouldn't do it.
---
&gt;you wouldnt know it if you only read reddit and didnt play the game tho.
---
My experience is the complete opposite. On this subreddit there are a lot of people upvoting these kinds of threads and downvoting the ones complaining about how slow AV is now. The players ingame on the other hand constantly complain about how weak Alliance is in AV, how boring AV is, that they will never enter it again after reaching exalted, etc. Ingame I rarely see players talking about liking the defending part of AV.
---
Male Turen. Big... When Quel'serrar swings across the screen it looks amazing. Also suits taurens with maces. Hammer Time!
---
Aint that the truth
---
I agree with ya. I wouldn't unfriend him that time, but I would be weary. Ive had people say they're gonna change after doing fucked up shit, and they never change. This is a video game so it is different, but I wouldn't run BRD with him again lol.
---
Y’all complaining like some hoes
---
Biggest downside: no zeppelin
---
“Hey guys do you also not like cheaters? Upvote if you also dont like cheaters!”
---
Because alliance being able to spam insta que 3k honor 10 minute AV is much more honor/hour than horde waiting 30 minutes for 3k honor 10 minute av's. 
---
You're ranked against EVERYONE on the server. Not just your faction.
---
?????
---
Me too, man! If you’re alliance let’s duel. If your Horde I’ll see you on the battlefield.
---
Had a guildie of ours who I am assuming is in his 40s fall for this after 14 hours of straight PvP grind. Everything was taken and he is still working on getting everything back. Some people fall for this shit still.
---
I mean, you CAN, but nowhere near as fast/efficiently as a mage can. You can really only pull like 4-5 mobs tops, and can't kill them nearly as fast as a mage. It's possible, yes, but likely to be way slower than normal questing.
---
Ironically I don't have time to play casually, so am now in a hardcore guild. MC cleared in an hour, +40mins for buffing, looting and travel. Gives me a lot more time with the gf, or making gold.
---
I've only done half pug half guild runs and so far only the fastest one got to 8/10 and the others had 10/10. All included a wipe on majordomo though.
---
Wait a couple months after phase 6 to play.  It will be much more relaxed and enjoyable.  Leveling will be easier because of the excess gold on the AH.  Nearly all the try-hards and bots will be gone.  It will be lovely.... unless they release TBC.
---
They get more than 100%. Pyroblast is weird though because a chunk of the damage is in the dot.
---
Yeah, dog stacking is just for fun. DPS like to see those juicy numbers.
---
Zero reason to do it otherwise.
---
O
---
You and your guild can make the raids more challenging by shooting for better parses/times. My guild does this and it gives us something to improve on every week while we enjoy each other’s company. The warcraftlogs meta isn’t enjoyable for everyone, but we all cheer each other on when we get 99 parses and jump server rank.
---
Man this story brings back memories.  In late 2004, I was just starting the game and had no idea what I was doing and WC was my first dungeon in any MMO ever.  
---
Similar story--a PUG of four other randoms and I spent hours crawling through the dungeon and I still remember the whole thing (including learning about how to make that goddamn jump).  It was an absolute blast and after we finished it, I felt like these four internet strangers and I had truly lived through something together, like army buddies or something.  I felt sad and empty when the party broke up but it cemented my love for the game and preceded thousands of hours of playtime over the years.  Man what a blast that was.
---
hey its me ur brother
---
garbage for a hunter. sorry guy
---
You seem like a well adjusted individual.
---

An orb isn't even enough for me to tank a pug strat live.
---
Keep spamming trade for a tank, maybe you'll find one within the hour.
---
Long casting spells only get up to 100%.
---
Look up spell power efficiency. Even at max rank frostbolts and lvl 60 you still only get 88% or so of your spell power added. Fireball gets 100% I belive as it's a slower cast with higher efficiency. Once you get higher ranks of frostbolts (slower casts) you will see more of your spell power added to the spell. Instant casts get a lot smaller benefit from sp, and aoes gets so little there's barely any difference in dmg from a fresh 60 and an epic geared one.

Shadow word death but yep!

Go into the character screen, select your character, select "delete", then type in the confirmation

Where would you start? Is there a starter zone with NEs to kill?
---
They didn't. Gold that doesn't get spent doesn't affect the economy. They've taken billions of gold out of the economy with cosmetics (million gold mounts and T3 in BMAH) and transferred billions to other players via the WoW Token.
---
And those BoP crafting mats that all the retail players hate so much? That also causes a transfer of wealth in the economy. Blizzard has actually been very smart with retail's economy.
---
If you're in a guild that REQUIRES you to PvP in order to do PvE with your spec, I think you're in the wrong guild. Resto is far more desired for raid healing than feral generally is, but I think this is something that should always be kept in mind with a druid. I'm not sure why you'd even really try to grind out a feral druid for raid minmaxing because what gear that drops from raids would you even use?
---
This is a pretty good deal. I can grind out 30g/hour passively farming BRD pickpocket on my rogue. Leveling in this stretch is brutal and can take 2-4x as long!
---
Was gonna say his thunder bluff is my auberdine
---
What addon is used to see the times for each gy?
---
that's... not true at all, you aren't ranked against everyone on your server.
---
You're only ranked against your own faction.
---
So... sounds like a lot of misinformation from your end my dude.
---
I’m sorry, man. I hope you find your answer and if need be, a more fulfilling time sink.
---
I can’t help but think this new Blizzard doesn’t give a rats ass about bots in classic. They are all about the bottom dollar now. This new Blizzard is a far cry from the Blizzard that created vanilla wow.
---
I used to main a priest back in the day and got R11. If I may suggest a few things the first would be about mages:  group up with a mage or healbot one because they are your best peels and can give you water. Everyone says group with a warrior, but I would honestly leave that to shamans on horde and pallies on alliance. Mages you can bubble, heal, dispel, and really help a lot, and they can keep melee off of you. Geared warriors and rogues can delete you quickly, and a mage is their worst nightmare. I always found in PuG that if I just followed a good mage around and healbotted, they would quickly pick up what was going on and 99% of the time it made for a fun BG.
---
Second is enemy mages and offensive dispel in general:  this should be honestly your main focus. More important on alliance for sure because we didn't have shamans, but mages were the most important enemy to dispel because they were the most dangerous. Take away those shields, buffs, everything. Dispell druid hots, dispel dispel dispel and I can't emphasize that enough.
---
Watch your positioning - you'll get a feel for it but focus on your situational awareness. You're no good getting viper drained or polymorphed, so don't get yourself in that situation if you can avoid it.
---
It’s way better for a tank than for a hunter, but depending on what their previous rings were it was probably still an upgrade.
---
Gear while leveling doesn’t matter much, it’s a bummer you didn’t get it but it really doesn’t impact your character much.
---
Not to mention all the games where the alliance start out with 5-10 people.  I had two games yesterday where alliance had 11 or fewer people in the game by the time we were at Icewing(it shortly filled to 40 after that, before we could push to Stormpike GY there were 40 ally there).  There is no way for them to do anything at that point, they were tenacious and turtled up to drag it out a bit (which I respect) but when we ended around 25 minutes they still had zero bonus honor.  They did get a shit load of HKs though, a 40 man alliance turtle turns the bridge into an absolute meat grinder with those archers.  
---
That is all too common these days, and makes for some rough games for alliance I imagine.
---
Are those naga worth farming?
---
You haven't made any points so there is nothing to make a counterpoint too. 
---
What do you think is the most unfair matchup, a good wow player vs a bad wow player, or a good dota player vs a bad dota player? You reach a skill ceiling in classic wow real fast compared to dota 2 where there is actually no skill ceiling. You can play a duel perfectly in classic wow, very consistently. You can never play a midlane 1v1 perfectly.
---
Can you even get from level 1-2 by only killing night elves?
---
The problem isn’t with the game. 
---
The problem is with some people. Toxic personalities reveal themselves through social interactions whether they be reality or digital. 
---
“There are some people that are so negative, they can walk into a dark and begin to develop.” 
---
~ Les Brown
---
Unfortunately, some people sit in their dark room and play WoW. 
---
A few months ago someone on r/ wow posted, “There are two kinds of players in this game. Multiplayers use content to progress social interactions. Solo players use social interactions to progress content.”
---
Unfortunately, these two types of players are intertwined on every server. It takes some effort to surround yourself with the type you desire. 
---
If you look at all the posts in wow related subreddit’s, there’s a clear relationship. Positive posts tend to revolve around real friendships or guild accomplishments. Negative posts revolve around people who register as rude to abusive
---
If most of your raid is just scrapping by you don't have a good loot council.
---
Pretty much every core raider in my guild is neck and neck in dps because we've focused on gearing people up evenly. All of our mages for example are within 50 dps of each other depending on rng, that's the right way to do loot council. If your council is just feeding gear to themselves or their friends, you should find a new guild
---
They drop clams that drop golden pearls
---
out of curiosity, do you kill alliance druids in moonglade when you do this? or do you still respect the sanctity of the place? I always wondered about that.
---
The crafting professions (leatherworking/enchanting etc) you can get to 225 skill at level 5. To get above 225 your required to be level 35. (Same with first aid and cooking )
---
The gathering professions you could get to 300 skill at level 5...but it would be hard to do since the higher levels are in higher level zones.
---
Maybe alliance side, the horde pool is still massive.  But yes unfortunately it's turned into a PvE server.
---
I have too much gold and hate leveling (too lazy for it). I check AH for Upgrades every 2 hours :D
---
rogue - because I like making people SIT and do nothing when I tell them to and orc - because fuck playing against stun resist but also yes to stun resist
---
also female because I actually like the animations and im horny
---
Correct, you must be level 35 to skill up any profession above 225.
---
Gold pearl
---
Then a rogue in your guild asks if anyone has one for Libram...and nobody does and there are none on the AH, because everyone passes on them.   And you laugh and laugh.
---
I agree that fury is more dps than arms, but the gap isn't as far as everyone makes it seem, and it seems the real big hang up is the debuff slot we take up.  As arms I almost always out dps 2h fury but geared dw fury is ahead by a little bit.  (alliance btw so no WF)
---
I treat Av the same way I treat porn in a liquor store, hurry up and just get past it as quickly as possible and onto the alcohol. I did AV for about a week, hit exalted and I'll never go back again.

They really dont but ok.

Undead mage.

Mage works superwell with my minimal play time. Easy gold farms. Easy movement around azeroth. 
---
Also I like being a zombie
---
I ground my mage from like 30-60 all AOE. I hate to break it to ya but there's only 1 quest that comes to mind that I was able to do: Pirates at the tanaris docks.  Around level 40ish you can start farming these pirates.  HUGE pulls tons of xp.  The best part are the maps that they drop.  There are 3 fragments to the map and when you combine them you can take this map all the way to the south of tanaris and get a loot box that will give you pretty decent loot.  
---
The best part of this is that the quest is repeatable.  So as you're farming the pirates combine all your map fragments.  Get a couple bags worth of maps and then head south to turn it in.   Such a huge bonus to AOE leveling.  There are some youtube vids that cover this quest / aoe farming them, I'd suggest you try to search em up.
---
Ahh yeah - Horde side I’ve heard is still not bad due to size of brackets and BGs being available.
---
Alliance side is fucked though
---
Classic API doesnt allow addons to swap weapons while in combat. You need to bind your spirit staff or macro it to evocation
---
Your job isn't to be top DPS on every single boss. It's to do what's required for the raid to be effective. Decursing takes priority over damage on Lucifron, Gehennas and Shazzrah.
---
All of my friends went to retail, I ended up going back myself as a result
---
Yeah gear doesn’t matter too much while leveling up until you’re in UBRS, DM, Strath and Scholo. But regardless, garbage ring for a hunter. Should’ve went to you.
---
Isn't that the equivalent of (for a warrior) 70 strength and 100 agility. So, yeah probably outside of weapon upgrades and hit gear.
---

I met my best friend in highschool on WoW. At the time, I'd just gotten through a nervous breakdown and was in therapy multiple times a week. He was the only person I told about wanting to kill myself, and it's in large part thanks to him &amp; the music he introduced me to that I came out of that period. Sadly, as I was improving, he got worse. He told me one day that he had tried meth, and it really wasn't so bad. I told him to please be careful and that I was worried for him. That was the last time I heard from him. I tried to track him down, but living in another state with no contacts for his family made it hard. I finally found out over a year later that he had committed suicide.
---
I logged back in shortly after learning this, and lo and behold - his name was lit up on my friends list. But it wasn't him... Just a bot or someone else who'd gotten into his account... I went into a rage. It was too much to have that brief flicker of hope, followed by crushing realization. I sent the person all sorts of horrible messages, reported him, and logged for the last time.
---
Maybe I'll try classic some time.
---
This is a beautiful tribute and I'm certain your friend is grateful, for your companionship and dedication to his memory. The sun shall continue to rise over Ironforge and bring warmth and light to the land... Blessed be &amp; LVX
---
Our current record is 38mins from Luci to Rag. That requires everyone with full consumables, buffs, and engineering. As well as hundreds of waters (to tick drink), healers and dps chugging potions constantly, etc.
---
Not an everyweek thing ofc!
---
Pretty much universally this seems to happen to rank 14s. I don't know why they bother. And I especially don't know why they bother when it's KNOWN that the grind is miserable and more of a timesink than anything.
---
Sure thing reddit
---
You realize there are bots that have been farming in the same spot for over a month right? They have been reported by countless players in that time but there they are every day still farming..
---
I agree with all of that, it's my favorite city in the game, however falling off the goddamn bridges when trying to avoid the dismount tunnels is really damn annoying. Every horde city seems like it wasn't actually playtested by anyone playing horde races.
---
Different topic, what's the deal with the alliance flight path times being way shorter on single hop flights?
---
lmfao
---
Almost anything that kills you where the source of damage is another player, including a teammate or yourself, will not cause durability damage.
---
Whos crying lol?  I see that not only are you an idiot but you seem to act like we're in middle school or something.
---
Why would explaining the state of the server make me seem like I'm complaining?
---
This isn't just my opinion.  It is the opinion of every major guild on the Alliance.  The opinion of people talking about it on this subreddit, on the official forums, and in-game.
---
You have to be one of only a handful of people who I've seen disagree.
---
But you know what?  Your opinion doesn't matter.  It isn't going to affect what my guild decides to do moving forward.  You're essentially just acting like that typical WoW mongoloid who trolls for the sake of being contrarian.
---
You'll see how dead it is for the Alliance yourself soon enough.  I don't need to promise anything.
---
Warlocks scale better because of more dmg multipliers and higher base dmg on shadow bolt. Frost mage get what, 10% from CoE and 10% crit From winters chill? Warlock gets 10% from CoS, 10% SM/15% DS, potential for instant casts randomly, 20% for 5 Bolts after every crit, 15% from a shadow priest. Also unlimited mana of course. Adding potential for a debuff slot corruption (100% efficiency) ticking is good too.
---
Frost is a bad damage specc with fire already outperforming it. Frost isn't used right now because its good. It's because all the current max level content is basically fire immune/resistant.
---
Tribal has Devilsaur Legs/Gloves, Wolfshead Helm, Hide of the Wild, and Corehound Belt and Boots are all salable. You can also pick up the Warbear Chest/Legs which some Druids go for.
---
Elemental has Shifting Cloak, Molten Helm and Belt, and the Volcanic set. Stormshroud is pretty crap.
---
Dragonscale has Chromatic Gauntlets, Black Dragonscale set and the Red Dragonscale Breastplate.
---
None of the specialties have any sort of BoP option, and if you set aside the FR gear and look just at the usefulness, I think Tribal comes out ahead. That said, there will be more Tribal LW than the others.
---
It always amazes me how unaware people are of their music tastes can differ from others. The music shown in these videos are one thing but also the people who blare their music out in public. &gt;_&gt; I love instrumentals for example but I'm not going to try to show it off
---
They don't have the source code for earlier version so no.
---
 blizzard won't try to artificialy recreate it like pservers, they either have original data or they won't do it.
---
Possibly that, or possibly even don’t play wow.  Just be sure to gauge your happiness while you play and don’t do it for the wrong reasons.
---
It's going to be tough because you give up all the 5man perks and utility to put out mondo-threat on a single enemy.
---
Get real good at tab sundering
---
You can also level thorium grenades from 285 to 300 and then you can use or sell them
---
&gt;and even at 60 it's still good lol
---
Not just good, it'd be BiS until Aurastone Hammer/Azuresong Mageblade/Staff of Dominance for most casters.
---
Should my gear from 45-60 prioritize spell power or int?
---
Money farming as a lock is misery. Same two instances over and over.

Marks aren’t worth exp in classic, that was BC
---
Apes together strong!
---
Well he never said anything incorrect in that comment.
---
Recall OP
---
No, it's not doing anything against the TOS and does not touch the game in any way. Just takes a screenshot of your computer and sends you a notice about it.
---
Hunters can literally win a AV once and get the second best now behind Rhok. So why would they want striders mark?
---
True
---
Yep, guess we didn't lose enough Alliance players before BGs, so let's make all of them quit.
---
Kiting and mob tagging?
---
Nice. For what it's worth takes well less than 2 min on a lock.
---
Dropped a profession to take up Tailoring, but now the trainer doesn’t give me the option to learn tailoring. Is this a common bug?
---
For horde or alliance? Our guild has 9 mages every raid on alliance
---
Any Warlocks with wisdom on the Dreadsteed quest? Is it worth to buy the 250g materials or just pay someone else 50g?
---
Yeah. We’re literally bringjng alt Druids just to not DE gear.
---
There is an add-on that someone made for classic that does this. I forget the name, but you can Google it easy.
---
This post has nothing to do with me, I’m sorry you seemed to miss the entire point.
---
I’m perfectly happy with my progress and experience, and was commenting on the attitudes of others I’ve seen in game.
---
I use /stopcasting on all my instant cast spells. iceblock, nova, fireblast, cone of cold, blast wave, and arcane explosion.
---
use /dismount for all your spells
---
use down rank modifiers in your macros where needed (helpful in pvp) rank1 frostbolt to slow flag carrier, rank 1 arcane explosion to fish for stealthies
---
/cast [mod:ctrl] Frostbolt(Rank 1); Frostbolt
---
this one casts rank 1 frostbolt when holding ctrl, otherwise it casts max rank frostbolt
---
We have MC on farm, 2h15m To 2h30m with usually 32-35 people. We have 10 healers and it's too many. Could probably manage with 6 or 7 at our gear levels, and we've barely gotten any healer gear from MC (except that all 8 Priests including the SPriest have Benedicition). What matters more than healers is sufficient dps, sufficient dispels, and sufficient FR for your Ragnaros tank(s).
---
Ask your guild to have some of the healers do damage. Even if that means running 1 Ele Sham and 1 Boomkin. You absolutely need more damage if your runs are taking that long. Rogues and Warriors are approximately equivalent with currently available gear. We run 6 Rogues and 4 DPS Warriors, two of whom are really poorly geared. We booty blast through all of MC and just got to pre-Submerge kill Ragnaros.
---
Did you drop a main profession? Some thing like first aid or cooking doesn't count (you can have those in addition to two other main professions)
---
Hmm. Do you get xp from killing alliance npcs? If so, mabye run to Teldrassil and kill the npcs there.
---
Yeah dropped skinning
---
This is the loop that I use:
---
- Enter BRD, go through the left gate, right gate, and left door.  You're now in the room with the ramp on the right and the mechanism that controls the massive door on the left.
---
- Pick Pocket (PP) the mobs on the bottom part of this room, and open the mechanism.  You can do this without aggro'ing any of the mobs, just be mindful of the fire elemental patrol.  You want this open so that when your bags get close to full, you can head to the bar and sell.
---
- Head up the ramp and PP the mobs on the *right*, in and among the tables.
---
- Head up the next ramp to the arena seating.  PP every spectator in a loop until you're back at the ramp you just came up.  Go down it and to the right.
---
- PP every mob down the hallway until you get to the windows *before* the massive door you closed (that you walk over to head towards Angerforge).
---
- Jump out the *left* window so you end up in the massive, massive "hallway" with all the packs of 5 mobs patrolling around.  If you know the instance well, this path takes you all the way down to Bael'gar, the huge fiery rock giant.
---
- PP every mob from here down to Bael'gar.  I like to go up the right-side, loop around him, and come back down the left side (now on your right) until you're essentially right back at the gates you opened in the beginning of the dungeon.
---
- Rinse, repeat. Go to the Grim Guzzler to vendor as your bags start to fill up.  PP every mob on the way and inside the Guzzler before you leave it obviously.
---
There's some things you can do to make this route faster, more efficient, etc. 
---
(1) Be Subtlety spec'd so you move faster, have a lower CD on Vanish, and have Preparation for another Vanish.
---
(2) If you're an Engineer, make sure you have a Gnomish Cloaking Device.  This is basically another Vanish but with a 1-hour CD.  It'll help if you get really unlucky several times in a row.
---
(3) Get a pair of boots with Run Speed enchanted on them.  This is 8% speed increase, and works in Stealth.  With being Subtlety and having this enchant, I stealth around at 92% movement speed.
---
(4) Make a Pick Pocket macro.  I don't have the exact one I use because I'm at work right now, but it basically goes something like this:
---
`/cleartarget`
---
`/cast Pick Pocket`
---
`/targetenemy`
---
It allows me to simply point in the direction of targets and PP them one by one. Alternatively, you can use a mouseover macro.  I prefer to always be holding down my right-mouse button when I move though, so stopping this to mouseover enemies got really old quick.
---
No. Completely fine and legal. It does not touch the game in any way. Just takes a screenshot and sends you a notification about that screenshot.
---
You realize you’re saying this in a world of warcraft classic sub right?
---
Your lack of self awareness is staggering. Also you’re an asshole.
---
The quest turn in definitely gets you exp...
---
Honor is farmed with real money via subscription time, so why doesn't Blizzard just sell it directly?   They should auction off the PVP ranks as well since it's just a matter of who spends the most time in the BGs.
---
Would make everyone happy, no?
---
You wouldn't need to. I send my void in to tank until the first dust cloud and launch shadowbolts at her for a while. Can also use it to eat a bunch of the boulder throws and Sac if you actually manage to get hit
---
I believe it considering its just DoT and run haha.  For what its worth tho im clearing the place in under 12 minutes so the lockout timer is the real limiting factor either way.
---
Forgot about this BG. I always fucked with it
---
Sure alliance ganks but the reason you see more people pointing fingers at horde is because horde dominate almost every pvp server.
---
venruki is a professional player who has won blizzcon numerous times as well as numerous classic dueling tournaments. He was a competitor first then a streamer
---
Vanish is probably 10 times more reliable in Classic than it actually was in Vanilla.
---
Can't turn in when it's ended in 12 minutes.
---
Yea, I was a little bummed when I found that out too. I was thinking of adding additional notification options as well. Like maybe Telegram or slack and stuff. Do you have any other ideas for phone apps to use for notification?
---
In Vanilla they used to be worth more... Not much more, but more.  
---
But in 2019, EVERYONE gunned for Best in slot for everything. There's just so much more easily found build info now; And they can't be vendored.
---
The combo makes them near worthless.
---
You chose Horde knowing there would be ques and Alliance dominates AV, and Alliance were told that phase 2 would be terrible bloodfest. Just stop complaining and deal with it, just like alliance dealt with phase 2.
---
not only pretty bad for hunter, its unique and random stats so if an agi one drops later they cannot roll on it
---
Yeah, I use ringmenu, bound to my middle mouse button, and use it for things that I dont need in combat, like portals, TPs, mage food/water and my LFG macros. It's makes my bars so much less cluttered and really cleans up the ui!
---
People who are content mostly don't go to forums. They just play the game.
---
humanoids are generally top grinding mobs. Azshara is a zone a lot of people do not spend time in, and there are very few mining/herb nodes in the area of these nagas. Botters really don't care about killing the best mobs, they just want something that isn't competitive. I would not recommend grinding for golden pearls, personally. You can easily find yourself not getting one in hundreds of mobs.
---
+6 DPS would be more significant than +6 damage per spell as long as the cast time is longer than 1 sec. In OP's case, the cast time is 1.8 sec, so that's less than a 6 DPS increase.
---
Priority is as follows:
---
1. Spell Hit Rating (you will typically need 10% to cap hit against bosses)
---
2. Spell Critical Strike (150% damage chance on spell hit);
---
3. Spell Damage (some spells scale better with it than others, but for the most part you will be casting spells that benefit greatly from it);
---
4. Intellect (grants spell critical strike and increases your maximum Mana).
---
Same reason why Bots aren't banned.  Blizzard is lazy and incompetent.
---
&gt; Female dwarf 
---
Best vocal emotes, too.
---
Right, why don't they all have shared aggro? I gain a freaking soloing DM and the bosses' aggro goes of the charts.
---
Invis pots maybe, to sneak past the last boss, but mostly Enslave and pathing glitches are what make it possible. Any other class besides warlock is better off tag teaming the place.
---
In runescape there are lot of accounts like this that are actually hand played by gold farmers in poor countries. Usually multiboxing multiple account because gold in videos is worth more than their countries cash.
---
If by '\*great\*' you mean worse than just having a 5th mage in the group, sure lol
---
I played FFXIV for years, but it is closer to retail than classic , dungeon finder, cosmetic /transmog is the endgame, some difficulty with Savage for sure, world is empty as you teleport everywhere and pretty much never use the mounts for extended periods of time
---
It should be ok with even medium gear.  The nature's Swiftness helps plug a lot of holes.
---
Damn I didn't even consider that some people didn't have 60s to be on honestly my bad that's a completely reasonable reason to be miserable in pvp and sorry that people above you killed you thats fucked up (like way above not a few levels obv).
---
If the boys are safe (as it seems they are), he's likely safe as well

Thanks for posting this I kept forgetting to get this
---
If you're pressing soulfire against a rogue you're asking to lose. That's vanish bait. 
---
If you see him early with fel puppet dot him out of stealth, he can't cheapshot even if he's ontop of you. If you have succubus seduce and run as far as possible, open with fear (seduce and fear share a DR so be careful). If you have a voidwalker save it until you are sure he will kill you; if you don't he can gouge, blind, sap and wait the shield till it expires. Not getting coil vanished is your highest prio.
---
Anyone crazy enough to go for an achieve rank 14, might be crazy enough to keep rank 14. You have to be pretty efficient and/or socially connected at that point.

How about trolls, since, iirc, night elves evolved from trolls

@ You and the rest of you dumb cunts trolling OP: I sincerely hope you experience grief or despair alone in the near future. Grow the fuck up and learn how to pick your battles you insensitive, desperate, bitter, wastes of space
---
Same exact thing happened to me awhile back. Pretty annoying since hunters dont use strength and they rarely get hit. Plus at least for me rings were hard to come by. You can however get some pretty good ones on the AH for cheap!
---
Careful to not get banned. When I was much younger before wow was even out I played a different game that had bots. I randomly logged into the game and started exploring. Then I got an invite from a person who was just grinding mobs as an archer, I thought it was great free XP. About half an hour into it, I got a 7 day ban.
---
I contested it saying I didn't know what was happening that anything wrong was going on. All I did was accept a random party invite. That's how I learned what Botting was.
---
I'm wondering how long you would have to farm on a mage to make up for the lost farming time on your hunter from leveling the mage all the way to 60
---
wait til it’s a full set of tier 2. that set bonus. oof
---
That's just not factual. 
---
I solo cap bunkers, GY, and can solo kill lieutenants.
---
The only ones you can't solo as a mage are the ones who are immune to CC.
---
Apparently a lot of people that play Classic actually wanted features from Burning Crusade, and some from Wrath of the Lich King too. Might be some new blood or reactivated subscriptions with each expansion.
---
A windfury compilation, never seen one of these before..

How? Nothing about that was Yoda esque.

True! But tier 1 is here ;)
---
"You think you, but you don't. Trust me."
---
What exactly is your thought process here? How do you think these scams work that banning this account will do anything?
---
This is an obvious phising scam in order to hack in to people's accounts. Did it really never occur to you that maybe they use those compromised accounts to to send out these messages, so they don't care if they get the account is banned? For that matter, do you actually think this is the same person on the same account you've been reporting for three weeks?
---
I know this sounds mean, but it's just so annoying seeing people come on here and bitch about things without putting the slightest bit of critical thought in to the issue first.
---
FOMO the video game.
---
I don't think a hunter can even solo DME but i might be wrong
---
Honestly I feel like as a tank you'd be at liberty to remove a healer in that kind of situation. Yeah healers are desired but toxic ones no thanks. I can understand the struggle of sometimes finding teams for dungeons like Lower, but you'll be stuck with them for a fair bit rather than in and out of some random group for SM or something.
---
Warrior takes more time investment than any other class. Don’t play a warrior unless you plan on focusing only a warrior.
---
ah the ol' GM Blizardi that gives you [reins of spectral tiger] for free just by loggin in Biizzarad.freedomains.nut

If Night Elves evolved from Trolls then how come we still have Trolls?

Judging from just the numbers you do seem to underperform heavily. Especially after 7 weeks of gear from MC. So to answer your question, yes you are underperforming and progressing incredibly slow. But if you guys are having fun then keep doing what you do. The issue with "improving together" is that if you're all equally bad then you don't learn anything really. I always found that I became better when playing with people better than me, and when/if I started out performing those people, then I tried finding even better people to learn from and so on. Playing with friends makes that kind of difficult though since you can't ditch them. I'm just worried that if this is your performance in MC you might hit a brick wall in BWL and frustration and discontent might arise

Thursday is 3$ well drinks. I buy 3 of these things called reds wicked apples beforehand, 3 is enough to get you drunk, then I just sip on gin and sprites. I go through probably 4 of them in the ~3 hours. I’m a regular and work at a different bar as a side gig so people will come by and offer me shots. 
---
Even better is Monday’s because it’s 1$ domestic beers. Do the same thing but end up drinking like 8-10 beers. 
---
We have this guy who I’ll call Greg that offers rides home for the price of gas. He used to be a big alcoholic but turned his life around a couple years ago. Ends up being like 3$ for me and he refused to take tips but I’ll usually buy him Taco Bell. 
---
I know Australia has a higher cost of living so the numbers are a bit fudged. For reference my typical Uber for ~30 miles is 20-25 dollars.
---
I’ll be playing Pantheon when it comes out, but by the sounds of it it’s not going to be for you. Slow leveling, spawn camping, non instanced dungeons, sitting to get mana after every pull, etc.
---
Blizz jumped on the raiding/dungeon exploit because it literally broke the game and got tens of thousands of reddit upvote arrows so Blizz had to address the issue.
---
I reported hundred of names on Grobbulus(RPPVP) and I saw those same people all the way to 60 so I doubt Blizz looked at a single report. They definitely do not care at all about customers actually being happy. I ran MC 4 times and then dropped the game after being hyped for years. Blizzard is genuine trash. Creating Classic was obviously not for the fans. They ran the numbers, cranked it out, made money, and don't give a shit now.
---
If you're physical DPS you need to get exalted. If you're a healer you need to get exalted. If youre ranged spell DPS, it's exceptionally good to be exalted.
---
because people don't want to give their phone number to an internet company.
---
We need the same version of AV that Nost provided. It's way more fun, and fixes ranking too.
---
Alliance scum
---
He said he doesn't want it as a PvP weapon. Why else would they give it to him if not to raid with in that case?
---
full t1 set hunter now that is a beautiful sight indeed
---
There's a second one that is a rare drop from Live Strat https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13353/book-of-the-dead
---
He said "decently hardcore" which could easily be interpreted as "semi hardcore" which is right in line with your statement. It really seems like you're splitting hairs and you sound rather elitist.
---
Considering that those are all chance based procs, I'm not sure an addon that does this would be all that useful. You could go an entire fight without a single parry or dodge.
---
Good God you're as immature as they come.
---
Lol, you're like a walking definition of projection.
---
It's the holidays so staff are off on vacation. Also, this is classic and it doesn't get as much attention as retail (less staff designated probably).
---
Congrats on your Roll! Here's your -5000 gold.
---
Blizzard actively wants classic to die. They've sped up content release and let bots run rampant. They don't care. They'll probably release everything prior to Shadowlands at this rate so when people done with Naxx have nothing to do they'll think "might as well try out Shadowlands."
---
The previous phase (before bg’s came out), drained a lot of alliance players out of the game already, being corpsecamped at every corner sux. I get why they left ship, at least until the next raid comes out.
---
But classic is all about community and helping each other out, so look for a good guild and discord that will help you with what you want to achieve, be it casual or hardcore.
---
It sounds like you want more alliance players leaving, in contrast to what I’m trying to say: engage more.
---
A lot of players will see the light again after getting in touch with peers and a few wins.
---
You know the only solution in blizzards eyes: cash shop
---
Dude, if you don't parse 99% you are trash, god forbid you parse blue, then your hole guild is trash. Sure you are one shotting every raid boss each week and most people have 80% of their bis,... but they are TRASH! Everyone hates you! People will whisper your guild leaders and tell them just how much your guild is TRASH!  
---
*Is story is based on true events*
---
Mage and always Mage. Mage is the best class in the game for everything.
---
Hooooly fucking shit you are delusional. 
---
&gt;Dota does have a skill ceiling.
---
Where? When? Link please. Link me someone who has achieved the skill ceiling. 
---
&gt;And the curb stomping a good wow player has vs a poor one is absurd.
---
Not at all compared to what a 10k mid will do vs a 1k mid in Dota.
---
&gt;Over simplified comment full of bias. I can literally just reverse Dota and wow in your comment and it's just as accurate.
---
You couldn't.
---
&gt;A Dota hero has 4 abilities. And generally 1-3 items that require a use ability in game.
---
A warlock almost has as many spells as the entire Dota team in a game would and with trinkets exceeds it.
---
Chess has 16 pieces Warlock have 46 spells. Classic wow &gt; Chess.
---
&gt;Why is it that AI exists in Dota for PvP but no counterpart exists in wow? Even though wow has like 50x the player base? It also has arena tourneys with hundreds of thousands of dollars pay outs.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's been attempted in wow. The AI just ends up being fucking terrible so far.
---
Hahahahahaha. Wow has 50x the player base of Dota 2? Prize money? Have you ever heard of the international? 
---
People achieved Gladiator with Honorbuddy for their combat rotations. That was a couple of germans in a garage. OpenAI is a Elon Musk backed billion dollar company that is still only using 15% of the actual hero pool with more rules that severely limits the complexity of the game. And they still can't beat the best teams. 
---
You actually gotta be trolling at this point.
---
Tip someone 50g to use the items unless you plan on running other locks through later.
---
No offense, but I don't think you understand how machine learning would work in this scenario. Chess is easy to simulate because it can be abstractly represented with very little memory. Using machine learning (AI is a nonsense newsbyte, there's nothing 'intelligent' about how machine learning works). Wow, on the otherhand, is going to have to make at least some use of the actual graphical data, which means representing each pixel (or probably a cluster of pixels) in each frame as a value in a matrix of data. The computational overhead of doing this is so much larger than chess that it would be hard to compare the two. 
---
Now, there is a lot of abstract input and ouput in wow that could be used to minimize some sort of brute force neural network training that relies strictly on this pixel representation, but visual input would always have to play a role, and that means massive computation, i.e. a very expensive AWS account. 
---
tl;dr building a working neural net that can play wow is not something a person could do at home by themselves. Two neural nets playing Vanilla PvP against each other would be significantly more difficult than chess.
---
Nice, that's pretty lucky!
---
*I made this for you*
---
Going off this same theme - for solo farming out in the world, i.e farming recipes and materials, would a hunter or mage be better?
---
Careful, I could easily you see getting banned as you are benefiting from a bot.
---
I will work for 12.50 canadian  an hour  11 hour days,5 days a week ....from home as a remote agent   hire me hire me.....that's a pay raise in  the making.
---
He's right though, and nothing seems maladjusted about him.
---
Thanks for posting, I have been trying to wrap my head around what my best options are for my rogue to output the absolute maximum amount of dps in Molten Core for my guild.  
---
I have never used the Shadowcraft 6set bonus- I was fortunate enough to be the only Rogue in my guild while we were green and expanding and thus was handed a 5-piece NightSlayer set relatively quickly. Now that I've been at 5 pieces and we have recruited many more rogues I fully expect and encourage them to have 100% priority over me for the foreseeable future on any drops.  
---
Boredom and generally just wanted to have a somewhat matching outfit has led me to collecting all the pieces of the Shadowcraft set- which I completed yesterday.  
---
I am curious if the stat loss from the Nightslayer gear is made up for by the Shadowcraft Proc? I lose about 2.3% Crit and about around 30 agility if I take off my NS 5 set.  
---
Currently with ShadowCraft 6Piece: I play a human so I have my Racial in Swords (+5 swords) + Weapon Expertise Talent (+5 swords) + 6% hit from my various pieces of gear. Also 23.70% crit  
---
I am curious to see how this differs from my usual raiding with the NightSlayer gear which puts me at a much higher 26% crit unbuffed with more raw stats and about 8-9% total hit from the gear on my body.
---
I'm gonna go with luck lmao
---
This is your defense of 33 premades not being enough to take on completely random opposition?
---
Lmao needing on something you can use is not the same as putting it on reserve
---
Yall are ninjas for needing patterns you cant use. Plain and simple.
---
It happends when you dot someone, and someone dies after you die. You get killing blow, but no HK
---
both?
---
I still like jumping on GW2 or Star Wars:The Old Republic  every now and then.  Both games have gone more towards retail than classic in later xpacs though
---
People have demonic runes for various reasons, grinding felcloth e.g. - I have 50 on my warlock and dont really need them, imagine being a warrior or rogue  ;)
---
I just tested this with both Demonic and Dark Runes, and it 100% DOES NOT WORK.  You cannot use consumables when you're sheeped.  A few ppl have mentioned spell batching, so perhaps if you take one at the same moment the sheep is cast it would work, but you definitely cannot take one after you've been sheeped.
---
OP is a big fat phony!
---
Tauren druid.
---
I'd pick tauren even if druids could be other races.
---
Taurens are just very cool. As a kid I loved NE because I like the nature hippie loving races. But as I played NE I found out they're more like cow-ards. 
---
I'd rather just be a big leave loving cow who loves the thrill of the hunt. Mix in the druid cenarion lore and boom.
---
Plus warstomp with a druid is way too useful
---
Funny thing is alliance gets fucked over more with premades. You cant even take a shit in between queues if you are serious about ranking. meanwhile horde can chill out in solo queue and still rank at the same pace.
---
Don’t know if you’re trolling or not after reading this whole chain, but no. It’s worth 600 to the person selling it for 600, and 600 to the mage that will equip it, because he can just buy it for 600. You can not buy Savage Gladiator Chain for 3g.
---
Your entire comment is basically to ignore what I said.
---
&gt;Hahahahahaha. Wow has 50x the player base of Dota 2?
---
You understand that Dota 2 has like 300-400k individual log ins per month and that they themselves post this data right?
---
&gt;Not at all compared to what a 10k mid will do vs a 1k mid in Dota
---
A good wow player will kill a poor player often without being hit once.
---
&gt;Where? When? Link please. Link me someone who has achieved the skill ceiling. 
---
The AI in Dota two has achieved a 90% win rate against pro teams.
---
Wait or are you going to say it needs a physical cap while ignoring that wow doesn't have a cap like that either? Lol
---
&gt;Chess has 16 pieces Warlock have 46 spells. Classic wow &gt; Chess.
---
Yes classic wow is vastly harder than chess from a mechanics point of view lol
---
&gt;People achieved Gladiator with Honorbuddy for their combat rotations.
---
Honor buddy didn't play the character for them.
---
Funny enough you've actually just made another point supporting me. That AI could at best in wow could only perform a very small fraction of help to a player but not actually play them alone.
---
&gt;OpenAI is a Elon Musk backed billion dollar company that is still only using 15% of the actual hero pool with more rules that severely limits the complexity of the game. 
---
It's actually a math AI that they let play Dota for publicity. Because the mechanics of Dota are really simple so it can just number crunch and spam abilities faster than humans can react too. Wow has gcd that don't allow speed spamming and a far more complex game. It's why AI bots haven't been able to catch on.
---
I started over on a normal server after reaching level 55 as alliance on a pvp server.
---
I've cleared KT on pservers as a warlock. Is killing the content doable? Yes. But players are much different nowadays. The retail mindset of parsing and dps speed runs has crept into classic. No min/max player is going to want to wait for sunders to start dpsing. Killing cthun and the harder naxx bosses pretty much require heavy consumable use. The type of player who's gonna bother spending time outside of raiding to farm gold for these likely also wants to be pushing dps ranks. These players will slowly leave your guild when they're forced to stop dps because your tanks are undergeared especially while other guilds are efficiently speedrunning the content and killing bosses in under a minute. So yes it's doable but you're going to have a hard time retaining your most geared (and probably most important) players.
---
Its cuz he is dwarf so the gun specifically is the reason hes mad.
---
Yes, I understand Rhok'delar is better but it also requires a leaf and the sinew from ony people have been raiding for months and still not managed to get both of these (case and point myself).  It should still go to a hunter over a tank.
---
Hunters literally have an exclusive weapon drop. Why would you give hunters priority on other weapons when they are just going to vendor it for the leaf.
---
I mean, he's providing the classic vanilla spam experience.
---
That hardly seems like it would be worth the $15.
---
Shit you say that but I’ve sold a pair of living shoulders nearly every day for the past 3 months. Usually costs me at most 5g and sells for 20ish. Only pattern I’ve had to farm skin of shadow for is the Shifting Cloak which was well worth it in the end when I sold for 450g.
---
In the same batch, yes
---
Spoiler: You've been pwned.
---
The chance of not having been pwned these days is scary low. Some people go decades using the same set of passwords, not getting hacked is a matter of luck for most people...
---
What’s the job?
---
Wouldn't 1 shot indicate only hitting them once? I saw at least 3 different hits on the first guy so I'm guessing the rest of the vid wasn't 1-shots either.
---
Lets not. 
---
But good for them.
---
&gt;It’s kinda shit that they seem to care more about players who buy than the ones who sell.
---
The Scandinavian model.
---
Maybe there's a hidden multiboxer penalty, because my guild and I love Strat Live and average 3 orbs a run.  Our max has been 8 in one run.
---
Gtfo with that retail lore
---
The gap is certainly considerable. 
---
I'd like to see some numbers if you have them, but flurry is something that Arms can never have the hope of competing with in any real way.
---
Night Elves and Tauren are united by the druidic magics, so we gotta have love for each other
---
Dude this comment is -28 points in the hole (and counting) and is a quarter day old... How did you find this post and why are you putting your sauce on it?
---
great tribute
---
Must be if they keep spamming it. Imagine they do it multiple realms/characters per account.
---
Hey,  you know what would prevent alliance from making premades? If horde just rerolled alliance.
---
There is a lot of cut content from classic. The emerald dream, parts of Outland, Hyjal. I wouldn’t trust blizzard to do these right this time though as they were cut pretty early on.
---
Yeah but your client is disconnected at that point, lua runs in your client not serverside.  It's a lifeless husk waiting for the server to time it out
---
I think the deal is that R-can-ite and R-ca-nite are virtually the same pronunciation though. Either way R-cane-ite doesn't feel right.
---
The problem is they hack normal accounts, and create those characters. They never pay for subs and get free accounts.  Then blizzard just bans normal healthy accounts.
---
Moral of the story... Get two factor authentication. For fuck sake please
---
Lol. I assume you are being sarcastic, but in case you don't know the story of the night elves, I left a comment under the same comment as you with some back story.
---
What is annoying to me is that technically I have 310 Weapon Skill for Swords with my Human Racial + Weapon Expertise talent.. but when I open my menu to check my weapon skill it only shows (300 + 5)
---
So, I can see both sides to the argument here. A raiding guild would agree that the gun is not a hunter weapon, because the assumption is that all the hunters will get rhokdelar, since it's such a common drop and hunter only and BIS. 
---
However, in a PUG I can see why hunters would want to roll on other weps. If the PUG is guild run, they probably want to keep the leaf in guild, and if it's not guild run, the odds of killing majordomo are pretty low.
---
Ultimately, any hunter who raids should be targeting rhokdelar, but I think in the future the best way to avoid this issue is to be upfront at the beginning of the run. No matter how obvious it may seem to you, someone else is going to have a different opinion so it is better to clarify at the start for the pieces you care about most.
---
Sure, every pve server (where it doesn't matter) and a single pvp server.
---
Your loss.
---
I mean the only rough part is the ARR story, after that it is some of the best writing in the industry (especially shadow bringers).
---
_blizzard_
---
You probably enter your account and password on that site just to give it to them.
---
It is definitely not a fucking hunter you absolute idiot.
---
Melee dps? Sure they should get to need. It's BiS for fury warrior too, and it's up there for rogue.
---
Definition of a bad hunter a liitle ofc
---
I'm not mad I already have one I just think my guildie got screwed out of what should have been his loot.
---
Tribal, if there's any money in lw it's in those devilsaur items
---
No, it should not. If you thought about people other than yourself and how itemization works in vanilla, your emotion wouldn’t cloud your judgement. But it is, and clearly anyone who has actually played vanilla or raided knows that this goes to melee dps. It’s a PVP item to be honest, striker is PVE and lasts until p4.
---
Strength is melee attack power, not ranged.
---
It's redundant. It's too easy to get hit as a hunter. Whatever he would gain in trading out a piece or two of hit gear would be lost by constantly clipping his auto shot.
---
Mouseover heals my guy.
---
Get some raid frames that will show you party/raidmembers as well as their current health and any status effects.
---
The you can map heals to left/right/center click, as well as other mouse buttons. You can program modifiers that will change layers (i.e. Shift+Left click, or CTRL+Right click). This will give you easy access to rank down heals.
---
I currently use healbot, but there are tons of raid frame addons.
---
The only thing I really use key bindings for when raid healing is my divine favor, seals/judgements, and my bubbles/DI.
---
I also would advise you to pick up the pallypower addon, it makes managing blessings super simple.
---
Of course they don't care. People don't cancel their sub over this shit.
---
You have been raiding ony for months and don't have the sinew? I don't believe you.
---
The best part is the male tauren falling animation
---
Congrats man pog!
---
Not only that, if the average game length doubles,  it also means horde queues double.
---
You’re right.  I just can’t fathom playing two MMOs at a time.
---
I'm with OP. I had an absolutely amazing time, but quit pre-60; I was behind the curve so I got a glimpse of what my "future" would be and it looked utterly miserable (watching streamers just optimize AV and grind it 10+ hours a day so they could rank up over the course of a few weeks/months). 
---
Everyone has a different definition of fun but the way people are min maxing, and just endlessly grinding WoW is just about the least appealing thing in the world to me. Exploring, progressing, trying new dungeons, and the little magical interactions is what made classic WoW an amazing experience for me but those thing start to go away over time as you play more and more. Everyone is allowed to have fun their own way, but I hope the people out there grinding honor 8+ hours a day are actually enjoying themselves and have taken a step back and questioned "is this fun?" at least once along the way
---
Server transfer is going to be your path to peace.
---
I rolled undead :/
---
Why pay $15 when you can hack into accounts and scam for free?
---
please not. i still havent finished my rep grind since i can't nolife it
---
I'm so confused by this comment
---
Remember that Blizzard messages will always appear in a separate window from your chat box. If that fails they'll contact you via in-game mail.
---
Check out [this page](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/32221) for more detail on how a GM will contact you in-game.
---
Seems like a leaf and sinew drop everything time we do MC and ony. Last night we brought in a pug hunter to take the leaf....
---
Play during prime time as there will be more randoms queueing then.
---
I rarely play WoW these days but why the fuck you guys post the same shit that has been happening since Wrath? Yes we get it, posting it on Reddit won't do shit.
---
I dont think I'm a big fat phony.. so thanks for those kind words..  this was working recently so it may have been fixed with recent spell batch fixes and as I said in my original post I made this post after hearing it wasnt common knowledge for helping people in older posts, which I found thru playing and not from a guide so maybe it never was an intended interaction.  Thanks for the feedback... and kind words :)
---
Why should it have been his? Rhok outclasses it by a mile and is a 50% drop chance that *only* hunters can use. Him being a dwarf is irrelevant, weapon skill doesn't suddenly make a bad weapon good.
---
Blizzardi crime, the rum of choice for scammers.
---
around 1.5k
---
My condolences brother. I'll be heading there when I can login after work to pay tribute.
---
I've noticed this, as well as others in my guild. I had multiple buffs on, including onyxia buff and ended up with ~10% Crit for an entire MC run. 
---
It's reduced a bit from miss chance, I get that, but it was 15% lower than what it should have been. It was almost as if my Crit from gear, talents and buffs was doing nothing.
---
All of the Journeyman Trainers will teach you, they are found in the starting zones and the capitals usually.
---
Expert and Artisan trainers won't speak to you or let you train until you reach a higher level. 
---
The rank of the trainer is important.
---
I'm surprised Blizzard never made the name "Blizzard" off-limits during character creation.
---
The well of eternity and night elf evolution has been around since before wow Classic. The only parts that are "newish" are references to the titan world soul and blood trolls.
---
Although, I suspect even the idea of the titan world soul was already canon within Blizzard's internal story group prior to classic wow because Warcraft 3 has story elements which elude to Azeroth being some form of titan. I suspect the story group just hadn't gotten to the point where they were ready to make that reveal in game.
---
because blizzard has next to 0 support for classic compared to the actual vanilla game
---
well, Activision I should say
---
blizzard disappeared in the merge, as activision acquired them fully
---
Sinew is hard to believe, but I can buy the leaf not dropping. 
---
My guild hasn't gotten an eye in a month and a half.
---
The gun is better than those weapons it's more DPS and if you're  a dwarf it's worth using for the +5 to guns.  You don't know wtf you're talking about.
---
Looks different on my macbook with graphics set to 3/10 :-)
---
I think both are ok. My mage is on the Horde side. There isn't much low level AOE spots for the Horde maps as mobs are often separately roaming around.
---
And the Horde quests are quite linear to go from one map to the next. So I mixed grinding the mobs and quests together.
---
On the Ally maps there are a lot low level AOE spots in Wetlands and Duskwood. However you don't have too much mana in level 20s and early 30s, also you don't have Mage Armor which gives you 30% mana regen until level 34. So you probably need some gears, mana potion or wait for Evocation cooldown when doing low level AOE.
---
After level 34 things would be a lot better, if you run out of mana you could use 1 level Cone of Cold to kite the mobs while regenerating.
---
Garbage bants. Go play the game on easy mode Hans or Fritz or whatever they call you in Deutschland
---
&gt;It's reduced a bit from miss chance
---
WHY DO PEOPLE SAY THIS
---
It is NOT reduced by miss chance
---
Long horde queues were obvious. Ability to premade was just a bonus from instant queues.
---
In my experience on relatively balanced servers, horde would jump alliance every chance they get. While alliance would not do the same every chance, but if they get attacked would defend themselves. Horde are also waaaay more likely to corpse camp, while alliance are more likely to kill and move on.
---
I'm playing a mage.
---
Yeah mad wasnt the correct word, just didnt think u deserved the idiot comment :)
---
“Hey guys what’s the best way to make your experience playing AV as shitty as possible? Thanks!!” 
---
-OP
---
Remember wPVP honor release? Fuck you lol.
---
Hackerman!!
---
Not on classic.
---
then you ARE CORRECT!
---
sorry, see a lot of people mistake this
---
Moonglade is a place for peace.  Anyone who commits war crimes must answer to the UN.
---
PM the raid leader ahead of time and explain that you're using swords right now because they are the best weapons available to you, but that you intend to roll MS as a dagger Rogue. There should not be any issues with this as
---
1. There aren't any MH swords in MC anyways, and it's not like you're replacing Vis'kag.
---
2. It's not like Healing/DPS or Healing/Tanking, it doesn't change your role in the raid.
---
If the RL won't work with you on this then I'd look for a more reasonable group to run with. If for whatever reason you can't (raid time, etc), you might have to take the DPS hit just to make the moron raid lead happy. You can MH Glacial Dagger from AV or Darrowspike or even the classic Barman Shanker.
---
except there is a machine that can calculate all of that. Its called raid logs. Who brought all of their consums? Who is doing dps during trash? Who is topping the meters? Its all right there. Whoever puts in the most effort, gets the most rewards. Simple concept. 
---
And if LC isnt doing that, then thats not a problem with LC, its a problem with the guild leaders.
---
Are there really that many compromised accounts to work with?  Not being snarky here legitimately asking if there's really such an abundance of hacked accounts that they can use them for a scam like this that's bound to have a ridiculously low success rate.
---
I have the same issue as you. I cant averge more than 16%crit on a fight, but other mages in our guild are consistently getting 20+ every fight.
---
You can give gold to whoever you want to.
---
That’s one way of looking at it. Another is bringing another mage or two with a consumer to cover your secures groups. In my guild we assign buff and decurse groups by mage.  So if I’m trying to go ham one week I’ll simply ask a mage or two to cover for me and return the favor the next week. I typically only do this when I get a big upgrade and decide to flask/collect world buffs.
---
But yes in short the mystery is the decursing GCDs if you’re other parses are good.
---
My dog works at Blizzard too! You think they know eachother?
---
Hello horrible player.
---
because they cant ban their own GM, wouldnt make sense
---
on lvl 54 mobs, players, and 58 elites? 
---
im not using raid #s
---
Blizzard slacking so hard :/
---
/r/Matt
---
my samples are from 54 mobs, players, and 58 dungeon elites, not raid bosses
---
You could see stuff only near your body. In rest of the world you could only see ghosts.
---
Manual verification doesn't scale and doesn't handle edge cases and is more prone to false positives. You're just wrong about this.
---
I do sub 15 min consistent runs, unless there are chests/books i go back to get. I reset with a second account. Look at the video, that's me on an average run.
---
That list is taken from that run, where gordok dropped a weapon and the chest. It's abit above average, i've seen alot better. So no, 13 minute runs are not hard to do.
---
Here's a list of night elves:

I'm not sure what elves give exp and not, but I'm almost certain it is not possible. If you include all elves, satyrs and nagas, it probably is.
---
... they had 12 million subs, they had to automate, which is why this person is still around, if no one reports it, it won't get flagged.
---
Had a 40 minute game where horde just kept killing themselves recalling for 30 minutes. They never got the gy, and the few they had on attack couldn't get vanndar started at all and 2 pugs kept defending the bunkers. Ended the game with 250HKs before we won.

Been 7/8 for 5 weeks now.

Mag won't drop my pants. :(

Ah jeez
---
I il
---
I didnt, but am open to researching the topic if asked.
---
Currently If I wanted to do other languages I'd only be able to have a single male and female shared among all of the races, since I only have other one pair for any language other than English.
---
If that were true the crit cap would be an absolute ceiling that could not be raised. But seeing as how getting more hit chance increases your crit cap it would appear that it is not the case. Something about dumbfucks
---
It makes more sense if you change the punctuation. It matches his speech pattern, rather than being anything he'd actually say. 
---
&gt; Spoilers, they won't.
---
You don't have to give them your phone number to install the authenticator app.
---
Oh shit, yeah that sucks big time. Think of the scale of the game and the number of servers around the globe, if only 1% of people fell for this you’d still have thousands of accounts to plunder :(
---
I didn't realise that actually, thanks for letting me know.
---
Oooh some clarification. Okay I digress
---
Buy em all?
---
Yup I noticed that too. Try taking off item rack.
---
On average, do you think a 60% or a 100% mount player will be more effective in AV? This is the only information you have about them. Exactly, now fuck off.
---
I just wonder why no one ever shows the kill count when making these "dropped after millionth run" threads. It's not like everyone doesn't have DBM.
---
Man, tell that to my Orc Shaman.
---
I swear to god I never resist stuns...
---
I heard Biizard had more integrity than Blizzard and didnt ban their player from Shartstone for speaking out on the atrocities in hong kong
---
I dropped multiple professions and always could re-learn new one.  
---
So it shouldn't be that common bug.
---
I have no idea since I main a caster so what i'm gonig to say is probably compeltely wrong but just suggestions.
---
For casters, bosses have a innate 24 resistance(8 per additional level) that you can't reduce, isn't there a similar hidden mechanic for physical damages ?
---
Doesn't the defense reduce crit rating ? I'm pretty sure the bosses have 315 defense since they're lvl 63
---
Damn I feel bad for all the other rogues in your raid.
---
you only get aimed shot if you spend 15 points in markmanship I spent most of my points in beast mastery.
---
Honestly in the 4 years I've done vanilla I dont think I've once seen this go to a hunter nor did they feel entitled to have a shot at it. It's always just been a pvp roll. 
---
With more info coming to light about classic it's also very strong for most melee since you dont need much hit so this fits nicely.
---
AV quest bow far exceeds this and it literally requires you to win 1 game. Doing quick google search and it's even said that hunter weapon skill is a non factor until 315+ and even at that point it's just bad.
---
Now in a pug I suppose he should have had a chance cause it's just free rolls but I couldn't imagine being a hunter and taking this but that's just me.
---
They aren't banned because you have a blocked/ignore list
---
Someone told me you can attach the eye in trade screen to someone else's hammer.  If that's true you can easily get some solid cash out of the eye.  I'd pay a lot just to have it

Orc Warrior. Tier one shoulders are 10/10 on orcs and they fit the class fantasy so well
---
Come to Grobbulus! It is an RP-PvP realm with the most active community of any NA realm. This isn't even my opinion, there is significant data to back it up. Grobbulus has THE largest subreddit of any realm AND one of the largest discord servers. 
---
Grobbulus is also one of the most balanced realms with ironforge.pro showing a balance of 54% Alliance and 46% Horde last time I checked (a few days ago). The realm is high pop rather than full so there there are plenty of people but almost never any queues. And since it is RP you get a ton of awesome community hosted events like holiday parties and large scale world pvp battles.
---
I just want to use my time efficiently. Whether or not I tried seemed to have little effect on a win or loss.
---
Little embarrassing but I think I may have only “not available” options in view so that’s why i don’t see it. May have to check that when i get home
---
Ya I don't understand it. It happens so often, and for such a long period of time, I just can't see it being statistical probability. Maybe that's just because I'm already biased to watching for it now. I'm sure the guys who are getting tons of Crits, are perfectly fine with it.
---
Uhhh... no
---
The only problem is this WAS NOT the av that was in place during the honor system.  The only gripe real pvpers have atm is that av gives WAY TOO MUCH honor for very little participation.
---
Because its christmas time, lots of guilds have stopped raiding right now
---
&gt; Seriously, why spend your time doing something you don't like doing?
---
Rewards make things worth doing. Why eat salad and do cardio all the time if you don't like doing it? Because the reward of a healthy body is worth it. Why study for hours a night if you don't like doing it? Because you want good grades and success in school leading to a career. Virtual rewards really aren't much different
---
even if you're bm you still at the very least get aimed shot. every single viable hunter spec has mortal shots &amp; aimed shot
---
Dont hold your breathe. Been using it a few weeks now and it feels super underwhelming. I guess if you lack tank healers it's ok but soon as t2 3 piece is available I'm going back to CH with +healing gear.
---
LOL what a joke.  In spite of the inbalance we wiped the floor with you idiots when it came to organized PvP.
---
You have to be the biggest shameless loser here ROFL.
---
Can you post a parse?  I'd be curious to look at the numbers.
---
 E d
---
Yeah, but when is the gold amount to high? I can’t find an answer to this.
---
Like if I gave away 500g would that be to much, or do we talk 20k?
---
I sure do enjoy it as well. Last 5 games losses with 0 bonus honor in total.
---
Why even ask if that's your mindset? The ban wave will come.
---
Isn't 2019 strange that so many of us can raid seriously have gfs and gold farm? Young me would be so proud 🤣
---
Seriously, *HOW*? 
---
Yoda never used contractions, not once, in the entirety of his screentime. They fundamentally do not work within his dialect. How...
---
We have only one hunter left that needs it and only 1-2 priest that need benediction. Join a guild raid weekly get loot.
---
It was meant to be.
---
I was wondering what happened to fish prices, scanned last night for the first time in some weeks and they’re worthless. I’ve seen some bots but didn’t realize how bad the problem really was
---
I would reccomend 3-5 resto shamans, 2 druids and 3-4priest. 8-10 heals total.
---
Yeah some posters have been saying this got taken out with the spell batching stuff so this info maybe a irrlelivant post as of this week lol.
---
&gt;15
---
It needs 11. In what spec are you putting 40 points into BM? Are you trying to confirm being bad right now?
---
Depends how you play the game, if you like aoe grinding go for stam and int. Same for pvp
---
If you mostly pull mobs 1 by 1 its worth it to get the dreamweave set and frostweave pants tough.
---
Bracers of frozen wrath and the cloak from hinterland elites(horde) is amazing
---
Your talents matter too. You need your feral tree to be mainly bear talents. Increased threat gen talent, the ability that gives 5 rage back on a crit, and all the other good ones. If you get crits on your swipes, you get all that rage back. If you stack crit. You can just spam swipe and they crit all the time. It's a beautiful thing. But try to get some gear with armor on it, like rings, trinkets. They give 360% minimum. 
---
With the right talents you should be fine, seeing as how bears have more armor than warriors. Make use of your taunts, and AOE taunts too.
---
Wow, as if that wasn’t horrible enough, someone actually had taken the account. I can’t imagine how traumatizing that must be. Thank you for sharing your story, I’m deeply sorry for your loss.
---
They wont spoilers? Is that a sentence? Thats what it is when you un-yoda it. i would love to see you or /u/Balisimo89 try to explain how that is anything even close to a yoda-ism
---
Lobo is good. I use it as my mh dagger right now, with CHT on oh. I will replace it with Perds (or even gutgore ripper) if/when it drops, but lobo is the best you can get outside of a raid.
---
&gt; Essentially applying dodge, block, parry, ect to see how much your health pool is worth?
---
It's called "Effective health".  
---
IIRC for retails there's TanksTotal addon, but not sure that it will work in Classic.
---
Bots and fake spammers run rampant throughout the game and it seems like it's a very slow process for them to get on top of it.
---
On my server there was a guy just patrolling around storm wind shouting his company's gold selling site and this went on for days.
---
bosses have a hidden 24 non reductible resistance to all magic schools
---
welcome to rolling the overpopulated faction. you saw this coming.
---
&gt; only fun you can get out of this game
---
I mean, I like it b/c I'm taking the time to appreciate how the game started compared to what it's at now.  I don't even have a toon at 60 yet.  Am I playing Classic WoW wrong, then?
---
&gt;0, would this not work if I play on a MacBook t
---
Windows only, sorry.  
---
While there is pwsh for Mac, to be able to use OCR you would need another app like Tesseract, so I took the easy route and used windows built in ocr.
---
yeah dumbfuck
---
the reason hit raises crit cap is that in the attack table, your hit, parry, dodge, etc get rolled first. Then your melee swing. Then your crit. So once you "CRIT CAP" what that means is that your crit rating is a higher % chance than your ability to hit the target. Meaning every time you land a hit, it is a crit. The way you raise this crit cap is to get more hit. 
---
This generally only applies to duel wielding autos, because you can easily still be around 20% miss chance on those. 
---
Crit cap never is an issue for specials, because you cant really raise the crit cap on those, as by default youll be only 6-9% miss for those based on wpn skill. 
---
You arent arguing against me. Youre arguing against the blizzard post that I quoted. Youre arguing against every website and youtube video dedicated to the matter. 
---
Your miss chance WILL NOT AFFECT crit rating until your crit rating is higher than your hit chance. 
---
Let me spell it out for you. Casters calculate hit chance first, then crit. So, if you have a 5% chance to miss, it rolls.... and if you get 1-95 in the roll, it lands, and then it calculates crit. This reduces your overall crit rating because your crit rating is a percent of that 95%, not of the overall 100%. 
---
Melee however rolls everything separate. So, hypothetically, if you have a 15% chance to miss and 85% to land a hit, and 10% crit, it would roll 1-15% for the miss, 16-90% for the hit, and then 91-100% for the crit. So your crit chance is never reduced by chance to miss until your crit chance is higher than your chance to land a spell. 
---
GOOGLE IT. Literally everyone, including blizzard official responses on the matter, tell you so. I quoted it for you even and you still ignored it.
---
Im not at all hard core right now.  I get maybe 3 hours a day on average, and not even playing every day.  I guess my main question would be what is everyone doing when they aren’t raiding?  You said no one really bothers with consumables or pre bis farming, so is everyone just honor farming in AV the rest of the time?
---
I only hit 60 just before Thanksgiving and have about half of my pre bis list, and I’ve probably done less than 50 total dungeon runs, not even stepping foot in a few at all yet.  I have been unguilded until recently and was not prioritizing key attunements until last week.  
---
If you have 40 solid consistent raiders, you could easily do a few dungeon groups a few nights a week to improve your raid experience.  Not saying everyone needs to min max or memorize every detail of anything, but simply getting some dungeon gear and ony head buff will improve your times dramatically.
---
Doesn't work against competent premades. Even with 30 people defending,  alliance usually wins in 20-25 min.
---
Your numbers are made up. Mara caps at like 60gph if you get perfect drops
---
To you, sure.  Some people enjoy goldfarming though.  Everyone's different
---
Yea I just want it, it's nice to have in PvP for the raw stats and the 5 bonus is nice enough. But I feel you, the +healing is way too low
---
I enjoy it and I don’t care if others don’t enjoy it 🙃
---
Hunters do not need strength, it's a useless stat for them. In fact even stamina isn't that important for PVE. You were robbed :( but fear not, you will out level the item soon anyway.
---
The accounts are hacked. They aren't paying for it. And if they are, not much incentive for Blizzard to stop them.
---
No and neither am i
---
Ya but that ain't gonna make a 15% difference. I'm also talking about the ENTIRE run. So trash mobs included.
---
&gt;horde flair
---
Hmmmm
---
True ally here, thanks so much. He was a dwarf hunter, so fire a gun up there if you can. I’m a pally so...
---
Yeah there was a bot farming elemental earth in arathi one time. He was a melee hunter and if I tagged the mob as he was getting to it the program wouldn't recognize it wasnt his tag and just kill it for me. Got like 50 elemental earth after a few hours.
---
Eventually the person using it must have come back to his computer cause he did a /spit then logged off. He came back like 30 minutes later and I just did the same thing until he hearted out.
---
Risky business
---
I wish i could still make money off living shoulders. The market for them on my server has plummeted. At best i can get 10g for them on the AH now. And there are about 10 other people selling as well.
---
Agreed. My comment wasn’t meant to imply that a pug strategy would work vs a premade.
---
Nope. I actually got one of these on my old Mage back in the day, AOE spammed a bunch if mobs for a few hours to test it out. It isn't very good, but it has the potential to be if you get super lucky procs on single target or Arcane Explosion spamming.
---
Yes, the mage definitely has an extra reason to *want* it over the rest of the party. That does not change the objective value of it to everyone. The mage does not *need* it more than the rest of the party, though. Everyone needs gold equally. People only say “all need” to prevent people like you from thinking they deserve the gold more than the rest of the party. It’s the only way to ensure everyone gets an equal opportunity at it.
---
“Our” loot rules apply to expensive BoE items (there’s a difference) that are of the *same* value to everyone.
---
What’s your server/ in game name if you don’t mind me asking? So I can make sure not to invite you to my arena farms
---
I wouldn't be surprised if OP was the only person that got banned.
---
What if you simply don't have the time to farm an epic mount in any reasonable time. I generally have between 0 and 2 hours to play WoW a day, depending on when my son sleeps, how tired I am and when I need to be up the next day, more often than not resulting in me not getting play. Farming an epic mount would take ages for me (if I can ever get to 60 that is), I kind of feel like that's a decent excuse to enter a BG without an epic mount, as I'd otherwise have to wait for ages (rough estime up towards 3 months) before I could play a BG.
---
they would never, ever do this. Their corporate model is about being a tiny GM team, which they recent laidoff and rehired for less pay, and having them tend to their entire GM demands. To imagine them creating a product to cater to the pleasure of groups of subs at any additional expense is not in their realm of possibility. We got classic ONLY because vanilla private server scene was getting extremely hyped on all social media as Lightbringer brought back the full hype of Nost and much, much more. They simply reeled their product back in. Classic is far more about controlling their brand than pleasing fans.
---
This guy knows how to use the system.
---
Agreed. I of course didn’t mean to imply that this put strategy would work vs. a premade.
---
Relevant username
---
They are great for leveling, and without bots, the pearls start to become worth enough that streaks of bad luck are acceptable for farming them.
---
redditors hate the chinese for some reason even though they play chinese game and post on chinese website lol
---
Trash is over lvl 60 so it applies too, it's 8 resistance per additional level.
---
It seems odd my crit chance is pretty normal, if you're a mage I guess you are counting winter's chill ? Unless you have a very sitrct guild the debuff keeps keeps getting removed by others and it takes some time to fully apply it you can't consider it as a permanent 10% crit increase.
---
I'm still mad I lost my one and only chance at MH Dal Rends sword to a fucking huntard. And this was right after DM release (awhile ago now).
---
Only time I've seen it drop and was literally hardly anyone rolling on it. I rolled higher than other rogue but then this hunter rolls and wins it...... And it was right after DM release where they have a better weapon upgrade anyways. I still remember the hunters name too lol. 
---
Just to be that inconsiderate and not knowing what's actually good for you makes me so mad.
---
BGs are meant for PvP first and foremost, not your PvE centric rep grind.
---
&gt; probably still an upgrade.
---
Probably not since it's basically useless, could easily get a agi/stam ring off the AH for like 1g instead. Regardless, like you said it just doesn't really matter, it's lowbie loot.
---
So now aren't you the cheater lol \*ooooo what a twist!\*
---
Female Dwarf.
---
/Giggle
---
Lol
---
But you aren't whispering 1000s of people at once.  You have to do it individually.   Ofc they use a bot to maximize the number but the question here is: is the successrate higher than the number of reports it would take to get robo banned?  My guess would be no, because misspelled blizzard and barely legit looking url is going to take a special kind of dumb to fall for.  But as others have already pointed out these dudes might be rich in hacked accounts and at some point this is all you can really do with them.
---
Hmm I need to change my passwords..
---
It's -1% for each level above you.
---
You are definitely behind if you havent downed Rag in 7 weeks. Your people should be geared enough to handle Rag after 7 runs through other MC bosses.
---
So why are you failing?
---
One is raid composition. You need 2 tanks, 7-10 healers **max**. The rest are big dick DPS. A few fury warriors should have tank gear for some fights but be doing damage and not tanking for the vast majority of the fights.
---
Your tank 1 and 2 should be getting big priority on tank gear, they should be heavily geared long before any other warriors.
---
Second is mechanics. If your people have a good comp and decent armor and cant clear Rag then they are fucking up on mechanics. You need the raid leader to go learn mechanics and hammer them home. If someone keeps fucking up you warn them once, warn them twice if they dont improve, and Gkick them if they dont fix shit after that.
---
Your mages should be dispelling when needed and people should be decursing when needed.
---
Your whole team should be coming on time, repaired, prepared and with consumes. No, you dont need flasks, but your melee all should have Greater Fire Resist pots. Use raid logs to see who uses them especially on Rag and Baron. If they dont have them, they need to be given a serious warning that anyone without fire pots wont be getting loot.
---
Your people should be have a handful of basic ass potions. Health pots, mana pots, and at least a couple of damage boosting pots like STR, AGI, or Mongoose pots.
---
You need to start cracking down on fuck ups and people who are not showing up with pots and repairs and all that. These are not hard to get one week in advance. You dont need to drop 100g on a flask, you need to drop a couple gold on a few basic pots, it's not much to ask and it can make a huge difference.
---
Start slow introducing rules but start getting serious about punishing repeat offenders by restricting loot or kicking them from the raid team that week if they didnt show up prepared.
---
As a warrior who just finished theirs in the last week, grats welcome to the legendary club.
---
none of this is true lmao 
---
cleared all the way to kt with two guilds and no TF tank. we weren't SALAD BAKERS ofc but we also didn't fuck around and pushed content fast. our tanks held agro fine and our dps could go nutty. 
---
TF is really nice but this comment sounds more like an experience with a less than ideal tank
---
I used the same password for WoW (and a bunch of other online forums) for a decade. I never needed to change my WoW password because it was a really strong one. Then one day the Blizzard Auth asked for confirmation if it was me logging in from Singapore.
---
The funny thing is that in WoW both creation and evolution believers are simultaneously correct. Trolls, Tauren, and night elves are all examples of evolution but dwarves and gnomes are examples of creationsism (since they were made by the titans). Humans are actually an example of both since humans evolved from Vrykul but the Vrykul were made by the titans.
---
I currently have grid2 setup to see the timer left on my renew on anyone I cast it on, party or raid.
---
True, Lobotomizer is a decent option.
---
Oh, to be a class with tier worth wearing…
---
Hey guys, I used to play in Vanilla but not from the beginning and so am unfamiliar with the patch order. There used to be WSG rewards for friendly and honored that you could get at 18,28,38 etc but I just got honored on my 38 priest and there not appearing. When are these being introduced or am I doing something wrong?
---
I went to the person in Ashenvale as I’m alliance and all she sold was potions and bandages
---
can you attach it in trade screen to someone elses hammer?  Might get some solid gold out of it if that's possible
---
Yeah. It's a nice experience **ONE** time but dealing with that everytime you'd want to run a dungeon? Yeah, no thanks.
---
It's Gaben.
---
Get one of the mobs in blasted lands that never dies, afk while attacking him and then check? Taking a bunch of numbers hitting a bunch of different things doesn't seem very scientific.
---
theres a dude on grob named nanaki who i see goin for exactly that allusion
---
I would have dropped the group though if they are that greedy I would never take that ring on my huntard.
---
Honestly I just assumed the Ony buff was bugged and assumed the debuff taking a few hits to apply, some resist/miss make up a few %. The rest is just stats and the meter being off a tiny bit. 
---
But thats assuming the buff is, or was, bugged. I have no explanation otherwise.
---
that must be it. my guild clears mc in under an hour cause it’s boring as fuck and we don’t want to spend more time than necessary in there. but enjoy wiping on rag for 4 hours and raging against the hardcore grinders. spoiler alert the game is easy and you’re wasting your time by sucking at it.
---
It is easier than you might think if you are already max level in one of them with raid ready gear. Technically at that point you only need to login for raids.
---
I used to play 3 mmo's at the same time back in the day. It just comes down to time management for what you want to achieve in a week.
---
Its gold related I believe.
---
An epic mount is less than 20h to farm for. That is less than 3 weeks even if you are averaging an hour a day. You will need solid gear before PVPing anyways so you will generate a tidy sum just by getting pre-bis. Add in questing in WPL/EPL for an extra 400g to start your 60 with and you would have your mount.
---
I'm a Rogue and went an untraditional route. I took Elemental LW for several reasons.
---
- There were already a huge number of Tribal LWers on my server, and at least one in my guild.
---
- I would have had to compete with the devilsaur mafia if I went Tribal.
---
- I decided to wear a few pieces of Stormshroud instead of traditional pre-bis stuff. The 3pc set bonus is really nice and similar to 6pc Shadowcraft. 
---
- Dragon LW doesn't help me, as a Rogue.
---
- I didn't know of any other Ele LWers on my server at the time (now there are several). I remain the only one in my guild (large guild with 6 raid teams).
---
In short, there was less competition for Ele LW. I made some decent gold off of it.
---
On my server the price for the full devilsaur set has plummeted dramatically in recent weeks, so that is hardly woth it anymore either.
---
its pretty funny seeing people with like 200k honor and like 100 honorable kills complaining about how much honor they have to grind, complaining how little they are actually ranking up despite dumping 10+hours a day into bgs, when its that exact type of attitude that's making it so difficult. yall thought you were the only ones afk farming av? what did ya expect when its so mindlessly easy
---
Oof. Every hunter should have aimed shot, no exceptions. It's like a solid 25-30% of your total DPS and I would go so far as to say it's mandatory for every spec in Classic. I mean, it's only 11 points in MM. What else do you have your points in?
---
I wouldn't be calling others out for not knowing what they're talking about if you're raiding as a hunter without Aimed Shot.
---
You're going to need to do a controlled experiment using one specific type of mob, and maybe hire a healer for as long as it takes to get your desired number of swings.
---
If I was setting up your experiment, I'd go for  [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7668/servant-of-razelikh](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7668/servant-of-razelikh)  in blasted lands.  They "phase out" and become unkillable and you can attack them indefinitely as long as you don't run out of HP.  Make sure you pull the mob out of the patrol path of the elite demons that roam the area.  Have a healer from your guild (or LFG or whatever) toss an occasional heal to keep you alive.  Would it be best if you don't use any abilities, just gauge your crit off white hits?  I feel this would be more consistent than doing a DPS rotation due to the various dynamic procs and abilities you may be specced into.  It may be possible that you don't take much damage from these guys and maybe you can keep yourself up by taking a health potion every 2 minutes.  
---
I use these guys for leveling up weapon skills, they're pretty handy.  I think using your data that includes players and a variety of mobs has given you unreliable results.
---
Wheeewwww lad that’s intense!
---
I may hop in there.  I haven’t played since before the first xpac stopped.  I think they even have a sale right now...
---
No I farm satyrs that drop them anyways. So really, I’m paying the opportunity cost from vendoring demonic runes.
---
You missed the best one for hunters: Falcon. Falcon, Eagle and Monkey should be their main itemizations. Whale is good for regen. Boar, Bear, Tiger and Gorilla are never Hunter loot though.
---
There are exceptions, like an item with static +AP that rolls of the bear. Also I never rolled on one personally, but HoJ was technically pre-bis for hunters P1 even though we couldn't use the extra attack. So some stuff that isn't "hunter loot" actually can be good
---
So its only ok to get your boe bis if some one else gets market price on ah...
---
One user calls someone a snowflake, the other user calls someone a boomer.
---
Y'all are really perfect for each other.
---
That’s what I’m using right now and I was like wait am I doing something stupid, lol. Because I swear I don’t see a lot of people MH’ing it so I wondered if there was something I was missing. But I guess that makes sense that a lot of people who go daggers end up getting a MC dagger to MH.
---
Huntards are the worst. A lot of dumb pallys out there as well
---
this is true 
---
I was a long time paladin main, obviously I would love the weapon but getting this on casters should be prio. 
---
but it is really nice for paladins, but so is Mish from nef :(
---
You really shouldn't...
---
What’s the point of PvP progression? To get PvP gear? Then what?
---
So many folks are afking in AV to get PvP gear when they’re never going to queue up and PvP just for the fun of it.
---
&gt; PVP ranks require way more honor for the alliance
---
Why is this the case?
---
so like vanilla??
---
What did you expect? a new game?
---
Prolly is some dudes hacked account, thats what u get for not having an authenticator on ur account.
---
Or you can equip it and they can inspect you...
---
Easy to get indeed, but man is that multishot damage sick
---
so what about winter's chill ?
---
Spoilers: They cannot.

I'd be down for it. I think with all the available information on the game now there'd be 1 or 2 weeks of painfully slow AV's, but once everyone learns the ins and outs of the pre-nerf AV it would be loads of fun.
---
BoPs are also the same value to everybody, 3g in the case of sav glad.  I need 3g just as much as warriors do, that's the point
---
the "It's worth a lot!" argument is completely debunked by AV, people need trash all the time.  so you're wrong, the only reason "all need expensive BoE" exists is because it's easy to convince a few people to agree to ninja and then everybody gets away with it.
---
as long as you convince the whole group to need on savage glad, you're not ninjas, you're 3g richer.
---
I’m not yet 60 due to being undecided on what class I’d like to max.  I have so many low levels floating around and my highest  character is only 40(which I forced myself to do). This has caused me to fall behind and makes it difficult to find groups for lower lvl dungeons(40 and below) to get gear,extra exp and coin. I even have a healer (only 38 though) thinking I’d get into dungeons quicker but that has proven false for me. My question is, is there a server where there’s a decent amount of not yet maxed players(but still a well populated server) that I can start over on or am I pretty much SOL? The type doesn’t matter to me, I’d just like to be able to actually do something beside questing and looking at the LFG channel mainly being for Ony, Arena(?), MC, princess runs(?) DM-E and other high lvl content. Thanks in advance!
---
It wouldn’t be bis since you can just put the same enchant on any better weapon
---
Good eye! Forgot Falcon.
---
No?
---
Literally right click the name and report it, otherwise you're the problem by not reporting it.
---
I am 100% certain those people never saw a Star Wars movie in English if they think Yoda has ever sounded like that.
---
Maybe in the Chinese subs and/or dubs but certainly not in English.
---
Well they should have masons fraternity ring for sure which is league's better.
---
Then it's up to that other slot which ANY ring with ANY amount of agi would be better than this one.
---
It sucks OP but honestly if you're leveling just move on. It ain't worth it because in 5 levels you'll have something better
---
I actually don't understand what you are asking. When something with value drops it's most fair to let everyone in the party roll for the valuable thing.
---
It’s all fun and games until Bizzaro msgs you
---
Looks like they won't be available until phase 3.
---
250 runs and I haven't got yet. lucky bastard! :D
---
Give me one!
---
I mean it sucks as horde if you're just doing BGs for fun
---
They don't hack anything. It's people being sloppy and reusing old and bad passwords and emails that allow them to simply grab a leaked database and try everything with brute force methods. No hacking needed anywhere.
---
All 3 of my emails have over 10 pwns, but somehow a lot of my friends have none. But still, get a password manager.
---
Horde do that because we enjoy actual pvp... ok that isnt true.  We enjoy smashing the other faction and calling it pvp.  We could care less about objectives.  We do care about the best gear to smash alliance tho.  And sadly av is the best honor per hour so we are forced to play it but hate that it is a pve dungeon with some pvp thrown in
---
Lel
---
As a clothie I will have to report this video.
---
Doesn't matter what you think. They are the same.
---
There aren't any satyrs from like 31 to 45.
---
And arcane explosion. Not arguing that math but ae is still very useful in pvp.
---
I find using a faster 2h works better with fury 2h and keep flurry up.  Arms is inferior in raids from an analytical perspective.
---
I'm curious how to communicate the price and length od the boost via emotes only. To top that how do you even engage someone to boost you like this?
---
Oh. Touché.
---
Blizz would then ban you for grieffing haha
---
Lol I get the joke, but it seems like it was at the expense of me and not the guy being ridiculous.
---
Does spell power influence the proc dmg?
---
Speak for yourself.  I have fun, and I'll continue to have fun as long as the game exists.  If you're not having fun then quit ffs.
---
Stephan is amazing, and has the whole package as far as stage presence goes. Any songs you'd recommend pursuing?
---
whether you can buy it or not is irrelevant, just because it's BoE doesn't mean there's any in the market for you to buy either.
---
what matters is it what it sells for.  for a BoE that can be a few hundred gold, for a BoP that can be 1-5g.  either way, it's more gold than 0 gold, which makes it need worthy
---
If you aren't a tank you would absolutely not want TF as a warrior.  The TPS of that thing is off the charts, you would just pull aggro and die constantly.  Rogues can barely get away with it, and they have vanish and feint.
---
You don't need another reward for having fun
---
I play mage and this is my favorite place to Port. Everything you described is why I love it. One downside is I almost never get ony and warchief  buffs.
---
BONKERS LUL
---
It’s a tough grind. The math comes out to be on average 1 gold pearl per 266 naga kills
---
I remember the days of having our 8th group full of rogues and a druid. Coordinated stealth tower and gy caps over ventrillo. Multiple groups of aoe mage and priest bombs coordinated over vent to take IBGY. Another coordinated group to rush backup to FWRH when the rogues capped it. THOSE were the days....
---
Alliance aren't pissed. Don't generalize everyone on your faction just because your panties are in a bunch over nothing.
---
Also, you play Alliance on a server where alliance make up 79.2% of the population, so basically you're acting like you faced some kind of hardship when really you're one of the offenders.
---
I'll say it again: **victim complex.**
---
This makes me want to reactivate more than anything else I've seen. It's weird how a certain place in a game can give you feels

**NOW YOU KNOW**
---
That still hardly means he is the pinnacle of aoe farming on a mage lol
---
Play priest. I have a low level priest alt which I find pretty enjoyable. Don't spam heals and use lower ranks when necessary.
---
on lvl 54 furbolgs and slimes, or players in WSG?
---
prob not
---
O god literally defending ninjas in other threads and using the same "take a step back" line. Yikes dude.
---
Isn’t that the name of your first character, followed by that character’s starter zone, e.g. “ZOMGRogue Tirisfal?”
---
Hordes.io    Browser mmorpg.   Really fun if you get a handful of friends to play together.   Well designed, and honestly a good time sink.
---
Is it truly a classic experience without scammers?
---
Pally
---
Thats why i want them to try =) i have a sneaking suspension they are just going to ignore my comment. cmon  /u/balisimo89 explain yourself!
---
If you have to ask whether or not its allowed you are probably too small for it to get noticed anyway
---
ehhhhh, farming furbolgs for 5 hours and then looking at DETAILS! is a pretty fricken' good way to tell how often you crit lvl 54 green mobs w/ almost all epics and a 23% crit rate
---
You want to be able to PuG for recipes and social pressure them out of competing against you. Get bent.
---
I like dkp...it rewards participation and results and allows for fine tuning with 1 epic per run, etc, type rules.
---
I got one from bliazzrd today. More or less the same message.
---
Weirdly enough, he whispered me about 10 seconds later as well....
---
I’ve gotten both a Flurry Axe and an epic mail belt drop (can’t remember which) while farming them for XP back in TBC. This is anecdotal but that’s more than I got while farming the blue dragonkin. Overall they’re worth it IMO.
---
redditors aren't good at video games tho 
---
lots of alliance players enjoyed phase 2 but not these people
---
I use this on my shaman for PVP and love it. The proc can crit and it can also proc off of purge which I find hilarious since it doesn't actually do damage.
---
Absolutely. Yes, there is a lot of greed. There are endless arguments citing 'equal value' and 'expectations', but everyone is playing a game and people lose sight of the vast amount of perspectives that exist. I believe in the value of community etiquette and common courtesy, but I absolutely could not fathom being upset with a player who needs on a valuable item that aligns with their character - whether it be a good weapon, a recipe, or even a material needed for a recipe. I understand that in some groups, i might have a chance at it. But I'm also trying to help people achieve their dreams, and believe the greed icon exists for a reason.
---
dont worry guys, he got his pity pants right after
---
On the plus side, if you’ve got 3 kids, you can run 5 person instances as a family!
---
Yikes dude.
---
Not really, I want to get max rep with everything, all the BiS items, all the quests, all the professions, and I'm leveling every class and race combination. Got like a decade of content even in phase 1
---
UC is the most convenient.
---
I just got 8/8 last week and it's so awesome.  You can GCD clothies with auto multi auto.
---
Damn how long did it take you to get this good dude
---
Oh I still level after I’ve typed LFG, ____ in Chat, I just never get a groups for lower level content and mainly only see people looking for groups for 50-55+ content. I mainly look for groups to get gear(upgrades) from a dungeon, I don’t sit idle and wait for it. Due to not getting any hits I was just wondering if maybe there was a realm where there are hits for high and mid level dungeons.
---
My 2¢ is that since you are a TLW you should be catering to the healing class with Hide of the Wild (DM:N Knot's Cache) and the Phase 3 Corehound belt (revered w/ Thorium Brotherhood). The rep for TB is daunting for sure so maybe you can rule that out early since it's a big commitment. Mining would be my suggestion to obtain Dark Iron Ore on the way and keep all your smelted bars for leveling engineering later.
---
&gt;pushes glasses higher on nose
---
*hands you a brand new package of poopsocks for your 10k gold farm*
---
I would argue it is worse than other options currently if for no other reason than HoR being a global taunt in PvP.  I will always kill the person running around with that thing first, even though the warrior with BRE is doing every bit as much damage.
---
German titles are 10 times better. Legíonnaire (horde rank 8) is called Wrathbringer in German. So much better.
---
I know plenty of groups that would've kicked a hunter for rolling on HoJ. Some guildies had ran that shit 100+ times and still hadn't seen it.
---
I disagree, I think we fundamentally have different ideas on the idea of value and community culture when it comes to warcraft. That's ok but I don't think we'll be able to reconcile.
---
So you’re already a hindrance so you fuck with other people who were trying.  Of course people are mad at you.
---
Maybe instead of that, find things to do that *don't* make the game worse for everyone else?
---
They should remove all loot from raids and people should just do it for fun.
---
I paid 25g for mine
---
I’m basically bis warrior dps and I feel like I crit constantly lol.
---
I was pretty intimidated by Weak Auras for a while. It just seems a bit impenetrable because it can do so much I didn't know how to start.
---
But, to start you can just copy-paste stuff from wago.io really easily and test stuff. I've got 2/3 which I used to fill gaps in the TukUI mod now.
---
Everyone getting the same shot at an item of equal value is NOT FUCKING GREEDY. Explain how that is greedy.   
---
Just because there is a gold coin on greed doesn't mean any looting for gold in the game is greedy.   
---
The Need symbol is just a dice. It doesn't somehow imply that its  meant for people to take priority on valuable BoE items.   
---
You are deriving your own meaning from those symbols, but its completely missing the definition of Need and Greed.
---
And it's payware, but I've found Dashlane to be pretty good too, (I have no connection to the company apart from being a customer) - it works across OS's, phones and tablets, which is nice.
---
Sure it is. My raid group is loaded with all these excess BoEs nobody needs anymore. Plenty to share.
---
You should probably send me 1k gold just to be sure it's ok
---
I think this is where we inherently disagree. I don't think it is just money. I think there is value in the experience and ultimately I think the experience of buying everything is a lot more hollow then finding things you need naturally in-game.
---
It's almost as if people have their own opinions and like different stuff about this game! Wow!
---
I know your link has the server name in it but you might want to stick the server name in the post too.
---
I like it tho:(
---
You should be annoyed but don’t worry, that ring doesn’t last that long before you get blackstone/masons fraternity ring
---
*General Blizzardi, I've been expecting you...*
---
Rattlegore
---
Only wipes threat at start of p3 so p1 DPS doesn’t matter.
---
I’ve had fun in random Bgs in original vanilla but classic isn’t the same as vanilla. Too many elitist players now, all about farming honor as efficiently as possible. Not my type of entertainment
---
Absolutely! I do think some grinds are more worth than others though. For me, going to BRD and running Anger over and over wasn't worth it. Neither is doing AV! But there are others that I find fun. I think it all comes down to personal preference and what you're able to stand :D
---
Blizzard only bans people for saying things they don't like, not for scamming other players.
---
Never understood why people complain so much about warrior I’m in mid 30s and never eat rarely even bandage if I’m killing 1 mob and I can decimate 2 mobs with sweeping strikes and cleave. All my level of course if they where 2-3 above me maybe I eat but when I leveled my mage I was drinking for mana more then I’ve ever eaten on my warrior
---
Sometimes I'm glad I'm a class that unintentionally pulls agro constantly and dies all the time. No stressing about carrying buffs.
---
Nah if you reread it they were saying they would update you on exact BG release time, not BWL release
---
Bitwarden is free. It's paid version is optional I'd you want extra stuff like the compromised password check. But for 10 $ a year, it is worth it.
---
It also works on any machine there is. They even have a windows store version to install.
---
&gt; I got bored 3 sentences in so I appreciated it. 
---
Are you okay...? That is shocking.
---
They might just get a lot of rogue drops. There's a guild on my server with like 5 rogues with 65-66 ilvl. They all suck but damn their guild gets a shitload of rogue/melee weapon drops.
---
Thanks! Only rank 4 here, dunno if that'll satisfy 'em. Mostly I just want WSG exalted for funsies.
---
I don't think you understand what he is talking about.
---
probably because they are creating spam accounts and then doing a charge back, or using hacked accounts.
---
I agree 100%
---
I've actually been somebody defending Blizzard around here talking about how they do bans in waves and to just have patience ect. Starting to regret it.
---
It's been over 3 months since release. We need to see something from Blizz to show they care about the bots.
---
Well I didn't, though I admit I didn't acknowledge it. Even so, I can totally see someone in eagerness, excitement, haste, needing on something that looks amazing and not realizing what happened, even if they were told about it. It's not ideal and definitely frustrating but if it was the case, I think merits forgiveness if requested.
---
Dickeruni wrong sideruni
---
This. Turtling is fun the first time and it sucks. Nobody liked it back in the days either. AV isn’t that much fun overall tbh
---
What is mango ferring? I stopped in 2013
---
They do give a fuck in retail WoW. They 1-month banned tons of account for exploiting XP potions. Yes, banned people for abusing probably the most irrelevant part of the retail WoW: leveling.
---
I was just thinking about how crazy big BRM is.  
---
Is there a non map picture representation somewhere of BRS, BRD, BWL and MC just to show how big that area actually is?  
---
Art I guess is what I'm asking for lol
---
“User Blizzardi is currently impersonating Blizzard staff in order to trick users into visiting a malicious website, he also said that Hong Kong has a right to exist as an independent nation-state free from communist rule”
---
This, gnome mage just looks right
---
This is why i posted this as a reply to someone saying *people* take this game waay too seriously
---
Hahaahahahaahahaha :D :D :D
---
The set static value is to the party, I wasn’t referring to the market. As in, set and static to every person in the party. Sorry for the confusion. 
---
I’ll reiterate this one more time because it seems like you’re purposely missing the point to hold onto your beliefs. No, the value is not what you can sell it for. The value is different to each person *for BoP* items. An SGC has an unquantifiable value because you *cannot* buy it, you must farm for it. That makes the value inequal to you and he.
---
You said earlier
---
&gt;who cares if it’s purchasable or not
---
That’s the whole point dude. Everybody cares.
---
not if you're trying to rank. 
---
Fun comes after you've got your rank.
---
You must be fun at parties. You can't even craft tf yet.
---
My server has a level 60 still running around with the name “Pissmop”.
---
Top grinders were joining groups to skip the queue times.  Exit a wsg, join a group who's queue just popped, hop right into a new wsg with no wait time.  It's the reason wsg was over 45min queue last week for the people who weren't cutting in line.
---
If players were buying gold, they deserve to be banned.
---
Sucks when it happens and the person is innocent, though.
---
Not a bug, it means you already have a copy of the book or have already completed the quest.
---
Okay, so first of all it would probably be unwise to level your first character this way. I spent some gold on my character to make him work. Lets go over everything. 
---
For the talents you’ll want to grab consecrate first, as soon as you have it you might be able to AoE (though i waited longer). Make sure to grab the talent that prevents pushback on casting so you can heal yourself when 10+ mobs are hitting you. After you have cons, put the rest in prot. 
---
For gear there is luckily not a whole lot out there at the lower levels, just focus on strength and stamina. I got the green tower from the AH (which is always cheap) and the AOE hat from the last boss in gnomeregan. 
---
There are some items that will help you AOE better. Most notably the shield spikes, the hat from gnomeregan, engineering grenades and oil of immolation. All easily attainable for a level 60. 
---
Youll want to go engineering for sure, for the grenades and other explosives. 
---
I also make sure I have a lot of potions with me at all times. If it gets hairy or I overpull I will use grenades, oil of inmolation, and potions to correct. 
---
Your rotation is simple, gather mobs and drop consecrate, and keep regenning mana with blessing and judgements of wisdom. You should regen enough mana to keep consecrates going as long as you cam survive. If you get low switch from retribution aura to concentration aura to heal yourself. Most of the time you’re just using 2 skills (wisdom and consecrate) and the occasional consumable. 
---
Ive found if you can find a healer friend, the playstyle really begins to shine. If your healer is good at conserving mana, and you’re just using wisdom and consecrate, ive found you can aoe packs of 6-10 mobs with hardly any downtime.
---
For sure its solid for pvp and 5 mans I find.
---
Yeah, I read that most people see it as a gold drop rather than a gear drop - which makes sense but is not really how I see it.
---
Man, the guild this guy is in must have some supercoolguys in it.
---
Im with you, brother!
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/Lt4aNd3.png](https://i.imgur.com/Lt4aNd3.png)
---
The mobs die significantly faster and you don't need to stop to eat like ever. It's much more efficient to do green quests. There is no xp penalty either until you are 5 levels above the quest. (They turn to green much earlier.)
---
Sick tech time to farm satyrs
---
You're right, it doesn't.  But there's a difference between being angry versus placing the word "fuck" in every sentence and making an equivalence to flat earthers.    
---
    
---
I understand that not immediately jumping on the "You're right, fuck Blizzard" train isn't going to curry me any favor here.
---
No, this is like buying gold.
---
you need to update your macOS to the newest one :)
---
Frick yeah, more neato information delivered in a non-aggressive manner. Thanks again internet buddy
---
When they delete the character that sent the message, it frees up the name and it gets reused on a different account.
---
Ima go level a warrior now...
---
Blizzards response is always proportional to the amount of effort it would take to fix.  They are lazy and greedy and want classic to be a turn key operation so any upkeep will be minimal.
---
inb4 people tell you Blizzard bans in waves as an excuse for their prolonged inaction
---
Do people actually fall for this shit? 🤦‍♂️
---
I'm paranoid on trash too so I put prowl on auto-cast and just use it as normal other wise. Pet follow when he takes dmg or raid leader calls for melee out depending on boss
---
Are you sure?
---
I heard one of the best rogues are there :S
---
It proberbly has a higher gear req. Than you need as mage but from my personal view mage req. more kiteing than priest does.
---
A Nice trick you can do while farming honor as horde is to Que for av in thunderbluff fly/hs to camp mojache but This works best with Que above 18 Min if you fly and 4 less if you hs. I get about 8g between my AV ques.
---
I mean maybe if you’re the only hunter. I haven’t seen the shoulders drop in 8 weeks. This week was the first week any tier helms dropped, but both t1&amp;t2 did.
---
GW2 isn't even close to an MMO.
---
Unfortunately it’s not viable to go for 8/8 t2 as a dagger rogue. :(
---
If it's an epic everyone's needs. That's just how it is.
---
They use stolen accounts and buy game time with stolen credit cards. It costs the scammers nothing.
---
Only the cheaters.  For most horde this cuts our queue times in half.  Too bad they didn't issue any bans for this exploit.
---
Blizzard staff: "...impersonating Blizzard staff... boring... ok.... WAIT WHAT? HONG KONG HAS A RIGHT TO EXIST? BAN HIM!"
---
Life is short, the cake is a lie, spend more time with things that you love before you die.
---
I used to go to a bar that had $1 wells on a weekly special. I'd spend $5 there and get a good buzz before walking home. This was in college and I lived less than a block away, which could have been dangerous for the wallet, were it not for the special being once a week.
---
Removing all customer support was a change 😅
---
sounds like you take things too personally. In any case pretending to not understand how an analogy works probably isnt the best approach
---
Yes. Thousands. Many of them are inactive players who don't even know their account was stolen.
---
Had the same thing happen to me. I tried to chat him up, and he went offline. Reported, too, obviously, but I don't expect that to work. So, yknow, fuck with 'em.
---
I think there is value in the experience of getting a fair shot at loot and also being able to determine how best to use a BoE drop for yourself, rather than being forced to equip a 600 gold item you won't use.
---
Most players who have seen more than a few drops think this way. Your mentality is shared by new players that have only seen a few rare drops and allowed someone to "Need" on it. They now feel like they should get their "fair" shot at free loot when something they "Need" drops.
---
Haha no actually I have a 31 mage and 31 Druid my warrior is 34 and I will say is well geared but I never bought anything just got pretty lucky with dungeons I guess
---
The unfortunate thing is that due to us playing in patch 1.12, the 8 piece for bloodfang is going to be in its final nerfed state that procs significantly less, so it won’t be bis. 5pc t2 + NS gloves/shoulders and boots of the shadow flame will out dps 8 piece by a decent margin.
---
Im a mage. I'm superior to all other classes.
---
Why? Just because... 
---
I pulled aggro with my stupid AoE/blizzard bullshit? Well I have Iceblock.
---
You think you're faster than me?Bitch I'm a mage, i can blink.
---
You have to use your hearthstone to go back to IF? Bitch I can go to IF whenever I goddamn please... And boom im in Darnassus, while you're still flying to Menethil Harbor...
---
You want to farm those mobs? Bitch those belonged to my AoE farm and you just ruined my 300k xp/h leveling experience.
---
You're thirsty and have to buy your own water from the Vendor? I'm a Mage, I'm never thirsty, I can make my own water and never have to buy from a Vendor ever.
---
Wanna get triggered? Haha Frostnova! Wanna get triggered again? Frostnova again!
---
Why Human? Why do I wanna play the race the size of a pebble? And why would I want start on the wrong side of the battleground? Horde has been red and has always been red, why would I want to change that.
---
Yeah for sure I guess it wouldn’t be solo cause I have a decent bit of dungeon gear
---
No, I actually do have the improved FD talent. I prefer not even imagining farming DM:N without it.
---
As a reminder because apparently a lot of people coming back to Classic don't realize this, but USE AN AUTHENTICATOR. You can download it for free on your phone and it's very unintrusive and easy to use.
---
Azeroth being an egg of sorts for a sleeping titan is definitely canon from classic. Cthun and the other gods of the void are here solely to corrupt the titan to give the void gods an avatar in the physical world.
---
if you're able to get to the end of dm north, the spirits around the edge of the king's room are basically target dummies. perfect for leveling weapon skills and testing rotations. you can quickly relog at the end to lose the king debuff and be able to attack them again
---
The flailing limbs is pure comedy, will jump from any ledge just to get a glimpse
---
Ah, perhaps bandages are not on GCD, I never paid attention. Normally any action that triggers GCD will stop the macro, no matter if it's available or not.
---
I don't believe LFG is in the spirit of classic and would be banned. For the character's equipment, if the API exists, I'd use a message specification framework - though I believe this isn't in the spirit of classic either.
---
Ty addons...
---
If anyone tries it on a blind let me know!
---
Hitting someone with a snowball isn't greifing.  Their purpose in the game is to hit people or NPCs.  There's no rule that "Hey, if you hit someone who isn't at their keyboard, that's greifing!"
---
Why is it shocking? I suffered through the whole post and it was the most boring and mundane thing I've ever read. "It took me 4 hours to find a group to do this games content. That's what I love about MMOs!" Oh ok then
---
You know what has never been hacked? I have a book in which I have described my passwords in with words or a picture. I have had it for 10 years, longer than any electronic thing has lasted. Also the fact I have long passwords which are sentences seems to have helped.
---
Yeah... you could make an argument of it getting lost, destroyed... whatever, but I can do the same argument about anything electronic. We have books that are hundreds of years old... how old is the oldest hard drive that still functions daily, or a internet system.
---
Gnome rogue: Kick animation is a full flip, dual wielding daggers + slice and dice = Monkey arm-swinging. 
---
The only problem I have with the gnome is the shrunken armor. Instead of creating separate graphics for gnome armor, they just shrunk the normal stuff, making especially the Tier gear look like shit.
---
How hard are the satyrs to kill? I'm wearing mostly pre bis hear with some green int items as a PI spec priest.
---
Also, tubers are from the pods?
---
Real mature!
---
Buy a skinning knife, buy the mats for a +30sp enchant, find an enchanter...?
---
where's the arcanite reaper???
---
Nice bro
---
How would you know this unless you were that person?
---
To
---
The thing is I do like tankiong, but the guild already has 8 tanks, and I also tank alot of dungeons for fun. In fact outside of raiding I've spent most of my time tanking in lvl 60
---
Greens bind. You can reuse the skinning knife on several different classes.
---
Wait......are you suggesting that there are leveling Paladins that die from mobs ?
---
they offer you extra bag space in retail for setting it up?
---
Back then it was done through an addon that automates queuing. Even when they removed instance numbers you could tell that most people got into the same AV because they got a pop at the same time.
---
Seems legit, give them your soul
---
Do mass not farmers/spammers use stolen credit cards to create so many accounts?
---
I don't understand how they make and pay for so many accounts. Is it really profitable to buy a month just to spam for a while on some level 1 characters in Org?
---
February most likely.

I used to love AV turtles back in Vanilla. I used to think to myself "Wow, I got over 600 HK's today, that's a ton of honour!" Little did I know I was killing the same people over and over again, so I was getting 0 honour for the vast majority of those kills. I think people would be more inclined to turtle if they felt like it wasn't gimping their ranking progress.
---
What would you recommend as a chill farm for Hunters?
---
As a hunter, the guys that rolled on that are complete assholes for taking it from a tank. Druids &gt; Warriors / Paladins &gt; Enhancement shammy &gt; Rogue. Pretty much anyone else gets no benefit from this ring besides the raw stamina as a stat for PvP which can probably be gotten for a gold or two from a green ring.
---
yeah i agree with you gotta learn the matchups
---
You got plenty of answers, but if it still doesn't make sense. Healers don't roll on damage gear, if their main spec is healing. Tank Warriors likely don't get to roll on big damage gear even if its good for them because their main spec is prot, not fury.
---
always bet waifu
---
As a comparison, I have 4564 auto-attack swings recorded from DM:E lashers (also level 54) and my crit rate over that was 6.7%.  My spellbook crit rate is 4.49%.
---
Good idea! Thanks
---
&gt; Because we have instant queues
---
That does not really change things though.  Your rank is relative to other people not to an absolute number.  So while you DO require more honor relative to someone in the horde that is really not relevant.
---
So you had to take a piss and miss your queue, so you can’t play for 15 minutes? Nah.
---
I don't know how humans didn't get hunters. Gonna assume it's because they got basically everything else as well minus druids
---
I seriously hope they don’t stray from the classic way of doing things. Making everything easy in an mmo makes the players apathetic.
---
Most people in my guild have a mage, lock, or hunter alt with professions dedicated just to farming gold by now to support their main raider, and they farm on their alt while in AV queue...
---
You are right, most of the playerbase has 60s, but raw gold based farms like lashers are nearly as strong now as they were on release (well, a little weaker cause Ghost Mushroom and Dreamfoil is weaker due to inflated supply), if you have 4 days played past 60 and you haven't farmed epic mount yet, that's poor planning on your part and not you falling behind the curve
---
Currently on my server according to FarmLog i have 51g/h with 20 hours collected data with minimum ah price from TSM. With most valuable item being a travelers bag. 
---
And on a side note for hordes in AV que you can weave This inbetween the ques if they are above or about 18 min. if you fly from thunderbluff, 4 min. less if you hs to camp mojache, i get about 8g between AV que.
---
We can, but it's super inefficient and almost no one does it. Because the imps pull the plants, you have to kill them first and it's time consuming. Get him below 51 percent and reset him/invis pot/mine nodes.
---
Too bad it’s the most boring class to play in raids
---
Each swap uses a gcd, so for two weapons you will have to click twice or use two different macros.
---
How do you get this?
---
I've always loved blizzard for recycling icons between games, but the one they use for the bindings *does* strike me as odd.
---
Because people play a braindead class like Hunter or warlock where you can kill 2-3 things without breaking a sweat and then try warrior and think its hard because they can't facehit the keyboard and win
---
How is that not relevant?? You asked why PvP ranks require way more honor for the alliance. The answer is because they have instant queues.
---
You can also modify the mana cost of spells depending on your MP5 and the cast time of the spell. 
---
If the base mana cost of the spell is 100 mana, your MP5 is 20, and the cast time of the spell is 3 seconds. The “true” cost of the spell after adjusting for MP5 is 100 - ((20/5) x 3) = 88.
---
Then take your mana pool and divide it by the adjusted spell cost, and multiply it by the cast time. That will give you the number of seconds it takes to go out of mana. Compare that time, to your boss fights. 
---
Sometimes your most efficient spells are “too efficient”. So if it takes you 2 minutes to kill rag, and your rank 3 spell can be continuously casted for 3 minutes, you should choose to use a higher ranked spell.
---
in our guild we have only had 1 piece of nightslayer boots so far and those went to a rogue who stopped playing :,S
---
At 22 go aoe farmers in hillsbrad. The exp/hr is insane, but there are lots of people farming it usually.
---
If you go in early morning or middle of the night tho, you can go from lv22-28 or 29 in about 4 hours.
---
for DPS
---
Priest
---
Elemental Shaman. The on demand burst.
---
I am shaman above all. Not horde.
---
Orc because cool rest of horde are either a walking hamburger or a hunchback.
---
Best race ingame are dwarf. If i could be shaman dwarf i would be that.
---
Take my upvote
---
Still shouldn’t take them from healers imo, who need them for raids etc.
---
As a horde who's played against both premade and pug, you really are letting down your team queuing with 60% mount. Usually I will hit the back of the Ally zerg and kill all the 60%ers I can to split them from the main zerg. BGs with premades have like 25-30 100% mounts that I can't engage on or disrupt for free like their 60% counterparts, it really is a big difference and I don't see how a player with 60% mount can contribute as much as a 100% mount if both are trying equally hard
---
Don't know. I win probably 80% of all AV games. The other 20% are against premades
---
Damn son. 200 iq
---
Bad idea not to have server name in the title.
---
My raid, all 5 rogues are 6/8+ minimum. Most of us even have both t1/t2 helms, pants etc
---
Imagine having another GY.
---
I honestly fail to see the issue with any of this.. times are different why fight tooth and nail for something that will just flat out never be the same (aka our knowledge of the game)
---
That's just plain wrong. A good 30 min win gives 6k honor including kills, a quick 10 min loss maybe 2k. With 20 min queue, that's 7.2k/h for winning slowly and 4k/h for losing quickly.
---
Got 8/8 T1 and 2/8 T2 (not an officer or gm, just lucky) and it sucks that only 3 pieces are worth using as a mage while you go with blues in the other slots
---
Wah wah wah, horde can't win fair pvp. Grow up, dude. Horde response to this problem was, 'gO tO rEtAiL', and massively stacking the Horde faction. Why is it only a problem when the other faction does it? Hmm?
---
They can, I've done it, it's not fun and very difficult.
---
I would stick with my main.  Warrior specced 31/5/15, Arms/Prot.
---
This spec gets most of the goodies out of arms for PvP and enough of the mitigation out of prot to tank.  I can enjoy PvP, DPS, tanking dungeons / offtanking raids all without respeccing and I love it.
---
It kinda bothers me you're ignoring your battle shout weak aura....
---
But gg none the less.  Literally never get tired of seeing warriors pull a win against a mage.
---
Oh, I forgot about the soulbound ones.
---
You don't know me like you think you do. We clear in about 2.5, and haven't wiped on rag in a month. There's plenty of guilds full of middle of the road players who are ok but not top players. These are the people who frustrate me when they try to competitively parse. It's not appropriate. Grats that you put way too much time into wow, tho.
---
Those are your made up rules. Everyone needs gold obviously.
---
Ahhh I remember when golden pearls were sub 5g on my server. Was nice while it lasted
---
The only thing boring with classic pvp are that it's not a measure of skill but how much time you can spend playing the game.
---
I've been dealing with this shit since Warlords. It's never ending.
---
I wouldnt go around giving people bad advice like "write all your passwords down". Please.
---
Ya people just make up rules for how it's supposed to work. Gold is a huge upgrade.
---
Why is this so shocking? the shocking part for me is that there's people like you who care about posts like these. I get it, people enjoy the game, people like the social interactions, people prefer classic over retail. r/wow gets the same posts like, every day, they're annoying.
---
This is the real MVP comment.
---
Even just a couple of ticks of Regen with +100 or so spirit is the difference between drinking for 15 seconds vs 8 or 9 seconds.
---
I kind of feel like it's so easy this time because we've done it before. We've done more, so this is pretty straightforward. I think (assuming they happen) TBC and Wrath will be much of the same.
---
Ive seen 4 bots on my journey lvling my alt. Next day i keep lvling keep seeing the bots. Nothing new
---
Piggybacking off u/Blipter you can use bootcamp and download windows if you are unable to update to a newer OS
---
If that doesn't work you can use a virtual machine. Parallels is by far the best one for Macs. You should be able to run any version of Windows. I will warn you that doing this may demand too much from you cpu
---
If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask!
---
Blizzard wouldn't actually lose money on those accounts though, because the botters will just move on to another one. They might even buy retail wow expansions too, so there's little disincentive cash wise for blizz to ignore bot accounts.
---
I love my paladin as well. Being able to perform any role is a plus. Also, they arguably have the best class quests in the game ( not the easiest, but the most epic). Unfortunately paladin is alliance exclusive, is shaman a decent alternative?
---
Paladin... do I look like I wanna be Celibate? Chad Paladin all day sir.
---
As it should be, cant complain about hacking and bots if you have any benefit from them.
---
BoP and BoE are exactly the same in that it's possible they're an upgrade for people who need them, or they can be sold for gold.
---
"but it's worth a lot!" argument is debunked, people need trash BoEs in AV for vendor purposes.  a few silver is more important to people than other peoples upgrades.
---
What? I just agreed with you and you're talking about some password manager that I never mentioned?
---
This isn’t true, I’ve gotten the hunters book very recently when I already have the trinket....
---
And apparently Perserved Holly. Had one in my bag, hovered over it by chance and noticed Auctioneer scanned it at 1.5g+ on my realm. WTF
---
I ended up choosing Kromcrush, made an Undead Rogue and a Tauren Shaman, and possibly a warrior. I like to make lots of characters. Im enjoying shaman most, and I've wanted to hate life, so warrior :D
---
What race and professions would you choose if you only had that one character? 
---
Thanks for you help!
---
&gt; 1x Ground Scorpok Assay + 1x ROIDS - "Blast lands buff"
---
Just remember there is a cooldown between these so you cant really stack them
---
I actually didn't face premades nearly as much back in vanilla, it felt like it was 20% of the time or so, now it's nearly every single game. Ontop of waiting 20 minutes for a horde queue to pop, it sucks.
---
... risky click
---
Sending love bro. I'm very close to my brother and we used to play hard often. This is definitely a story that resonates with me. I've never climbed to the top of the peaks like that, but I can see this being something that I would do with him too. We're back at it again playing Classic now. Who knows, I might just carry on the tradition and take him there. Go with honor, my friend.
---
Is there any other way to evolve?
---
I stopped after exalted but I won at least 75% of my AV matches. I heal and always kept up to the tanks on O, so that probably helped some.
---
Considering the 20+ minutes of queues currently, if you have to take a piss at 15 minutes in and didn't do it earlier, that's on you.  The edge cases of people being denied pvp because of real world emergencies should not stop Blizzard from preventing abuse of the queue system.  Even now, Alliance players are getting a free pass into the AV of their choice with checking the number and comparing to the warmaster.  Declining the queue should have a penalty.
---
5% spell crit? Be still my heart! :p
---
Not everbody loves hour long turtle matches tho.
---
Depends on the age of the macbook honestly I ran into compatibility issues with windows 10 on a late 2010 inch MacBook Pro. Can’t remember exactly what the issue was.
---
Seriously... what a bullcrap you are spewing???
---
do not enable 2fa because someone can grind for you... you wish...
---
Great adventure dude :) last night I did an all nighter on my 42 (now 44) dwarf hunter just farming turtles in Tanaris and skinning them to farm up some gold to get my mount. I knew this wasn’t even close to the quickest way but I didn’t care it’s what I wanted &amp; how I wanted to farm the remaining 50g needed. 
---
In one of the clams that dropped from the turtles I got a golden pearl, it vendered for 1G and that it was a neat find. Then I went to AH to chuck skins up and thought I would see how much the pearls sold for, turned out they sell for 20G so I ran back to the vendor and luckily it was one of the last things I sold and I could get it back. 
---
Chucked it up for 16g and it sold quickly. Was a nice boost forwards and I’m less than 10g away from my mount now. 
---
I didn’t realise how something so little in classic would feel so awesome until now haha
---
I’ve been either clicking it off or doing an action that cancels it
---
I love hunter and Shaman.
---
But I’ve never Max lvl a rogue, priest, lock, mage or warrior.
---
I think Priest would be so cool.
---
But I’d prolly end up going back to my hunter lol.
---
Literally how? It shows you the link if you hover over it and it literally shows an official battlenet link
---
I'm speaking from experience cause I did the same thing... Dinged 60 and farmed 2500 gold for 2 freezing bands, Archmage, AH spell power greens, and flasks and consumables before I did my mount so I could get priority in our LC for raid drops (our LC takes raid performance into account for loot  prio.) I was actually so salty that I waited so long to get my epic mount... It's a huge upgrade for open world farming and cuts down on travel time to instances. If you assume a rate of your time being worth 50g/hr, it does not take very long for the mount to pay for itself in time saved!
---
It's fairly common in the internet vernacular (and increasingly elsewhere) to apply a noun as a verb in order to produce a shorthand version of a sentence. For example, "to Google" is shorthand for "to search for via the Google search engine". The natural application of such here would lead one to read "They won't spoilers" as a similarly shorthand version of "They will not reveal spoilers about [the thing in question]". While it would be more grammatically correct to write "They won't *spoil*" (as that is the proper verb form), it is still perfectly understandable in the "verbified" form to those who are familiar with that particular quirk of speech, and thus is perfectly acceptable outside of academia and other such professional settings.
---
Now that we've established that it is, indeed, a sentence, it's a simple matter to transform it into a Yoda-like form. Note that we're not looking in any form at whether Yoda would actually say such a thing, but simply converting it to match his speaking patterns. English uses SVO (subject-verb-object) sentence structure, while Yoda uses OVS sentence structure, meaning that the Yoda-fied version of the sentence is, as expected, "Spoilers, they won't".
---
Yes, it is a stretch. However, I find your reaction to the concept to be rather over the top, and I can completely understand why u/Balismo89 would read it as such at a quick glance. I'd advise you to take it in stride a bit more, shrug it off as a joke you don't find particularly funny, and be careful when challenging a linguistics student to explain esoteric grammatical structures =)
---
I don’t think it’s bad to try hard I just think it’s toxic to be exclusionary over something as trivial as a mount
---
I have a warlock and I’m debating doing this farm. Have you seen it proc off your fireball dots? I’m hearing rumors that dot ticks do not proc it, which would be very sad. Grats to you!
---
I don’t think i heard a single person say MC would take days if we aren’t counting the honor grind for douses. 
---
Most people knew it would be 4-5 hours when the first runs were made but even then the consensus was once MC was “farm” status most competent guild would have it done in 2-3 hours.
---
If you could only have one, what professions would you choose for it?
---
Man I love roleplaying as a normal human person
---
Use unique, strong, non-guessable passwords for every account.
---
Never share your passwords or accounts.
---
Enable two-factor authentication on every site and service you can.
---
I'm currently Herb/Alch and would probably stay as such if it was my only character, as Herb is nice to relax and farm with and Alch flasks/elixirs never go out of demand.
---
Im sotting on 50 arcanite bars already farmed since launch. The guild is wanting to give it to a warrior. I play shaman. The warrior doesnt have anything ready to go.. i have q crafter for my mace the moment i get the eye... but it wont happen cuz guild is kinda lame

Old Gods are not the same as Void Gods, [here's a brief list of 6 Void Gods from BC](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Void_god) and the [Void Lords](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Void_lord) created the [Old Gods of Azeroth](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Old_God). I maintain that the Void God/Void Lord lore and stuff was non-existant in WC3/Vanilla lore.
---
Seeing a picture like that, you can instantly hear the distant war drum and the music. It's majestic.
---
I don't think it's possible without BC. You'd need the night elves in Eversong and Ghostlands to make it to Ashenvale

Ugh its so difficult to decide on just one, but I really don't want to spread my alt-addiction to a horde server as well. I am adamant to just have one. Hunter is always a good choice... what professions would you choose?
---
If I'm pugging I legitimately don't care about the other peoples' upgrades and I don't expect them to care about mine... I will be nice and polite but at the end of the day it's completely transactional, they are just randoms who I'm working together with to complete a short term goal and I am just a random to them.
---
&gt;BoP and BoE are exactly the same in that it's possible they're an upgrade for people who need them, or they can be sold for gold.

No. Disabling xbgs would kill them.

the rep grind is trivial. it's like 100 AVs tops. is it really that big of a deal to have 10 of them last 40 minutes instead of 10?
---
Took my rogue practically a year in Vanilla to get the pants from Mag. Good luck!
---
Turtling isn't fun. A hardcore back-and-forth match is fun. Good luck trying to get two teams that are equally matched, though.
---
It's not a fucking exploit. They give you and everyone else queueing the EXACT NUMBER you're queueing into. If they didn't want people to think, 'hey, we can all see our numbers, let's try to match', they shouldn't have let everyone see their number. Get over it, dude.
---
That's fair I guess but the way u look at wow is odd to me as trying to spend every min being productive to the fullest to me wow is my break from stress so this never occurred to me. Thanks for the insight. 
---
I have 5 or so on me that typically gets replaced before I'm out completely from just playing the game as with my trink and bubble and blessing of sac I dont use them much plus the rune itself has cd.
---
Well fuck all this shit. I’ve been on the fence about continuing to play with the AV bullshit ruining PvP. I came to experience something I missed, got to 60, got my epic, got my prebis, but you know what? Fuck a sunk cost, I’ve got plenty of things I wanna do with my time and one of them isn’t watching a game get ruined by a greedy corporation. Fuck this time waste. Fuck Blizzard.
---
it's not, because it denys someone who needs to equip the item that should be rightfully theirs according to standard loot rules
---
tbh the spreadsheets i use have it as like 1 dps less for 8/8 bloodfang. think it’s preference at that point
---
They did at a panel at blizzcon. The oldest update they jad fully saved was 1.12
---
Having half the raid on slow mounts literally splits your group before you ever start fighting anything. It’s not a slight chance, it can break the first push. 
---
I was explaining why people gravitate toward premades and why there’s 1v40 games. How is this toxic? I don’t mind if people play how they want but don’t call me toxic because I’d rather play with people that want to win.
---
Yep, I should totally drop my 300 tailoring before I get Truefaith and my 295 enchanting for herbalism.  Because those only take 4 hours to level up again...
---
People keep saying 'wait for the ban waves' .... but I'm not even sure they have the staff to deal with this. People are literally creating accounts, leveling to 60, playing for a while, then quitting ... all in a time frame that none of these fucks have gotten banned. For those people, there never has been any bans for anything, and any action taken now is too late.

Hey dude,
---
Sorry for this out of context reply but I just wanted to say thank you for your advice in this chain of comments.
---
I have went through that thread and your tips and changed my AOE rotation completely and its night and day now.
---
My AOE tanking capability has improved dramatically and its a total joy now.
---
Its ironic that I couldn't find this concrete advice and tips in the internet, not in WoWhead nor icy veins.
---
So thanks again and merry X-mas.

Please convince your fellow horde of this. The last few days I've had several games of 15–20 horde camped either right outside SHGY or at one of the major chokepoints (IB or the hill to the horde keep), with the rest roaming around the middle and 0 horde pushing on offense.
---
Yeah if I knew how irate these alliance were getting I’d have doubled my efforts in P2.
---
Fresh players are always so cool to me, because it's been so long since I've seen all of this for the first time and it's such an old game I'm surprised new people want to play. Thrilled, of course, and happy to be an in-game encyclopedia, there's just a novelty to being a long time player.
---
I explained how and why it makes sense. Go read the first paragraph again.
---
If you are on the alliance side, missing a queue because you have to piss is 100$ your fault.
---
I'm not salty about premades.  I'm salty about premades dodging other premades by declining queues and getting another instant queue.  If you queue for a BG, you should be penalized for not accepting that invitation.  Maybe not a 15 minute debuff but enough that it makes rolling queues for a stomp less of an easy thing.
---
Huh?
---
My first toon in classic is warrior, never played it before and chosed warrior coz its "hardest" to level. In reallity its not.  its probabbly slowest but not hardest. now leveling mage, and yea i drink way more then i eat as warrior but i can also pull so much more mobs then warrior and just aoe them down. As warrior if you pull 3 mobs ur lvl u either have to run or pop cds.

latest spreadsheet stuff says that gear set with full raid buffs is about 12 dps higher than 8/8 bloodfang. without buffs it’s like a 2 dps improvement.
---
I don’t mind being downvoted but y’all boosting my ego with the claims we’re ‘top’. Anyone watch actually good guilds (not mine) clear MC bosses melt.....
---
You can't change the player base but you can make it harder. This will make players have to fall back and start taking hubs like graveyards, minibosses and towers again to make the final boss fights easier. Thus, making it a bette, more involved AV all around.
---
I feel horribly for you, and honestly it is embarrassing when people spend hours trying to find a group. I hope the OP and many others read this comment. I am going to list an all knowing guide to -Creating a dungeon group-. WIth my guide you will be able to fill a dungeon group for any dungeon within a few minutes. Almost always.
---
FIRST. You find out what your role is. Say you're a priest. Okay. SO you are the healer. What do you need in a dungeon group? You need a healer, tank and 3 dps. Sometimes you need a crowd controller.
---
OKAY so you have 1/5 covered. Now you need to find a tank and 3 dps. SO start with the tank classes. For Horde that is warrior&gt;druid&gt;shaman.
---
So you're doing Wailing Caverns, you need people about levels 18-24. SO to find a tank, do a /who warrior 18-24. This will bring a list on your UI of every warrior online in the world between those level ranges. Start at the top, and whisper the first warrior. "Hey want to come tank a WC group?". Now DO NOT wait for his response, keep firing out tells. Ask the next warrior on the list. "Hey want to come tank a WC group?". Once you get it down you can use a control+paste so you don't have to write out the invite message every time. If you fire out a handful of whispers someone will respond with a yes. Great, now you got a tank and a healer.
---
Now you need 3 dps. That can be anyone, you could just type /who 18-24 and ask all the people. Or go by class, say you want a rogue, so do a /who rogue 18-24. Now ask every rogue. Once you get one, go to the next class you want, etc etc.
---
The key is to NEVERRRR wait on an individuals response. Keep firing away and you will have people filling the group in no time. And if someone asks if you have a group established? OR is it just you? ALWAYS say you have an established group. First off, it will be full in two seconds anyway. Secondly, everyone is much more apt to join if they think the group is established.
---
Think about it, You are not the only one sitting around for 6 hours hoping for a group, you're not the only person who cant get a dungeon done. Don't be shy sending invites out because people are just like you. Just sitting there PRAYING someone invites them to a group. ALWAYS START YOUR OWN GROUPS FOLKS.. You can decide the rules this wya too ;)

2019: We need a banwave, Blizz needs to get tough on bots! Drop the ban hammer!

I feel you. Before I started playing WoW I played Runescape for about 13 years and when they released a mobile client there was a huge influx of new players in that once dying game.
---
Now I’m the noob in wow and I love it 🙃

Gold farmers wouldn't be doing it if there wasnt profit in it for them.  Google "buying gold wow classic", those websites wouldn't exist if they weren't making tons of irl cash off of them.
---
Priest flexibility and optimization challenges both in gear and gameplay is so much what I look for in an MMO.
---
Pretty sure he could buy the gnome one on his NE and mail it though, as only the riding skill is restricted.
---
1h of effective play time is something you maybe get 2-3 times a week with a three months old child, a full-time job, a gf and home to take care of. 20h of effective farm (keep in mind I'm lucky if I get 1h in front of the computer, that hour includes starting the game, getting to the farm spot etc.)  is probably around double your estimate of 3 weeks.
---
Am I correct that all of those issues except shared DR are due to spell batching?
---
That is brilliant! I'm so doing that. Hijack the bots and beat em at their own game.
---
Yikes nice discussion 👍
---
Why is this person not banned after ~~3 weeks~~ **13 years?**
---
&gt; You arent storing anything locally
---
Some password managers work like this, therefore giving all of your passwords to a third-party.  Don't do that, unless you're encrypting your passwords locally before you put them into the password manager.
---
It was set up exactly like wow initially, you just had individual class story missions for every class on top of everything else.  You could level 100% with dungeons or pvp.
---
Due to is being an online populated RPG or?
---
I am thinking whatever character i make i want an orc. It just seems the right choice when only being able to make one character on horde.
---
Why would they want to?
---
Crafting professions are rarely worth keeping IMO. For alch, for example, you usually make potions at a loss from materials (you can buy mats cheaper during weekends and sell potions and flasks during raid night but you can also just relist the mats for the same margin.) You can make like 10g per mooncloth CD if you keep tailoring or swap it for a gathering profession and just relearn tailoring when Bloodvine comes out for less than 200g. IMO mage is one of the stronger farm toons so I would go double gathering or gathering (best usually is Herb) + engi if you like PVP. Professions are not long term choices, and they usually take less than a day to 300
---
The first week of BGs yeah. Now it's back
---
War stomp cant be used in form. Literally worthless racial
---
Those can play WSG and AB.
---
Welcome to the English language.
---
Drinks cost more than life drain...
---
It would be the final nail in the coffin for low population servers, there are some servers like mine that have less than fifty level 60 Horde on them, queues would be in the literal hours among hours.
---
Id say the alliance cities are much more convenient. Iron forge is cake to get around. 
---
Tb looks awesome though have to give it that.
---
The cone nipple people will rule this planet!
---
What region are you in?
---
I still haven't had a game start with less than ~35 people in US, and the other spots fill almost immediately.
---
They, however, Alliance players can check the BG their going to.  If it’s not at the bottom of the list, it’s not a fresh AV.  Whenever I see this, I cancel and try again.  I’m not interested in joining an AV that other people are quitting
---
But tailoring is fast and cheap to 300, it's a money loss to keep it till ZG
---
The Preserved Holly will sell for a lot more if you hold onto them for a couple of months.
---
Was banning China effective for countering bots/gold farming on private servers?
---
Do you think it should be considered for Classic WoW? I mean they can still play on their own servers, but no Chinese IPs on American servers.
---
It would obviously screw some people over... But the net benefit could be pretty great for the overall game.
---
Is it even worth considering?
---
Classic WoW is most fun I have had playing WoW or just a game in general in a very long time. Especially my first like 6 weeks. Leveling to 60 then trying to get gear and do my first MC &amp; Ony raids in forever was so fun. I am still having fun although I am not a huge pvper so been bored lately and not playing as much. I still do raids and help guildies from time to time and continue to farm gold. But I just don't have that much to do at the moment and don't feel like making an alt for whatever reason.
---
Merry Christmas yah filthy animal
---
Don't look inside a silverleaf, it gets even spookier!
---
Garcias or bloodmoon? Shadowflame plus aclg should be a good bit better from my sims.
---
I got hacked in the vanilla days, before the security token became a thing. I was decked out in Tier 2+ (basically a little smattering of some stuff from AQ40, otherwise) and got hacked via my then-partner's old computer had a keylogger on it. 
---
I did a virus scan and thought I had it cleansed of the evil, so I reached out to a GM, they verified my losses and whooshed my gear back.
---
The keylogger was not gone.
---
I was hacked a second time, and this time, wow would not send me back my stuff (can't say I blame them)... They gave me a shabby set of greens and said "TBC will be soon." I was devastated. But I learned a lot about account security, keyloggers, viruses in general, at that time.
---
Once Onyxia is completely in the air, auto-attacks can't hit her, but special attacks still can. This is a big issue for warriors of course, since they can't generate rage, but rogues can still do decent DPS since their energy regen lets them continue hitting.
---
We keep rogues on Onyxia, and have the warriors handle the whelps. The tank that plans on picking up Onyxia in P3 uses the whelps to build a full rage bar in berserker stance. When P3 triggers, the tank pops Recklessness, burns that rage bar, goes to defensive stance, pops a mighty rage potion, and continues their normal threat rotation. This usually allows them to get threat back very quickly.
---
Huge impact on queue time on some servers. Blizzard would need to balance out most servers first.
---
Once or twice probably won't make a difference
---
You might want to lay off the crack pipe if you think Kirtonos is 80% alliance buddy.
---
Oohhhh maaaan...https://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1.gif
---
Thank you for this, a friend of mine (new to vanilla/classic) was bummed he didn't get a chance at our guilds first binding (it was given to MT/GM) but maybe this will put into perspective why it's not something to be upset about.
---
He barely has 100g to his name at any given time.
---
Shaman are fun. Totems totems totems! Windfury, chain lightning! Self Rez. Frost shock. Purge! Lots of cool spells. 
---
Thought this was in the regular wow sub... as far as Classic my answer still stands. Paladin but I am maining a warrior for Classic as I’m tanking for our guild. But I have been focusing on my pally now that my warrior is basically BIS geared. 
---
Paladins in PVP are so much fun. I just really like the play style. Lots of abilities that play well with other classes. Freedom, BOP, BOS, LOH, stuns, cleanse, heals, good burst damage. Pve they are the best tank healers in the game period and bring the absolute best buffs Kings and Salvation.
---
For dagger rogues you already have aged core stopping you from 8 set lol, I'm taking those boots.
---
Not taking it personally when people poke fun at your argument is a good skill to have
---
He's totally asking for a friend.
---
Which password manager solely handles storage at the device level that actually gets any use? 
---
You dont need to encrypt your passwords yourself before storing them in a password manager. That is wholly unecessary.
---
Neither is saying a post is boring instead of just moving on.
---
Prevention against key loggers.  The loggers will just see a CTRL+C and a CTRL+V
---
There's also people that enjoy raiding through LFR. Let people have the AV they remember. Not everything needs to be catered to attention span lacking zoomers.
---
Outside of handful of fucked up realms, I have a hard time believing queues would be any longer than they already are if they were disabled.
---
Key loggers don’t get your password if you copy paste from a password manager.
---
I spend a ton of time running around herbing in the areas with them, and on my server(Fairbanks) every one is consistently camped by 2-3 people, and often more like 5+.  I think you had a nice run of luck getting 9 in 45 minutes, which certainly can happen, but I wouldn't think you can maintain that rate over the long haul.  I stop and farm them from time to time when the areas isn't slammed with people, but that rarely lasts long.  
---
They are BoP but still have the same value as the BoE ones.  It is economics, you will farm them when the BoEs are expensive, but if the BoEs are cheap you wouldn't bother, you would just buy them.  Because of that the value of them end up being identical because they share the same demand pool.
---
You have a serious lack of understanding when it comes to modern cryptography.
---
&gt; Yeah gear doesn’t matter too much while leveling up
---
You leveled a warrior to 60, and still say that? Man
---
I'm not going to give you that because they released DM way early too. They just to spread out the content to keep people not bored and much less to do with Alliance bitching on reddit.
---
It's almost disingenuous to even talk about consumes with their performance. 
---
They've been at it for 7 weeks, even just with the gear they've got from that they should be able to comfortably clear the raid without a single person using an elixir. 
---
People are just pressing the wrong buttons or not hitting them enough.
---
Yeah, due to this, I honestly prefer Mara. I can chill and grind away gold while watching some streams/YT/TV.
---
vanilla technically wasn't the first step.....there is Warcraft series and boardgames
---
Youre right now could I be so blind!?
---
I use a password manager but I also have the master password for said password manager written down and stored in a fireproof lockbox just in case.
---
In which case, the healing and durability that bloodfang provides more than makes up for a slight dps loss.
---
You don’t get everything. 
---
You will if they’re level 49 or higher, but that doesn’t help at low level. 
---
Eg. level 15 vs level 15 deviate elite, 28xp in group 9xp out of group. 
---
Still running through instances isn’t a bad way of doing it.
---
Why can't I play a BG here and there when time allows for it? Why do I have to grind to play a BG?
---
Oh yea, cause any guild without TF is gonna be stuck and won't be able to complete the impossibly hard bwl. It's gonna suck soooo bad.
---
Low pop servers would be the most desired location to transfer to. It would fix the population imbalance.
---
Looks like you thought you did, but didn't.
---
Skinning knife doesn't bind, and you can use it from level 1.
---
That was fairly rare, and generally, those games were on the far side of enjoyable. A solid, hard fought battle with time to turn in quests, and then a conclusive end is the sweet spot, and early AV had a lot of this. Not an eight minute rush, but not an all day grind either. On average, doing an AV was still shorter than running a dungeon.
---
My raids have 1 feral druid and 7 rogues. 
---
Tier vs "everyone can use" is a pretty small difference.
---
&gt;  So the Alliance not in the premades will never win a AV, get bad honor and never get gear,
---
Silly casual.  Everyone knows that if you want to do good in PVP you go get raid gear.
---
&gt; CHANGES that people warned Blizzard about repeatedly are what ruined Classic and Blizzard can't even fix their own stupidity and stop this crap.
---
What CHANGES?  This is how 1.12 AV was.  The honor system was terrible, and everyone knew that coming in.  This isn't "CHANGES".  Don't give me the "it was only there for a little bit of time, so it isn't really Vanilla" bullshit either.  We knew what they were giving us, and they've delivered on that pretty well.
---
because hes paying them 15$ a month. same reason honor wintraders/multiboxers/botters are not banned. they do not care the game is dieing they wanna milk everything they can.
---
there are plenty that have the option to do so:
---
* OSX's Keychain
---
* KWallet
---
* pass
---
* BitWarden
---
* KeyPass/KeyPassX/KeyPassXC
---
A closed-source product which claims to securely store your information on a third-party server should never be trusted.  If the ability to recover your information having forgotten a password is offered, then someone with access to the host has the ability to do the same.
---
also re: your edit - what country actually has those laws around breach reporting?  In the US, only HIPAA-covered PII breaches must be reported.
---
BGs at least ensure both sides have equal numbers.
---
Without fixing server populations, world PVP is AIDS.
---
It is literally not.
---
If we're being literal here eve, cracking is the word we are after.
---
But just downloading a list of passwords and emails and trying to login with them is nneither hacking or cracking.
---
I don't understand why people are talking about consumables or even gear and shit when this is so much simpler. 
---
You have a bunch of people who don't know which buttons to press or aren't pressing said buttons enough. It's the only way performance can be that low regardless of gear.  Or maybe you're just not doing the mechanics of the fights correctly.
---
I did tailoring + enchanting for leveling. But if I could do it over again I’d probably pick skinning/herbalism over tailoring, and max tailoring once I hit 60 for TF.
---
1. Your hypotheticals are literally too ridiculous to address. You think the company wouldnt send warning emails about it going bankrupt and closing down? Any evidence of this EVER HAPPENING? I'll wait as long as needed. 
---
2. Maybe don't use a password manager hosted in Russia or China? 
---
3. I'm assuming you do not work in infosec?  Getting access to unhashed passwords from a good password manager is not something a hacker without a nation state behind them would be able to do. Pretty confident in saying it has literally never happened to a big pw manager company. Your plan on the other hand can be foiled by fire, you losing your book, a flood, a simple thief, you forgetting your word associations etc. You are putting yourself at far higher levels of risk doing what youre doing than simply using a password manager. Through your ignorance you have paranoia'd yourself into being less safe.
---
WoW is a social game. Battlegrounds are multiplayer PvP skirmishes and you're being a leech by entering them undergeared and unprepared. That's part of the whole social dynamic of MMOs.
---
Roll paladin. T2 is gorgeous, Naxx will be more interesting, and the quality of life improvements will be more noticeable. Priest is relatively the same between TBC and Classic. Better solo capabilities too, although that isn't a particularly high bar. 
---
IMO roll a holy priest Ally side and git gud, because it's not hard to play, but that wasn't an option. :p You're overall more useful as a paladin to the Alliance than as a Priest to the Horde. Our priest racials Horde side aren't great for the raid, unlike Ally side where having Kings and Salv is pretty damn nice. They're also underplayed so every body counts. Good luck either way!
---
Good thing theres transfers
---
The design values of battlegrounds are evident in everything people don't like about retail wow. Convenience. Empty world. Everyone out for themselves. Etc.
---
They wont spoilers does not make sense. That is not a sentence. Yoda says correct sentences switched up, not gibberish.
---
It literally barely existed at all. I didn't see a single piece of gear with spellpower on it, till Dire Mail.
---
The good memories are probably before they were cross-server.
---
Pugs trying to replicate the play of premades.
---
Like if you handed some regular joes an NFL playbook and told them to start running plays like they see the pros do on TV. In this case, Alliance pugs know they need to rush south because but don't know why or what to do once they get there.
---
Even without selling any loot DM Tributes are still the best farm in the game I believe. A good hunter will make between 100-150 gph if they have enchanting and can do 15 minute runs consistently (that’s not counting extra drops like Forors or transmute undeath to water from chests).
---
Dmeast+hydrospawn+satyrs+ghost mushrooms in rest of dm has been netting me consistently 80g/h.
---
The only right response in this thread.
---
Lol so much BS nobody ever said
---
The recipe for Elixir of the Sages is going for 30-35g on my server. I don't understand why it's priced so high. The buff from the elixir doesn't seem to stack with raid buffs like Arcane Intellect and Divine Spirit. Am I wrong about that? Am I missing something? Why is it valued so highly? If it doesn't stack with other buffs, how is it useful?
---
classicwow.live
---
O shi
---
Yes it is :)
---
Honestly I just googled AV premade discord and got in with no proof of gear/epic mount required.
---
This is for NA though...might be different in other regions.
---
My guild helped farm 200 as a team, only took us a week or two, I’m very blessed to have the generous and courteous raiders I do. If you missed it this is our second completed set of bindings.
---
Nah dude, WoW is a game we all pay to play, I'm allowed to play however I want. If you want to avoid me, it's your job to do so, not the other way around.
---
Just give the botters a 10 day ban. That way Blizz gets to keep their subscriber and it wrecks their honor grinding strat. Everyone wins.
---
Lol is wow classic turning into osrs with the amount of bots ?
---
That would likely mean transferring to PVE server.  You okay with that?
---
Exactly. If you can afford to put +30 SP on a skinning knife, you should be putting +30 SP on your witchblade/ mind carver /maybe hypnotic blade if you're really unlucky. Which is then pre-raid BiS.
---
Gold is bis, you can use the gold to get items you need.
---
Ahhh family guy gotcha makes more sense in that voice lol
---
Demand dropped off. They get used on Head and Leg enchants so when DM first released the supply quickly got used up. Now that it's been a while, people that get the enchants don't need them replaced often.
---
My orc fury war
---
Ok boomer.
---
See I rolled a warrior first and I didn't get why everyone was going "oh you have a warrior im sorry leveling must be hell" when it really wasnt that bad. But then I made a warlock alt and suddenly it clicked with me why people making warrior alts were like OMG THIS IS SO HARD.
---
It literally is, it's just not the hype b's hacking you see in your Jason Statham movies bro
---
I don't think these WoW players are running the death camps.
---
Ah yes.
---
Enslaved paint. Smells nice.
---
Sure, you can play how you want. The way you're describing is being a leech however and no one is going to be excited to be teamed up with you.
---
Yeah I was saying was interesting way to look at shit. I bet with that mindset u crush this game. Ty for the feedback :)
---
There used to be an add on called OQ, I think, that would help construct premades. Not sure if that is still around.
---
I can only speak to what I experience. I can't say it's not anecdotal, since I'm not farming them across five characters (just two).
---
Five plus competing farmers is normal for my server, too. However, I think people are too "flighty" and stop or do something else and come back to it after lots of little breaks. 
---
Probability doesn't really reward that. I set aside a block of time and do only that, and it seems to work pretty well.
---
As far as consistency, I have done 9 MC/Ony clears, and I've done this farming either the day before or a couple days before the Friday raid. I get about the same amount per run give or take. The timeframe does change; often it's 35-45 minutes, sometimes it goes for an hour.
---
This satisfies a few things in one trip: Dreamfoil, Felcloth for Mooncloth transmutes, and demonic runes for raiding. I'm killing 3 birds with one stone and the results have been pretty consistent the last (now) 10 times.
---
Ah so they can be farmed good to know.
---
I’m an Ally, but can I please come here if I promise to behave?
---
I mean, if you're going to use a horribly over used meme, at least use it against actual boomers.
---
You could say the same thing then about Ragefire Chasm.  Ragefire Chasm was the first step to retail.  It's right in town.  You don't have to go anywhere for it.  Etc.
---
“Turtlehordes”? You mean defenders
---
Yeah comes down to speed of kill vrs xp comparison. Good point
---
Ok there is no daily honor listed under the honor tab only honorable kills and dishonorable kills. If your lists your daily honor it's done through an add-on and that add-on number is wrong your not missing any honor.
---
Did not realize there were bots anymore. Glider was a great bot back in the day. After that one got shut down I thought it killed all the wow botters.
---
Are we playing the same game? I've done 10.AVs today and lost every single one of them. Longest one was 11 minutes long. 
---
Sure, I can have faced 10 ally premades, but there is no way in hell that horde wins 9/10
---
It's almost always phishing scams
---
Human Warlock. Best feature - not a gnome
---
AFK'er are on both side
---
lol, afk and check in every 15 to take the loots lol
---
Biizard lmao
---
It's a very tough start and very different fights from MC.
---
Razorgore requires a ton of coordination not seen in MC.
---
Vael will drive guilds crazy (although DPS will be no problem with 1.12 gear/talents).
---
I think the trash/suppression rooms will make trouble for a ton of guild as well which may come as a surprise.
---
But having said that, it was 15 years ago so who knows!
---
Winning a BoE roll on a NEED should auto bind it to you. Winning a BoE on a GREED should stay BoE.  You couldn’t ninja items when you NEED.
---
You can potentially send yourself an email message: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/send-mailmessage?view=powershell-6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/send-mailmessage?view=powershell-6)
---
To play a part of the game I'm paying for is being a leech? Really? You're essentially saying I can't play the game because I don't have as much time to dedicate as you. Get off your high horse and let people play the game however they want to.
---
are rp servers nicer than pvp servers?
---
not the good one... 
---
you can tell which premade it is when it's filled with rank 9-10-11 VS a bunch of rank 5.
---
i've seen many of the later lose to horde pugs...
---
&gt;*But it’s not exactly compelling information or a unique perspective.*
---
We need your precious memes back for that!
---
Have you noticed that nearly every piece of content released in classic so far has found a way to do irreparable harm to the game?
---
I'm not disagreeing with you about the AV premade thing, it's just that this isn't really anything new. People are going to find the most optimal way to play the game and minmax.
---
Your points weren't even inspiring..
---
Growing to hate people, getting a sense of satisfaction from revenge, getting ganked, having to rely on strangers when I'm getting ganked..
---
Non of that is why I play.
---
Strat is the easiest dungeon a pally of any spec can tank. Try DMW with the same setup and share us your experience
---
100% ban the bots - if blizz is going to stop people from account sharing, they better stop the bots.
---
hope everyone else found this just as funny
---
 I'm with you in that aspect in that my guild clears MC in 2 hours flat and haven't wiped in months. We currently have a Boomie and 2 druid healers. 1 druid being top heals and parsing 94+, and the best thing yet, these 3 druids have been some of the best individuals that bring fun and laughs to our raid. Our 40 man raid even spent probably 20 minutes longer last night because we all kept laughing at jokes with each other.
---
There's definitely those elitist no-lifer jerks who try to suck the fun out of any of the fun, and if you're not doing the meta then you suck. Sad they don't see they are the one that suck. But I also understand the elitist no-lifers. They have nothing else to identify with so they become protective and gatekeep WoW. Pretty loserish if you ask me. 
---
If you want to minmax, don't push it on others and gatekeep the game. EZ
---
Arugal has the lions share if OCE, and often has high queues to just log in.
---
Yojamba, is high pop, but no log in queues (yet)
---
Both are dominated by horde.
---
I'm on Yojamba (alliance side, 1st time in my life playing alliance), and its pretty damn active.
---
Aaaaah, yeah, that makes sense. A couple days ago I told someone else that he probably had shift + keybind bound to something else, so that's why the shift modifier in his macro didn't work. Unfortunately it didn't even occur to me that that might be your issue too.
---
Yeah I will be starting my av grind soon to get the epic mount on my warrior. Why would I spent 800g when I can spend 640, and use that extra 160g to buy my Don julios and other goodies.
---
Ok... How long does it take for Chinese hacker to decode a "What did grandmother claim got her drunk at Great grandmother's party?" after they broke in to my apartment, and found this specific book? How unsecure is my passphrase? Again, that isn't a one I use.  
---
Because if it can be encrypted, it can be decrypted. But thus far no one can retrieve my memories.   
---
I understand modern cryptography. But having these impossible to remember passwords stored in a service behind another impossible to remember password is impractical, especially when we need more and more passwords.
---
California S.B. 1386. Not sure about your state. I think 1 or 2 states may not have them but even outside of law if you are not reporting a breach involving PII you are getting fucked. Doesnt need to be health related.
---
Tartshart
---
I got power run 20-30 in stocks, 30-40 in SM and ZF 40-52 (with some questing and normal runs in that area. 
---
So yes mages and prot pallys are basically the only viable option for power runners. Anything else is too slow and waste of time. I payed around 2g for stocks, and 3-5 in SM. Was fast. Try to get the power runner to set loot on ffa and try to loot everything and you will recoop most of your cost. Having a full party is more xp
---
As an ex-game support who was working specifically with that kind of things (fishing) I should note:  
---
1. If you go to that website it will ask for your account, password and 2FA codes (yes, they can by-pass 2-factor that way);  
---
2. They transfer all your items/gold/stuff to other hacked accounts; trying to create a messy transfer operations so that it would be harder to figure out which account is the last (temporary bank account);  
---
3. They sell gold from bank account to gold seller (as if they were gold farmers); when they are done more toons are created and spam continues;  
---
4. Which means buying gold from gold sellers can end up with you being banned or at least loosing all your acquired gold - it is removed since it was taken from hacked accounts (you might get refunded with whatever junk you traded with);   
---
5. If you think nobody is stupid enough to fall into that trap - you will be surprised as I was once. I was a support for a dead lineage-clone game. i dealt with \~1 hacked account every day. in WoW I expect it to be **at least** dozens per day. (tldr: people do it because it works);  
---
6. It takes time to return all the stuff because your gold might be already sold and used. We can't simply draw more gold without removing it somewhere else because it's hyperinflation.   
---
7. IP ban doesn't work here, same with MAC ban. Banned accounts were hacked so it is quite normal to see them unbanned when the rightful owner returns.  
---
8. Write your real name and surname on your account details. If your account is hacked sending an image of your passport/ID is probably the easiest proof.  
---
9. Fishing websites are constantly removed. However it takes some time to contact the domain and (since free domains are used) new websites are created within a minute.  
---
10. Fishers usually spam when there would be least personnel to stop that - at nights, in the evenings, at weekends, on holidays, etc.
---
i would be dumbfounded if the EXISTING optimized version of their player/gear database did not already have hundreds of millions of records.
---
What MacBook do you have exactly?
---
This "trick"?
---
Anyone could've joined a group queue that had already spent time in and gotten in faster. 
---
Most people thought that AV was still the better honor farm. 
---
The majority of Horde players were still choosing to farm AV brainlessly instead of actually PvPing, at least on my server. 
---
At the end of the day, if Blizzard would either lower the Honor that AV handed out or increased the honor given in WSG, nobody would have to try to use "tricks" like this. 
---
Some of us just want to PvP. We enjoyed it during Phase 2 with World PvP. These queues are a slap to the face at this point.
---
I had no idea that was an add on that showed that information, I thought it was always available lol! Thanks guys I’ll check and see if it updates again
---
RP or not RP is a variable independent from PVP or PVE. There are RPPVP servers and RPPVE servers.
---
**GENERALLY** speaking, people on RP servers tend to be friendlier than people on non-RP servers.
---
I also believe TBC was the pinnacle of my WoW memories. But after playing classic again with a close group of friends and establishing ties with a guild, I'm having a blast!
---
The key is to build community in WoW classic
---
Wait you guys get Nightsalyer?
---
My raid group hasn't seen a piece of it in over a month.
---
KMS I guess. :)
---
Playing horde and in AV for about 6-8 hours a day. There are quite a lot of alliance premades out there and then they usually face roll, but except for those cases it's a win 9 out 10 games. Horde has adapted to the long game meta now that there are queues, and I've seen a significant change in win rate. Now I actually feel disappointed if I don't win as a horde.
---
My Buddy fell for it....I sent the dude a message and just said WTF seriously? Lol
---
&gt; tailoring is both fast and cheap if you do it efficiently
---
Spoken like someone who never felt the pain of buying leveling recipes for 20-50g.  Tailoring isn't cheap to level from 250 to 300 in a fast manner.  Sure the potential exists but the patterns you need to use to level are often outrageously expensive.  To the point that it doesn't make any sense to drop it and then pick it back up just for gold farming.
---
If I was using my professions to flood myself with gold, I would have gone with alchemy/herb.  If I wanted to be a class that farmed well, I would have a hunter/warlock at 60.
---
You still have yet to make the point that a 100% mount is that much of a difference for someone like myself.  When running dungeons, I'm often the first there.  Sure in PvP, it makes all the difference.  But I'm rank 3 and tailoring/enchanting.  You can work out how dedicated I am to PvP.
---
It's an upgrade sure but not one that I am going to prioritize over the next two pieces of gear, Truefaith/Cloak of the Wild.  Any gold earned is being reinvested in direction that my character will be spending the majority of time; healing.
---
What? All AV games on Nostralius were rushes aswell. The only thing that differs is that on Nost you sometimes died of stepping on a landmine.
---
Turtles are horrible for solo melee classes. You get to sit back and have everyone else using abilities while you wait for an opponent melee to get fed up and ran into your zerg. You then help kill him. 
---
Occasionally you get upset as well and think "Yeah, I can kill one guy!" only to be reminded that: Nope. You cannot solo charge the enemy zerg.
---
Unless you literally only play meme specs (boomkin, ret pally, etc) your class isn't the problem. The problem is that you've spent (presumably) dozens to maybe even hundreds of hours leveling from 1-30. Pick a class and main it if you actually want to progress.
---
Granted, if you enjoy the leveling experience and don't care about endgame, then you do you.
---
No way that's well decent. You need a specific build for that? And also herb maxed out? What's the idea behind it, is there a video to check?
---
I think the first 6 bosses will fall without a problem for any guild clearing MC without trouble right now, Razorgore and Vael are definitely more intricate than MC fights but are in essence able to be cheesed by good DPS. 
---
The DPS that guilds are putting out with the 1.12 talents and understanding of rotations is incredibly higher than what people were doing back in Vanilla. I wouldn’t be surprised if Vael 90s is standard for most guilds at this point. 
---
Chromaggus and Nef will be a bigger challenge for most guilds just due to longer fights and more things going on, but even those shouldn’t be too too bad. 
---
BWL at least will be more engaging than MC and less tedious for sure.
---
we aren't doing it on the horde....  You choose to fuck the game up.
---
It'd be more efficient if they were...
---
Horde troll warrior engineering and mining
---
do you think it's possible for 2 mage controlled by 1 person to clear all the undead trash then repeat ?
---
If the person isnt a ninja then you can just have everyone /roll for it.
---
Both are worth, an epic mount costs 800g
---
I'm in a guild that raids ony/mc with about 27 people and so am a bit concerned how it's going to go. But it's definitely a coordination check for the most part. Not sure about alt pugging this.
---
I mean for sure, if you’re kiting correctly.
---
Using the same password on multiple services
---
10k gold is a *very* small amount of money on retail currently, so it doesn't affect the economy to let him keep it.
---
Have you ever tried DMT?
---
Yeah this is why full combat logging is so important.  It lets you look at the individual performance of members and see who is actually pressing buttons and who is afk in raid.  It lets you track gear improvements week to week.  It lets you see cast timelines of individual members.
---
On runescape its difficult to detect because many of these accounts are Venezuelan/chinese gold farmers.  They can sometimes be playing multiple accounts at once, seeming very bot like, but in the end it's a real person playing so it's hard to ban them until they real world trade.
---
Might as well go 5/8 ... ns shoulders + aclg + boots of the shadow flame
---
Should be BiS for dagger rogues.
---
Join in with a guild run that's pugging the last few spots.
---
Don't join a pug hosted by completely random strangers (they draw people in with promises of free rolls on legendaries and no reservations), those usually are trash.
---
It’s not wrong. I’m just omitting the small pieces (that you pointed out) for the sake of giving a general overview of how to calculate these things. 
---
Everything can and should be adjusted. But the first step in any analysis problem is establishing a maximum. 
---
Obviously there’s more things to think about, like crit for paladins. I don’t have the patients to type it all out. 
---
The general idea is there. Work on the semantics on your own.
---
Would trade 2 eyes we got for 2 left Bindings.
---
Nice video gonna try this pull later. What is the add-on that counts your instances saves called?
---
Ns Shoulders are also better than bf shoulders
---
"Can this be done with nearly full bis? The rest of my gear is prebis"
---
Yeah bro, you can do every activity currently in the game with that gear
---
well mc basically has no mechanics, but honestly pservers had heavily overtuned BWL, you can cheese a ton of it. but if you are the kind of guild that is taking more than 2 hours to do MC at this stage, you will have trouble in BWL, you will have to do actual "progression"
---
Anyone having issues for queing BGs since the WSG hotfix yesterday? Everytime I try to que AV either nothing happens or i get "someone in your group is already qued" error even though I am solo. I have to relog everytime to fix it.
---
You are describing my life last weekend with Alexoo on Skeram.  I reported Alex so many times and yet still he is able to farm earth elementals for days.
---
So does improved frostbolt talent lower the dmg even more?
---
I recently finished my grind to exalted... and I really don't understand the complaints here... "90% of AC matches are straight up garbage".... this simply was not my experience.
---
Yes, zergs do end some matches really quickly, and that sucks. But I found that most matches seemed to go reasonably long. I've won and lost AVs in a variety of ways over the course of the grind, had huge pushes and PVP battles... seen bosses summoned, had GYs capped, stolen, defended, etc. 
---
The way you talk 90% of AVs are just zerg fests that end in 10 minutes... and that's simply not been my experience. Am I playing a different game? Horde on Whitemane... maybe I'm just lucky?
---
You wanted classic wow you've got it. Be careful what you wish for
---
The true challenge of any tier set is those damn boes
---
If you are a rogue or druid you might get away with it, no one else.
---
would it be profitable enough to even consider ?, im making 91g raw per hour from zf with those 2 mages doing it 10 pulls per  hour
---
What about all the FR for bwl?
---
If you fall for that you deserve to get hacked seriously
---
&gt; but once everyone learns the ins and outs of the pre-nerf AV it would be loads of fun.
---
People still don't know how rep/honor works for Balinda / Galv. 
---
They don't know that a tower that gets destroyed after the game ends (within the 2min before the BG closes) still gives honor, so it's a good idea to wait 20sec.  
---
People will never learn the ins/outs of the prenerf AV.
---
Exactly
---
ur playing horde
---
&gt; because then they know what gets detected and fix it faster.
---
100 people reporting the bot a day, because it's an obvious bot? Ban bots in waves. Sure. Those that get reported by hundreds of people should get banned immediately.
---
I really question how good your healers you are running with are then :P
---
asking for quality control in WoW, LoL
---
Grats man its was a good vid, I wish I could see what would you do with a root spamming druids tho since I have no idea how to beat them with warrior. Im playing on zt alliance too and never seen you so its kinda weird.
---
Don't do that, copycat! :P
---
I love OPie.  Being able to take all of my totems off my action bars was so nice.
---
I think that pugs and scuffed guilds will have a hard time. But the good guilds will clear it on the first day easily
---
RPZ. D'ailleurs merci au botters pour l'honneur journalier gratuit !
---
can you believe that retail came from cardboard? 
---
that is one hell of an evolution
---
No, this loot council is garbage. Proper loot council allows for players to be rewarded for performance. Dkp is just about attendance really.
---
This. 1-2 hours of farming ZF, Mara, running people through SM or Stockades, etc
---
Yeah this is a pre-swd swd:)
---
Get bagnon
---
Dunno, I played 8 yesterday and lost 8. None of them shorter than 14 minutes (and I was lucky we had premade here, horde was just faster).
---
Between matches starting with 25 players and horde intercepting the (now majority) 60% mounts, it is honestly demoralizing to play AV. Once you see more than 5 horde approaching the galv deathball, you *know* this is both a lose and a turtle, because there are more chances of HoJ and SGC  dropping in a single BRD run than Alliance has of coming up with something else after the first wipe.
---
I chuckle every time.
---
Same, but EverQuest. Losing XP and potentially everything you had if you didn't get your corpse back in time? Punishing, to say the least.
---
&gt; BiS is still BiS. I wouldn't limit something like this to a caster if it's BiS for a paladin.
---
This is why people call BiS cancer.
---
Something can be BiS for a healer and also be something the healer should never, ever get until every single DPS has it. But some people think "it's BiS, that means you should be allowed to roll on it, right?". Hell no. Just because it's very slightly better for you than the healing item you should be using doesn't mean you get to take it over DPS casters for whom it is a huge upgrade.
---
Different game, but Old School Runescape bans this. Somebody tried to sell sub only "raffle tickets" on Twitch, got smack-down/banned for real world trading.
---
I never had extra security beyond user password. Never got hacked on any game. 
---
This said, I have a 2nd PC for porn
---
That’s incorrect - you could queue as a group, and many did at first. Did you even play before?
---
Not with specials.  Your crits with the slower weapon are going to hit much, much harder than the faster weapon.
---
But we're talking about much larger values.
---
Lets take two relatively equivelant epics.  Hurricane is 1.6 attack speed and 30 dps, with a top end of 63 damage.  VS dwarven hand cannon, which has an attack speed of 2.9 and 32 dps, with a top end of 124.
---
They both have procs on ranged attack, but that gets averaged into the dps.
---
Your hand cannon is going to perform far and above the 2 rated dps because of the multiplicative nature of crits.  In addition to the larger spectrum of white damage, your specials recieve even more benefit.
---
I believe the strategy is to take the boss down to 50% first in order for the wall to break and imps to come out. This is to access the mining nodes, yep.
---
I just kinda fucked around in dmeast, and figured it out slowly. I used a lot of videos for reference but you can go very deep into dmeast and pick ghost mushrooms and kill lots of satyrs and reset using the back entrance. Depending on drops you can make like 120g/h, but it’s usually averaged around 70. It’s not brain dead farm though. You gotta be on top of shit or you’ll die and waste a ton of time. 
---
I do it as frost, engineer (cloaking device, but not needed. I actually did this for a while without it but it’s a very nice thing to have. Otherwise you’ll need some invis potions to pass a specific pack.) max herbalism. Sometimes it’s best to check prices for dreamfoil because you can farm a stack an hour in just the lasher room and it’s more efficient. Play the market. If felcloth/mushrooms are high, farm the deep end. If dreamfoil/groms are high, farm the garden area.
---
I think lashers have a higher chance of dropping epics though. So they got that rng factor going for them
---
He probably figured if he got high he would get high on the meters.
---
Classic BWL is nerfed to the ground just like MC was. It's completely faceroll. 
---
Nerfs, not including values and all the nerfs that happened in most patches since it was no longer current.
---
1. Warriors have AQ talents amd weapon normalization that happened in 1.8, 1.9. You always needed a lot of warriors but their dps was mediocre other than a 2 hand slam spec that people sucked at. 
---
2. 16 debuff limit instead of 8. I believe 16 happened in ZG which was the next patch. So release BWL was much harder.
---
3. Itemization and PVP gear. The blue PvP gear you have is Naxx patch blues. The pvp gear before that was trash compared to raid gear.
---
The first raid close to "real" in Classic you will get is AQ. It's still nerfed though through all the patches and due to PvP gear. **Naxx will be the only raid in Classic that is legit.** It will be much harder for the smaller faction on PvP servers since they won't be able to carry in buffs. You will see hardcore guilds transfer off due to this ruining population even more. Naxx is more a time commitment than anything else. Consumable costs starts to get obscene. It will also be much, much easier on PVE Servers due to all the buffs you can carry in.
---
Thorium Widgets are used for Darkmoon Faire, so they’re not a complete waste.
---
I just had this happen again by the gryphon guy, this time I was the one invited and this time I changed layers
---
Whats the name of the addon ?:)
---
I remember vael as being a dps check, so with 27 people you guys might really struggle with that fight.
---
Facts lol I am a prot holy pally so I do both :)
---
yes... 
---
being stuck at the same chokepoint for 3 hours cause there's a bajillion NPC protecting it, notably the 200 range archers, just to see your iceboi/treejus get kited into vann/drek and promptly killed.
---
definately a lot of fun.
---
I dont understand this... the 5 piece bonus is the tank healing one. The 8 piece is to encourage you to use something other than chain heal on raids. Why do people say it is for tank healing?
---
Can it include procedurally generated passwords? Example Avast Pass? It uses an encrypted key on my computer to unlock a procedurally generated password of 28 characters and symbols. I don't have to type or copy anything. I have a thumb scanner and that's all it takes.
---
Battlegrouos?
---
Try playing alliance. Very different experience.
---
Has he tried tequila and a little foreplay?
---
Female Undead mage
---
Should I drop tailoring or enchanting for herbalism?
---
Warlock- 300 tailor, 260 enchanter
---
I want to pick up Herbalism to supplement my gold income and be able to finance consumables for cheap/free. I think Enchanting endgame is a lot better gold than Tailoring but don't know if I have the time or gold to invest into getting the patterns that would allow me to make enchanting profitable. 
---
 I have my Robe of the Void so not much for the future of Tailoring except bloodvine set and bags.
---
Rogue so I can pick my fights and stunlock and blind, Dwarf so other disgusting rogues can't blind me.
---
A single mage could effectively stop a premade rush on Nost.
---
Did it plenty myself. 2 mages - 2 hunters and you had a turtle war.
---
In the current version even 20 ppl can't stop  premade from rushing.
---
I don't think that's what it said either way BGs were already announced by the time of the post so.....?
---
I don't need to carry around my book. Because I remember the common passphrases I need daily. And I also have 2 factor on everything I can have it on.
---
So you are saying that a trojan with keylogger on any of your devices, and your whole security system is compromised.  So. If I got access to your device for a moment, I could just inject something to it via USB or wireless system to compromise your security absolutely. 
---
Let me guess... you are going to say: "Well I assembled my phone myself, and it runs a special OS that I made from opensource components and then compiled myself. Absolutely impossible to infect."
---
This was back during either the end of BC or first few months of WOTLK. Can't remember for sure.
---
The thing I don't like it is my guild's discord is suddenly a ghost town.
---
From launch up until the past week, discord was always alive with groups doing shit together, but there has been several days now where literally nobody is in discord because everyone is in some premade discord with people that aren't even on the same server.
---
I don't undertand it at all, considering we were doing premade AV's just fine as a guild. Our rankers were ranking, our raiders were getting rep for gear, it was working just fine. Idk why everyone decided "screw hanging out together, lets all go fuck around with people we've never met and will never meet again"!
---
It's basically like group finder in retail. It is killing the community of my guild/server.
---
For mage ZF is your best choice for consistency and you can only get about 55g an hour if you can do gy in 2 pulls + boss + scarab. If you can solo SM cath+armory without boosting then it's about 70g. If you have 300+ spell power and specific summon gear you can do maraudon runs with herbalism and enchanting ( mining is garbage atm so i won't recommend that).
---
However the aoe learning curve for a mage is pretty hard at advanced  level in order to start making big gold , so be careful
---
Adjusting honor has no relation to the queue. That is a separate issue, and I suggest you convince #noChanges first :)
---
The raids never really stop being relevant, there's crazy good shit from MC that will be the best thing you can have until naxx and because there's no real catch up mechanics it's always worth to do old raids. One of the best parts about classic if you ask me.
---
If the raid lets you tag along then so be it. They will be essentially carrying you. It’s always better to enter into a raid that you can pull your weight in. I think some bosses have an enraged timer and you will be holding back the crew with low DPS. 
---
Bring buff food and pots.
---
well you will need to get gear to get into the raids... for example:
---
its highly unlikely that a fresh lvl60 will be taken into BWL (the next raid to be released), because the fresh lvl60 will have no gear.
---
People will be doing 5mans, MC and ony for quite awhile.
---
Well you can’t ban a GM...
---
if you actually read the article you quickly googled and then skimmed so you could prove a point here you would realize none of those companies store their passwords in plaintext.
---
It's not like you can only choose one 
---
Use whichever one you're currently spec'd for
---
&gt; The people texting and standing in the back spamming one button while watching netflix 
---
You could have just said 'mages'
---
Being lazy and using a third party site to install addons for you. OMG it's so difficult to put this folder in the addons folder I must find some program to do it for me. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.
---
depends on the proc rate we dont know yet. Full t2 + distracting dagger could be bis
---
No, I am also bitching about people ability to solo-cap every objective. In pre-nerf AV its much harder as all the npcs are much more powerful, not the pushovers they are now.
---
Dwarf shaman always made more sense than draenei to me
---
Probably. If you have access to the users machine through something like a keylogger it's pretty much impossible to stop stuff like that. It's still a good idea to use things like that, though.
---
I don't understand how he was not gkicked. I'll consider moving on one day.
---
for the bad ones maybe
---
for the good ones where 75% of the raid is rank 9 or higher... the one that steamroll AV and kill drek in 6min over and over... those require more than a 100% mount.
---
I think he’s saying if he was in the group where myrmidon’s dropped, he would have let the warrior roll need on it.
---
We usually just have a druid pop crowd pummeler on phase 3 and call it a night
---
Complete BULLSHIT. If you have a key logged you most likely have a screen scraper too. copy pasting DOES JACK SHIT.
---
It's super satisfying to have a matching set. No more hodge podge random gear!  
---
I have a mix of NS and Shadowcraft gear so that I don't have any clashy brown boots or anything Haha!
---
MC was overbuffed on private because it was the msot hit by 1.12 balance
---
It's really not that bad. I swear anyone who thinks this grind must have never heard of FFXI. 
---
I solo farmed for my entire Sulfuras in 3 weeks.
---
I missed my guild run due to work last week and ended up finding a PUG on the weekend.  It wasn’t as fast or as entertaining as my guild MC runs but we didn’t wipe and it took... 2-2.5 hrs? As always YMMV. It was a run done by a guild that couldn’t fill out a full raid yet.
---
My brother in law does everything online on a thing he calls a virtual machine, and he said no average hacker could ever do anything to him, how does that work?
---
You're*
---
And warlocks
---
Thank you for the in depth look at this. I'm sure there's a bettwr way to do this, something like banning potential botters (i.e. reports that say pet with chinese name, no communications, doesn't acknowledge others) and then providing them with a rebuttal option. Idk man, there's got to be a way to deal with bots. They are a nuisance to an already hardy experience.
---
that Pserver where admin admitted they buffed everything in order to make classic feel more 'real' since the real, original one was too trivial?
---
Mate_00 is the hero we need but don’t deserve
---
Where is a good place to grind mobs solo as a 49 alliance lock? For both gold and xp?
---
So basically i use a Windows simulator? Can I in that case choose to simulate an older less demanding version of Windows?
---
What guild? I have a 60 mage alt in need of a consistent raiding group.
---
there's multiple discord.
---
the good one ( where 75% of the raid are rank 9 or higher) require more than the 100% mount.
---
I remember... From my head. 16-17 passwords. But I only use few daily. But there are so passwords. And I remember those passwords the same way I can remember mind numbing amount of technical data like welding specifications, or pieces that I play with my orchestra.
---
Am feral druid. Tanked all my Ulda runs, and the same ring dropped. A lock rolled need on it and won. 🙄
---
Luckily, I got an “of the Monkey” one in a later run. I’m still using it at 58.
---
Was thinking more like "the dumb fuck that is yours" just like you say "your dumb ass"
---
Ah, I assumed that he only just recovered the account based on:
---
&gt; (It's been like a decade, so can't remember for sure.)
---
Healing is really cool and easy as a priest. 5mans and raids are all very relaxing and I can watch shit on my second screen all the time.
---
Yeah, in WC3 void beings were only seen as small packs of creeps to kill in Outlands maps/missions. They were no where close to as important to the overall Warcraft universe as they've become in retail WoW.
---
If you can farm the 7,000g to make this, you won't be poor for long.
---
How long is it compared to MC? MC pulls take forever.
---
But a miss/dodge/parry/block/glancing still can't crit right ?
---
The part you're quoting about crit being calculated for all swings, not only hits, mean the actual crits will always be lower than what the spellbook says.
---
Let's assume a same level monster, it should have a 5% chance to dodge, 5% parry, 5% block , 10% glancing and 0% miss if you have at least 5%hit on gear. That's 75% chance to hit and 25% other things that can't crit. With 20% crit being calculated for everything and not only your 75% hits, you end up with 15% crit in your combat log, 60% and the rest of parry, dodge and so on.
---
Cost me about 7,000g.
---
I'm very happy for you, but not everyone wants to do that and it's not practical for most people.
---
We had 1 left binding lol. So now we got 3 extra rights...
---
A rogue in our guild just finished his full MC BiS last raid.  
---
2xT2, 5xT1, Core Leather Gloves, Striker's Mark, Quick Strike, Accuria, Ony neck, Strike's Mark and Perd+Tooth.
---
Guess he won't be attending any more raids until BWL lul.
---
Hopefully soon. But probably early jan/feb.
---
Half the debuffs, offtanks whose dmg was mediocre who now top dps and itemization being stupidly better are all huge nerfs. 16 debuffs means much more dmg which means much faster boss fights and much easier healing. **BWL is as broken and dumbed down as MC was.**
---
Everyone sleeps on ret pally. I got my eye last weekend, and it's his until Corrupted Ashbringer
---
Ok don't listen to anyone else.. you do not get xp with a 60 in your group or out of your group helping you kill mobs.... Though... A Hunter out of group can give you sick xp gains.
---
1.Hunter is out of group sending pet to kill what you tagged.
---
2. You must be in party with someone else. But! This person can not be near you at all. 
---
You will get 100% xp while Hunter pets kills. I leveled my friend 1- 25 so fast. You need to find hyperspawns to benefit the most out of this
---
That's a bit out of scope for this conversation, it's not something the average user would be able to do, but basically he's running a smaller computer inside his bigger computer so in order to get to his real info you'd have to break out of the virtual machine, which is basically impossible.
---
That's way overkill for the average person and can be difficult to figure out how to work.
---
Say hello to Will of the Forsaken m'lord...
---
cool, now I know where I will go after I finish rank 9
---
Not only is that not the same guy, but the line of posts you’re defending are the ones that opened up with rudeness and hostility.  Get it together man.
---
I can only remember my family's phone numbers. I also have a very good passphrase system. They are all things that are very meaningful to me, and use memory tricks which make them really easy to recall. I learned bunch of them back when I did my welding certifications because there was lots of technical data we needed to remember to pass the theory examination.
---
Sargeras' backstory was retconned for Legion too. Originally they had him slowly being driven mad by the demons of the Twisting Nether, unable to comprehend their pure evilness even as he fought them back, sorta like the Joker and Two-Face/almost Batman in Dark Knight; nothing to do with the Void at all. I can't recall if they changed the part about killing the rest of the Titans or not.
---
Random caps makes you look dumb.
---
Oh okay, he's talked about it in passing conversations and I was just wondering if it would be applicable.
---
Here is a tool...12 hr days or your not getting rank 10
---
On Bloodsail (RP) it's a lot less min-max and with a lower % of the base being 60.
---
You sure convinced yourself of that.  Maybe you can convince some kid of that.
---
every spec is raid viable bud, find a new guild.
---
If you had the resources for hand of rag you can get the resources for tf, maybe not on release day of bwl (altho I don't see why not), but eventually. It's a game, and a lot of people prefer having fun over absolutely mathematically choosing the most perfect road.
---
Sooo sick. You even got the Brut Blade to match! Damn dude!
---
They are not only using new accounts. There's tons of legitimate accounts that got hacked/stolen and then used for spam\botting\etc.
---
And Hand of rag is going to take you 3-5 times as long to craft.
---
My GM sent everyone gifts too.
---
We all got random junk items like low level vendor weapons.
---
Up dewt from rattlegore!
---
The coordination for Razorgore is non existant due to the DPS will be doing, I highly doubt will see any kiting.
---
It really tests healers. It will quickly highlight which healers know their shit and which were skating by unnoticed
---
They need to be farmed as well, I'd say they're basically the same value, potentially even more because they can be used for crafting.
---
When a BG ends you are shown the killing blows, honor, bonus honor etc
---
I remember that you were also shown damage and heal. Can this be switched on or was this a TBC thing?
---
Don julio &gt; quick strike,
---
Checked logs, he is indeed using Don Julio's :P
---
I think Flamegor will be a huge stonewall for a lot of raids.
---
Is your GM Michael Scott?
---
Vanilla didn't have cross realm BG's until the tail end. Vanilla didn't have the abomination that is 1.12 AV until the very end and it has totally screwed up the meta. You actually had communicate and do BG's like WSG and AB where you actually PvP in real Vanilla. We only did AV on the weekends.
---
We thought we did and we did. Blizzard gave us the finger and told us they knew better. Unlike Nostalrius who tried to mimic past patches, Blizzard just went the lazy route. They either want Classic to fail or are completely incompetent to not understand what the community tried to tell them repeatedly would happen. Take a pick.
---
Razorgore will be a bit challenging for new guilds, because once you lose wbuffs you cant keep up with killing dragonkin, which means your hunters need to kite them.
---
Chrom will likely be the most punishing for less experienced guilds because it's the one boss you cant just bang your head against due to needing hourglass sand.
---
I'd say its roughly 30% harder than mc. Rag and domo are the only fights that are comparable.
---
I have one, Holy spec pally and I tank 5 mans pretty well. I haven’t yank dmw yet and I figured it wouldn’t be any harder than scholo so I took a group so that I could do the early parts of my epic mount quest.
---
Oof, I was hella wrong. My ass got blasted. One of the gnomes invited the party into a discord so that we could grind thru the dungeon and after the 3rd wipe we got really good momentum and cleared the dungeon. although it was still difficult.
---
But it was really cool though, we all worked together to get they every pull successfully, I learned the dungeon and I even got my bis for Prot pallies, Evil Eye Pendent
---
I havent waited in a 30min queue once since BG's came out lol
---
Tanking as a ret pally is super fun and super tricky, especially if you're deep ret like me and don't have Consecration. I tanked SM Armory last week underleveled and down a man, and we somehow managed to only wipe twice. The hunter was the only one who survived the last boss lol, such a great experience for a random PUG (though come to think of it, I haven't had a bad one yet on Classic).
---
Yes I look forward to seeing Reichsmarshalls and Fuhrers in the game soon.
---
I run rank 7 on rag that’s really about it. For the most part carry dark runes and major mana pots gets me through every fight with r10 LB and hitting CL on clear cast. I also will use spell batching with ele mastery to get 0 mana cost Crits with both CL and ES as long as I am in range for ES to hit. That’s at minimum 3k damage and on the high end 3.6-4K damage at 0 mana cost. I am still experimenting with different combinations on rag as to what gives me exactly 3 minutes of casting with no breaks. 
---
I use em mastery as early as I can I try to wait till I’m at roughly 75% to pop the dark runes and then wait till I’m around 50-60% to pop my major mana potion. R6-r7 seems like I can do that with Rng clear cast procs.
---
But no less ele shaman is most certainly viable especially after you pick up some gear for them. Going oom with forever be a problem but there are ways to combat that and bring strong dps and buffs that no one else can.
---
Well that was a convincing argument. Thanks
---
Ive been grinding a week now on Oceanic battlegroup and have 1 win. Only 2 other games where we even realistically had a chance.
---
I'm only here for the rep grind, just hit revered yesterday. So I'm like halfway there :D
---
This has to be the most uninformed comment in the thread. Firstly, sacrifice is a pet ability so it's not on your gcd. Secondly, sacrificing your void is asking for a full reset by the rogue. Now you have no pet to keep them in combat so they dont even need vanish to reset.
---
Aoe farming becomes a ton easier at 26 when you gain cone of cold.
---
I remember Vael being the guild buster back in the day.
---
That's a fucked up "ooo laalaa"
---
Most flexible one yes, if we go by pure staying power while putting out stupid amounts of heal paladin has them beat. Also the paladin brings the best dispell in the entire game to the table 3 types of debuffs in one cast and the lowest mana cost. Don't forget the divine shield in the end. 
---
In the end there is no best healer for raids. You'll want a reasonable combination for success. 
---
There might be a best healer for specific bosses and for dungeons but every healing class can contribute to every situation to warant its usage.
---
For example as a paladin doing dungeons I would sometimes kill for the priests toolkit just to dispell a mob or help dps/ silence a target while shield and hotting. 
---
The priests in my guild on the other hand frequently curse about bad tanks that can't keep mobs of them. Now thats a problem thats pretty much unheard of as a paladin.
---
They had no data. Is there any other lies you would like to throw out there? But yes, even though they had no data they provided a much more accurate AV then what we got. Amateurs with limited time &gt; Multi billion dollar companies who charge a sub fee.
---
Blizzard has NEVER increased the subscription fee to play WoW.  $15 doesn’t go as far today as it did in 2006.  That’s why.
---
27 is noy going to cut it in BWL. Better start recruiting now
---
Oh yeah?  That's disappointing.  I remember all sorts of kiting around in vanilla.
---
All of these people talking about how hard it is to complete the Sulfuras are cute. If you did an FFXI relic weapon back in 2005-2008, you'll know it took the average player 1-2 years to complete. Only the wealthiest crafters on the server could do it faster, and even then it would usually take 3-6 months because of the nature of the items to make the weapon.
---
Dynamis runs dropped 200-400 "ancient currency" per 3 hour run. Each run took at least 18 people, sometimes up to 36 depending on how skilled and geared your players were. You could only do Dynamis every 3 days (72 hour lockout).
---
How much currency did you need to finish the relic? 17,500, give or take (it varied per weapon). That's between 40-80 Dynamis runs, each on a 3 day lockout, meaning 6-12 months, assuming all 18-36 people in your Dynamis run was okay funneling 100% of the currency to you. Most guilds had 2-3 people trying to assemble relic weapons so multiply that 2-3 times as long.
---
Of course if didn't want to go that route, you could simply buy the currency on the open market but doing so would cost you about 3,000-5,000 gil per coin, so a total of about 52,500,000 to 87,500,000 gil. How fast could you farm gil? The average player could probably make about 30,000 gil/hour farming, but you could theoretically make it faster if you got lucky with rare drops.
---
Even still, simply buying the currency wasn't easy -- there was probably 5-10 people on your server actively buying up ancient currency, which meant that the demand far outweighed the supply, so prices would either continue to climb or you'd be stuck scanning bazaars daily for cheap coins, and considering the snail's pace that the currency came into the economy since Dynamis was time-gated to every 72 hours, it wasn't readily available.
---
And by the way, those weren't even the hardest weapons to get in FFXI... That would be the mythic weapon, but I won't bother with that here. Let's just say... 60-90 Alexandrite per run. 30,000 Alexandrite needed. Yeah. That's all you needed to know.
---
To compare, if a Sulfuras costs 7,000g to complete and you can farm 30g/hour, that's only about 235 hours of farming. That's about the length of time the average player spends on a fairly complete playthrough of Skyrim.
---
Not even a comparison.
---
Do you use your server LFG channel?  
---
Install addon like Puggle, create new chat tab, on this chat tab filter /Trade and /LookingForGroup channels (maybe "world" and "LFG" if they are active on your server), and never look into this chat again.  
---
Puggle will search for all lines that start with LF and show you them in nice UI.  
---
P.S. I constantly see parties for Dead Mines, Stockades, Gnomregan, so there's a lot of people leveling new characters. Depends on the server though. Some servers turned into 60-only with small groups of alts, so you will have hard time finding party there.
---
Exactly, so please dispense your cat poop elsewhere
---
Not for classes that don't use mana...
---
No, I'm pretty sure I'd prefer a bot-less economy. Would mean that all the stuff that noone likes to farm would be more expensive, which is nice, because I tend to enjoy farming the stuff that noone likes to farm, it's just that a lot of those farms aren't viable due to bots.
---
If you ever get one of those emails saying "your email is X and your password is X, I have video of you watching porn and will release it unless..." they are using these known passwords to script sending it to you, you see an actual password and panic thinking it's real.
---
Same exact situation here, 0 legendaries across the board but mageblades ahoy, starting to think some weird GUID shit is causing this lol.
---
Found the clown.
---
Just buy gold like a normal person
---
Rip its like 800g on my server
---
Yes it is because ilvl is completely arbitrary in Classic WoW.
---
Hacking is a strong word for falling for a scam and giving your account details away
---
Don't change the subject, you made a dumb dumb oopsie comment and I must mock you for it.
---
What a useless comment
---
&lt;unity&gt; forever
---
Normalization nerfed warrior damage it didnt buff it.
---
16 debuffs existed for most of the time guilds started clearing it. 
---
Itemization is pretty much the same as it was at BWLs release outside of pvp gear which is a sidegrade for most tier 1
---
All good man,
---
I went ally because I played horde until I stopped playing in 2008 (i do miss my tauren shaman), so wanted to see the other side.
---
I also like wPvP, so with more Horde than Alliance, can usually find something.
---
Serathil is not a bad BoE Axe to think about. Under 60g  nice dmg and a perfect OH.
---
iirc one of the early thunderfury holders was a rogue on bloodhoof
---
Maybe your server is different, but my point was I don't know how you are even getting groups as a healer reserving orbs.
---
I keep hearing this. Is enhance or ele builds that bad?  I already have a priest and mage leveled thought shaman might be fun, but don’t want another healer.
---
Lmao, I feel this way in this subreddit too sometimes buddy.
---
Even enh sham is way better off with spinal reaper, lol
---
They also come from fishing. I get the occasional golden pearl, that goes straight to the AH, as a side effect of fishing up Winter Squid. 
---
Prices would probably be higher without bots, though. Fishing would probably be more profitable as well. I can dream.
---
Also because you need to gear up ~10 heals for BWL
---
Queue at the same time and hope that you get the same instance # when it pops.  Lots easier to do as alliance than as horde due to the imbalance of#s queueing.  Might take a couple tires but generally easy enough to do.
---
I got whispered by blizard
---
I’m actually looking to probably go into pvp rather than pve since I don’t need to be so organised to hopefully enjoy it. 
---
I just don’t want to always lose as ally! 
---
I’ve played horde since TBC on retail and every xpac I go back I consider rerolling to ally but it always feels like so much effort since I have so many horde toons.
---
But it is reduced by miss chance. Everything that's not a normal hit (so parry, dodge, miss,block, glancing blow) can't crit. So the lower your "normal" hit chance is, the lower your actual crit chance will be.
---
I'll use silly numbers but the point remain the same:
---
Let's assume a scenario where the miss + dodge + parry + block + glancing adds up to 50%. It only leaves room for 50% "normal" hits.
---
If you had 100% crit chance on paper you'd still only reach 50% crit effectively as only 50% of your hits could crit to begin with. If you have 50% crit chance in the same scenario then you should be around 25% crit in your combat log. 50% of your attacks could crit in the first place, and 50% of  those rolled as a crit.
---
You would need 100% chance to hit a mob to be able to reach the crit chance you see in your spell book. Since it's impossible to get 100% hit your actual crit is lower and reduced by miss/dodge/parry/glancing/block.
---
Mines great for Ele! Collecting all those bits for PvP.
---
Grats on the bad item
---
It really depends on class tbh.
---
Rogues for example have a linear ilevel parsing with their tier gear.  If your ilevel is higer, it tends to mesn you shouod be doing more DPS.  Fury warriors? Not so much.
---
From my understanding, when you get a message to join it will tell you the number of the battle. If it's not the same number, don't accept it
---
Yes, it's not literally one shotting someone. That's why I said people refer to killing someone in one second as one shotting.
---
And everyone clapped?
---
To be honest, he was a bit of a bonehead back then lol I doubt he would have been able to figure out my password as I never wrote it down and he still doesn't know what inspect element is. So I doubt he'd be able to actually hack into my account. But if he did manage it somehow, I greatly appreciate it because it sucked being so behind in our group.
---
Destroy them.
---
Spam on tank and it also heals the melee at no extra cost.
---
Lol are you serious dude?
---
Do you guys think druid or hunter will be more fun/engaging late-game, including raids, dungeons, solo content?
---
I did play wow 14 years ago as well. I loved the game but hated av grind 14 years ago. Hated it now as well. At least I got my exalted a long time ago.
---
Every av they play is 30-60min they could be farming is all I’m sayin
---
That's why I went Horde in Classic. On my WotLK server, Alliance would never join Wintergrasp, or would join and AFK, and they wouldn't queue for BGs as much as Horde either. That made me realize Horde players are simply more into PvP and motivated me to go Horde, even though I hate Orgrimmar and a lot of the Horde zones. Glad I did.
---
Queue times are pretty long right now,  if we dont get same av and requeue do we do to the back of the line so to speak?
---
Do definitely go yojamba out of those choices but be sure to also consider felstriker! I play on felstriker and it’s really a great server, the community side of things is amazing and has a very similar feel to actual classic. If you have any questions about felstriker please feel free to PM. And if you do decide to join I’d be happy to throw you a guild invite and help you out where you need it :)
---
Agree with all that. Plus the views are pretty amazing. I still love crossing the bridges too.
---
Alliance loses wayyyyyyy more. Nice try, midget.
---
I don't know the answer mate. Probably.
---
Yes, you’re put into a new queue and have to wait 20 minutes again
---
I'm seeing a guild and looked at the guild index but it doesn't show server names?
---
We play games for entertainment.   If the game is torturing you, quit it.  It really is that simple.
---
Hmm... super rude post, and factually wrong (he was talking about the discount.)  Maybe time for an edit?
---
Yeah, they're different buffs
---
That breaks my heart, but thanks for saving me 100+ hours of farming I’ll stick to dm e then.
---
Yeah for sure, didn't think of that one since we're under 1 hour
---
Let's be honest... They didn't get hacked. They used the same password for everything and their password is freely available at ghostproject.fr
---
You can already do that with chain heal.. and if the melee are taking damage chain heal is probably the better option anyway since it is more total healing spread out over more targets.
---
Like the only time you'd use the 8 piece specifically for tank heals is when there are 2 tanks together like on Rag or tanking the dogs on golemag or something.
---
Maybe I'm just confused but I guess I'll find out when I finish my set.
---
Consider going for mining instead of herbalism. I had tailor / herbalism too and recently dropped herb for mining, because i learned to solo DM:E. If you're ever interested in learning that, you don't want to miss out on the rich thorium veins at the end, which is where more of the gold comes from. Herbalism is better for maraudon soloing, which is easier than DM:E, but much less gold/h. For just open world gathering, i believe mining and herbalism are comparable.
---
You can't blame people for doing the most optimal farming strategy, that's on the game allowing it.
---
\&gt;  why do you want more PvE in your BG?  
---
AV was originally conceived as a PvPvE battleground, that's why.
---
Can you post actual data that you have about this?
---
The true classic experience
---
Male Dwarf Paladin - Blacksmithing, Mining, Cooking, Fishing, First Aid.
---
I know this because this is my only character.
---
Decursing too
---
This used to be a punishable offence is it not anymore?
---
we have the PVE part. people choose to ignore the PvP part, that won't change even if you put more NPC in the field of strife.
---
stop blaming blizz for player's decision.
---
Anyone saying mage is objectively wrong and shouldn't be taken seriously, especially those who think selling portals/food/water is a good source of income. Mage may have been good on private servers, but the farming meta on classic is much different as lasher + hyena farm just simply isn't as good in terms of drops and efficiency.  
---
Pretty much the best raw gold farm for mages right now caps out at around 50-65 gold/hour with ZF and DME being very similar in terms of profit, with DME having more potential for RNG drops but also the requirement of herbalism to have maximum efficiency. 
---
The only way a mage can even possibly keep up with a tribute hunter or solo jump run lock is by selling boosts for SM/ZF, but with all the people who rolled mages because "mage free gold ATM" runs are down to even low as 2g per at certain times of the day. This is before you have to consider the extra annoyances that come with boosting (collecting the gold, making sure people trade you all the money they passively earned, looking for buyers, getting everyone to the safe spot each run, etc). The hypothetical gold / hour of boosting can potentially come close to hunter/lock farms, but in actuality, you will never consistently match them.
---
I'm not going to speak on which is better between lock/hunter because I've heard and seen conflicting things, but the "mage is easy gold" crowd is quite annoying with how vocal they are in spreading their misinformation.
---
Unless private servers had very off spawn/mob nr's which I doubt we will not do any kiting even for the first week.
---
How did he ?
---
&gt; how the fuck do hackers even get through ones account?
---
[Because it isn't hackers, it's Blizzard. That's how they sell physical authenticators.](https://i.imgur.com/nsXbCpJ.png)
---
I THINK you’ll find NO caps makes YOU look DUMB, bucko!
---
how can i maximize my honor in AV? do i go on O or D ?
---
They ignore the pvp part because doing actual pvp gives no benefit, just slows you down for no real gain.
---
Get fucked horde
---
other lies? you mean them admitting they buffed it?
---
it's not accurate at all.. when will you come to the realization that classic was ridiculously piss-easy for everything PvE related and the PvP system had to be scrapped in the very next expansion.
---
Yet... People willingly memorise plenty of absolutely useless information. So if you don't want to come up with a system for something actually useful and critical information... well thats your loss. Memory is a system which needs to be maintained like your muscles.
---
Impressive but in some that I watched they capped the average APM and the bot would still spike over it in key fights
---
Except your frostbolt casts less mana, does more damage and you have almost twice the mana pool. You don't have to waste GCDs on tapping all the time, nor do you have to keep up debuffs.
---
It's notling like a warlock. You can literally stand and cast frostbolt entire fights (on certain fights), while warlock has to do most of this on most fights.
---
You are right.  It has changed since I last played.  
---
Here is where I got my information.  I’d love to have more exact data. 
---
http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Rattlegore#
---
Where did you get your information?
---
yes if you don't accept it, you go to the end of the line when you re-que.
---
a buddy and I tried queing at the same time and after an hour (4 ques) we gave up. this was about two weeks, haven't tried it since.
---
Going to be honest here, I miss private servers. Classic is better for consistency but the skill level of players was bliss.
---
Never had to explain aggro or fights; everyone just knew. Nowadays every time I run a dungeon I have to explain to someone how aggro works. People are such bad players on average in Classic.
---
Omg. I have completely forgotten about those. Remind me how they worked, again?
---
You could move on instead of posting stupid replies but here we are.
---
Rag is much better unless you hit the same guy repeatedly, which is rare in PvP.
---
Its got higher base damage, strength and a more immediately useful proc.
---
Grats!
---
Yeah this happened to me, even the alliance could see me and were emoteing me. When i left the bg there was no npcs and i was still dead, relogging fixed it.
---
If you're still falling for it 15 years later, not even Blizzard can help you my good man.
---
Problem is that the drop rate isn’t too bad... if you get the boss who has it.
---
Lots of feral Druids like to get some variation on the x/x/21 spec for it's versatility.  And it indeed is a good spec but I've been running with:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-5050501303022151-055023003
---
And I give up NS for LotP but I've been pretty ok with that.  Mostly because I tank a lot more than I heal and as such having a passive group buff is nice as well as it being a DPS/TPS boost.  With the ~400 +Healing gear I have I can heal most groups fine.  When things go badly I don't have NS to use instead I have to rely on max rank Regrowth spam and then an Innervate to get back all the mana I just spent.
---
However given that I am rarely healing I also have been thinking of going to the "full" tank OOC build:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5050501303022151-05002
---
This build really would close the door on any healing but would be a pretty good boost to my DPS/TPS.  So far I've not really needed it but as DPS continues to scale up and feral upgrades are few and far between it might become necessary.
---
Yea, retail didn't add just bad things, it added a lot of good.
---
There is constantly a half dozen or more 60 mages clustered around the AH or bank in TB - zeppelin shmeppelin, 50 silver and you’re anywhere in the world in 2 seconds.
---
I feel you man, I've been in the same shoes for about 2 weeks already myself :S
---
Thanks! It was so satisfying
---
Well apparently one-shotting can be multiple hits taken in one shot.
---
Why are we even having this discussion?
---
I don’t.
---
I’m replying to someone.
---
They stated that folks would be forever appreciative if you helped them get their BiS.
---
I disagree. 
---
Not sure what you’re replying to as a result.
---
We deserve to lose. It's the price to pay for being so damn sexy and awesome /flex
---
Problem with an MMORPG is that doing the things that *are* fun requires you to do things that you may not like. 
---
A lot of people really don’t enjoy levelling. It’s something they put up with to get to the endgame content that they enjoy. 
---
There’s no option in classic to skip levelling aside from botting, so what would you say to someone who doesn’t like levelling? Just don’t play WoW? 
---
It’s similar with the PvP grind. Players want the rewards, getting the rewards is fun for them. To get the rewards, they can’t even PvP. They have to spam AV because it’s the best source of honour for them. 
---
The system is super flawed, but it is what it is.
---
Get a pockethealer to level together. /thread
---
I don't know their abilities very well but use some sort of detect invis (warlock or potion) to see the invis patrols. That will help ya ton.
---
And if you role one with pigtails **they fucking spin** as you're casting. Amazing.
---
It’s a script from wago.io in WeakAuras 2
---
Hunters probably didn’t know what they are doing.
---
I play Horde so I wouldn't know, but are premades that picky about who they invite? I remember in WotLK there would be cross-realm Ventrilo premades that would accept almost anybody no matter their gear, since all you had to do to win was follow the leader's instructions.
---
Because in moba you rely on your team a lot for the game to go well, if things go to shit, it's easy to start blaming others.
---
Human female mage, because armor looks awful on gnomes and human males have derpfaces and look dumb as hell all buff but running around in a dress.
---
You're correct, but its far more fun to be the best. So I'll keep doing what I am doing, you keeo doing what your doing. This cancer attitude of "MiM MaXxERs aRE bAD" really needs to die.
---
Paladins are sick at leveling. Slow and steady but can take on 3 mobs, sometimes 4 with lay on hands if need be. Warrior on the other hand would greatly benefit from this
---
You don't say.
---
I meant; what are the odds of being 1-2% off next rank every week? I don't use HonorSpy so I have no idea where I sit in the rankings.
---
War stomp has gotten me out of TONS of jams, not to mention saving our fc from getting picked off just before capping etc. I'm primarily pvp, so that health bonus is welcomed to me.
---
They're from warcraftlogs, which is a hell of a lot more accurate than your victimized perspective.
---
The queue just got 5 minutes longer Horde boy
---
Yeah, it's like 15% chance to get the boss and then a 15% chance it'll drop; that's pretty rare. I've done it probably 7 times now and I've seen the boss once and he didn't drop it. There's a poor mans version that drops from the 7 that also has 2% crit but lower stats. Almost as good, using that for now
---
It's the holidays (I'm assuming you are na) which is always a rough time for guilds. Once you get past new years eve it should pick back up.
---
6 weeks at 7/8 missing shoulder, it really hurts!
---
I think he would especially appreciate this one. He always talked about Valhalla, so that’s where he is as far as we are concerned. I’m sure he has spent some time up there soloing Onyxia, Nefarion, and all the raids up to WOTLK. Thanks for the chuckle.
---
Will do then! What’s the faction balance like? And are you horde/alliance?
---
Yes. But pouring gas in a fire won't smother it
---
how come i cant MC these npc but in the video he can? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ3gkWbnNnM

Where is WoW open-ended, because I've never felt that. Its a themepark, your meant to ride the rides.
---
Its not because Timmy brought them in trouble before.

---
So NONE of those companies store passwords in plaintext then? Got it. That was my point. 
---
Also your rant about blackhats being more invested in breaking things than security researchers are in discovering them is so off it is hilarious. You are completely off. Responsible disclosure, crowd sourced pen testing, all this points towards the industry providing talented individuals LEGAL ways to make money breaking things. Your read of the security landscape is completely off and rooted in misplaced fear mongering.
---
i have no experience with bwl, but im hoping the encounters are longer than mc. so many priests ive raided with who dont know anything other than flash spam but get away with it because the fights are so short, except 20 manning ony where they can barely get halfway through without needing an innervate.
---
managing mana/5sr/stopcasting over long encounters is one of the reasons why i rolled a priest, but maybe thats wishful thinking with classic.
---
Life tap. Nuff said. 
---
On a male Undead it looks like I’m dabbing.
---
Username does not check out.
---
What realm though?
---
Contrary to popular believe and what Hollywood shows you, you can't just drop a match on a gas trail and have a huge trail of fire chasing a leaky tanker truck as it goes down the road.
---
I dont know ive maybe bought 4k+ gold of stuff and have 1k gold in my bags and I still dont have everything I want. I also have an alt.
---
Better be a damn good reason why you need my gold more than I need it, and not having enough time to grind for yourself is not a reason... you shouldve passed to the person willing to self grind for it.
---
Wait did they put the timer on av?
---
You are willfully misinterpreting what I am saying. If you want to assume that those companies no longer store things in plaintext and never will ever have a bug ever again that will expose passwords in plaintext then go right ahead.   
---
Shit happens. I'm not ranting at all about "blackhats" and I had to lookup what the term was. I'm not talking about the security research industry. I am talking about regular websites that people use on a daily basis. Its so easy for a mom blogger or a regular joe to make their own website and start selling stuff. Those are the kinds of people that aren't invested in doing security research and updating the code in their website. Christian sites are known to be worse in security and your more likely to get a virus from a christian website than a porn site. Just normal people selling stuff on etsy, how invested is etsy on security do you think? Or the various custom tshirt websites that are out there?   
---
I'm done with this convo, you obviously aren't listening.
---
Ah yes, the one that a hunter rolled on and won over my mage because it had more dps in vanilla. I was only a youngster and I cried for a good while afterwards. Still hurts to think about lol.
---
I mean hard to say until we re visit the bwl content but I dont think you need to go out of your way for FR as a healer. If anything pop one of the lesser fire protection potions (small flame sac and some miscellaneous herb. Cant remember as I'm on my phone now) if you're worried about dying. Itll also help with pushback.
---
Uh sir this is a Starbucks

The drakes are a joke

Blizz scales bad with sp. Better to have more int and stam for farming with blizz (ie a pvp set) so you can do more blizzards (which will tick for slightly less). Sp stacking is for single target pve. Sure, has its uses in pvp.
---
Also OP, +18 or up to 18?

God thankyou! The whole minmax culture is so bloody toxic yet any time someone says “hey if you don’t enjoy it then maybe don’t do that” to you always get a “WELL WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO DO HUH HUH?!!”. Clearly we aren’t talking about them, though their need to be so defensive probably says something.
---
If you want to minmax then awesome, have fun. But if you’re miserable while doing it, maybe like.... don’t.

He’s literally botting

Hello,
---
 I made a druid alt and looking forward into lvling it as my second lvl 60 .
---
What spec do you recommend looking forward to P3 and further ? I'm torn between healer/tank . What's the viability of both in raids and also in later phases . I was thinking about feral dps but heard they're not as great.
---
Are there any good tips and tricks for playing a druid both lvling and late game ? I decided to play druid but was choosing between druid and paladin . Any major difference between paladin healer/tank and druid healer/tank
---
Got a rogue named Assfacekilla, surprised I haven’t been forced to change it yet
---
Pretty sure we’ve just established I play less than you, at least on raid night. So if playing the game we’re here to discuss is a bad thing to you then it seems like you should be sarcastically congratulating yourself.
---
😂
---
Right now I play Orc warlock with Engineering and herbalism.
---
I honestly would not change class, 1 week ago I discovered DM:East demon farming, and it's one of the most fun farms I've done ever.
---
If I'd change it'd be by going Alliance and human, I don't feel orc has the same kind of personality I thought it would.
---
I Updated it with additional Notification types. Currently supports:  
---
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/), [Telegram](https://telegram.org/), and the Alexa '[Notify Me](https://www.amazon.com/Thomptronics-Notify-Me/dp/B07BB2FYFS)' Skill
---
Also, by default after you configure your notification type it should 'just work' right out of the box.  
---
Only certain people or certain computer setups will need to change any of the advanced  features.
---
Thanks all for the feedback!
---
Ally 100% need to put more effort in for ranking, as they have instant queues compares to hordes 30m or so, generally.
---
This means horde can walk their dogs, have a break, do chores, take a shit, a shower, etc
---
Alliance have to premade, as instant queues allow for gaming of the system for false premades, whereas horde can't do it as well, thus don't need to, and with instant queues there only breaks are the 2 mins it takes for av to start to be honour efficient.
---
So horde can do w.e they want for 30m and still be honour efficient and alliance need to basically poopsock to be the same efficiency as horde.
---
I just use my phone in the bathroom
---
The bounce heals are really garbage tbh. Its literally an extra 200 healing and like 50 on the 3rd person so I use it for tank healing and any extra raid healing is a bonus.
---
In interviews, part of the justification to use modern client / infrastructure was to benefit from more recent anticheat measures... Where are they ?
---
Well hes still not banned so I suppose not.
---
It’s a wardrobe simulator.
---
Based on history, nope. Horde have massively outnumbered alliance for the vast majority of WoW and in classic especially the horde racials are better for PvP so you tend to get a lot of the PvP focused players choosing them. 
---
End result is that alliance have near instant queues pretty much always while horde queues get worse and worse. Big reason I prefer alliance honestly... no racial is as good as “play whenever you want”.
---
If you think about what you're saying, it's "don't post about your nice experience unless you were the first person to have a nice experience". That's not going to lead to a goid community
---
its bad when it affects other people, otherwise i dont see why anyone should care
---
Das some good shit
---
Since like early 2000s i've seen keyloggers save clipboards.
---
Super basic freeware software captures that shit.
---
2fa is the best option. 
---
People without 2fa and reusing passwords are the ones losing out. People buy those lists when they get stolen and try using the credentials on hundreds of sites to see what its the same as.
---
Willing to bet people are reading this are guilty of reusing the same email/password combo on a dozen things with no 2fa. 
---
If a single one get hacked with some horrific security practices (plain text passwords, stupid but it happens) then they're ALL vulnerable.
---
Sure some are useless bullshit accounts with no power but some are actively used and very inconvenient to deal with the fallout.
---
It’s like a shaman taking a HoJ from a warrior for his pvp spec then. I don’t think most people would be happy about that.
---
Idk about 30-39 but 40-49 was 20 mins for me
---
Don’t know why people say this, the vast majority of my games in vanilla were not against premade teams.
---
Rank 10 shoulders/head combo are better than both
---
Leaving me more time to stomp some allies out in the world &lt;3
---
What’s the add on you use for consumes
---
Enchants and pala epic mount quest when DM released. Now that the demand is a lot lower, prize goes down.
---
this is inaccurate. Its dead.
---
WHAT'S IN THE BOOOX!?
---
Thank you, this is great advice :)
---
My first two games today consisted of horde camping us at our gys: not taking them, mind you, just blasting us to smitherines as we rose.  
---
Spirit walk to another? same experience there.
---
I'm peak millennial... I'm 26.  
---
I just don't believe in this world where everything you do is tracked and sold to target ads so you'd buy more useless shit, and where capitalist corporations put profit and investors ahead of their customers, your data can be truly safe if it's on a digital device.
---
Maybe in a world where your every movement isn't being sold to the highest bidder.  Where my digital correspondence is just another commodity to be traded, but my journal and snail mail is considered so private and almost sacred. Something that I truly own, which has not terms of service, or license agreements.
---
If you’re a tank, make friends with a good warlock and take them on every run with you. Nothing brings toxic morons in line faster than “the lock is here to summon your replacement, stop being a fuckwit and play the game”.
---
And here I spent so much time figuring out how to give it great quality!
---
They were huntards,  this ring brings no benefits to a hunter worth arguing about,  during leveling or later.
---
Ye good song! Love sum41.
---
Give me a whisper perhaps! :P?
---
Two lousy mage blades since October. Glad I settled for staff of dominance instead of waiting for mageblade.
---
In TBC I tricked people into thinking that ALT+F4 gave you free gold or an end game weapon. It was fun watching several people log back on to bitch me out in trade chat for lying. I've been able to convince several people to do that still, and seeing streamers do it is just as fun because it shows that they're not really a PC person.
---
Knowning Blizzard they will sue the hell out of that website
