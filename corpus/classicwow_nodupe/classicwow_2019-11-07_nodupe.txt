Dude, someone took screenshots with combat logs showing it working. I don't even play a warlock and can see you're a dumbass.

Mom... Why do people shorten words?

---
Idk b fyi taboadqaysbatba...bnflbsh. Hagd
---
I don't know, but for your information thats a bit of a dumb question and you should be a tiny bit ashamed... But not for long, because shit happens. Have a good day.
---
Think about how epic several raid v raid fights would look without lag :(
---
That‚Äôs because old people watch like 11 hours a day, young people watch far less.
---
What are you talking about? UnderCity is the gateway to Scholo and Strat. Darnassus has nothing.
---
When ZG comes out, for the first time it feels like there is a lot to do. Guilds will want to run ZG until the end of the server‚Äôs life-time and I hope to god that people do not figure out a way to farm idols in groups of 2-3 people.
---
But I agree. Having honor and BWL is already a huge improvement.
---
Bajheera, he‚Äôs a great streamer and isn‚Äôt toxic at all. He‚Äôs mature and plays the game at his own pace, but he definitely knows what he is doing and learns the lore/mechanics more every day. 
---
He has a great community and is or used to be a bodybuilder, so he still streams workouts sometimes before he gets on WOW.
---
People saying there is no one good to watch is in the other hand pretty fucking accurate though cause I can‚Äôt think of anyone else that eventually annoys the shit out of me for toxic/immature crap. I‚Äôd say there half the reason why you still find toxic players in game.

We didn‚Äôt hand you shit.  The only thing our generation did wrong was to allow that liberal degradation of our societies morals to continue to this extreme - should‚Äôve fought it down hard, even if it meant civil war, but instead we‚Äôve got you now and a thoroughly locked in socialist liberalized plague in places of influence that we will never clean out. 
---
That whole POV that your five daddy‚Äôs and a liberal mass media raised you own is some seriously messed up bs. 
---
It‚Äôs sad that you don‚Äôt even realize how screwed up you guys are, but its just you
---
Them some nice pants.

Just remember ... ATL-F4

&gt; server administrator
---
You can google server admin just like that person googled storage admin and find alot of jobs. It is an official title if people are being recruited with that job title in mind.
---
Dood I refuse to go anywhere but UC, superior city over the rest any day purely by layout. Closer access to Western and Eastern Plague Lands, Shadow Fang Keep for Shadowfang farming, BRD ROL+General farm, UBRS, LBRS, MC all one flight path in about 5 minutes plenty of time to bio n grab a snack n check out memes on reddit real quick. 
---
P.S if for any reason you want to see your poor smelly Ally's Capital it's just a smol Zep ride over and there. UC the Hordes Darnassus? HAH! That's TB man!
---
I noticed this lag the other day when I was flying from  IF to SW. When the flight path gets close to Blackrock Mountain, it freezes and rubberbands for a moment, just like swapping CRZs on live wow does.
---
So much for the seamless world they promised back in 2004
---
1-5 twinks + 1-5 twinks is still a lot more common than finding a random battleground with 1-5 High Warlords/Grand Marshals on each side though...
---
Please don't lick your UI.  You don't know where the developer has been!
---
Dungeons are probably the best bet. Try to avoid things were everyone skips pulls and honestly I would probably try to do it with people in guild or at least tell the party before hand.
---
Even if the pet doesn't aggro anything extra, I would expect it to get blamed for anything that goes wrong at all.
---
No I didn‚Äôt consider that since It literally never happened to me when I was leveling my main around other mages who would die during their pulls. Because I wasn‚Äôt an idiot and saw the dude 10 yards away with 10% health. 
---
The only time I‚Äôve had issues with leash hand offs are when other people are running away from their pulls. Not dying. I‚Äôd say you deserve to die in those positions for just being in bad positioning.
---
You've just posted on reddit, what do you mean???
---
I play on Sulfuras alliance and I love it, it's pretty balance. Also heard Kromcrush is 50:50
---
For the most part you got it, but a single DK probably won't drop a whole rank but a decent chunk of it. There's posts that have how the honor system work out there. You have to maintain your rank too, there's no preset amount of honor you need for each rank.
---
Yes. Each spell will have different coefficients. +Spell power does ALL spells, where as +healing is only heals, +shadow is only shadow damage spells.
---
Ya it‚Äôs bad for WPvP. But this pic is no surprise. They‚Äôre all waiting for Ony buff, on raid reset day, almost at peak hour. Many of their raids probably start soon, and you can‚Äôt get another buff for 6 hours. 
---
After 10 minutes I‚Äôm sure this picture would look very different. Including a giant spike with a dragon head on it.
---
I feel you
---
Leatrix Plus will let you move the player and target frames, sure.  But that's not what the OP wants.  The OP wants a clone frame showing health bar and combo points in 2 places.
---
I don‚Äôt like it, but I don‚Äôt think the restaurant should be able to deny you food if you are a bad tipper. If you demand a tip in order to perform a service then it‚Äôs a fee not a tip.
---
I understand what you're saying, but you tried to debunk the theory by saying:
---
&gt; According to other people that have tried to figure out how her threat works, if the fireball hits multiple people, the threat reduction doesn‚Äôt work and will keep targeting the highest threat until they take the fireball alone, which is more than likely what is happening here. 
---
Which can be seen is not the case by the examples of MT/OT stacking. Threat is clearly getting reduced to a point, but then not effecting the target once it switches to the OT. 
---
So your theory (or the theory you say others have made) cannot be true. While the current examples are proving the GUID theory valid. So while it may seem odd that this is the way it was programmed. It is still possible and so far is holding up to testing. Testing is the only way we will find out the truth since we don't have access to actually see how it's written.
---
Aoe grinded almost exclusively from 56-60 doing lbrs and stopping at ommok since week 2. Was doing them with mages who were ahead of the curve and managed to get their skyshrouds but me on all my runs. Well I'm still rocking spiritshroud üòé
---
I can't confirm but sounds plausible.
---
You are amazing, thank you so much! :D
---
Dam. I'm gunna be a farm being a holy priest lol. I usually am solo out in the world but I might have to spend a few weeks in dungeons lol
---
I honestly can't wait. With my current playstyle I get 1 soul stone for every kill, and I legitimately can't spend them fast enough, demons take too long to summon, healthstones are on a 2 minute cooldown, and I'm a long way from having the tools to do anything else. I'm planning on having 5 points in the reduced cast time of soul fire by level 48 and I'm going to be starting every fight with that most likely.
---
Thanks for the insight. That's actually pretty fascinating!
---
Paladin + Warrior is a big wall of ‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù
---
People don't care for reality, they only care about complaining and easy buzzwords to throw around.
---
Vanish being used offensively... i see you have a lot of confidence in your group lol
---
Basically this. You have two options as 30/21. Spec into cat talents and feral in PvE or spec into Bear and heal in raids and PvE, but with the right gear you shouldn't have a problem tanking dungeons.
---
Azeroth.
---
That's exactly what he meant. In phase 3 the two blues op is excited about should easily get him him epic riding and then some.
---
Maybe I wasn't clear. For me, I'd definitely prefer if you distracted them to keep them there and let me pull them.
---
You‚Äôll know about Paladins when you see one with a Warrior and/or a Mage. Imagine a warrior you can‚Äôt slow 90% of the time or a Mage you can‚Äôt touch with physical damage when they are locked down. It‚Äôs obnoxious.
---
Reddit is full of people who play 5 hours a week crying that the game is being rushed when the reality is most people are 60 and bored, even the people with wives/kids/jobs. I don't know what universe these Reddit players are from lmao. I have one guy in my guild who works full time, has a wife and kids yet he has 2 60s already(Hunter/Mage), epic mount, Rhok'delar and most MC gear on his hunter.
---
Been running it on reset when I can with 3 people.
---
Yeah I agree, but unfortunately most rogues dont really use those abilities (besides evasion). I will admit though I never see rogues in dungeons anyway since they dont get invited.
---
Well when i remember vanilla correnctly city raids where often laggy.
---
I mean for your Hp/mana and target etc :) I like how they‚Äôre blacked out around the borders
---
They are both pretty rough, but I've heard some really good things about Holy Palaldins grouped with Warlocks in BGs. I imagine the combo is insane.
---
Start hanging out with a prot pally :)
---
Again people regurgitate this myth, it‚Äôs insane.
---
ClassicAuraDurations? I believe it shows timers for any stun or daze effect.
---
fair enough, i don't typically see that specific job title though i have seen it before. i'm not really concerned about whether job titles exist, like whether "server engineer" exists or not, but a storage administrator is a common role in large organizations and has been for a long time. i was trying to highlight how you clearly do not have the background knowledge, much less the specific knowledge of the environment and application, to be jumping to conclusions like "it's storage latency." that is an absurd leap.
---
Oh what you‚Äôve seen right through me. You caught me
---
I don't think anybody has those expectations...
---
What it takes to be good as a Pally in PvP:
---
1. Find the Warrior most dripping in gear
---
2. Cast Blessing of Freedom off CD with the talent that reduces the CD
---
3.  You‚Äôre good at playing a Paladin in PvP
---
CHESTBRAH
---
Of course I have seen some weird shit in my time in large code bases but when talking about software engineers of AAA titles where every cpu cycle counts, I can‚Äôt see anyone justifiably using a GUID for determining which object to use in something so trivial as determining which target to select for threat reduction of an ability.
---
Insta spells use the gcd of 1.5 seconds.
---
The problem is that this would correct the issue lol
---
Nah, that's real dumb. 
---
As a rogue, unless you've been insanely lucky and gotten Felstriker, your prebis should be Swords, and you should be sword specced. Then respec once you actually get the decent daggers.
---
What class are you playing so that you can duo these runs?
---
As another SWE, a few things. 
---
1. GUIDs _are_ an integer (128-bit), and some representations will keep them as bits (1x128, 2x64, or 4x32) until they need to be rendered as text. Even if they're kept as a string, unless you need crypto level security the string comparison should be optimized and return early as soon as it hits a different character; as it's a known length you can optimize to compare more characters at once; and there are other potential optimizations.¬†The point is it wouldn't be that much slower than comparing ints.
---
2. The "GUID," if you look at what it shows in the video is more like "player-xx-xxxxx," not a real GUID. It's smaller so it could be stored as a single int/long internally.
---
3. There plenty of ways a bug or simply unspecified behavior could result in the lowest ID being usually or always chosen.  The most straightforward is they just end up with an array that happens to be ordered by ID and they just take the first element (either on purpose or due to a bug in their selection process). Maybe that's just how things are pulled out of the DB and the order propagates to the selection, or maybe they're pulled out of a hashmap that doesn't order them as unpredictably as one might expect.
---
Yeah brother, np. Twitch is just the one most people use I think.
---
But the ID seems to be based on when the record is created. If the entries in the database are stored in that order then it doesn't have to compare the actual IDs. It might just be set up to pick the first player on the list which happens to be the person with the lowest GUID.
---
"Click to help summon"
---
Dead player.
---
Play on komcrush? I know a guy who sells cars and plays at work would be funny if that was you.
---
It‚Äôs less than 15-20g At least on my server. That‚Äôs what Mooncloth sells for, but that‚Äôs not accounting the price of the felcloth. And selling the transmute is not very profitable with such a long cooldown.
---
No, I do not. I don't believe there necessarily has to be a corollary between people's ability and understanding and the time it would take to enjoy that content. It's like saying movies should be made shorter as we've already seen so many.
---
What do you think the appropriate length of each tier should be? Just because people can clear them quickly doesn't mean everyone will or the loot structure (which hasn't changed) will suitably reward everyone in a shorter time frame.
---
Rogue here; fairly terrible AoE, but that usually isn't a problem unless it's specifically an AoE group. I also often pull aggro when I DO use my blade flurry (which I use on CD), because it's hitting a non-focus target no matter what. This is also fine, because I pop evasion each time I pop blade flurry pretty much. 
---
As the other poster said, there is crazy competition for leather gear and one handed weapons in classic. Plate, mail and leather classes all want the same shit a lot of the time. People just want less competition.
---
I don‚Äôt think this is going to be fixed or addressed until they see a significant change in the numbers on their spreadsheet.
---
Rogue 0.5 4-piece is (probably) BiS all the way up to and including Naxx. 
---
It would really mess up gear progression if it was released before even BWL was!
---
Resto Druid. The warrior was Arms for MS to reduce healing on the second boss. It worked pretty well.
---
1:40 is my expectation, reality is going to be a slideshow due to terrible servers
---
the shitty part of it is that if a 60 is in a raid with a 30, and the 30 sees the level 25 npc blacksmith as an honorable kill and kills them, the 60 gets a dishonorable kill, even if they didn't participate in any way.
---
Spoiler; they'll just get warned, or teleported down
---
If they repeat it, it might turn into a 2 day ban
---
I've checked it there too and checked both of them in game with no luck. Also there are no cured thick hides in the horde AH which makes it even more suspicious.
---
Years...lmao
---
You have no clue what you are saying
---
Thanks.
---
The word actually [existed](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNQQw_xgp5xU6urfFfoqgPifArNz8Q%3A1573085976514&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=GGPDXcD2G8yV0PEP-b2s2Ak&amp;q=parse&amp;btnK=Google+Search) before the idea of trying way too hard at World of Warcraft
---
Okay sweet thank you
---
Lashers drop greys that vendor for gold and they drop lots of greens boes
---
/quit and /gquit went out in a boat.  /quit fell out.  Who was left?
---
Yiiiiiikes. Imagine for just two minutes that you're trying to say that hunters can even STEP to mages DPS and then you don't even take in account world buffs and flasks (which hunters don't get any of, except flasks) . You're a fucking walking goldmine of insults yet can't see that you're the one who's wrong. Its hilarious. You're a bad mage resorting to insults so you go play a hunter so you can have it easy. I see, I see. Its okay buddy you'll reach top ten eventually ;)
---
Bite, because you are using a wolf for Furious Howl?
---
I mean it rarely happens that your taunt will be resisted, and worst case scenario in a raid there will be two other tanks as back up.
---
I feel this! Lvl 29 priest here playing horde on skeram always looking for people to level with
---
Blizz customer service definitely used to be another level.
---
I think this is from 2019, my only reasoning this is that the classes are color coded in chat. I remember I found that so weird when it was added in BFA. I think they kept that feature and added it into classic
---
&gt; how much atk power I'm getting as a warrior from agility?  
---
Zero
---
&gt; how much crit rate I'm getting as a warrior from agility?  
---
For a Level 60 Warrior:
---
20 Agility = 1% Crit Chance, 1% Dodge
---
For other levels it's unknown. People have some calculations and estimations, but there's no definitive answer from Blizzard about this.
---
Hahahaha you got caught!!
---
Mocking blow is a melee hit not a spell, shouldn't 6% hit mean it never misses?
---
Outstanding move
---
i'll start rolling need on star of mystaria then
---
Lvl 24 Night Elf Rogue here. I just completed the Van Cleef quest in Westfall and I‚Äôm planning on moving to Stockades soon. I‚Äôve seen/heard that Van Cleef will drop a Cruel Barb and that it‚Äôs a great weapon for those of us going the sword route. Is it worth continuing to run DM in hopes that I get a Cruel Barb? Or nah? Thanks!
---
\#showtooltip Heroic Strike
---
/startattack
---
/cast Heroic Strike
---
/stopcasting
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's paramount to type /stopcasting instead of /stopattack, because /stopcasting will abort your HS, not your autoattack.
---
I just had a question, jesus christ..!
---
It's a brainstorming statement that I made while bored taking a shit at work. I never said it's 100% true. Someone said it could be how their put zones in containers. It could be that as well.
---
Bind your keys son
---
I agree it could be any number of things, but as for now the theory is holding up. 
---
Also just because the theory is saying it's newer vs. older GUID doesn't mean that the code on the backend is saying compare  GUID to GUID. It's just the info that we have available on our end to determine it.
---
GUID would most likely be just the identifier for the player, then the code would actually be written to possibly look at a field on that GUID such as a creation date. As someone who works primarily with Javascript, it would be quite simple to get and compare a creation date between two GUIDs of a couple user records for the system I work on. :)
---
This is not v good. Considering g the bag is a waiting game with a ton of others going after it. Not really worth it unless you just wanna bs
---
Sorry to break this out to you, but unfortunately your idea is utter shit.
---
Lmao, remember when you and people like you all thought layering was going to be an absolutely disastrous, game-breaking mechanic, and that Blizz was lying and they were never going to remove it?
---
It's all a conspiracy man, Blizzard is out to get you, and your family. Watch out!
---
Curious, can you give me a run down on what you do in sm? And what wings you prefer to farm?
---
So glad there are other people here who understand the English language beyond gaming culture buzzwords.
---
I used fire wand for onyxia and pretend that I did any dmg. üò≠
---
By the time you get it you would have outleveled the item if you just stick to questing.    Upgrades whole leveling are nice but you shouldn't have to go out of your way to get anything.   A single quest run is enough for most Dungeons.
---
Civilians don't give honor, but I see your point especially if TM SS battles are going on.
---
Man god bless all those who take the time to help out the whole community.
---
Overhealing doesnt matter unless you are struggling to clear the content.
---
you don't need lbrs.
---
like the others have said: go in, try to target jed for a couple minutes, if he's there, great, if not reset and do it again. once you find him, advertise for a 5man group (I usually aim for tank, 2 melee, 1 caster, 1 healer). so long as people carry their weight, 5 manning thru rend is easy
---
Ok thanks for the advice!
---
&gt; why should I bother continuing my subscription?
---
Honestly you shouldn't. 
---
If you cared about classic and you wanted to experience all the stuff missed as a kid you would have set aside time in your life to make that happen.  Many of us did that, and I think many people are realizing that the rose tinted glasses are real.
---
I want bgs so badly , wpvp is boring imo
---
obvisouly i know nothing of the blizzard server setup but... I think that batching might be part of the problem here. You are essentially quing up huge processing spikes on the server over and over again rather than having a consistent flow of data.  
---
I understand that they want the "True vanilla experience" but honestly the game just feels clunky in 2019 with this built in batching mechanic. I really hope blizzard end up removing this and use the new engine (20ms batch windows) but previous experience shows that blizzard can be quite stubborn about these things and take the "we know best" approach rather than what the community wants.  
---
people play vinalla for the content
---
I gave an answer. Lord Satan!
---
Theyre rushing phases somewhat yes. Ita pretty sad but i guess they think better of their new xpac so they want classic done by the new xpac.
---
Just turned lv 40 (human warrior). Which mount should I choose? Pinto, brown or chestnut?
---
Is it a melee hit? It doesn‚Äôt seem to be coded that way, as I don‚Äôt know any other melee attacks that can be resisted. It seems to be coded as a spell, in which case, hit will not help. 
---
Also I may be wrong, but I‚Äôm pretty sure the hit cap for special attacks is 9% unless you are an orc using an axe, or a human with a mace/sword.
---
I'm a druid and I do this. There's lots of critters in moonglade. Lots of dead ones after I finish there.
---
...
---
Good thing I don't play on an rp server. Maybe I shouldn't be a druid.
---
Clips pls
---
Find a guild. People are 99 percent really nice on voice chat unless you stumble on some toxic guild.
---
yeah grobb alliance is a pretty solid community
---
Bro settle down with the emojis, this isn't tumblr. 
---
Yeah the original release perhaps, you think phase 2 (honor system) came out 2 months after vanilla launch lol? No, it came out like 7 months after.
---
So obviously things will be speed up. Blizzard is desperate for keeping the game fresh as we can see with panicrelease dm and early phase 2.
---
We're talking a small damage reduction change in favor of a huge threat change. Armor is a diminishing return for druids, which is why you need to balance threat and armor, not just go nuts into armor.
---
nope, definitely not. And not on openers, which is the only thing that really matters in dungeons. Dungeons are a series of openers.
---
No tank worth their salt is going to be tanking without at least +5 weapon skill. Be it via racials, Edge Master's, Mugger's Belt, or Aged Core Leather Gloves. You are correct though, 9% for those who don't.
---
Mocking Blow definitely acts like a melee hit on the damage portion at the very least. It's the only taunt that does damage and the yellow portion of the attack is a melee attack. That said, mocking blow can still get parried or dodged.
---
It's alright if the server is overcrowded and there is lag during prime time, just wait til 3 AM and it should be fine cause nobody is on. /s
---
No, it's 10-19
---
Bruh don‚Äôt call me out like that
---
You are completely and utterly exaggerating.
---
too real
---
It's not like they will increase the player cap. There will simply be queues.
---
It's not so much 'the servers can't handle it' but more 'will Blizz use all that money they are making to deploy extra server resources to handle the increased load'
---
You would have to pay for a NA subscription to wow.
---
Varies on server
---
The PVE server I'm on there's been nearly none of that and everyone is helpful, seems most people i interact with are 30-40 with kids and are far more mature.
---
The PVP server I'm on I've seen long ass racist/misogynist chats going on so yeah it's pretty toxic and while I'm not overly sensitive either there's some topics I don't want to see people making jokes about nor using as insults to people.
---
My advice would be to find a mature guild to ask questions to if you are having issues, or join the realm discord to find a good guild.
---
Being an online game you will always get some smart ass replies but usually on a good server there will be real answers mixed in as well or personally I usually PM the person directly with an answer.
---
I see... that's interesting... so is Spy doing something you can't do with the combat log or can you see the aura somewhere in the combat log manually?
---
I was going to downvote you for complaining about mega Chads but now I'm downvoting you for complaining that people didn't like your bad "joke."
---
Stop gaming? Nah, but if your life doesnt change when you settle into a long term relationship, thats pretty odd.  I still wow, I do not wow 6 hours a day like before I met my spouse
---
According to this https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_UnitGUID it does look like a UUID prefixed with a type and number eg.
---
Creature-0-1133-870-141-71953-0000432FBD
---
Maybe the client doesn‚Äôt show the full GUID and just some of it, or classic doesn‚Äôt use the same data type. I don‚Äôt know.
---
if you are interested in tanking, check out skarm tank on youtube. he has some very informative videos about warriors and druids.
---
Imagine a kid eating a sandwich with only tomato in it, no one wants to be that kid
---
They will not release p6 6 mo after p5 guaranteed. Go ahead and bookmark it for me. Still hasn't answered.
---
Deflect deflect deflect
---
fyi it is not possible to survive this without 1-2 pocket healers
---
Rogues?
---
Cannot recommend it enough, the versatility is really impressive for vanilla-era WoW. If you're Tauren I'd also recommend trying out 31/0/20, warstomp allows you to become a really dangerous duelist coupled with Elemental Mastery and your farming gets a noticeable uptick as well.
---
Stralya!
---
Lost that one to a holy pally on my first LBRS run. It's okay I guess but I grouped with him the next day and noticed he replaced them with leather healing legs. So annoying when healers roll on your bis damage gear...
---
Here's another great moment. Finally, the [Shivery Handwraps](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18693/shivery-handwraps) and nobody needs it! Holy shit, what luck. I roll a 5, other guy rolls a 65. The other guy is a priest. I haven't seen it drop since.
---
The video states that the GUID is incremented for each character creation, which leads me to believe it's an integer.
---
It was a little bit horde stacked at one point, maybe it was horde who transferred to felstriker not alliance.
---
LooL. Your main is a rogue, of course you die from this.
---
Your answer is literally why I hate today's mages.
---
The thing is that Alliance get their Onyxia buff in SW while Ironforge is kind of the main hangout for level 50+ chars, but it's not like that on Horde. Org is the main city that gets used for basically everything all of the time.
---
Every hardcore/semi hardcore raiding guild wants to get world buffs on raid night, well this is what Org looks like when 20+ hardcore raiding guilds group up.
---
Imho the playstyle between 30/0/21 (SM/Ruin)  and 9/21/21 (DS/ruin) is not very different, but the second is stronger. So don't worry about not 'being' affliction, it plays very similar, if not less mundane.
---
Personally, I can recommend giving 9/31/11 a try. I leveled all affliction, but changing to soul link was best decission I did. It outperforms the others by far in 5mans and is only a bit worse in raids (depending on the encounter).
---
In PvP however, soullink is such a beast. 
---
I haven't tried full destruction yet, as it is not very good in the raids atm.
---
Good luck with the journey :)
---
Spy
---
Anyone got a TL;DW?
---
This guy rambles on a lot...
---
Moonfire is by far the best critter-murdering spell.
---
&gt; How are people selling dungeon runs for gear when it's a random drop chance? 
---
You pay after item dropped. If it didn't drop - you got run for free, so run it one more time.
---
4 runs no shadowfang? That blows man sorry
---
Druid warlocks. I barely saw druids leveling and when it comes to raids I barely see any locks even tho theyre needed and do great dps.
---
stat padding cocksucker
---
*thank you for your service*
---
How big does two bindings recieved because of rng and not merit make your penis?
---
Addons like these weren't as widely circulated in vanilla. I wasn't talking about the technical possibility in vanilla either, just the fact that it dumbs down world PvP. 
---
Instead of being able to hide around terrain, set up an ambush, sneak up behind someone, etc, etc all of that is impossible when theres a big list of players nearby on your screen.
---
I'm a lvl 36 sword combat rogue, I was wondering if it would be better to take the sword of serenity or that dagger from the alliance SM quest? 
---
The sword is a great upgrade for my main hand, but the stats on it aren't really useful for rogue. The dagger would end up in my off-hand, but is still a big upgrade and the passive sounds quite good.
---
I think I saw the graph that said shaman is the least least played class on classic.
---
Looks like there are issues, and Blizzard is aware of them https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1192243820060119040
---
Dwarf
---
I always use imp for the health buff and that its invis unless you order it to attack. With other pets there's a risk of it drawing aggro. (Except succy). Succy has better dps but dps isn't really needed.

It's a world drop, so it's low drop rate and not farmable.

They're hard to farm and not many classes can do it easily. Pair that with incredibly high demand (most popular twink bracket/used on the best classes in the bracket/need multiple weapons per character. = high price

BT is the best and highest DPS in the game. I have x2 lvl 60 hunters and have tested this extensively.

Shadowfang for sinister strike / assassins blade for ambush

GUIDs have existed in some fashion since the games creation, many of the systems rely on it (like friends / ignore). The game must have some way to uniquely determine who is being targetted for what. The API for players to be able to see this was only added in 2.4.
---
Regarding alchemy...   
---
In original vanilla, the the Major mana potion recipe was made available from the ghost outside scholo in one of the later patches. Magnus Frostwake, I think his name is. To see him you need to have completed the Scholo quest chain from Eva Sarkhoff.    
---
Can anyone confirm this is still in the game, or has it been removed in 1.13?
---
I look forward to the perpetrator being brought to justice.

I was in the same boat. 300g was too much for me... and then someone offered it for 190g. I'm now 190g further from my epic mount. spent just shy of 600g on forever bis BoEs though. so not too terrible.
---
I have seen gear on the AH which requires Cured Thick Hide, but no idea where to find the trainer for it! Sorry.
---
&gt;It's not random; it's incremented as characters are created.
---
This is absolutely random in the context of what should determine how a boss uses an ability.
---
Who should I cast the fireball at? Uh, how about the person in the database with the highest number that was generated during character creation? 
---
Yea, there's something that's not absolutely arbitrary, that players have an opportunity to control...
---
Do you happen to know if caster stats apply to some of the wind serpent options?
---
I saw a mage doing an fire aoe, the animation was like frost nova but instead was a fire one, what was it?
---
Can the taunt be resisted if the yellow damage hits? 
---
Unless the OPs add on is wrong and mocking blow was parried, missed or dodged rather than resisted it would make much more sense that being hit capped would make it hit no matter what.
---
Liberal/socialist.  Who cares.  Either one is a travesty.

I love helping the other faction haha. I was in alterac soling the elite quests on my rogue and some Ally come up and I point to the mob and shoot it, we both kill it. Then I point again and he shoots it and I help him. After we both finished he left, and a few more Ally come and I help them too. Was pretty cool.

No. I had to respec to combat because of raid but thats just how it is. PvP sucks ass as combat and its really boring dying to mage that just spams fb and you cant do anything. When u get like 7 items  from raid respec to sub and it will be okay because most people will be well geared so one rog having bad spec wont do much in raid but in early phase go for combat for sure.
---
They go OOM too fast to be able to stay competitive. Theyre still viable tho for raids, its not like having one or two will ruin your 40 man raid and they provide i think 3% spell crit? You give them to the groups of casters the same way you give Ret paladins to the melee group.

As stated in some other posts, the reason is likely just the order in which players are added to the target list to begin with. e.g. when it hits an area, it iterates over players in the zone, and this list is always sorted by GUID. It takes the targets that are in range from that list, and then it resets the aggro of the first player in that list. It does not say "Take the player with the lowest GUID", but "Take the first player" of a list that happens to always be sorted by GUID.
---
I don't really know *why* the list is sorted by GUID though. I talked about this with a few guild members just yesterday and my reasoning was that it was likely sorted based on who entered the instance first, as it'd be most logical to add players to some list in that sequence. Another option is who logged in first for example, but that one is about as arbitrary as GUID, honestly.

I use my mage and it takes about 8 minutes for me to clear up to Fenrus the Devourer. Once I clear the big room before him, I run out and clear my bags a bit. Once I run out, I mount up and go to a vendor to sell some of the greens that won't sell on the auction house. If you're horde, there's a vendor named Leo Sarn (54, 82) southeast of SFK. Once I do about 3-4 runs, I just go and mail all the stuff I wanna sell to my bank alt. The time it takes to keep your bags clean will help you never hit the lockout timer. I also use an addon called Dejunk to keep my inventory clean of useless junk items that don't really sell for much.
---
It's so dumb. These people think that someone theorycrafted something new and their shitty little meme spec is viable. The reality of the situation is that they're either running with terrible dps or they're severely gimping quality players just to save a few gold.
---
God damn that‚Äôs fucked up. I‚Äôm sorry that happened.
---
On PvP realms any time you enter contested or enemy territory you are automatically flagged. Once you return to allied territory you wait 5 minutes and the flag goes away.

This is Azeroth, at a time when the Horde and Alliance ruled a lush and fertile planet. A piece of content just 600 mb wide changed all that. It hit with the force of 10,000 nuclear weapons. A trillion tons of blood and tears were thrown into the atmosphere, creating a lag the server was powerless to penetrate for a thousand years. It happened before. It will happen again. It's just a question of when.
---
Make sure everyone has updated their details
---
NP. Just keep in mind that the info on that page is updated for retail WoW. So it'll be a lot different in terms of how many casts you'll need to get to 300 skill, as opposed to the 600 listed.
---
purple?
---
I think it's also that there are more "normies" on the internet now. It used to be mostly nerds and perverts until myspace and facebook brought the technologically challenged people online en masse.

Does anybody remember a guy that played a dwarf paladin that made videos around vanilla / bc time? I vaguely remember from when I was young and just starting to play the game. His videos are what got me into it but I can‚Äôt for the life of me remember who he was. I think it was a fairly popular channel and he always played his dwarf paladin with gold hair in a long ponytail. I think he may have made videos on soloing as a paladin because I remember seeing him using consecrate and being amazed at all the damage numbers. Anybody know what I‚Äôm talking about?
---
Wtf. What do you think a cloud server is? It‚Äôs literally a machine sitting somewhere else. Blizzards architecture is the problem.
---
Kinda type of girl who swipe left for you :(

Keep an eye out for green wands on the AH.
---
I got a +13 healing wand for 5g at lv42
---
I just said "fuck it" and grabbed the pants from The Beast instead
---
Yea I respect that, but imo the trade off of 8-13 stam isn‚Äôt equal to a pretty good chance for a common matchup insta-win. I respect your opinion but I disagree with it about pvp. Cheers mate good luck out there
---
Totally, I'm at 45 and counting using a prot/holy hybrid build. Mostly tanking at this stage but with the occasional run as a healer. [This](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/0505311052125-053021330031) is the build I'm currently aiming for, but I may switch to [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/050531105-053051331031051) if I have more trouble with the lack of mitigation.
---
Got those on my first kill, couldn‚Äôt believe it when it happened since a guild or has also done 50+ runs for them

Agreed, my argument is not specifically for 1v1‚Äôs sorry if I misunderstood that statement

Ironya pants and Grim chest, a ‚Äúof spirit(~3% chance)‚Äù ‚Äúof concentration(1.5%)‚Äù or ‚Äúof the owl(3-4%)‚Äù suffix on the final boss ring is also nice

World pvp and Pvp in Mass areas are just mass AoE fests which is stupid.

Warriors are great end game, but definitely not while leveling.

iirc there's pretty much an equivalent set of boots from a quest reward/drop.

it may be better to sell if you are hurting. if you want more info, reply to this and i'll let you knwo when i get home.

Armor and stamina, whenever you can. If those are up to par, resistances are much less important. I just respecced my cat and she has 0 resistances right now and I‚Äôve had no issues with her dying because her armor and stamina are at the highest rank for her level. I do plan on adding some back when I can though.
---
Don't watch a streamer. Just play the game and learn by playing.

i should run dungeons more but i cbf dealing with pugs.

If you are stuck on min/max like everyone else then dwarf. Otherwise a night elf has shadow meld and can have some surprise MC! Lol. Humans which I am, not sure what they do lol. I just couldn't bare myself to play a dwarf lol
---
What did I just read?
---
In scholo you need a mix of Phys DPS and magic DPS. There are a bunch of mobs that are magic immune and other mobs that are Phys immune. So that guy you're talking about obviously already had Phys DPS in his team and needed a magic user to deal with the Phys immune mobs.
---
In other words: you will quit before p6.

Also, you really can't say deflect when that's the sole thing you have done as a product of your delusional coping mechanism since the start. You dismissed yourself from comment #1, but it was hilarious spectating your mental breakdown nonetheless.

EVERYONE will be layerless come P2. So when it's released they will be switching the remaining realms to being layerless.
---
obvi, this may change, but as there are only 2 layers max now, i'm quietly confident that they will follow through with it.
---
Find a Warrior buddy and you guys can just 2v5 most groups. Bonus points if he got (should have) Engineering can get pretty nasty.
---
No offense but fuck you for continuing to scalp people on the glove pattern.  It's the best way to level tailoring and charging that much on professions that pay dick is extremely toxic for a community.  "Hey, you want to level tailoring quick and not with a huge cost?  Fuck you, pay me."
---
Our raid has one shadow priest, but they get noncompetition for the spot from anyone else in the guild. If you're a solid reliable raider you'll find a shadow spot in a guild somewhere. At the moment raids are mostly still about filling numbers, so getting to 60 and geared is the best thing to do.
---
Look at all those parasites. Makes my spine tingle

---
Lol that would make me grief it for sure. I wouldn't normally do that, but if some needs tried to believe they can dictate my actions I'd do it on principle
---
No he didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the same scenario.  So with your thought process would you go out of your way to kill someone because they are more geared than you and can pull more? 
---
Are you going to go out of your way to kill someone who‚Äôs a higher level than you because they can kill more than you?
---
Are you going to purposely kill someone because they have more runecloth on the AH than you?
---
Especially when they are on your faction.
---
Apparently people don't know wowbash...

Priest. Mage can solo in theory, it would just take ages. I duo'd it with a mage after I got my pants.
---
Got them on my first ever LBRS last night :)
---
if you get a chance, try the druid + mage combo, it's basically pally + mage on steroids. 
---
for AoE, druid collects the mobs, mage freezes then blizzards while druid throws out a hurricane. for single mobs, mage pulls, druid ravages and shreds, facetanking generally won't be necessary. mage rarely has to drink with innervate and evocation and the druid really gets to fuck shit up. 
---
it's just wonderful to watch.
---
/e was the advanced version, people would just straight up whisper you that and I guess it would still fucking work on some
---
A big bunch of nonsense
---
Nearing 40 as a shaman with my warrior buddy. I tell ya what.. it gets real fucking good.

Do you think Blizz is going to give an official response to this stuff?

Don't, that's on them
---
Not far from where I live. Brb joining Tinder.
---
This isn‚Äôt my explanation, but my guild has been experimenting with stacking different tanks and this would explain the anomalies we‚Äôve seen where the strat works with some tanks and not others.
---
Yeah. Like 2 weeks ago I did run Census on one of the biggest EU realms and 50% of all logged characters were max level and over 64% of all logged characters were 52lvl+.

Is there anything even remotely resembling a 5 man tank spec with open world solo viability? Warrior that is.

Sure, the same amount of people use computers the same amount of time as two decades ago ^(/s )

I love it when rogues kick and stun lock mobs. Mages these days forget they have decurse and counterspell. 
---
On behalf of all the healers... keep over compensating!
---
There's a script to do a random amount too
---
Used to do that after every raid night. Someone fell every time.
---
At that point he deserves a shame rank just for himself
---
I would recommend starting a lvl 19 or 39 twink. U can get Staff of Jordan and other kewl stuff for 39, or just the classic for a 19 rogue/hunter.
---
Wake up in the morning and do it then

This is so fucking sad. The most epic part of the game is ruined by blizzard being cheap. This would've run on private servers without any problems at all and they were crowdfunded and cost 2k ‚Ç¨ a month..

I‚Äôm fine being behind, I‚Äôm 51 right now and that‚Äôs not bad.  Oh and I‚Äôve set time aside, but the idea that content should move based on the will of the hard core players is absurd to everyone else
---
Maybe you should put how many runs you've done in the title to make it more clear next time.
---
If you seriously have 50+ kills on him and still don't have the pants (17% drop rate) you're either lying or you keep losing them because you group up with people who also need them which you should avoid at that point.
---
literally the easiest thing it would seem like you could do for this is have 2 tanks, have both tanks say their guid's, tank with higher number tanks boss, tanks stand together. win.
---
&gt; Isnt that what they did from d2 to d3? and also when they revamped the wow talent tree system? I wouldnt necessarily call either a success.
---
Turning about 300 choices into 3 choices isn't good. Turning them into 30 is a much better option.
---
Had this on Shazzrah.
---
Shazzrah ports to someone. Entire group takes damage. "TAUNT RESIST" shazzrah rampages through our ranks. "RESIST AGAIN" after some time "Finally got him" Shazzrah teleports to someone in the group. "TAUNT RESIST"
---
You pay $0.50 a day to play wow. Would you like blizz to send you that as a check or on a gift card?
---
Turns out you might be dyslexic.
---
He really does ramble like crazy, I was losing my mind near the front of the video. I think he'd do well to write out scripts for himself.

Nah I just thought it was funny we got locked out and saw 5 belts in a row. I've been running 3 man groups for the last 3 days begging guildies for help.
---
getting mad over literal market dynamics... Go farm your own if it's so easy to do and worth having.
---
Only on the smaller ones. Provided there's alot more Eu players than NA. I think we have 4 servers still layered while I think they got more or double that. Not sure though
---
So here‚Äôs the question, how soon does content have to come out to placate the hardcore players?
---
Exactly. I cant remember the number of addon complaints since August that people claim as unauthentic when I remember addons that are exactly like the ones people have problems with. Addons dont give an unfair advantage as they are available to all users. If you dont want the addon, fine, but you can get it if you want it. Vanilla was the same and had some really good addons. In fact some existed that were nerfed before the patch they are using for classic.
---
I remember getting up for raids with very few sleep and putting a pillow on my keyboard and dozing while pressing my mouse in the same spot and it would heal the lowest health player in the raid. Such addon is impossible now. There were many cool addons in Vanilla that got coded out of the game. I would argue Vanilla had more addon options than Classic, not less.
---
Some of them, yes. I use the website Petopia classic to see which have caster stats and which do not. I believe they tested some different serpents and a few have the regular stats. One example is the rare white one in Feralas.
---
Crush them all and claim your territory like an alpha predator.
---
Love the animation style, but one thing is factually incorrect.
---
Killing quest givers won't increase in Phase 2, since killing them is a dishonorable kill. I would imagine Phase 2 will only decrease a number of people doing that.
---
I did the same thing when I hit 40 and got the black one thinking it would be uncommon. Boy was I wrong lol
---
They sure do like to talk about how much world pvp they have. I'll give you that much.
---
You can tank 5 mans with standard fury build.
---
you goofed (because IIRC Priest wears a different best in slot chest, you didn't need to get the pattern or mats for a robes of the archmage). If it doesn't suck on your priest (or maybe its best in slot for shadow priest? Then all isn't lost)
---

---
Exactly my thoughts. I was 5th in line for mageblade. Staff dropped last raid, I took it. Fuck waiting that long.
---
Warrior has generally very low solo viability regardless of spec, but yes, there are decent specs for tanking dungeons without being full prot.
---
Why would I quit before phase six? You refused to look at what the classes are truly capable of and just deflected everything I gave you - even when I used math to back it up. Sorry I'm not some casual like you; I have three 60s already and two full of them prebis. Good work.

Voone's Vicegrips looks so good. Basically off brand Edgemaster's guard.
---
He literally links a pserver video with an impressive amount of people and the only thing that's happening is a medium delay, not a full stop like on classic servers. How is he delusional when you are literally too lazy to watch the video. Like I can understand you saying there was server lag even on pservers because there was. Did they grind to halt because of a few hundred people ? Hell no
---
I‚Äôm gonna necro this because I gotta know. Did you ever run the Stockades as Horde?
---
Like to farm felcloth in fadefire in felwood, it's been 50/50. Usually alliance dominated which is nice but there's sometimes 1 other times there's 10.  But in my 3 or 4 half hour visits I got 11 felcloth and enough rune cloth to make 3 bags which I sold at 2.50 each. If I were to sell the mooncloth I'd say that's decent gold?
---
Mind linking that macro boss? I am about to respect into HotW/NS for tanking/healing and would love to have it in my toolbar.
---
&gt;Healers shouldnt be rolling on +spell damage gear unless nobody needs them.
---
I hate that logic so much. "Don't roll on an upgrade just because a different dungeon has something better for you." Those aren't just +spell damage, it's also +healing. A holy pally would benefit from those at that level.
---
What does the Warden staff sell for on your server, I had it drop last night on Yojamba.
---
Honestly all I hear about enhance at 60 is bad stuff. I have been a 60 enh for a while now and very well geared. Not only do I put up great dmg and dps I can melt in PvP. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt follow what people say about it because it‚Äôs been great for me.

Also a good build for WPVP, and maybe just PVP in general.

I mean they can come up with solutions to tons of problems vanilla had, but #nochanges

Didn‚Äôt get a kick out of it at all actually

Not possible. Your mage will need to craft the robe.
---
Is there any game that pulls off the large scale battles well? Seems like a very difficult thing to implement.
---
To me its the funniest 4 am shit ever xD
---
Funny I think it should be built into the game
---
It's a great build when you have gear/for PvP, but Shaman already splits the baby between damage and healing, and a split spec halves the baby again. I personally recommend going deep into a single tree until you are in &gt;50% raid epics.
---
VW bubble has been worth the dps hit on PVP server if I think it's one of those nights, other than that yeah Succ all the way
---
Worked on pirate servers with a budget of a few hundred dollars a month, but i suppose it's acceptable that a small indie company such as activision arent able to pull it off.
---
I thought you only needed 9% hit?

Yeah i dont get it

A hunter tried, but instead of killing him we just kept him CCd with sheeps and mind control so he couldn't res and mess it up lol.

By the time I find out this information I'm certain it will be empty now.

Shadow Unit Frames "SUF" also does this if you want something slightly smaller than the standard unit frames. Takes a little bit to setup but can be significantly smaller if you want more screen stuff. Pretty sure its almost identical to Luna.
---
I have a troll priest and regret not going dwarf.
---
But...alliance is weird. Been playjng horde for so long that the last time I tried playing alliance I kept thinking the alliance characters were the enemy. Then when I'd see a horde character I'd wonder why and how they're killing me.
---
farm 4 manual crowd pummeler per week and your probably fine to main tank with that spec especially on alliance side
---
It worked on private servers with community funded hardware, so it can be done. Oh, and the code is a fork from Legion, so its 2 or 3 years "old" code, which has been worked on for a majority of that time.
---
They simply fucked it up somewhere along the way because worldpvp was dead on retail, and they didnt care enough to fix it in time for classic launch.

I recently got my mage to 60. Wanted to roll try something else out and was torn between leveling a Warlock and Warrior. Started the warrior - got him to about 20. But decided to start on a Warlock. Having a lot more fun. But I think I am realized that I just really prefer caster type characters in RPGs. Just fits my style better. To each their own.
---
It might have been really shitty warriors, but when I pop FAP before they engage, its over for them.

No love for feral, we gotta take leftovers from rogues/warriors, but i get a lot of ‚Äúew this loot sucked‚Äù kind of drops, which i‚Äôm happy to get
---
Did you find someone to take a nerf bullet for?
---
We stack a fury war on the tank in P2, war lowers aggro tank doesn‚Äôt, win win
---
Late nights or early mornings
---
Or just be horde
---
This seems similar to another video posted recently, but it drew a different conclusion; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Gnj4pXymw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Gnj4pXymw)
---
The other video says if 2 people are standing together, the one with the \*lowest\* thread loses all threat. Keeping those two people together at all times means the \*highest\* threat will always remain the highest.
---
This seems far more likely that it been based on the GUID of the player.
---
But the strategy is the same. Have 2 tanks always stand together, and one will keep agro, and one will lose all agro.
---
don't blame the servers, blame the real problem, layering.  layering was the worst decision
---
In my experiece, you can't really use Blood Fury liberally. The 50% healing reduction is often too much of a downside compared to the 50% base AP increase. The stun resistance is nice, and it will definitely help you agains rogues, but War Stomp for the clutch Lesser Healing Wave or earthbind/ghost wolf is really good for overall survivability. 
---
In the end it's mostly about looks. Do you think Taurens are cooler than Orcs? Go for it!
---
To be fair, 5 axe skill points will not matter in PvP and I feel that Blood Fury is not that great for PvP due to the healing reduction. 
---
I'm just kinda wondering if the melee range difference is noticable and worth going for over the Orc racials.
---
In pve I would mostly just DPS in raids and tank dungeons and am not really sure how much I would raid on that character. Mostly just an Alchemy / dungeon alt. I like the looks of both Orc and Tauren so I aint worrying bout that.
---
I remember elevators desynced for the first time for me back in Antorus with the elevator of death
---
almost everything you use from every profession can be paid for, so to me, it comes down to the kind of farming you like/are willing to do, and the things you yourself might spend a lot of gold on. For example, if you plan on doing a bunch of WPVP in phase 2, you might want engineering. Conversely, since you already have skinning, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to go LW since you can just sell your cured rugged hides and turn all the skins into gear that you can disenchant. 
---
Best profession is probably enchanting, but you have to grind the shit out of it and you can't just put your stuff up on the AH, so like, it's kinda actual work, and part of why I don't really fuck with it in my free time.
---
Right.  Fuck all those people who rolled healers and tanks to make your dungeons go easier.  Git gud and stop asking priests and paladins to be non-damage specs.
---
This comment suggested using frost trap, not freezing.
---
I always use burning steppes side. Still the same comment, when alliance control it they don't care and just move on but horde seem to like camping. I think it's play style not faction ratio.
---
Yeah thats my plan now, its so frustrating tho. That is bis until phase 4 lol.. a mage without robe of the archmage..
---
Lies! Custom emotes don't transmit cross-faction
---
Right? I feel you!
---
Oh man, there's a girl I only refer to as wow girl, what a heart breaker.
---
She was leveling at STV
---
No. Its bind on pick up.
---
Golden pearls from big mouth clams. Find a naga. Fuck its face. Get a pearl.
---
What am I supposed to be seeing?
---
And that's a slightly nerfed version with 2.0 talents, I think a lot of people are underestimating the difficulty. I never even got inside of Naxx in vanilla and I played a lot.
---
AQ and Naxx will be fresh and challenging for 80%+ of players
---
Vanilla servers were never able to support even a fraction of those players in wpvp. 10% of those players in SS vs. TM was enough to lag the server out so fucking hard that the whole continent crashed.
---
what? I see rogue v warrior duels where rogue doesn't lose a single hp
---
Holy hell that's a lot of survivability. How do you ever die?
---
How much are those on the AH?
---
Rotgrip Tinkerer Princess in Mara are an average of around 9 gold per clear. Doing 4 runs an hour is easy and you can push a bit faster if you have a second account or somebody willing to reset the instance for you after each clear rather than doing it yourself.
---
ok
---
Well it took me almost 2 months real life time.
---
I had 14 days 13 hours of /played time.
---
And uh. Combo of quests and dungeons until about lv 55. Then I just took breaks and made liberal use of the rested XP feature.
---
300-340
---
Wait, pets lose happiness when dismissed?
---
I hope you‚Äôre running along the edge.
---
At massive scale it really comes down to sappers and mages though
---
This is a blizzard issue. I've read countless stories of people having this problem because, well, I'm one of them. I run every single game with lag except classic. I get constant lag bursts and I can watch missing packets on winMTR. Literally every other game is fine, even those with shit servers.
---
nah, herod is NA. With like easily 200+ people in the city when buff goes out the city just full lags for a bit
---
You would save a lot of gold if you didn‚Äôt go so many crafted items and grinded dungeon items instead. Putting the expensive +hit scope on your bow is really wasteful plus I would suggest carapace spine xbow over the bow you have listed. A bigger issue is that as you get MC epics you can‚Äôt replace your armor because it is all set pieces.
---
If the ratio favors horde it makes sense for Alliance to hit and run instead of camping, because if they camp long enough eventually horde will zerg up and smash them. Better to just spend a little while smashing and then move into an instance or somewhere else than just feed free kills to a bunch of zerging nimwits.
---
Does the Tribute chest in DM:N ever despawn?

I got hit by melee Onyxia in phase 2 how is that even possible? This whole fight is a mess.
---
they should try asking P server Devs for advice üòÇ üòÇüòÇ
---
Balls!
---
I‚Äôm asking questions I don‚Äôt expect reddit to do anything lol. Why do you have to be such an ass about it when this is a forum to ask questions and compare experiences? You can simply just
---
Ignore this if it triggers you so badly. Thanks though
---
The rend fight is totally different. I can confirm from running many UBRS groups on several pservers that the mobs, quantity of them, and damage and frequency of use of abilities is totally different, much easier on classic
---
You need to be 5/5 If you want to be tanking. You're already losing threat from LotP and Natural Weapons. Losing any more is unacceptable imo
---
Wish I could transfer to one
---
Tell me more about your ony attunement that is done in one place...
---
Yeah. :( 
---
Sorry man. Feral just doesn‚Äôt bring a whole lot to the raid without that buff.
---
Yes sounds like we are sharing the same experience. Have you found any solutions or ways to make it bearable? PS what ISP are you with? I was with Telstra NBN (played flawless didn‚Äôt budge 11ms) and now I‚Äôm with Optus.
---
They literally hired Nost devs who shat out a better server with 20k active players with a fraction of the lag that exists in Classic. They're capable.
---
this is the dumbest answer can ever be, you want people to suit your situation? its your problem if you are playing 2-3 ours or whatever, then you are not suitable for gaming at all. and if you still not experiencing the end game content already even with that limited time you just suck big time with this game and the fact that you are terrible doesnt mean the whole content shall be paused for you. entitled kiddo...
---
4 months per phase is what people assumed and expected as it would give us roughly 2 years of classic wow content..
---
They have been rushing everything so far.. Even though I'm already max lvl and raiding ony/mc I still think 3 months is just too short.
---
You also note it if natural weapons, 10% damage (and threat). And omen can proc off swipe and maul meaning if you are attacking every 1.5 sec with pummler that's a free attack (swipe) if you are rage starved. And on mc and 5mans you are not at unlimited rage in good mitigation gear. That's every 15 seconds if you're casting no swipes and every 12 seconds after that. So in a fight with 0 swipes due to rage starving with pummlers that 1000 threat in 0/30/21 over 30 sec with pummlers threat is now baseline 1100, plus 2 free swipes with an average of 2.22 swipes (assuming average of 10% swipe procs ooc) giving you a free bonus of quite a bit more free threat. Now imagine getting a free swipe every 3 swipes (hitting 3 targets) because swipe can proc omen with each Target. That's a lot of free threat. And that's from 1 talent point. NS is really risky as the MT as well. Especially later when you're gonna scale out of the heal.
---
jeez, i wish i could have a cat so bad. this makes me both happy and sad
---
I'll wait for the link talking about how Nost dev's integrated with Battle.net and all the other Blizzard infrastructure. Let's at last compare apples to apples.
---
Thank you. /bow
---
You're an asshole if you roll on someones BiS just because its an upgrade for what you have, that person will be using that gear for months or even years and you will change it for something else in a couple of days.
---
This is true
---
F
---
I've been on both Verizon and Comcast. I haven't found a solution, the only thing I can think of is maybe it's a WiFi issue and the way classic sends information. That send to make no sense though, because I can speed test my phone right next to my PC and get 400 Mbps with no packet loss.
---
Holy shit you're delusional. I've been on Reddit for 10 plus years make two posts and I'm lonely sheltered with no friends? Anymore armchair analysis we can get from ya? Anything? Or you done trying to pretend to be something you're not pal? You're not good. Statistics, and I have both shown you that you're fucking garbage lmao deflect more. Your presence has exhausted my attention. Please, learn how to play the game and then get back to me. Thank you.
---
This was hilarious to read. I'm loving all the pvp complaints from classic.
---
/applaud
---
Found an activision stockholder. The time to sell was after the launch bump. Sorry for your loss.
---
That may actually work, i tried enchanting with a bank char before. Likewise, gave me headaches. Now im just disenchanting and selling the essence. Lw is another case tho, I can even make devilsaur sets with LW and sell it since ill be spending a bit time in un goro collecting herbs. Engineering is way too expensive for me now, only in dreams
---
you seemed like a condescending asshat in most of them so when people get to where you were proven wrong with evidence and you still refused to change your dumb comment, people are gonna be like me and say wow what an asshat
---
Me2. I must now formally apologize to my gf for the near future.

Hey the exact same laptop with what I have! Inspiron 7577
---
Ah yeah and we live in completely different counties with the same issue -_- I‚Äôve bought a power line which basically turns my wifi into an Ethernet connection and it‚Äôs the exact same problem. My last connection was wifi with no issues!! It‚Äôs bloody annoying as I‚Äôm already invested in the game and want to keep playing but now I‚Äôm considering quitting due to unreliable ping.
---
Any chance you bat for both teams?
---
Private servers are a completely different codebase, written from the ground up to emulate WoW over 10 or so years. They've never ever been as close to vanilla wow as classic is.
---
If you ask people who played vanilla what large scale PvP was like, they'll tell you it was a complete shitshow. You can't be #nochanges and #nolag at the same time.
---
I mean. That pretty much is a very vanilla experience. 400 people is alot, every command/positioning has to be sent from your pc to blizzard then to 400 people, every second. 
---
Hillabrad, BlackRock mountain, parts of wpl, all used to be lagfests, rubber bands, disconnects into ques.  Fairly normal in vanilla, I'm guessing that's the part of the experience you chose to forget or never experienced yourself(read as new player).
---
Way too short.  (And I'm also in an ony/mc cleared guild) This schedule only caters to the most uber hardcores.
---
you realize that was 15 years ago...
---
Contact blizzard support and let them know, maybe if enough of us complain they'll do something. Like you said, people in different countries on different isps are having the exact same issue, it has to be on their side
---
Saw It on AH for 125, and someone advertising in trade for 100 today. Rattlegore US
---
Your points would be easier to digest if compressed to a couple sentences.
---
The GUID theory was developed because the lowest-threat idea was only working for certain players.
---
Ah, people finally realizing grizzly are scum. I feel old knowing that from private servers :)
---
The devs' handed over the source code. What advice can the P server devs possible give Blizzard at this point.
---
with vodiwalker : 
---
tank 1 mob with void walker, put all dots on it
---
pull second mob, fear and put all dots
---
ah yes, it's the players' fault, ofc.
---
Use evasion lmao
---
All it is now is a more controlled way of accomplishing the same goal.
---
Brisbane! Hahaha
---
I'm going to reinstall WoW
---
I will light the way
---
He said he asked the guild leader of one of the members, not they were his own guild members.
---
I'd just start looking for a decent guild, this happens sometimes but it's rare.
---
Not really, it'd be a lot better for fury dps, though. You'll typically want something faster for tanking, especially when you're undergeared (missing with a slow 1h = you're mega screwed for threat)
---
There‚Äôs an awful lot of the Enhancement tree that tempts me as a first time Shaman... but I recognize, no taunt, no tank.
---
Ensuring that your MT doesn't lose any threat in phase 2 is not the same thing as having to re-establish threat before DPS can start in phase 3.
---
What spec are you? If you like feral you should drop skinning in favor of enchanting for Smoking heart of the mountain.
---
10 Days? Even with my Pally I managed it in 6 Days.
---
I started as a healer got to 22, my server was full of healers. Rerolled for tank. Didn‚Äôt need a tank in any of the dungeons I have joined until I got to 40 so respeced for dw fury. 
---
And now I can‚Äôt find a healer or tank anytime I wanna dungeon run.
---
You can still tank dungeons as fury spec though.
---
Maybe. Kinda. We don't actually know what hardware they use because Blizzard is a shitty company that only divulges information when they absolutely have to rather than being open and transparent.
---
If I had to guess they almost certainly aren't using the best CPUs that are on the market and they have never made it a top priority to improve large scale event performance from either hardware or software perspective.
---
The fundamental problem with large scale events in one area is that the amount of processing power required on a single thread goes up exponentially when the amount of player activity goes up. This is an issue with all MMOs and cannot be mitigated by high core count CPUs. You can look at the nostalrius report where they outline their hardware and software optimization strategies they applied to try to mitigate the issue.
---
12 mins is sort of the min to do a run anyway, that's as a paladin killing everything without stopping (ret aura, skullflame shield, essence of pure flame, naglering, demonforged breastplate to kill them while im running). Not sure how the other commenter managed to get 5*2g = 15-20g but it's hard to get instance capped, I dont think you can make the runs less than 12 mins if you're killing the last boss as well.
---
Close to 200 runs and neither have dropped
---
Tanks will love you for interrupting mobs with your felhound. Felhound can also dispel magic, which is **really** good for some dungeons (can dispel silences/magic stuns/slows etc.)
---
If you're just sticking with tank and spank trash mobs, imp is fine, the fire shield acts as thorns and will give your tank some extra threat, too.
---
If that was true you would know it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúISCI‚Äù. Your entire comment is incorrect and misleading people who don‚Äôt know better.
---
And you seem like one of those "nice guys" lol
---
You can Google "wow classic lag" and find hundreds of people complaining about the exact same issue.
---
I read somewhere else it was mentioned in a leak on a german site or something but yeah I did not get it nor have heard of others actually getting it. 
---
It'll be free if you buy shadowlands anyway i assume.
---
&gt;WE COULD BE MELTING MOBS TOGETHER, but you want the gear all for yourself..sad.
---
Why is that sad? As soon as I started caring about who I invite to my groups as a Rogue I finished my full pre-bis within like 2 weeks. Before that, I kept losing items to rolls/bad RNG, it's just so easily avoidable (get mage/lock DPS instead of a 2nd rogue) that you have to be dumb to not do it... Well that or you just like running 2x more dungeons, which, good for you, but that ain't for me.
---
having 1/3rd of your stuns resist will be lifesaving.
---
TELL EM TO FUCK OFF
---
unless they're the tank in which case lube up
---
I agree, i had always looked forward to ST while leveling even if it didnt have the best loot for my toon.
---
It‚Äôs pretty much already too late to invest in these now
---
The not challenging makes sense in relation to solo content. But retails challenge is on a whole other level for dungeons and raids. I love Classic and am having a blast playing it again but dungeons and raids (especially raids) are child's play compared to retail.
---
dont feel bad been playing a rogue for 15 years just found out a month ago that it does not need stealth.
---
Rando eastern Europeans operating servers for next to nothing were able to maintain servers that could handles hundreds vs. hundreds, and a game from a multi billion dollar can't. And yet people are defending Blizz's blatant ineptitude?
---
Imagine thinking that putting an ounce of thought into your tinder profile is ‚Äútrying too hard‚Äù and that it‚Äôs a negative thing to be a barista. Quit trying to pick at non existent red flags and take a look at your own. Feel bad for that wife of yours
---
Seriously, like is that comment taking itself seriously?
---
Sure, but the above video explains why that actually works. üòú
---
If something drops and someone can use it effectively as an upgrade, they get to roll.
---
Naxx Halloween 2020
---
Fair enough. I would say those abilities you mentioned are to keep on you not to get on you as they are all fairly short range.
---
I raid as 30/0/21 and it is fantastic for farming or dps dungeons and is a pvp spec (the pvp spec where you can either get EM or NS dpending on preference).
---
I wouldnt raid as dps because shammy healers are always wanted and you can gear your ele set pieces anyway through healing.
---
Respeccing is no issue for me. I disagree with the below, content is not hard there is no need to be a min max resto or ele build at the sacrifice to all else. Also the Elemental raid build should go to resto regardless to get the hit % and crit %.
---
I started a 3v3 skirmish over Khadgar's Whisker. Are you a UD mage on Incendius who once had a battle with a Dwarf pally in Alterac? 2 lower lvls on both sides joined in lol, UD won in the end tho!
---
How do u play at work?...
---
On a laptop
---
40g atm on my server Arugal
---
I &lt;3 my guild ... 11/10 arpee skills
---
&gt; consumebles seems kinda a waste
---
Lol, yeah if you want to be bottom DPS and deserving of a raid bench.
---
When I play PoE I specifically dont use guides and the builds I come up with work fine for up to about level 80-90. Some better than others of course. The problem is that if you want to play to the level of the PoE streamers then you need to invest in insane hours figuring things out or playing with a build guide.
---
According to stats yes. On the ground, my alliance brethren are getting stomped for being far too kind to the degenerate horde. 
---
Fellow ally are shocked when I delete grey level hordes. As if we hadn't gotten camped outside booty bay by ?? mere hours earlier.
---
Sam &amp; Dean were still young
---
Hitting critters with a SWP and watching them run around until their impending doom is up there for me
---
I thought it seemed super weird as well, however it lines up with all the data we have so far. This theory has been alive for barely 30 hours, and we don't consider it tested enough yet. This guy decided to make a video about it now though. 
---
Keep in mind player GUIDS in classic are, for instance, "Player-4465-0083C836" so fairly short. 
---
But it's essentially the only thing we've found so far that seems to be true for all successful and unsuccessful tank stacks. That being that on successful stacks the soaker had a lower GUID and on unsuccessful stacks the tank had the lower one.
---
Nice. Nice.
---
Earth shock causes a high amount of threat, basically a ranged taunt.
---
31 silver and change, you cheap hoor?
---
Combine it with Enchanting and you can turn excess cloth into enchanting mats.
---
Yeah.. this seems to be lost an illicits the cries of "can't believe you rolled on MY bis"
---
Like they owned it from the moment it dropped.
---
It's a newbie protection thing. If you're in friendly territory (green zone name, &lt;20 levelling zones) you have to opt in to PvP. Enemies will always be flagged to you in these zones though.
---
As a warrior, I love mages, and want more actually. Why? Because they don't roll on any of my gear.
---
Yeah, just grab a shield if it gets hairy.
---
I'm a first time wow player seeing so many things that shot up in price because of updates that I just have no clue what comes with them (such as Oily Blackmouths for phase 2). Do you know if there's any detailed lists of that comes in each phase? For example when I look at phase 2 for Wowhead, it says PvP honor is coming but nothing about Free Action Potions. How did people know those would be coming phase 2?
---
You know... i curse about it, because it takes away a lot, but in the end: i am happy that my new server for my second 60 is a PVE server xD 
---
A lot of fuckery is not to be had on a PVE realm... devilsaur mafia for example
---
H...hey kid, wanna dupe that Sara armor set? Just come upstairs and I'll tell to how
---
Ok so drop it, and press alt+f4, as quickly as possible wait 5 minutes then come back on, and you'll have one in your inv and the other equipped
---
Not that the waiting even mattered back in the dial up days, it would be a fucking miracle to be back on in under 3 minutes
---
Light's hope held ~20-30k people on it.
---
Please tell me how blizzard can't do better than that.
---
The ones who literally BUILT the game, not trying to reverse engineer the server code and duck tape it together.
---
Yeah spending 1 million dollars, to please their new customers and deliver on a core part of their promised product that they're now earning 720m+ a year for would be ridiculous. 
---
Fuuuuck off. Blizz not fixing this shit should make every sub for classic eligible for a straight up refund. Only way to prevent these corporate lunatics with purely short term profits in their minds.
---
That‚Äôs what I have seen to be the case tbh. Alliance will try and take it over just never lasts too long. I‚Äôve had so many lbrs runs cancel because of the camping
---
Rabble rabble phase 2 roaming bands rabble rabble
---
Enh tanking is perfectly fine up through BRD, given that fights are usually very short. You're gonna spend 50% of the dungeon drinking, and you better have a mage, but spamming Earth Shock can hold pretty effective aggro on 2-3 targets.
---
The guilds who are going to rip through it in a week, have been doing it and practicing it for literally YEARS at this point.
---
Way back then, there was no knowledge going in, didn't know what we should have prepared for. Now we do.
---
Yes there's going to be a large part of the playerbase who still WON'T see the inside. But it will be more than it was back then at least.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt know any other game that even comes close to that.
---
I can name one off the top of my head actually.  Vanilla wow private servers do this.  Usually after launch there is a couple of weeks of instability but they get to a point where they can handle these massive battles with no throttling like we're seeing here.
---
Prot is a free kill, so yep.
---
Anyone who cares about ranking might be killing low lvl people so imo it will be sigificant.
---
[Follow this talent tree](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230005011--20350233132301301) and give preference to all frost talents before arcane ([example for lvl 20](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/--2032003001), finish imp blizzard first).
---
Just hit frostbolt at target when you're with friend, have void out to tank, then nova if mobs get close &amp; run away (or blink) if you need.
---
OK, some background.
---
I was at B-R and UALX.
---
I can tell you *absolutely* if the servers are OK at 100 but fall over at 200, players will bring 200.
---
And if the servers are OK at 200 but fall over at 400, players will bring 400.
---
And if the servers are OK at 1000 but fall over at 2000, players will bring 2000.
---
There. Is. No. Solution.
---
You should be fine for the most part. There might be a bit more corpse walking here and there but the main issue is for 48+ zones
---
That sounds correct but considering the fireball mechanic is based off of threat, we know the aggro table is used for determining who gets hit next by the fireball. The issue that causes all the problems is that it doesn‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd expect it to when multiple people get hit. If a single person gets hit that is highest on threat, their threat gets wiped and she picks the next person in the list, but if multiple people get hit, something weird happens. That‚Äôs what people are trying to figure out. 
---
If the reference list like you say is of all people that engaged her and it‚Äôs sorted by the GUID, which is kinda weird but okay, and when multiple people get hit, it does some kind of reference against that list and takes the first person it finds in the list to drop aggro then it makes sense because the person getting hit would never be first and never have their aggro dropped. Super convoluted but I see the point.
---
I need to get in on more of these RP LFGs! :D
---
RNG
---
That's a trip
---
&gt; Not sure why you have so much pent up passive aggressiveness.
---
Twinkers love to try to project their problems on to their critics, instead of honestly self-evaluating themselves.  "It's not that people are quite rightly judging me to be a dick and a loser who enjoys spoiling the game for others... it must be that they have 'pent up passive aggressiveness'".
---
Please note that there is nothing in any way passive about my thinking twinkers suck, both as players and human beings. I am actively calling you out for being a trash person and a trash player if you are a twinker. 
---
There are a myriad of great, fair PvP games in the world and if you choose to dedicate hundreds of gold and dozens of hours to rigging 10-19 battlegrounds in WoW in your favour then you are a terrible gamer. You're like someone who refuses to play Magic: the Gathering unless they are crushing schoolkids using a $600 meta deck. You are bad *for* the hobby and you are bad *at* the hobby. And just because nothing in the rules stops you from being bad for the hobby or from being bad at the hobby doesn't mean you should not be judged for it.
---
&gt; If you don't participate, why do you care what other people do with their time in game?
---
A stock argument from bullies. "If I'm not hurting you, why do you care if I hurt someone else?". It is because unlike bullies we are capable of empathy and big picture thinking. We realise that even if hurting other people feels good to us, maybe we still should not do it.
---
&gt; It may not be 100% the fastest leveling, but I'll be damned if it isn't the most fun I've ever had in this game.
---
This is all that matters.
---
Just go farm ZF once you hit 48-50. It's perfectly doable solo and will earn you nice gold as well.
---
Then move over to BRD at 54 with either a key or seaforium charges.
---
Yeah that does sounds pretty solid. My biggest concern would be the druids lack of panic buttons in terms of instant heals/protection, Ala BoP or pw:s. I guess if you go resto you can pick up nature's swiftness and swiftmend, but I'd still be pretty concerned about effectively keeping the mage alive. Even just a lack of fast, low mana, low impact heals sounds terrifying. Certainly single target is easy, but that could be said about pretty much any class. Is hurricane really so powerful?

If private servers were able to do it easily then it's not insane

This shit works.  MAcros and everything.
---
/gquit is the command to leave the guild. Having a guild members name after that is irrelevant because it's a command that can only affect you. The person who told him that was also the person whom he asked, so he whole-hearted-ly believed that would do it
---
I could see calling it a gear reset, but either way, however you want to view it, I don't like it. I agree on how it makes stuff feel more worthless. I also think it makes items more forgettable due to their shorter cycle time. Post WotLK they are practically no memorable items to me, where as I have a ton of items that are quite memorable from Vanilla, TBC and WotLK. There are probably other factors that play a part in that but I think the 6 month gear reset definitely plays a factor.

Is there a website or something to use to search for mobs to slay. Like humanoid, low health, low armour, level range kind of stuff
---
Sick dude
---
&gt;but I recognize, no taunt, no tank.
---
Paladins don't have a taunt either
---
Did you? Maybe what I read was incorrect, but I‚Äôve only used Petopia and also saw them tweet about testing different wind serpents.
---
I‚Äôm starting to see how it would be possible although very weird. It‚Äôs like a LINQ first query, where it takes the first object in the list that satisfies the parameters. So for example, when it hits two targets, it has to decide which to drop threat on, and if the main target is second in the list due to the list being sorted by GUID they would never have their threat dropped since it would always return the soaker as the player to drop threat on. So it‚Äôs not actually comparing GUIDs it‚Äôs just referencing a list of players that were sorted by GUID which makes a lot more sense and is definitely plausible. 
---
Eg. List is the two players [guid1, guid2], tank taking fireballs is highest on threat is guid2. Guid1 is the soaker. When it decides to drop threat it says give me the first object where Id is equal to either guid1 or guid2, and it always returns guid1, so the tank taking fireball never has his threat reduced.
---
var targetToDropThreat = sortedListByGuid.First(c =&gt; c.id == guid1 || c.id == guid2); 
---
That always returns the soakers character so the tank taking fireballs never has his threat reduced.
---
I would just like to point out that technically this isn't even the developers own game, it's more like a remaster
---
When Ony casts a fireball it probably has to reference the list to identify who got hit, to later process who takes damage. It could be something as simple as the coder assuming whoever is first in that list was the initial target, but instead it just did a scan from top to bottom with all the identifiers.
---
Yessss I loved this quest! When I did it with my pally in combo with another quest (duskwood wargen quest maybe) and I was like hooooly shit theyre connected!
---
just confirmed, i am on the croupled note, and just found it on a drop!
---
Invest in stonks. Though with only one week to go it's probably a little late to stock up on pvp consumables as the prices are already sky high.

Yeah I‚Äôm starting to see it now. Seems super badly coded. Oh well.
---
Back in BC I had mainhand Glaive drop on my guild‚Äôs first Illidan kill and offhand drop on the second. Must have used up a big chunk of my lifetime portion of luck, right there.
---
You mean the breastplate? You'll probably spend more time farming strat UD than collecting the rest of the mats.
---
Blizz allows it because it makes them more money and because of the price it's not common amd therefore not disruptive.
---
I bet if a pserver allowed multiboxing though things would very quickly fall apart.
---
Stop complaining about things about other people complaining
---
See this is why warriors kill you, you think that because they have *one* ability that's triggered by a dodge that evasion isn't useful. If you're dumb enough to pop it on low health then sure, that's a problem.. use it early and guess what? They get to hit you three times in 15 seconds total while you kill them, giving you time to lock them down and out of the fight. Not to mention they have to swing, wait for the dodge and *then* Overpower... that gives you time to do something to stop them. Killing warriors is a marathon, not a sprint.
---
Plus a decently geared rogue is going to have a high enough dodge chance that overpower is going to light the fuck up within a few seconds of combat no matter what you do, so denying them everything else is a huge advantage. I already have over 22% chance to dodge unbuffed in my *PvE* gear.
---
I'll admit against a very well geared 2H warrior with improved OP it's a dice roll... buuuut that same warrior landing any other attack is going to cause you just as many problems and as previously mentioned it's extremely likely that they'll be able to use it on you no matter what you do. So against a 2H it's a calculated risk and against a duel wielder it's a no brainer.
---
But you do you I guess. Worked for me in vanilla, works for me now.
---
Nugenergy for sure. Something to help track enemy debuffs and cast bars like Neat Plates. A threat meter, i know its not UI but you should use one.
---
I've completely stopped playing because it's impossible to pug as a rogue.
---
Unfortunately, this isn't really helpful as the reports I'm pulling up either are not extremely recent or are not in such specific frequency as to illustrate a clear pattern. I'm not saying there isn't something going on, but we're not currently tracking any specific issue is all. In order for a situation like this to be identified, we have to start collecting diagnostic information which can either help us identify the external source, or indicate that the issue is not originating from the network outside of Blizzard.
---
This is definitely #nochanges tho.

31/0/20 shaman here. I have tons of fun playing the class, excellent versatility as stated above. On trash in raids im usually top 3 on the dps charts. Boss fights are tougher due to our inbuilt mana issues, but consumables help. Currently 7 weeks into raiding MC+ONY, theres not a whole bunch of loot options. Our tier sets are resto focused except for rag pants so we end up competing with other casters on staff of dominance, mana igniting cord etc

if the void can't hold aggro then she should switch to succubus. its the best pet. so she may as well be dealing more damage with it than using void
---
This is true but it‚Äôs not a taunt, it will never guarantee aggro, but in most cases you‚Äôll win it.
---
Orc. The stun resist is bis for pvp.

Idk where you get your logic from that you keep your rage swapping stances without tactical mastery

My experience as a Paladin main has shown me that I can wingman with the best of them.

I can buff, heal, do solid damage and enhance my experience as well as others.

Mind boggling that people don't understand the problem. Blizzard has stated it over and over and over and over. I hope you're actually trying to be dense and it's not a natural state.

Holy shit. Makes me feel lame for thinking how much org is popping off on my low pop server haha. Like 100 people running around
---
Two points.
---
First, I agree. Most players ARENT trying to get 60. Most already hit sixty weeks ago. 
---
Second, how and why the fuck are there so many 60s already with full prebis/partial raid gear when 90% of them are married, with kids, etc? It‚Äôs insanity
---
I recommend walking around the sides of one of those Giants instead of going between them, on the pair right before princess. You get a ton more room. 
---
Too many times I've sneezed and pathed into a Giant..
---
Absolutely, I don't think people appreciate that the 1-60 grind is nothing. 
---
MC is a babystep.
---
AQ / Naxx.... whole 'nother level.
---
If your healing is good and you havent had a problem then the choice is yours. I would recommend going into Prot if you want to be the best support and ret if you want to have some self sustaining melee.

"my" GUID idea isn't even 2 days old yet and we've had the first tests of this coming in during the last few hours. Sure, it seems to be working pretty well as of now, but everything works well until it doesn't work at all.

Way too early to post this (which you would have known if you had reached out to either of us before posting or making this video). Thanks for crediting us though, however Cannon really deserves the lion share of it. 
---
Also what is the first rule of fight club?
---
rip your inbox
---
It‚Äôs hit or miss.  They get a lot of ‚Äúhi I want to make gold‚Äù posts everyday and it‚Äôs annoying.
---
Asking questions and putting any initiative into the goblin game helps.
---
It‚Äôs like people walking into investing and asking for ez money stock tips.  
---
So not welcoming for the lazy.
---
My comment was responding to "why doesn't Blizzard talk to P server devs". That's why, what do you man so what?
---
Yeah and the real exodus is still ahead of us. Just keep in mind that the only large content that will be added in later phases is new raids. Raids are rather easy and very grindy, because getting your gear can take very long. That will lead to burn outs on people and people getting the feeling that they have finished the game because there isn't much to do besides raid-logging. The game will inevitably lose players and a high number of dead servers would only accelerate that.
---
Sure, you can always make more alts to get more goals but it's unlikely that the majority of players will enjoy that for long without any shortcuts.
---
I dont like the layering but I think it is a sensible compromise.
---
Suck it up and find a new guild
---
Jamie look that shit up!
---
It's 2% per hit, every hit. I don't think there is a hidden catch up mechanic where at 2% if you mine 49 veins you get a guaranteed crystal at the 50th. 
---
So basically he can either get 3 crystals in a row or none for 10000 veins.
---
No. It's not OK.
---
i absolutely refuse to use the twitch app, so i found this one project that someone made that works really well  
---
https://github.com/erikabp123/ClassicAddonManager
---
Well why not? Meh dont worry. I am sure they will fix the lag soon. Then give you lfg, then some welfare epics and soon after a lfr too
---
It's a component
---
They only want your attention when you don't wan theirs
---
Yeah, being able to tank or heal in dungeons makes finding groups a breeze!
---
Is there an addon that lets you make custom markers on your map?
---
Yea I mean the fact that so many people are saying this is too fast means that there will be plenty of us around to raid MC once all the current 60s have moved on ha.
---
Kind of similar to how a mythic+ tourney team discovered that the team members were being targeted for abilities based on the order that they copied they characters to the tournament realm.
---
then they would be doing that already
---
Just don't die to mobs.
---
TomTom I believe does this
---
Somehow these seems to be the same amount of people able to devote 40+ hours a week to wow as there was at release. Kids in school during vanilla release, I can see. But those same kids are full grown adults now and are still able to devote 40+ hours a week to a 15 year old game? That‚Äôs really sad.
---
very new and original content
---
RSC and classic wow are my 2 favorite games. Tons of my old rs friends played wow when it came out. You‚Äôre likely to enjoy it. Read about *how* the classes work, not what people say about them. Then pick the class play-style that you want to play. Don‚Äôt pick a class because people need healers or because ‚Äúx‚Äù is the best for pvp, pick what your heart tells you. All the classes are great and if you get bored around level 30 just try a new one. Have fun

We couldn't find a group for SFK for the pally quest, so we went and duo'd it at 26. Easily got to the stables, then went on to kill the butcher, baron, and Commander, picking up the cleaver, ring, and shield in the process :)
---
How come... here there are like at least 2 girls that like that wow... and yet my whole life I've struggled to find even one of ya'll and have happily settled for someone who never even plays games... should've just chucked a post up on r/wow to try my luck first I guess haha.
---
Using Kings on the group while RF is up is basically an AoE taunt.
---
The same could be said for any number of professional  (or otherwise) athletes. (Would you say Arnold Schwarzenegger ruined his body with roids?)
---
Look at combat athletes, be it MMA/Boxing/etc. They intentionally punish and damage not only their bodies but their mental faculties (through CTE) to gain a degree of renown.
---
One of these can be a role model while the other "fucking ruined his body with roids"? Doesn't really add up for me.
---
shit any rogue with thrash blade and mirahs song should outdps you...those are quest items too.
---
Due to cross realm battlegrounds, there is absolutely zero benefit to being on the smaller side for faction balance. Accurate data would give people the information they need to pick good realms for themselves. Which would further cause realm imbalance to worsen.
---
The rest of the data you are interested in basically no company provides publicly.
---
Lol sorry I've never used tinder I'm not a loser.  It's adorable watching you aggressively defend a tinder profile though I bet you're such a nice guy you're gonna get so many women oh yeah
---
I have a quite large monitor, didnt even think of it lol
---
Yeah, it really makes everything easier. I play a druid tank as my main when we aren't playing, and I love having pallies. Salv makes it so no one ever pulls aggro off me. It's awesome.
---
I don't think any of the people who originally developed WoW are involved with the current server infrastructure or whatever is causing the lag.
---
What you say is often true of smaller games and while I'm sure there are people at Blizzard somewhere who are passionate about Classic WoW, but I'd bet the majority of coders or admins don't actually give a fuck. 
---
They were just told to make the new engine work with some of this old stuff and they did. It doesn't always work great, but it's probably a legitimately complicated issue and they're not getting paid overtime to fix it.
---
People complain about it on retail. But it is a much smaller problem. Because retail doesn't really care about the MMO aspect anymore. Retail WoW is more like an open world dungeon crawler the style of Dark Souls mixed with Soul Worker. You find yourself together in groups for actual content and you can sometimes see someone else in the world.
---
Oh, thanks for this!
---
I‚Äôm with you, that‚Äôs my plan, but disagree about least common denominator ha. Just look at all these threads and the upvotes, thousands of people are frustrated cause they aren‚Äôt 60 yet. I think it‚Äôs a 50/50 split, at least in my server
---
Lol and the guy acts all proud of him: ‚Äúlook at his video game accomplishments in the face of real life responsibilities!‚Äù

Wow cool dude, super impressed by a grown adult with a job, wife, and kids devoting (probably) a huge majority of his free time playing a video game. A+ üëç

On retail they can use it to dynamically add and remove layers to each zone. Instead of having 4 layers for the server, you now get 7 layers in Stormwind and 1 Layer in the Barrens.
---
He was asking for 50g, but then got snotty when I told him no.
---
Hardcore players downed rag week 1-2. It‚Äôs week, what? 9 or 10 now?
---
You‚Äôre stretching ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù to anyone who plays more than you. Typical, but flawed 
---
Plenty of people with families and full time jobs in my guild have been raiding for weeks. 
---
The difference is intent, and game knowledge. Their intent is to level quickly and they have done the research to do that. They log in and level, while the slower/less educated crowd log in, spend 45min looking for a dungeon to get 14k exp/hour for 2 hours, take inefficient questing routes, fuck around with PvP/professions, etc. 
---
Even though it‚Äôs a low bar, leveling is a skill. If you‚Äôre bad at it you‚Äôll be slow. There‚Äôs really no excuse to be both a) not 60, and b) complaining about them rushing content. Anyone not 60 atm is hyper-casual or not focused on leveling. This game isn‚Äôt catering to those people
---
Potions and food. Also repairs
---
That happened in original as well. I remember this happening back in BC or WOTLK.
---
Duuuuuude. Wand in between abilities, please &lt;3
---
This picture is taken right before raid time as many guilds have stacked to get Ony buff together. I play on the server and it's not in any way this cramped for most of the evening, just the 30 mins to an hour or so before the Ony buff is planted.
---
As a common courtesy it‚Äôs kind of an unspoken rule for healers to give dps first dibs on + spell damage gear.  
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter what fucked up justification you have because I have seen plenty of healers apply that common courtesy in dungeons. 
---
If you want to be a douche and roll on it go ahead.
---
Huh? Did I miss something? Phase 2 rolls out in a week, not tomorrow.
---
But can you make 55 water? That's all the other classes care about ;)
---
Theres far far far too many healers to ask for 50g.
---
If you tell me your faction/server/name/class I'll make it as bad for you as you like :)
---
Self promoting your twitch will not definitely not help you grow
---
I've done both specs now and the guilds at the point we clear MC in under 2 hours.
---
The breakdown as many others have mentioned:
---
If you plan on tanking it's better just to go full tank. 5 mans are much smoother with omen, raidings smoother as you have higher aggro plus you can throw on pummlers and maintank stuff. The truth is you jumping to healing gear for certain bosses as HOTW/NS is going to make fuck all difference if the other healers had everything covered when you had to tank anyway. LoTP also increases raid damage and more importantly tank aggro.
---
PvP as feral or tank spec though just sucks. You're a druid, you don't want to oom after a few shapeshifts and the stuff you can do with a proper mana pool and insect swarm vastly outshines anything full feral can muster. You might have some reasonable success stacking certain items (bg gear with pretty much every stat on them plus a number of dungeon blues like wildheart legs) etc but then you're using worse gear than just the full int stuff from MC.
---
HOTW/NS is a good PvP spec, a mediocre healing spec and a very mediocre tanking spec.
---
My plan is simply to respec a bunch of times. World pvp is a shitfest which relies more on numbers than anything else so i very much doubt i'll be switching specs solely to run around for hours looking for a 1vs1 that doesn't get interrupted by others, nor do i think it's worth the time. As a druid in MASS pvp battles moonglow is going to be hands down better than anything which requires you to get close to things. When bg's hit is the time i'll actually care and spec solely for them, but at least at that point you won't be pestered to tank stuff continuously and you'll have something you can solely focus on for a few days between respecs.
---
So let‚Äôs talk about the pants OP was referring to that drop of omokk.   Do you think it would be fair for a pally to need on the plus spell damage pants when the same boss drops leather healing pants that would be much better for the paladin?
---
&gt; I'm hoping they'll add in the exp lock (that they did in wrath?) and give twinks their own bracket. Then every complaint you have about twinks ruining low level pvp doesn't really exist. Of course people can still leave the lock off and try to ruin BGs, but at least we can know which twinks are doing it to be dicks.
---
This is absolutely the very best solution. Add a small amount of xp to battlegrounds, offer an xp lock so twinks can have their own bracket, and the problem solves itself.
---
But we both know that the twinkers will howl and whine and cry the roof down using every excuse under the sun to avoid that outcome. Because that would stop them griefing levellers, which is the one thing they really want to do if they were honest.
---
 Nothing pisses me off more than a bear parrying my axe. How tf did it parry me...
---
Show me some numbers then? You‚Äôre making the claims - back them up
---
I guess you missed the "new player" part. Your knowledge of the game does not apply to new players.
---
Last night on Kromcrush Stormwind was completely packed waiting for the ony buff.  
---
you think you do...
---
Oh awesome, and my shit has been downvoted. That really tells me what this sub is doing now... neat.
---
Remember that Ony was rereleased. It's possible we're fighting that version of the encounter, as far as coding goes.
---
When healing as pally are you supposed to be in the thick of it meleeing until you need to take a step back and heal? Or is it more like a scuffed priest?
---
Almost definitely hunting followers. This guy gets it.
---
Yeah the other guy I think is basing all his experiences off vanilla. It's changed since then. Back in vanilla we chewed rogues up, but they weren't smart then. They didn't realize how to use bleeds and just let us slowly die. Instead they'd attempt to face tank us.
---

Healers are not in demand, if anything it's easier to find a healer than a DPS in classic, and they don't even have to be particularly good either, which is really a shame coming from Retail M+.

Myspace reached its zenith in 2008, which is about when this screenshot was taken.

---
Change the keyboard mapping on the secondary to have a keystroke of 1+^+ALT or something like that, something that won‚Äôt happen in passing on your other keyboard.
---
Then when you bind the hot key and press the 1 on the alternate keypad it will show 1^ALT and you‚Äôll be good to go.
---
A warrior is pretty much guaranteed to auto right after an intercept, you cant parry or dodge while stunned.
---
I used to use that effect to guarantee key moves like disarms landed too.
---
Yah thats kinda the opposite emotion that should be running through you lol.
---
Perditions blade and core hound tooth are very viable. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going daggers without them.
---
Except it's not 40 man raid per phase and BWL is probably coming out sometime next year, making MC's era well over 3 months. The only back to back phases with a 40 man are AQ and Naxx and there is absolutely no way they're separated by just 3 months.
---
Dots don‚Äôt generate much threat, it‚Äôs the Ruin SB crits you have to watch out for
---
Warlocks pull a lot of threat, and you have no threat drop ability, so you need to be mindful of how tank threat works. They can‚Äôt get snap aggro like in retail and decimate in threat. That being said.. I was not in your run and don‚Äôt know how your tanks threat was.
---
TLDR- give the tank a few seconds on pulls before you even start damaging at all.
---
From what I understand, they are currently quite a bit below combat spec in terms of DPS, but will become more viable in later phases when you can get enough crit to make the seal fate build viable. However, I think combat spec will ALWAYS be better DPS than any dagger spec with equivalent gear through the entirety of classic. 
---
Basically, daggers will never be best, but having said that, play what you enjoy; the content isn't hard, so a dagger build will work if you want it to.
---
It seems like there is, but they're not the same as they were in Vanilla. I tamed two windserpents of the same level, and the stats are identical *except* for damage:

#nochanges
---
If your entire group consists of one class
---
Absolutely, this is actually one of the fights in Naxx. Its teetering on outputting as much controlled damage and meeting the threat threshold while giving your tanks hope to maintain aggro and not wipe the raid - at least if your MT is a warrior. Druids for instance do not have similar problems with maintaining threat on single or multiple targets, but do not have similar mitigations as warriors when it comes to theoughput healing.
---
Yeah those items shot up in price not because they are for new items but because those items will have bigger demand.  
---
It‚Äôs all about foresight, check future plans and see which items/mats would be most desired as that‚Äôs what is going to go up in price. People don‚Äôt need FAP for regular content but it comes dam handy in PvP and when you have PvP rewards you have demand for those potions; which means you have demand for materials they come from.
---
People say this like on Skeram, were the Horde have a large population. But we still get giant battles so i dunno....
---
If tanks usually hold threat from you, maybe that tank wasn't as good as the ones you usually run with. 
---
However... If he can't hold threat and you pulling aggro cause dangerous situations, then you obviously need to improvise and adapt:)
---
Maybe if you used the succu to CC, and other useful utility stuff before starting your DPS, it could give the tank a headstart:)
---
Maybe  
---
Maybe not  
---
But Im liking it...
---
Don't worry, once you hit 60 you'll be making more gold than every other class easily.
---
Trust me, as a tank warrior I invite rogues, just on my server, there are so many rogues, usually 4 writes in the same time, I have to say to some of them that no more melee.
---
That has nothing to do with the tech world being more or less inclusive than x amount of years ago. Programming is as hard and easy it was decades ago. Engineering is just as easy and hard it was decades ago. 
---
The tech world is just as inclusive as it was decades ago.
---
Hey another question about this. 
---
Is it the same build as the 31/20/0 spec here: [https://classic.wowhead.com/paladin-healing-beginners-guide-classic-wow#blessing-of-sanctuary-30-21-0](https://classic.wowhead.com/paladin-healing-beginners-guide-classic-wow#blessing-of-sanctuary-30-21-0) ? Or do you get improved righteous fury, redoubt, and shield spec?   
---
(Ideally, I'd love to see what your build looks like since it really seems like there's so many different ways you could build it). 
---
I'm making the switch to 31/20/0 tomorrow and want to make sure I'm not putting my talents in the wrong places.
---
I'd still go with Orc.
---
Charge stun, Hammer of Justice, Bash (Bear form), Impact (mage talent, probably not taken much)
---
My two cents.
---
It's from WOTLK. The DK starting zone involves killing Patchwerk
---
Always. Your pets tankyness is your bread and butter. Skip your own skills over the pet‚Äôs.
---
yea but if you are tanking, you gotta deal with the (\*\*not smart\*\*) dps who can't even spell threat, let alone explain how it works.

What‚Äôs some good stuff I could be doing to make gold as a mage? I‚Äôm winter‚Äôs chill spec for raiding but wouldn‚Äôt mind respeccing if i can make enough gold to make it worth it to respec back next week for raid. I‚Äôm not incredible at AoEing but I could try. Don‚Äôt have epic mount yet so I don‚Äôt think I could solo farm ZF gy, but I feel like most places I go to farm are so packed lately so looking to hear some suggestions.
---
What the hell, how big paycheck you got? Must cost alot xD
---
When BGs come out it won't matter
---
Man. I'd love to see how the setup has changed over the years from the eq days. 
---
Stuff like this is like nerd porn to me.
---
Kitty wants you to switch to Alliance :)
---
Yeah I'd say you've just gotta slow it down a bit. If the tank is crappy just slow down Ur Dps. Let him get some agro. At the end of the day if you don't it will just cause more issues.
---
I'm actually a tank, would weak auras still work if I wasn't the one that casted it?
---
My goal is to run my own raid, yes. I have the very ambitious long-term goal of clearing all 40 man raids in the game on my own. As for effectiveness, it's obviously never going to be as effective as if every player was piloting a single character. The main reason for this is that all my DPS rotations are based on macros made with the GSE 2 addon. These rotations can't possibly result in an optimal DPS output, but you can get somewhat close with a lot of tweaking and testing.
---
no way dude! Its just too hilarious that you've made her keep it up on you all the time, haha :D
---
Fascinating, would love to see more on it. I‚Äôll keep an eye on the sub.
---
You will notice where he foreheads himself at how bad these servers are.
---
Oddly enough, badlands is where I hit my wall too and rolled PvE.
---
I battled through STV, holding my own often against players up to 5 levels higher but still had 60s griefing but its STV so whatever. 
---
Then in badlands, a random lock and I got ganked by a rogue 6 levels higher so we joined up and kept fighting off the rogue until the rogue gave up... we thought.  About the time the rogue gave up literally a group of 4 60s and a 42 rolled through and wiped us out at which point the 47 rogue from earlier joined in.
---
So we finish our quest and head to town where I shit you not we get ambushed by a group of 3 60s hiding behind a hill near our path.
---
I've played since vanilla and was on nothing but pvp servers for my entire wow career and classic pvp servers are just so aweful.  Vanilla had a ton of pvp but there was an air of respect, classic is just pure griefing and wannabe twitch streamers.
---
Vanilla never performed well under those circumstances, Classic at least has improved despite #nochanges
---
F in chat for the 3 rogues who risked everything.
---
Teleport stonard was always my favorite because it's fucking stonard
---
Mine do this as well and all of them were properly weaned, they just enjoy rubbing their faces on beards I guess.
---
Of course an allience person would be a car salesman
---
Also at least from what I have experienced Mass world pvp battles don't work great for melee classes.  They tend to die before they get in range to actually get a hit off.
---
This is like asking people not to gank you while running through BRM. As a fellow Mage, I say suck it up and stop making us all look like babies.
---
Bubble means I can always zone in.
---
I‚Äôd be careful with what your looking for, that could very easily get flagged as botting.
---
Vanilla was worse. If the nochanges ppl accept that, fine. Otherwise, they are all hypocrites
---
Raid instances Can easily run on a different hardware than the openworld to free some resources.
---
Nice! Alliance side too? Did you reach the same point, roughly?
---
sorry, what you‚Äôre looking for is a macro bot. which is against the rules.
---
One of my Guildmates is the same. He got this WC quest staff which is OP, for his druid. And then enchanted Crusader on it.
---
Me and my wife sometimes have nerf fights. Tje one who loses cooks that day.
---
What's really interesting is that Orcs are an intelligent species. They even use tools! I think, uh, well whoever the fuck studies Orcs have officially concluded that Orcs officially entered the stone age. So they are using tools without being taught so by other Orcs, and they are using tools constantly and for different stuff.
---
Whatever Jamie pull up the video where the crow is getting two cats to fight.
---
Oof
---
Thank you! I've checked through and didn't find anything I needed for Classic (though it does exist for retail:  [https://wago.io/irhGa5o\_Q](https://wago.io/irhGa5o_Q)). I've no experience working on this kind of code, but will do my best to find a way to modify it for Classic. If you have tips on a useful website for that, feel free to share before I Google myself into oblivion :-)
---
Ill do this if someone is pulling all the mobs i am trying to gather shards from.   Dont be greedy and people wont be assholes to you.
---
Question abt BIS lists: are they up for debate? I‚Äôm a healing priest and wowhead recommends stuff like Elder Wizards Mantle over Kentic Amice,  and Crown of the Ogre king instead of something like Dreamweave circlet, which seems better to me. So are those lists accurate? I also had a bis tracker add on which seemed even more random.
---
Work is work and game is game. Some of us like to keep those things separate. We don‚Äôt want to hear ‚Äúok so you finished that raid 30 minutes ahead of time so can you please get that report to me asap please?‚Äù
---
Farm the dogs and 1st boss of DMN you jump up on the railing AOE them all and once they get up to you jump down and let them get close then jump back up. You can infinitely keep them running so it dissent even matter on gear. AOE slowing is amazing for it but back in the day I even did this as a test just dotting them all as a warlock and I eventually killed em all. Helps get the sublime wrist guards too if you don‚Äôt have your pre bis on wrist
---
Phase 2? This looks unplayable now.
---
Wow, would love to hear more about this. Do you have a youtube chanel or something like this, where you keep track of your progress?
---
I have no clue how to bind a keyboards buttons to other buttons.
---
Same here. Thought it was just me..
---
TLDR: Give tank sufficient time to generate aggro. Usually takes a good few seconds for a tank to even build rage and then start to cycle sunders, etc. If you‚Äôre DPSing within the first 10 seconds that a tank pulls, yes you‚Äôre doing it wrong. Tank threat is different and harder to gain in classic
---
It is a lot easier than it was before, because now the ISBoxer software does all the heavy lifting for you. We have their amazing devs to thank for this.
---
Haha, it's just simple math though. You know, the math that the odds of getting a healer that doesn't charge 50g is pretty good.
---
don‚Äôt think so, i‚Äôm not entirely sure how the game‚Äôs code is set up but i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to track cc other people have cast outside nameplate icons
---
This isn‚Äôt retail, there isn‚Äôt a oh I can just taunt and everything is on me again button. 
---
Warlocks unlike every other dps class have nothing they can do at all to reduce threat through skills or talents. 
---
They are threat bombs just ticking and waiting to explode.
---
Don't sell yourself short man there's at least 3 or 4 better reasons for you to give the ol' reaper a ring.
---
Enhance tank is fun until about SM Cath. Up to that though, you can tank no problem. Rockbiter and earth shock generate a lot of threat and you can be your own emergency healer if your dungeon run isn‚Äôt going great.
---
You should learn to read.  Not another faction. Not pvp. I‚Äôd be able to sheep him and kill him myself if it was pvp. Or log onto my main if it was pvp. 
---
Being killed by your own faction is not pvp.
---
how can the addon  TradeStone get away with that then?
---
 [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tradestone](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tradestone)
---
Yea I'm pretty sure its a meme at this point. When ever i see a warrior that says they don't tank 5mans because their not prot or geared I just assume they are being lazy and don't want to learn how to play their class.
---
&gt; There plenty of ways a bug or simply unspecified behavior could result in the lowest ID being usually or always chosen.  The most straightforward is they just end up with an array that happens to be ordered by ID and they just take the first element (either on purpose or due to a bug in their selection process). Maybe that's just how things are pulled out of the DB and the order propagates to the selection, or maybe they're pulled out of a hashmap that doesn't order them as unpredictably as one might expect.
---
My guess is something like this: the threat reduction gets thrown in an AoE processing loop of some kind, looping through all the players affected by the AoE and applying the effect to them. This loop, being a far lower-level system than the spell effect script (or database entry, as they are in WoW) executes in order of character GUID, because that's most convenient internally. The spell effect has a "maximum targets affected" flag set to 1, stopping execution after the first application.
---
If this guess is correct, then I will hypothesise that AoE abilities that affect a limited number of enemies, such as Priest's Psychic Scream, will also select the affected targets based on their GUID. A way to test this is to get 3 or more players, figure out which of them has the *highest* guid, and see if he ever gets feared by a rank 1 Psychic Scream. Perhaps one of the Fight Club lads like /u/rkfs might test this out.
---
Well at least right now gems are going crazy. Sold a blue sapphire for 75g today.  Also arcane crystals at 45g.  those plus essence of water at 20g and vendor items, yeah you could probably clear 1k in a weekend
---
That was inspiring
---
U def can go zf gy without epic mount. As long u got imp blizz that doesnt matter. Just use iceblock for the two bigger pulls at zf gy and ice barrier works fine for the last one. Epic mount pulls in zf gy is just kinda meh, so many mobs you're bound to get resisted alot on fn.
---
If u got herbing you also can go try learning dm east farming.
---
It‚Äôs done through Bartender. There is a keybinds red button at the top when you type /bt
---
For my Razer Tartarus the binds are changed through the Razer Synapse software.
---
You can also hit esc in WoW and then select keybinds.
---
autohotkey might be able to do that.
---
Not yet but I plan on making one. I also have a stream but I'm still working out some audio stuff with Voicemeeter Banana.
---
Omnicc
---
Everyone assumes we're dudes and we don't correct them because it's seen as attention seeking if we do?
---
Enjoy having no Wind fury and eating chain lightnings next week.
---
This reminds me when people are like:
---
‚ÄúYeah Smoking por got boring so I started doing A SHIT TON OF METH‚Äù 
---
Made me chuckle. Pretty impressive you can manage 20 toons at once
---
Yes, I use bartender, but when it does not differentiate between the keyboard and the gaming keypad. Pressing T on one is T, Pressing T on the other is T. It does not see them as two different input sources
---
Wut? 
---
You‚Äôre so dumb. Read that back to yourself. Read what‚Äôs happening.
---
My approch is to make pvp encounters so tedious and boring for the opposing players, that they are unlikely to target priest again. How to do that; idk.. Perhaps a combination of fear, mc, shield, some talents and running away :p
---
I wish I could have but it was a choice of playing with a ton of people I know on a pvp server or going alone on a pve server and I'd rather play with friends. 
---
Despite having having my main on a pvp server for the majority of wow (ever since about mid tbc), I still haven't really figured out what the appeal of them is. It seems like just a lot of inconvenience since nobody engages outside of fights that are extremely stacked in their favor.
---
The one in burning steps has a enrage mechanic which you have to stay away from. Probably why you are dying to it. Also the Silithus one can be done with a terrain exploit. Some guy linked it I think.
---
You still can, according to YouTube videos.
---
OmniBar might be the one you're after
---
Paladins are better if you got a mage in your group, as a warrior cant hold aoe aggro if his life depended on it (which it usually does)
---
What are you gonna play ?
---
 That is so cool. Your profile is witty and hilarious, you seem very down to Earth. Grateful to have you in the community.
---
Like everyone I hate mages too who think I am the one who has to leave because this is THEIR aoe farming spot and I have no right to do any quests there because this is lowering their exp per hour.
---
So if I see a mage anywhere doing their greedy ass "I pull everything because I can and dont care about others who might like to get 2-3 mobs as well" I will pull mobs, Ill make sure they are out of your AOE pack so the will attack you and I will do a massfear or anything I can do to get you killed.
---
If I see a mage from the other faction, even better because that mage is gonna have a really bad time.
---
Go do your aoe shit in a dungeon where nobody cares but as long as you make certain quest areas super annoying to complete because you somehow think this is your area, well I am doing all I can to make your aoe session not worth it.
---
And yes I understood you moved to an area where no quests are avaible -&gt; this doesnt mean 50 other mages fck up the areas where quests are avaible and for the general hate towards mages, whenever I see you no matter where I will make life a little for difficult.
---
The way you play is a serious reduction in your odds of obtaining BIS gear
---
Gotta do dungeons. SM should definitely have some gear for you.
---
With tradestone, yes it automated the trade, but you still need to have the stone and cast a new one ect.
---
Yours sells you could set up a autotyper, go afk and it will just do everything for you.
---
That to me is a bot.
---
I've been so tempted. Just going to di herb/mining on my lock I think and spec and gear hin specifucally for solo instance runs.
---
if i get into a pug and see 4 ppl from the same guild, i drop group these days. i prefer a pug with 5 total randoms.
---
I'm working on a build for my mage that is more powerful in PVP that still will be beneficial for me in raiding. [So far, this is what I've come up with.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2030352012201--050502301320513) It's a slightly modified version of the deep frost POM build to be a little friendlier with AOE grinding and PVE content. I like how it looks honestly, the only thing that really deters me is not having Ice Barrier. It seems like it's just too big of a detriment not having it knowing that it's one of my main sources of mitigation. Of course there's mana shield, however, that drains my mana pool so obviously it's not always the best option. Any thoughts?
---
For reference, [this is what I'm currently running so that I can be a little more well-rounded.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230005--25250233132351301)

The answer definitely lies with any software for redragon. Check their website but to be honest it looks like the K585 is a ‚Äúcompact keyboard‚Äù rather than a ‚Äúgamepad‚Äù and your PC and wow client is registering 2 keyboards and not a keyboard and a gamepad.
---
To solve this issue you‚Äôll have to rebind the redragon keys to bars you have set up in bartender but will need some redragon software to do this. Contact them directly and explain your problem and see if they have a solution.
---
I know redragon mice have software to map their buttons so it must be possible somehow
---
I hit 30 on my warrior Tuesday and immediately put crusader on my WW axe
---
Alliance?! Well that ruins it all, doesn't it.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm so happy to be a part of this community. You‚Äôre all amazing!
---
Dont know what happened but when I dps I try to not overaggro the tank. If it happens I play differently to not do it. Example: as a lock I often use curse of recklesness even if it lowers my dps since not wiping is better than rank 1 on dps meters.
---
My experience as a tank is that people start dps WAY too early. Give the tank a while and to a bad tank two whiles.
---
Ah, showering. The key to every womans heart...
---
Just stay quiet you mongrel.
---
Most of us got forced unto PvP servers by friends and guilds.
---
I'd much rather be on a PvE server and do battlegrounds when I feel like doing PvP.
---
Run as close as you can to the pack without pulling them, and as soon as the whole pack is targeting your pet, you start running. The reason they sheep you is because the pet is out of range for them but you are not. If you do this you should not have a problem with the casters sheeping you
---
I mean, I know it's kind of wild to expect a massive AAA company being able to provide a stable playing experience when a pirated server, ran from a basement,  could handle the same number and more. But if they didn't have this amazing technology that a small group of people in a basement had, they should'nt have released with the server capacity that they did and/or not released 3 fucking servers at launch.
---
You're saying frost is the best dps spec? When arcane is the best dps spec???
---
It‚Äôs gonna be absolute clusterfuck and blizzard doesn‚Äôt care. I imagine the official forums are gonna be unbearable whining for a couple weeks
---
This exact sort of thing was known to happen in an earlier MMO as well, Asheron's Call; where the behavior was called the "Wi Flag" by the players.  Certain players found themselves with constant 'bad luck'; they'd always get targeted first by newly spawned mobs and things like that.
---
Turns out that after many years, they were inadvertently biasing their aggro calculations based on the character's unique identifier number; certain numbers would get hashed into places on an aggro table that virtually guaranteed they'd always get picked when the game rolled a random number to select a player.  They ultimately fixed the bug back in 2002.
---
Fade just lowers your agro level for its duration. So say you have 100 threat and pop fade. Now it is at 60 for a short while and reverts back after the effect is up. I would think the enemy being your companion would cause them to have actually no threat. 
---
But I might be wrong about them having no threat. I've never actually played a priest to a high enough level to get the skill so I have no hands on experience with it.
---
Thank you for the Video!
---
&gt; So either they changed something since beta, or 500v500 is a shitload different than 250vs250 which is pretty likely tbh.
---
Player numbers are an O(n^2) problem. That's programmer speech for saying that 1000 players is about 4 times as demanding as 500 players (1000^2 = 1,000,000, 500^2 = 250,000).
---
One solution to this would be to reduce the view distance, so each player sees far fewer other players. This reduces the network traffic requirements, which have a good chance of being the primary bottleneck here. It's incidentally also the solution private servers took; Classic view distance seems to be at times almost twice that of most of the private servers I played on.
---
Your username is quite fitting, tbh.
---
Also, don't worry so much about this. Noone thought you had any skill because you manage to kill people you outnumber 3v1 anyways.
---
Yeah, it will. Or maybe there will be a blue post on Monday or Tuesday where they got a whole new solution.
---
... you pay for 20 subscriptions?!
---
JF?
---
Layering will be back, and in greater numbers.
---
Shadowmeld into mind control is pretty cool though
---
I suspect... That the method Blizzard uses to get players in range of something (always an NPC or a player. Blizzard uses invisible NPCs to target their abilities), they will do something like getactorsinrangeof(actor) which then returns a list sorted based on GUIDs. Maybe its not even sorted actively, but due to how the system works, it adds players from low to high GUID to the list, effectively sorting it anyways. It would not take much for a programmer to make the mistake, that thret reduction is only applied to the first in the list i just got, as he assumes that the first entry on the list is the player targetted. They might have had the fireballs wipe threat on everyone hit, but nerfed it later to who they assume was the targetted player, when in fact it was the player with the lowest GUID due to how the players in range list(probably an array) is returned.
---
[if its all the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/ds3o1b/the_reason_so_many_women_think_men_have_out_of/f6o7gm4?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) to you, im less than interested in your ideas on how to get the ladies bruv.
---
Sure, but a lot of players will then panic and do something which causes aggro.
---
itt: bad reading comprehension
---
I read your posted chat logs. Dude you wiped 10 times, if you don‚Äôt tank maybe don‚Äôt start with LBRS. You whined to a guild leader and basically demanded they take action against them even after he said they would talk to the guildie. Sometimes dungeon groups fall apart before the end, I wouldn‚Äôt have made it to 10 wipes. You acted like a baby, telling the GL to take away DKP, do what the GL said and get over it.
---
filthy orc, get out of my rich thorium with your furry cat
---
Your tanking is not up to any warlock standards.
---
Please do better.
---
The thing is those games play entirely different. 
---
I hate world pvp in WoW. You can't level up or gain resources or gear through pvp. Most fights are done where the odds are easy to evaluate up front due to constant class abilities, and visible levels. All most world pvp  amounts to just a minor annoyance while you run back from the graveyard since you couldn't do anything in a 1v5 battle or a battle against a a significantly higher character level. Or maybe you kill them, congratulations, you gain nothing and they are minorly inconvenienced.
---
In contrast World PVP in EVE online is a blast. There are stakes and so many more variables in what your character has available. If they kill you cause you were in Ship A, you could go to your hanger and get Ship B that is way better at killing their ship and go kill them or you could put a bounty on them. If they initiate the fight with a fancy decked out ship and lose it's a significant loss for them but a big gain for you. You know there are places where you need to be more on your guard than others in watching out for people.  You can use PvP to control areas and control resources. PvP game and it's fun.
---
I got the kitty buff I can do as I please
---
Looks like Grid
---
Except for warlock and hunter at least mby others
---
What is the name of the addons that writes the taunt resisted in chat?
---
If you aren't in a group it wont work.
---
Also for at least 1 player in every raid it will return nothing, as there must always be someone that has the highest GUID of the raid.
---
You could be the lucky #1.
---
If you'd like a script that gives a bit more feedback you can use:
---
&gt; /run print("iInding players with a lower GUID:") local x = UnitGUID("player") for i=1,GetNumGroupMembers() do local y = UnitGUID("raid"..i) if y and y &lt; x then print(UnitName("raid"..i)) end end print("Done")
---
So, if the game loses 90% it's playerbase (any MMORPG, not just WoW) and the person picks a low pop realm he isn't screwed in group quests, raids and pvp? You are not thinking straight.
---
Middle of the night is when you can catch nightfin fish. I know you said nonprof farming but my server those sell for 35-40s each. Between 12 and 6 am server time you can get them at a rate of 30-40% of your catches. Works out to around 10-15g an hour while you watch netflix or whatever. 
---
If fishing isn't high enough yet the blackmouth fish things used for free action potion have been selling for some 20-30s each while you level it up. And certain areas have strangle kelp around them too. (Though currently the price of those dropped since a day or two after the announcement of phase 2 to around 10s.)
---
Otherwise farming devilsaur with your skinning will work nice for you along with elementals as others have mentioned.
---
I'm level 32 with 43g, lol you can do this!
---
To be fair though, paladin tanks ROCK in scholo and strat.
---
Also I find that alot of paladin tanks are especially tryhard players, decking our their characters in skullflame shield and all that jazz.
---
Mouseover kick/blind macro, distracting patrols, 'nading, and use your fucking feint ability are good ways to make yourself more useful but the issue is getting invited not proving your worth after the fact. lvl 58 war getting gargoyle cape yesterday and a hunter who already had a good (and enchanted) cape getting the baron cape was a huge tilter yesterday. Going from work into mining for hours in silithus into multiple dungeon runs for the 1-2 last items i need not dropping then into MC + Ony in under 2h then back into stratholme and getting nothing.. exhausting.. especially having gone through the day with 2h of sleep the night before and sleeping for 3h the night of.. i m at work exhausted rn with no raid till next Wednesday and know i have to grind my ass off with mining and strat ud until p2..
---
I think the problem is that the only difficulty is at the very end of retail. In classic, you accidentally pull 2 mobs and you are fighting for your life, encountering danger as early as the first few levels. In retail, it's virtually impossible to die to mobs in the open world, and you can run dungeons without a tank while leveling. I wish I could get a challenge before level 120 endgame. No challenge = no content.
---
Thnkfully not everyone is required to work stressful long hour days to afford to live.
---
Holy shit that is terrible luck.
---
Except when they got engineering shield.
---
Wouldnt judge on MC and Ony, they were literally the first wow raids. Out of context now we all have hidnsight and knowledge etc but imagine how daunting these were when the whole concept of what to do was unknown or completely not a meta as much. Also take into account that the spreading of information (reddit for an exmaple) was so much worse.  
---
Wait til aq and nax to make those calls. TBC even.
---
That may be true of some locks, but not all. I ran a mara the other day with all mana users. Never drank once, was never the last ready for a pull, had equal dps to the mage in our group the whole run. 
---
I run stam/spirit gear and drain tank build. End every fight oom, but with my regen and dark pact didnt have to drink. Always ready for the next pull before most of the group.
---
Let me be a viable pally tank pls
---
As healer this was nightmare. Ring is pre bis for every healer so it had to be done. I tried it around ten times until I finally got it done. Horrible quest.
---
+hit
---
"In This Thread", i believe
---
My tip would be. Always sure to log off in an inn close to the zone you are doing to make use of rested xp. You can have 2 complete levels worth of double xp.
---
This means just killing mobs will be a good source of xp instead of doing every single quest in a zone, I suggest skipping the time consuming ones except if they offer a big upgrade.
---
True, I was not referring to 60 with bumped up health and mana pools from gear.
---
This is some of the best WoW related content I‚Äôve seen in the game‚Äôs history. Absolutely amazing!
---
There is no IRL, only AFK.

Please let me know too If you find out name of this plugin.

&gt; Addons like these weren't as widely circulated in vanilla.
---
That really doesn't seem like a good reason to block an addon.
---
It sounds like the kind of World PVP you want is in BDO, check it out. We're playing a 15 year old game, don't expect innovations on it.
---
Why is he the rich one if you are the one farming? Lazy cat /s
---
And i didndt even get 1 in 60 veins
---
They might need to do something similar to Gw2 world pvp to manage that many, not sure the standard world can sustain that.
---
Leatrix has a bunch of automation like repair and selling greys
---
Personally I value troll racials more on shamans. Zerk helps all specs in all scenarios. PvP only orc might be the best but tauren stomp is a nice skill in the same sense of trolls zerk. Especially since we lack a stun.
---
Orc will mostly be just for the CC resist as bloodfury only helps enhance and can also cause you to get killed if used at the wrong moment.
---
Actually no, i can't commit that time with 100% certainty. I probably can 90% of the time, but thats not enough - after all 39 other people commit their time too, i don't want to leave them hanging.
---
And no, thats not a "bigger problem". It's actually the best thing that happened in my life. There are way more important things in life than raiding (or WoW for that matter), and i understand that I may not be able to raid because of that fact. Just stated a fact here. :)
---
Meanwhile I mined over 50 rich thorium nodes and didn't find a single crystal or diamond LOL

This is stupid. Repair your stuff as needed.

Yea, druids have that issue of not being able to resurrect groups from wipes, so I'm sure it's even harder to grab a heal spot as druid unless the group happens to have another rezzer already.
---
Dude , just keep doing your thing, people need tanks. If you feel you need to improve on something watch a video on how to run a particular run you are going to do, don‚Äôt let people‚Äôs toxicity bring you down. Keep at it, be positive , and improve. Fuck those folks.
---
You arent doing anything wrong. These guys are idiots. Repair as needed. You might keep a piece if gear for 5 or more levels and not repairing to save a few silver is stupid.
---
Looks doesn't mean that much. You're probably just not that interesting.
---
ye but thats gonna take a while i still need 6 for lionheart feelsbadman
---
get full plate gear with 2 valor pieces and you can tank every 5 man easy while being top dps
---
I actually also play a rogue on Sulfuras. STV was nothing crazy. I was surprised to see the pvp going on in Tanaris (especially near Gadget), but I didn‚Äôt think it was so insane, and I want to just say that - obviously - it‚Äôs all anecdotal at this point. Would be awesome to see some real stats on this kind of stuff next year.  
---
  
---
So far Un‚Äôgoro has been the most vicious zone for me. And not just in terms of pvp. People stealing mining nodes, tags, flaming in chat.  
---
Sulfuras is a really good server - I even think it will go down as one of the more awesome wow classic servers when all things are said and done. But right now, you wouldn‚Äôt know that from a trip to the Crater:
---
I went back on retail to finish my zandalari rep real quick for some reason, God what a shitshow the game is. Leveling an alt on classic is indeed much much more rewarding
---
i can't see 6 piece worth getting when you will break it so easily
---
I saw it; and sure, once one has got an Ubrs group together and once ones dealt or bypassed the campers at the entrance and if the group isnt half-braindead (like so many of them are), then its simple. 
---
However, the gear one gets isnt worth that effort unless one is going for the set for aesthetic reasons. Far more sensible, unless one has nothikg better to do, to 5-man a couple other instances and get better gear.
---
It's Luna Unit Frames
---
I unsubbed, for now, if during the launch of phase 2 this is not fixed then I'm out completely, with current server Alterac Valey will be lagfest as well... Imagine private servers being 10x more stable than actual retail ones... Instead of improving the experience they are cutting costs...
---
Whereas everyone else is bored. Players who are still trying to ding 60 can keep trying to ding 60 whereas everyone else can sit around being bored.
---
Had a Shaman tank LBRS for me. It was a blast and nothing went wrong after he told the mage to wait on aoe for 5 seconds. I really think Shaman can tank anything besides raids and UBRS
---
Elvui is amazing, and actually easily does both those things. Just take the time to learn it a bit.
---
Welcome to tanking.
---
No it worked this way in the first week of classic, got the buff on every kill before the first drain soul tick.
---
Classic is to retail as OSRS is to RS3. I think that's the best way I can describe the differences between classic and retail.
---
Also I think if you're coming from OSRS the grind isn't going to bother you because you've already experienced the grind. In my opinion OSRS is much more grindy than classic wow (but then I used to play ironman mode so I may be a littled biased there).
---
Judging by your post you seem to have done some research into the game so all I can suggest is give it a go for a month and see how you get on.
---
Haha my rogue is 16 but i am leveling with friends only so it will be much longer
---
I dont understand why people get snotty in these situations. I mean, you loose yourself a potential future customer. I tank A TON of dungeons for gold now that I'm geared but I would never berate anyone for declining on my offer. I just bid them a good evening and move on to the next potential customer.
---
People simply cant stop themselves from shooting their own foot.
---
Yeah I'm a healer and finding pugs can be a struggle sometimes. Seems like every group either needs a tank or DPS. It's actually astounding.
---
i think the big selling point for me (lvl35 priest) is, that i know it even makes sense for me to play classic with only a few hours per week
---
i know mc/bwl/etc will still be relevant when i hit 60 sometime later this year and throughout the next year
---
No, do not do this.
---
Make sure to use that margin on triple leveraged ETFs. Remember, you never lose if you never realize the loss.
---
As a tank who does alot of tanking for gold, the highest amount I've been paid is 35g for a full LBRS run. 50g would indeed be a **very** tough sell.
---
I‚Äôm currently 32 with 45g on this character, I‚Äôll have the mount  money by the time I‚Äôm 40, and if not I‚Äôll borrow from my main! Lol
---
whats with alliance and spitting?
---
I think the main problem is that this phase will actively fuck over casual players that are still leveling. I don‚Äôt care about being behind on content, but I‚Äôm level 47 right now playing alliance and the release of the honor system without battlegrounds will basically ensure that level 48-60 will be a nightmare. I‚Äôm already being ganked by level 60s plenty, I can‚Äôt imagine how it will be once they have an incentive to do so.
---
You'll want blue sapphires over diamonds tbh
---
That and leveling up. The pain
---
Honestly, ice barrier is to good to pass up for both pvp and pve right now with frost required for raiding and so many points in the tree. It stops warriors from generating rage, combined with mana barrier rogues can't instagib you as easily, you have an extra layer of protection vs raid bosses. I certainly wouldn't and don't pass it up.
---
 I don't think improved mana shield is worth having at all for any build, and magic attunement is a decent pvp talent but if you are raiding I would definitely pass on it for other options. What is really good for raiding is arcane meditation, as stacked with mage armor you keep generating a sizeable amount of mana in long boss fights.
---
Frost channeling, piercing ice, and elemental precision are MUST HAVES for raiding as well, unless you're blowing money on the bigger arcane elixirs and major mana potions (and even then... just get them). There is no real reason to have improved blizzard or cone of cold unless you are aoe farming either, and shatter pairs nicely with frostbite which you do not have. Frost nova with shatter + flamestrike is a good aoe farming method as well if that's why you have improved blizzard.
---
Gotta just shrug it off. Maybe when forming the group, state this isnt an aoe xp/hr farm group. Set expectation so you'll get the right people in the group.
---
Spent the last week fishing nothing but Oily Blackmouth and Raw Nightfin Snapper for Nightfin Soup in Feralas and made my mount gold that way. For a new-to-WoW player, thats been my first real grind in the game. I'm sure it doesn't even begin to compare to what the rest of the game has to offer.
---
I mean, I like to think I‚Äôm of pretty sane mind. But hey, who am I to judge?
---
In some ways, tanking as fury can actually be simpler. Atleast for a newbie. You dont rotate as many abilities. You basically tab-sunder-revenge all the time.
---
Aragorn is often called a Ranger in LOTR and Survival tree was intended to be one of those hybrid melee + ranged combat specs in honor of Aragorn, for example their last talent point was melee ability called Lacerate that dealt bleed damage. After human hunter combination was removed and they saw that the Survival melee + ranged hybrid spec isnt so popular they decided to change it to what it was in Vanilla.
---
Searing gorge, way worse, if you try to quest there around 50 with all the 60 on their way to blackrock Mountain, it was hell. Even tho i was shadow priest, most of the time people left me alone 1vs1 at the same level.
---
That is a phat health bar for a mage
---
Make sure to pick a fast leveling class like a hunter, and not a warrior. You can also google other fast leveling classes and get a list on how each class is rated in terms of leveling speed. This will the time you have be spent most efficiently
---
Open the quest log and shift click the quests in question. That should put a ‚Äútick‚Äù beside the quest and make it visible in Questie. 
---
Your welcome ! Fellow OCD traveller
---
Let me geus a tank who gets invited to all the groups.. Try a rogue
---
It's absolutely ridiculous. The servers are indeed no way near capable of handling the world pvp. Business as usual when Gehennas move to BRM to raid last night, the players won't even render on the screen as you enter, a few minutes later when the dust settles and you've been  spamming your abilities and consumables, 200 people are dead on the ground, alot of people were disconnected during the fight and got stuck in queue missing the raid. It's totally unacceptable.
---
 It's honestly a complete shitshow
---
Yes it is.
---
Classic is catered for casuals (not trying to flame or be negative). Alot of people wanna make classic seem like some super hard game to make them feel better.
---
It's probably more of a problem for retail than for classic. Retail is about myhic+ and raids. Classic is about the road to 60 rather than hard endgame content
---
No but he is right, the sale price of an item with 5/70 durability is far lower than one with 70/70. The repair price gets deducted from the sale prixe
---
Correction: *Few people want to tank. It takes a certain kind of personality.
---
I still assume it's people that don't speak English as a first language.
---
I met my boyfriend playing games. We‚Äôre long distance at the moment but I think we both look forward to being able to spend time ‚Äútogether‚Äù when we game, it something we both enjoy doing while enjoying each other‚Äôs company. We even hit 60 around the same time
---
&gt; o
---
Haha, yeh....rogues stand a chance against a decent warrior...sure.
---
You may want to search this Reddit, there was a post with GM response on this topic. As many other said, it is not against TOS, but you do not have the protection in case of scam like normal trading does.
---
Nope it is not, thanks git sharing tho
---
How long does it take? I've just been bribing guildies before raid lol
---
Whats the point of running high level mythic dungeons if the rest of the game isn't worth it?
---
Guild Wars 2
---
Lmao I've been thinking about that guy every time fire mage is mentioned.
---
As a tank myself I agree. I love the tank shortage. Leaves more action to me. It's like being the only living man in an amazon tribe where all the big women wants snoo-snoo.
---
care
---
gz
---
oof
---
r
---
This is a new generation of online communication, and I don't think it will get better soon.
---
Yeah you chose the easy content in retail, of course it's easy. I dont know what delusions you are under but 90% of dungeons in classic is AOE spam. Raid content is piss easy. Take off those beer goggles mate.
---
Probably multiboxes on retail to buy tokens. It would be ridiculously easy.
---
And difficulty cap is pretty huge. Even heroic raids in retail are pretty much walk in a park but once you start to do Mythic content things change a lot and suddenly you have to put a lot more into game. 
---
I would really hope they tune how normal and heroic work. I think current heroic should be normal and heroic should be something between current heroic and mythic.
---
What the fuck?
---
I'm 8 short lol
---
Private servers sustained it
---
He never pulls his weight
---
Is it a player arguing against another player? Seems like pvp to me.
---
Yeah if you never want to play or look at a guide how to get  carried around like a baby.
---
Jesus he is bad and also beg for everything that is not nailed to the wall.
---
I wanted this to be real so badly
---
Is it worth if i have epic mount?
---
what are good "dead" servers now?
---
basically a better flurry axe in every way. at the very least BIS for prot paladins due to the higher procs on SOC
---
Unless youre boomie. Then theres zero useful things in the other 2.
---
Shouldn't it be RNJesus? Like, RNG..sus?
---
Yes, I tested it in a raid with other people. It's getting 'nil' value for GUID.
---
Because they are really fun.
---
I'm more concerned about AV being a horrible lag fest. There was some lag in vanilla AV for sure, but I'm retail the servers shit themselves if the whole AV meets in the middle/on a flag. That wasn't the case in vanilla, it lagged a bit but it was playable.
---
120g on my server
---
In the same boat, my son is 15 months old so he requires a lot of attention still, so I have only reached lv57 on my warlock.. Yet that feat in itself is worth more than anything I have done in BfA or Legion to me
---
I have been 60 for a good while and I have run a lot of dungeons. On this time only one person has said "no thanks, I don't want druid because of ress".
---
So don't worry, they do not decline you because you are a druid.
---
Literally can‚Äôt go tits up
---
Fortch from Eternal Reign was the Scarab Lord. I was irl friends with Babo and a few others.
---
Meant in the sense that - as someone already mentioned in this post - the small things in classic raids still wipes the whole group. Yeah this happens in retail too, but as healer (shaman in retail) It just seems so more lax raiding - were not on farm status with anything yet - in comparison to classic where I genuinely have to make an effort in healing.
---
And please, so many effin people just use macros for everything today ^^
---
 Hey! That‚Äôs Freshfish! Someone let him know he‚Äôs reddit famous!
---
We did it on release played a few days without sleep until 40! Five man Alliance side :)
---
The same guild that banned all of Tempest from world for no reason.
---
What is "no time limit in getting geared in time"?
---
Hes definitely a snuggler
---
Well 100v100 doesnt work on classic servers either lol I get rubberbanding if theres any more than 50 people in BRM
---
Activate Windows please
---
Don't need faction specific transfers, we need faction specific queues!
---
Looks like #nochanges to me
---
Flamelash is pretty good
---
Nostalrius had 18.000 players towards the end of the server at peak times.
---
World bosses had around 800 people duking it out for 6-10 hours per boss.
---
I got 3 crystals yesterday its still quite good
---
That‚Äôs your end.. I personally haven‚Äôt had a problem with 100v100 or entering brm at all.
---
Honor among thieves?
---
Debrah?
---
Why twink now when you can‚Äôt even do bgs for months still?
---
You get geared pretty quickly in retail. OP is just a bad player who wants to pretend classic was some golden age of pve when the game was hard. 
---
&gt;And 90% classic dungeons are aoe spam only if you join xp/hr groups. No more than 10% of the dungeons I've ran have been aoe fests.
---
That doesnt make classic hard. If you want to take it slow, that's your choice and it is completely reasonable to play that way. But that is not an indication of difficulty.
---
If I know I am doing too much threat, I just wand a bunch instead of bursting the fck out of the mob just because I can.
---
Playing your class well doesnt just mean you need to do a shitton of dps and be number 1 all time, playing your class well includes knowing when to burst and when to slow down.
---
Tanaris on Heartseeker-US is a totally different story
---
really? which one? :O jeez
---
That‚Äôs racist.
---
When i lvled my main, alliance would always run around in groups ofr 4-5, whereas horde were usually solo...It was a dreadful experience for me as a horde...
---
The other day I killed one of those elite bugs so I could get the node and a Dwarven Hand Cannon dropped off of the bug and then got two Arcane Crystals from that node. I swear it must have been my birthday in a nearby Universe.
---
Funny how a bunch of euros working solely off donations were able to handle world pvp much better than a multi billion dollar company.
---
Probably should have said increase time period to get geared in content that precedes nax/aq in pserver.
---
I dont think pvp offers anything even remotely useful for 99,8% of the playerbase, so I dont use pvp as a benchmarking tool, only pure single target dps.
---
My main is named Thot and I need this
---
I have the exact same situation
---
&gt;if theres any more than 50 people in BRM
---
Either your connection is bad or you're lying. We've had no lag in BRM with 3 raid groups standing around. 
---
Now when the sappers start flowing you should expect the server to chug, and it does.
---
That has been the case for 15 years :D
---
baited
---
&gt;Tank 1 gets hit first. Then I eat every other fireball when we stack.
---
This seems unclear.
---
If you're letting him eat a fireball *before* stacking, his threat will already be lowerered, so you'll be the next target on the list.
---
More likely, you've misunderstood the GUID. Take some screenshots, I'm sure the fight club discord would love to see it.
---
Gigabit connection with a 2700x threadripper and an rx580. I get 99fps at max setting in MC with 40 people. 40v40 pvp however is a lag fest unlike northdale a few months ago...
---
I'm not so sure it's even about difficulty. It's about effort, and how the game interacts with your brain's reward pathway
---
Funny how people seem to think it's a lottery who gets R14, it was indeed coordinated, I was in such a group as well. Getting there was still a bitch and require a lot of effort, but yeah... :)
---
Is this like the "regular" weather effects? I don't think I've experienced such heavy rain yet! Would love to know if it's a console setting or smth, looks chill af :)
---
to me, retail feels like a chore - there are things you have to complete every week and sometimes every day, and if you don't it feels like you're missing out
---
in classic, i dont feel the same way outside of raid resets and xmute cooldowns. in fact, after you finish getting all your prebis and farming for your raid consumables and epic mount, there isn't a whole lot to do. it certainly doesnt feel like you have to log in to do your WoW chores like retail does
---
Anecdotaly it looks like a self fullfilling prophecy too. Many healers make their own groups because no one is looking for healers, and since obviously the healer spot is filled, they're not looking for healers either.
---
I very aware of that. But i want to be everything i can before that time runs out.
---
I dont know who you are or the failures you have suffered. But essentially you have given up to death?
---
Your also playing on a server now with more than the few hundred that a private had..
---
I wouldnt do dungeons if I had less than 2 houra a day to play. 
---
A fast leveler will take 6-7 days of playtime to go 1-60. Thats 168 hours, which means if you can play 2 hours a day it will take you roughly 85 days to get to 60.
---
Depending what server you're on I can help you afford you epic mount :)
---
GUH
---
this is just wrong tbh 
---
have you actually been in an 80 vs 80 or 120 vs 120 fight on classic? i have a clip on my hdd getting 10-20s of rubberbanding in a 120 vs 80 fight
---
People are already sick of MC. Most pugs are clearing MC, the raid difficulty is LFR level
---
Alot will burn out if there's no new contents and have to do these easy raids for months
---
The underlying technology hasn‚Äôt improved since 2005. No one can do these things at scale. Well, eve-online can somewhat, but they do it by queuing your actions so it takes 10 minutes from you press a key to the action actually gets performed.
---
No, I'd rather they put the equivalent playtime on my account. A day is a day.
---
Azuregos and kazzak will be a shitshow lmao
---
I was stunned by HoJ the *entire* time. The debuff doesn't wear off until the very end.
---
You dont need to be salad bakers to clear raids. There's an huge difference between a world record speedrun and being able to clear a raid easily. Any competent guild with retail experience will down the bosses you mentioned in less than 1 night. Why? Because those bosses are mechanically simple.
---
On the way to work so to put it briefly, it depends on the rest of your raid's gear (and to some extent the right). But for example, if your raid is geared to the stage where threat becomes more important than mitigation, wearing gear which gives hit cap, or close to, becomes more of a priority than mitigating damage
---
I farmed this for some time back in the day. I finally got it ,made tons of gold and rare items I saved items and now I can trans-mog them today.
---
I interpreted U were applying dkp per use as U were investigating quantities used
---
That command spam to miss looting the mount after loooting the swords haha. The pause after killed it.
---
Pulling agro as dps is always your fault. Even if the tank is slow generating threat, just means you need to go slower. Realize warriors are not aoe tanks. Wait until a primary target is set, either a skull icon, the one whose health is starting to go down, or by targeting the tanks target. Do not dot multiple adds until the first target is almost dead. Usually even then I only dot 2 targets.
---
I ran with a strong pally tank for the first time Monday, with them I could dot everything asap and rain of fire no problem. Just have to start the instance slow and careful. Increasing your aggressiveness little by little until you reach the limit. Then back off a smidge. No dungeon needs ultra max dps and allow for your tank to not be 100% on point every second of every pull.
---
Do you have any idea of what you're talking about? Many of the larger ones like Nost and KR absolutely murdered the current Classic servers in terms of wPvP performance.
---
Thunderfury is fantastic, I've been a part of multiple fights involving about 120+ and haven't had one bit of lag yet.
---
It's a very narrow spec and gear set, and doesn't work well on things that resist nature, like half of ST.
---
For those that don‚Äôt get it he is trying to show us how many times baron dies and no mount. So gl trying to farm it
---
Uh retail contents is magnitude more challenging than classic. Just because you dont' want to participate in m+ or raid doesn't mean the challenges aren't there
---
10 min? the buff takes 30 min to go off due to lag xD
---
Yeah, who'd care about how many people play a game based around social interactions and a sense of community?
---
Lol look at his stun debuff
---
In my experience it's literally easier to find a group as dps than as a healer. This dude is out of his mind trying to charge people for him healing. Really hope no one actually pays him..
---
I dont think its so easy.
---
Yes but you also don‚Äôt know how big the networks processing it where.. 
---
You have an entire network dedicated to 1 server vs having a network dedicated to having 20+ servers.
---
&gt; Listen, if your server is anything like mine, you need tanks for midlvl dungeons.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; SM Cath, Uld, ZF, Mara, ST... they all are absolutely moonkin tankable. Hell, even if your fatkin is wearing some cloth they'll be at around 45% armor dmg reduction. You aint dodgin anything, and you for sure are drinking a lot. But its better than not running at all, and actually the threat/dps output is kind of insane.
---
&gt; On the pull you can starfire moonfire combo the skull and its locked down for aggro. Tab target moonfires and nothing is gonna get the healer. Especially with enhanced thorns. You now just gotta sit pretty and maybe chuck a couple wraths or refresh moonfires. And hoot a lot.
---
There is a legitimacy behind non-bear tanking, the boys over at the [off meta](https://discord.gg/3JXSamG) discord talk about it and have made some pretty cool stuff.
---
It‚Äôs a game my friend. I‚Äôm in my late 20s with a wife and 3 kids. I play about 12-15 hours a week. I‚Äôm just leveling professions as I go. Doing dungeons when I have like 4-6 quests in them and questing the rest. I just dinged 50 and I started the day of launch. Just don‚Äôt get in the mind set of keep up with everybody else. You will get there eventually. It‚Äôs a great game.
---
hacks
---
Yes I have and haven‚Äôt had a single problem.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs your shitty server but the oceanic ones handle them with no problem.
---
Not if that lock is SL
---
Originally they released two European PVP servers (Golemagg, Shazzrah), then added a 3rd (Gehennas), then the night before release they added some more, when many guilds and people had planned where to land. Then on top of that, they kept adding servers. For the most part, the most populated ones (still layered) are the ones that were added first with some counted exceptions. 
---
People were very hesitant to reroll on new servers (I did, twice) because of the longevity concern, which is very valid. My server is far from dead, but Alliance is vastly outnumbered at level 60. Will we be enough to raid Naxxramas? 
---
Overall, Blizzard made two big mistakes:
---
* Greatly underestimated the amount of people who would be playing Classic, after months after release ("Blizzard knows better than you" we heard around here)
---
* Did not encourage faction balance via queue manipulation / limited free transfers based on faction. This already have negative consequences and will only continue to get worse.
---
The first problem is part planning, part a reflection of retail servers, where there are a few mega-servers and the rest are graveyard. People migrate to those mega-servers because there's zero benefit for playing in a small server.
---
The second problem is also Blizzard's and how they have let the population balance at semi-competitive/competitive level rot. This has extended itself into Classic.
---
The thing to notice, besides the massive scale world PvP, is that I was HoJ stunned the *entire* clip. I was spamming mouseover heals on my raid frames and couldn't cast a single one.
---
&gt; So the game has sacrificed a bit of uniqueness in the talents trees for what is arguably a much better raid experience.
---
I do not believe that the raid experience improved after WOTLK.
---
It has far more to do with people finally knowing their class and optimization. People used to jizz over the tier sets, turn out they are all shit and green gear with spell power is by far better.
---
Noggenfogger, they go for 40g a pop
---
Yup, sadly it does.
---
Oh yes. WOTLK was the peak of the game.
---
+5 dmg on MH and crusader on OH. The +5 damage on the MH is good because your backstabs/ambushs scale off of it
---
Here's a list of excuses:
---
I was eating
---
My cat kept running across my keyboard
---
I was on the phone
---
First time healing
---
I didn't have a wand
---
You are right my friend I was just been a lazy noob
---
I live in central Europe, which means I can earn a good living with much less zhan a 40 hour work week and still have plenty time to devote to playing. Idk about you but to me that doesn't sound sad.
---
This is the point this entire post is about. 0P is showing off that he got to epic BOEs.
---
There's a difference between holding 4vs4 raids while having 10k players with 4vs4 raids while handling 20k+ players
---
What unit frames are those?
---
Pservers have overtuned bosses. These boss will get steamrolled on classic
---
Surprised you didn‚Äôt use any big word as an exmaple
---
You guys got any Mazdaspeeds?
---
Never saw anything like that. WoW is the nicest online community I was a part of. Pvp alliance server.
---
Boomkins do better damage than all but the most minmaxing powershifters.
---
Well. Common sense. Do not risk losing things by calculating that there will be problems.
---
Anybody crying to this open world MMO rush-hour problem has soul of an ignorant kid that has 0 ideas about how client-server side programming.
---
Again, to people who are going to downvote. Not amused? Cancel your subscription because same thing continues to happen since 2006 and it will continue to happen again until a clever guy/girl finds a better workaround for this open world MMORPG games.
---
Resists come under spell hit, so unless the tanks use some amount of spell hit gear or they dont have t3 set bonus resists will happen a lot
---
This is what most people don't understand.  By the time a MAJORITY of vanilla players began their first sub, a LOT of what's still to be expected was in game.
---
You compare different player counts
---
The same hardware has to handle larger player counts on the whole server while handling that battle
---
&gt; Game is being rushed. Most players are still trying to ding 60 and Phase II is here.....
---
It's slower than original EU release schedule. What on earth is rushed here?
---
EU release was 11th Feb 2005 - Dire Maul release 7th March (4 weeks) - Honor system release 8th April (5 weeks)
---
Classic releae 27th August 2019 - Dire Maul release 15th October (7 weeks) - Honor system release 12th November (4weeks)
---
So in the original WoW release in europe there were 9 weeks between release and the honor system, in classic we have 11 weeks. How does the game feel rushed? You just have a different perception as US release was 10 weeks before EU release.
---
Good thing we dont have layering anymore !  
---
Or that we used that server transfer option ...  
---
Wait, I got it !  
---
Suprise Pikachu face and rant on Reddit/WOW forums !

If i understood it correctly, it relies on users scanning AH.

On my server it works just fine. [Updates every hour or so.](https://puu.sh/EBJxX/b2880d7436.png)
---
Why is it not happening now then, if honor doesn't matter?
---
I hope we don't see BWL before February, getting WSG before x-mas I would like though
---
No, plenty more. If you stay inside with king buff even more.
---
Heroic raids in retail is not that easy, did you do BFDA, mekka and Jaina were hard!
---
yojamba seems quiet lately.
---
That was cruel man.   
---
I mean ... Just cruel.
---
Farmed it in WotLK. I think they increased the drop chance then. Did it in 73 runs.
---
Casters need hit too. That's the struggle for warlock phase 1, no hit from talents, only 2 % available from gear.
---
well you're not gonna hit 60 idling around stromwind
---
Yeah no. You cannot. Try tanking Dire Maul North as a shaman.
---
You will say something entirely different after trying that.
---
^ yep this right here. Idk wtf could be the problem with classic though....
---
We were playing on a server with 12.5k concurrent players. With zero layers or sharding.
---
I dont know how many people are on some of the blizzard servers today, but i guarantee you it's fewer than 12.5k for a lot of them, just judgning by how the world feels.
---
the mocking blow can be dodged blocked or parried because it does mele damage when it hits, the sell effect of "forces the target to hit you for xxduration" is a spell so it can still be resisted
---
What? Is your brain smooth? I said ‚Äúhonorless target‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter. The 30s buff.
---
I normally wear a jacket when I let him up like that because He has got claws on him lol. Hes ma lil chonk though
---
3%
---
Meh, I got it in retail - many years back. RNG is RNG.
---
It is. Especially since people still pvp on pve servers, it‚Äôs just consensual
---
Official Blizzard servers were always terribly laggy when too many people were in one area. I think most people are comparing their experience with private servers - which run the 13-year old 1.12 client - with Classic.
---
Bunch of complaining over a non-issue IMO.
---
Ugh
---
We just need some good ol EVE time dilation.
---
guy has a 1 member guild
---
Do the elites drop felcloth at a higher rate? I‚Äôm curious why I‚Äôd want to farm elites over regular mobs.
---
Got 2 blue sapphires in 4 nodes yesterday. Pretty sure its pure RNG for both of 'em.
---
Sorry to say but there were more players on Pservers then on WoW Classic Servers.
---
To be fair, you could run Classic raids as certain classes (frost mage comes to mind) whilst holding a baby in one arm.
---
Unfortunately, heroic dungeons in retail are purely for gearing purposes and are designed to be easy, Mythic dungeons are where the challenges are.
---
The event should be hidden in in the combat logs and as such shouldn't be trackable (like X gains Felstriker / Felstriker fades from X). But who knows.
---
Blame your shitty isp then, personally I don‚Äôt have a problem at all.
---
This 100+ I have gutgore mh with +5 and core hound oh with crusader.
---
Both felcloth and demonic runes should be a higher drop rate, you also might be lucky and get a eye of shadow
---
Yeah but way too contested.
---
Like if phase 2 is gonna be full of large scale battles .
---
It's gonna be more like group of 5s camping level 55s.
---
Yes, and the billion dollar company with 20+ servers should have more robust networking to deal with that.
---
hunters are a blast to level but their dps isnt as good as the other dps classes for raiding
---
Had the same problem, blizzard did nothing and was kinda desperate. While I was about to give up playing I decided to give a shot to those so called " lag killer " most of them did nothing, 1 of those I actually letting me play smoothly. Dunno how they works and what makes 1 works for you and not for others, but they all have first week free and then cost 3/4 dollar a month. You may wanna give a try
---
Wtf is a raid fee and what‚Äôs the point of it
---
SoC with a 1h lel.
---
Everybody and their mom have been bitching to get an exact fucking replica of 2004 with not a single change at all and now they‚Äòre like ‚Äûc‚Äòmon Blizzard it‚Äòs 2019 yOuR SerVeRS neED To bE uPdaTEd‚Äú. Fucking ridiculous.
---
10 days play time to hit 60 is not casual, you're just inefficient.
---
Casuals players also have rested exp going for them, anyone following a guide or a quest addon should hit 60 within 8 days played
---
Not true. I farmed the shit out or tyr's hand as rogue back in vanilla. Mining thorium/crystals/sapphires now though and elementals when bored.
---
Well, actually...
---
&gt; they are both easier than LFR raids.
---
Flat out fucking wrong.
---
Play LFR again... in LFR it is neigh impossible to wipe. In classic, you wipe if you act a bit too late against baron geddon.
---
Get off your high horse.
---
In vanilla? I don't think there is a way to solo him in classic.
---
but....gw2 suffers from the exact same problem with less players lol. skill lag can make fights unplayable in t1/t3
---
[https://imgur.com/a/uXcYNqu](https://imgur.com/a/uXcYNqu)
---
I got it working fine on my Rogue, but my bank alt seems to have a lot of issues with theirs.  Tried resetting to default and trying different profiles etc but nothing. Anyone got any tips
---
Yeah... I defended blizz when they got ddos'ed with that argument because that's another issue entirely, but traffic created by the game should be balanced so the server can handle it... It's poor design to put too many players on a server to handle.
---
they have [wowprogress.com](https://wowprogress.com) for retail
---
i don't think they have one for classic but mc/ony are pretty easy, the race for world first on those was more of a race to see who could get 60 the quickest
---
Freezing band is nasty in pvp.
---
If it's me I get the epic mount, but your biggest upgrade raid wise is robe of the archmage, it doesn't get replaced for a very long time.
---
I att least found LW profits very bad without any special recipes, but I was Dragonscale. 
---
I guess you can still farm Devilsaurs leathers if you keep skinning, and always do more runs for the dagger. Unless LW gives you some good bucks, ditch it
---
Definetly
---
*laughs in warrior*
---
I would love for that to be the case here!
---
I totally read ‚Äúspace race‚Äù
---
I'd say it takes about 10 days in-game time to 60 for a moderately knowledgable player. That's 240 hours. If you play 1.5hr each time it would be some 150 sessions, or around 4months, not accounting for rested bonus. This is kind of expected compared to the 1-1.5 month that it takes for a fairly active player. 
---
It's a long road, unless you put in the time you can't expect to be at the end of it quickly. But then again why are you in a hurry? You're behind the curve at the moment anyway, so why not enjoy the ride?
---
They use potatoes as servers and they cooked them self's when to many players start to pvp... Then it disconnects everyone and someone has to replace that hot potato whit new one. I think every realm needs atleast 2-3 potatoes
---
Knew what it was instantly because it's happened to me as a Druid tank a few times across several dungeons while leveling!
---
I never had 300ms latency in vanilla and i was on dial up. 
---
People back then simply couldnt be arsed to use consumables or enchant their gear, but bosses still fell because they were very loosely tuned. My guild back then had half of the raiders falling into this category and could still kill bosses in naxx. When TBC launched and the raids were made significantly more challenging they couldn't get past tier5 and eventually disbanded.
---
Nope, just nope
---
Just wait untill you have a couple of epic plate pieces. You can go -5g if you whipe alot and get unlucky rolls. 
---
Not that I ever die on my Warrior.
---
I'd keep it, really want 1 on my warrior but it goes around 1k on our server as well.
---
Everyone's leveling and gearing much faster than vanilla as well.
---
i've only heard of blues. i think for the higher lv. chests....maybe. but very low chance
---
There are more pug raids clearing MC/ony then there were even guilds clearing them in classic.
---
you can do brd stealth pickpocket runs as combat swords, it just takes a bit longer i've done it that way
---
&gt; Warlock particularly.
---
What's wrong?
---
Soo unless the group has 300+ dps (every dps, could require flasks) melee usually have to run out.  
---
One problem you might be having is that since melee are told to stay out of the fight, the mages/ druids might not be decursing you since it‚Äôs normally a waste.
---
I think it's more likely a server problem than everyone in my guild having a problem with their isp at the same time
---
BTW large pvp is not classic. In 1.12 people lag out as well NO CHANGEEEES!!!!!!!!
---
I can't remember. I did play in a Swedish guild in tbc though!
---
This is assuming you get arcane crystals. You could easily go 3-4 runs and not get a single one if you're truly unlucky.
---
Additionally; solo DM East runs are *fucking difficult*. Even the Method youtube video shows the guy dying more than once, and he has the raid gear to do it best.
---
Will you be topdps? No
---
Will you be useless? No
---
It really isn't hard to hold aggro with a mage. I have probably tanked like 80% of my dungeons with a mage
---
How stupid are you actually? I said "arcane power, frost"... Arcane power is the name of the last talent in arcane.. But suuure lets call that a frost specc. Holy shit.
---
Pyramid Scheme under the guise of the guild caring about you.
---
Yeah, I played on two different servers and didn't experience anything similar to what he's describing.
---
Odds of a resist followed by a dodge or parry are very low.
---
The main reason why I chose a Warlock this time...
---
Did Nostalrius have 12k online every day and big 100v100 (and bigger) battles at least 3 days of the week?
---
Because what we're seeing here are layered servers suffering from 15k+ players online at once with a huge battle going on. We don't see medium servers balking under the number of players.
---
If private servers had this much stress anyone who has ever worked with online traffic knows they would lag and crash.
---
I know it's funny for some to parrot how two basement dwellers could do a better job through donations than a multibillion dollar company but let's not be fucking idiots and believe this to be true.
---
I have those too. I guess i will go with epic mount, even tho i usually stay in orig undercity zf brd
---
Thanks for the offer, I'd have my epic mount if i spent more time on my main, farming or dungeon crawling. I've just spent a lot of time recently on my alts! Thanks though
---
Tactical mastery and deep wounds are good pickups from Arms.
---
And contrary to a previous poster, I'd say deep Prot is definitely something you should have while raiding, at least if you are MT or OT. No problem for DPS specced warriors to slap on some tanking gear and be 3rd or 4th OT on some adds - that is old stuff - but Prot has its place, for sure. So many fury/prot streamer fanboys just try to rack down on it so they can stay in a DPS spec.
---
It seems insane to use one when my ping is usually 30ms with annoying spikes but maybe it will reduce them? Thanks I‚Äôll give it a try do you remember the one that worked for you? Already canceled my sub with 12 days left but would resub if I found a fix.
---
stonetalon is 0 0 in kalimdor, but the reason the boat ends up in stonetalon is because the boat is always under stonetalon and only software magic makes it look/feel like its moving.
---
Is it working? heard it was updating classic addons with retail versions
---
&gt;Also when we start collecting a small weekly "raid-fee",
---
that is not a good sign. if the guild needs cosumables or flask mats, that's what they should be collecting.
---
lvl 35 with 130g :D  would probably be lvl 60 by now if i didn't spend so much time fishing and flipping AH stuff.. :(
---
Actually this is my mage, but i do have a 60 warrior so I know the financial struggles of the warrior repair costs. lol I've got my mount money ready to go, i just thought this was pretty funny!
---
Looks like suf but not completely sure
---
By that logic, anyone not willing to tank or roll a tank is part of the problem, so I guess you also have yourself to blame.
---
Get over yourself.
---
You are wrong. I've played on 5 of the biggest private servers in the past 5 years and all of them has had populations numbering in thousands, and Nostalrius peaking at 15k concurrent players.
---
Me aswell located in Hamburg germany haha
---
Looks like Shadowed Unit Frames.
---
This right here.
---
Offered to run a lvl 56 guy through on my 70 rogue in BC. Mount dropped first run. Good times.
---
Not saying I've checked every fish but all I know through gold guides are undercut to all hell on my server.
---
Yea it sounds insane to me too. I've not much knowledge of how computers and net work to eve n try to understand the process. But I got your same problem. Every game was at 30ms wow at over 700. The one that work for me is called exitlag. I've been using it for a couple o months now and I play with 50 ms very smoothly. I even tried to disable it sometimes and when I do I go back up to 700. Hope this helps you mate.
---
I got 4 crystals today lol. Was a damn good day in burning steppes. Like 85 thorium, and around 25 dark iron.
---
Considering a team of 10 volunteer hobbyists ran a 15k pop server better than Blizzard I'd argue its **ACTUALLY A VALID STATEMENT**
---
Soul Link, a popular Warlock PvP build utilizing the last talent in the Demonology tree
---
It's almost like no matter the server, if it's not dead you'd have this exact same issue.        
---
This isn't retail where having a raid or multiple go against each other is a once in a lifetime thing
---
Why do you need a raid fee
---
If you have any big brand keyboard and mouse I think you can do it with the brand keyboard/mouse program. I'm sure razer have an heatmap-by-game feature, and it would'nt surpise me that every other big brand manufacturer have this.
---
Who are these Russians your talking about? A private server?
---
It would not be 50g each time thats exaggeration.
---
Also I can't understand why or how the guild would forcibly spirit rez? (And several times?)
---
ooof I'm in Un Goro currently but i always get other gems no arcan :(
---
World PvP.
---
Sure.  So can a good hunter pet.  It doesn't make it optimal.
---
hasnt anything to do with servers but the engine own fault if you play on high pops
---
sell your gold, it's going to go down in value.
---
Private server small time hobby bois with 10k euro could run a 15k pop server. Meanwhile gargantuan global conglomerate blizzard with **BILLIONS OF DOLLARS** at their disposal are not able to handle it.
---
Classic wow has been out for 15 years? Classic wow was never on private servers that ran better than official servers? Classic wow phase 2 has been out 15 years? Wow that‚Äôs crazy!
---
Community: No changes, 1 month later, Omg it's lagging reeeee that's not how my private server was reeee.
---
How do you want them to just "fix it"? No easy way to do it.
---
And yes, I understand i will be downvoted for calling out the people who want changes as soon as it suits them. 
---
I sink with this ship.
---
It depends entirely on whether the mage is a moron or not.
---
An add on exactly like existed in vanilla and then some. You could write way more powerful scripts in vanilla.
---
it's always been about a balance. heavy phys dmg fight? stack armor. heavy magic dmg? stack stam and threat. 
---
don't forget about consumes. stoneshield pots, armor elixirs, and scrolls can make up for wearing hit gear.
---
Every weapon skill over enemy defense gives you +0.1 to hit, crit, lower parry, lower block, lower dodge. Mobs cannot block or parry from behind.
---
If difference between weapon skill and defense is greater than 10 (level 63) then your first +1 to hit from talents or items doesnt count. Orcs, humans and rogues doesnt suffer this penalty because of racials or talents.
---
If enemy is 3 levels higher then your attacks have 40% chance of glancing blow which deal reduced damage. Every point of weapon skill reduce this effect by 2% and lowers damage reduction. This means that going from 300 to 301 is more impactful than going from 310 to 311.
---
Critical strike chance is calculated as last. So if your attacks have 40% chance to miss, dodge, parry, block and 40% chance of glancing blow and 27% chance of crit. Your crit chance will be reduced by 7% to 20%.
---
Overall having +5 weapon skill is much more important than +10 and +15 is nearly useless. This only applies when fighting level 63 enemies.
---
#NOCHANGES
---
Mad cause wrong
---
&gt;Which pservers did just fine.
---
Is that a question?
---
I decided to stop reading about opinions and I'm just going to respect deep prot at around 55 (11/5/35) because as you said every one and their mom have a different opinion on best build to tank and in-fine I prefer to be safe to heal for my mate healer. I'm still open to advice and such but with explanation instead of just parroting.
---
Yea i know Soul Link. Couldn't realize it's shortening :)
---
Where's the money come from? Is it just vendoring her loot or what
---
It doesn't really work. I think mostly because a large amount of gamers. Especially all us dafties playing classic wow. Given half a chance we'd sit playing all day all night and come back for more 2moro.
---
I'm glad my partner isn't a gamer. Keeps my life in balance. My ex was and in the end it didn't work out despite both of us loving videogames. Just my opinion ofc but the gamerchick dream is a flawed one.
---
Initially there were two EU PVP servers and both filled to max nearly instantly. Are you saying that the solution would‚Äôve been for everyone on server A to reroll on server B and everyone on B to reroll A? Or do you just not know the facts?
---
Why do you have two mice?
---
Why the fuck ban tempest, one of the few competent guilds, I'm assuming it's salt from lost chapters gm (that uses ony tank trinket)?
---
And running 100m in 9.58 seconds is also easy, because people have done it. /s
---
KYP
---
&gt; extremely tilted when being farmed 
---
A PVP server might have been the wrong choice my guy, but stick it out, I just imagine all the end game zones are going to be swaming with 60s looking for easy honor.
---
Current servers in their most busy days were 8k - 16k on german realms. I don't know if there are realistic numbers after the mid of september, because the numbers seem unrealsitic after september 20th (perhaps blizzard changed something so the counting got harder/impossible).
---
I'm pretty sure there are servers with more players, than the german ones
---
It's morning , 9-10 AM in Europe, but still it's a wasteland compare to what it was a 3 week ago when I took a break.
---
There's barely people here.
---
strange how it worked better on some russian dude mom's basement private server than on official servers, though.
---
I'm having the exact same problem. I just don't have enough hit, considering swapping out my mitigation legs and gloves for the devilsaur set for +2%
---
This makes sense. If he is in a guild with 10 mages and 8 mages get a spot (for example) and his guild want to clear fast they probably take the 8 mages with the highest dps. 
---
I agree otherwise with you. The content and rotations are super easy. It‚Äôs more about having the right gear.
---
yeah right now in 2 hrs we do every bit of end game content
---
BWL will add to that for a bit but it's really not that bad
---
Are you one of the people saying that small server are going to be dead after 2 weeks and that they must roll on the already full server?
---
If yes I‚Äôd call that karma. Else you should have chosen a smaller server :)
---
Horde on Stalagg,  Grizzly is KOS for a good amount of horde for good reason
---
That really is a stupid answer.
---
First, (most) people use the mousewheel for other keybinds (I use up, down, and alt+up and alt+down for hunter mark, barrage, gnome engineered boots and gnome engineer belt.
---
Second, right-click autoshot allow you to use the same key for attacking in melee or shooting when you can, it allows you also to shoot at target with online one action, while using any other keybind takes two actions : targeting (either with tab or left click) then autoshot (in your case mousewheel) which is exactly why right-click autoshot is very useful. 
---
Anyways.
---
On Shazzrah where I play its currently 09:51AM here and its jammed packed
---
Old gem yo
---
Because too many idiots have been spamming "no layering" since before Classic even launched, thinking they know better than the developers.
---
if blizz allowed server pop to go beyond what they are capable of handling, than once again it's a fault of theirs, so I don't see how you would be defending this
---
AHK is not bannable, using it to bot is.
---
4K for a ring? Lol. Guess then warrior bis weapons will go to 10K.
---
We ran 15 man ony splits last week. We're like the rank 30 guild on our server :D
---
Yes reroll. You can‚Äôt redo quests like this
---
The big short, anyone?
---
the best servers peaked at 11k+ all the time.
---
Classic servers are not even close to 10k.
---
I'll leave it to you to be ignorant ^^
---
Encountered this in LBRS twice, first time was at the same spot as this video and somehow the trolls below the floor got pulled. Second time was at Urok Doomhowl when scorpions in the nearby cave got aggro'd soon after the encounter began, forcing us to break the CC and AOE everything down. Ended up running out of mana just as Urok appeared but thankfully he didn't despawn.
---
Fireballs very nice explained.
---
Now WE can kill her without letting our healers die due Aggro from onyxia.
---
Thank you
---
Over 140 clams and I didn‚Äôt get 1.... so pissed
---
Joined a random pug on my alt earlier tonight and the two tanks stacked for fireballs. I couldn‚Äôt believe how smooth it went into p3. now I see this thread and it all makes sense...
---
It does if you resurrect at the spirit healer.
---
8hrs of sleep? Havent had that many sinde 2013 haha
---
As other posters have pointed out, this is not really a done thing. If some people are farming and contributing mats, collect and codify those instead. 
---
Everyone should be getting their consumables and buffs for raids, but stashing up mats is a clever thing - have never seen guild banks stash up gold via "raid fees" however. 
---
Is ClassicGuildBank working out well?
---
Nostalrius did things like that to make it work, they reduced the view distance and a few other things too to reduce lag and make the server more playable.
---
It would have been funny as a copypasta
---
The how might not be as interesting. Fact is that there's a lot that goes into this, private servers, for example, collect very little (pretty much none) telemetry. They didn't even attempt to do much of the "ping correction" that retail does. And the list goes on..
---
Damn I totally forgot about this
---
Good play bro
---
&gt; I ran a heroic dungeon to see how long it would take and halfway through my wife wanted to take a shower. 
---
I mean, dungeons only get hard from +5 onward. Hell, I'm pretty sure I can solo most Heroic dungeons on my prot pally.
---
Leveld as herbalism on my shaman, had 120g by the time I was lvl 38, without going out of my way to herb whilst not questing at the same time, while also learning all spells
---
Stop trying to hit me and hit me!
---
Look at how hunters used to lay traps in Vanilla vs how they do in Classic. They could practically do it while running, while we have to leave our keyboard, wait, launch FD, wait, pray that it actually drops combat, then smash the macro to get the trap laid before whoever is attacking you puts you back in combat. That's garbage.
---
I did the "30g if you pass" and the other guy immediately accepted. Good times :D
---
It's possible to do it, but will likely require some preparation. I've already done a Scholo run in Classic with a Shaman tank without any issues and have tried it several times on private servers before that.
---
On my first play play through ever and rolled a warrior (didnt know any better). Enjoying it but level 37 and have 55 gold or something, repairs are a killer alright. Trying to Smith and sell golden rods seems to work well, unless anyone knows a better plan for me?
---
People are blaming the modern client saying that it's not optimized and to make up for it everything is run on shards. You can see that Classic zones are shards. This is why you lag at the bottom of the hill when you step over the line into BRD when there's a battle. That shard is straining to carry the load that the Burning Steppes shard isn't sharing. 
---
I'm no tech but if that is right then this isn't a #nochanges thing. Changes made to the client are causing this. I think you are right though that there is no easy fix. It would take time and resources to deal with this and it doesn't look like those are things Blizz cares to invest in their game.
---
I‚Äôm thinking fishing is the backdoor banger
---
Gonna attempt 1-300 tomorrow
---
One person conditioned to taunt and mocking blow
---
The mage sees him and yells "nub, pull more!"
---
Scrubs, they aren't even chaining in a Flamestrike to get even more of those sweet, sweet numbers on their screen?
---
The thing is, if you actually we're good and wanted to see the end game and progress, you'd be 60 a long time ago. 
---
Assuming an average of 3 hours p/day (some nights less, more on weekends) you should have hit 60 mid October. Do the dungeons with your relevant preBiS drops + attunements on the way, and you're pretty much raid ready a short time after hitting 60. Even assuming you do no end game dungeons on the way up, that's still 2-4 weeks of gearing up and attuning. That means you should be stepping into ony/MC now or in a week or two. 
---
That still gives you 3-6 months of farming MC and Ony before BWL comes out.
---
While Blizz should absolutely consider the general player bases progression, you being bad isn't something they can or should cater to. Especially considering that you want to clear the end game.
---
You cant really "go ham" with dots though and the op's spell power is very low. By the time youve dotted *one* target with both corruption and agony, the tank has thunderclapped and demo shouted, by the time youve dotted another target, the tank has also sundered twice on 2 different targets. See what im getting at here?  
---
The problem was the tank being shitty.
---
Just go mangos at this point blizz.
---
So BWL asap?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw&amp;t=
---
this is from a private server and they could manage world pvp without lag
---
Better gear up 2 tanks, what if you cant make a raid or you are ill or something
---
I mean it course, a private server doesn't have nearly as much traffic as official servers
---
well thats because Blizzard made the in my opinion INCREDEBLY stupid decision to delay BG's.
---
Just use the infinite money cheat code on Robinhood.
---
what happened to the last post about this? and the video became private.
---
Nah, it's not like they should wait for every player to reach full t1 before next set of content is released. It's okay for players to be on different levels of character progression.
---
What's your played time?
---
He was just talking about his experience... most people couldn‚Äôt give a fuck about karma. No need to shit on him.
---
What are you practicing? Every boss fight in classic has like 3 abilities of you can't handle mc and ony while maintaining a dps rotation maybe raiding isn't meant for you...
---
I‚Äôm a pala good gear for all 3 spec maybe except dps , I advertise pala lf work any role got ask to heal arena runs said sure if I can roll on chest got invited should try it more often.
---
Private servers are an easier environment to get gear. This is fact
---
Thanks for recommending it. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find you there too. You seem to know the daily ins and outs of the daily post over the last 15 years on the official forums. Glad to have you here now, as a very valuable member of this community! Keep bringing all the positivity.
---
Of course an allience person is a grammar bully.
---
They're pretty similar, tbh. The abundance of SP gear, and removal of garbage items is a big part of why people are breezing through MC and Ony.
---
Aye that just sounds silly. I've 2manned it with Mage + Hunter easily, and it can be solo'ed by Hunters aswell. Sounds like a healer with some unrealistic expectations.
---
"We got limited sharding so everyone can play" no stop that's bad. "OK no more sharding but large queues so servers are at a reasonable size" no queues, queues bad. "OK no more queues and no sharding" blizzard bad why servers so big. The servers can easily handle tens of thousands of people, just not tens of thousands of people in one place, because math is a thing.
---
Not to my recollection. If your guild logs the raids, you could compare your own rotations, downtime, buffs etc against other players of the same class and with \~comparable gear (by that I mean you can't really compare your own damage to a fully Tier-decked and purple guy if you're in all blues, or you can but it will be meaningless) and see what you can do to improve.
---
That has more to do with your rotation though, and less with managing raid alerts and timers. You should be confident enough in your own rotation and playstyle to be able to manage that without watching much else than the boss positioning, yourself and your surroundings + raid alerts. If you are a caster, you get 2-3 seconds of time during every cast to watch what's happening, if you're melee, you probably just spam 2-3 keys anyway and can watch what's happening.
---
If you want to run a lot of dungeons, you'd be most useful as holy and healer is currently the most saught after role, so you'd basically get get dragged into a dungeon as you raise your hand. But it's up to you really, if you want to be ret then stay ret or prot or whatever, rather than being holy and going through the hassle of rolling on both healing and damage gear to respect later.
---
First, threat would only be good if you had a big stack of a single class (that's how greater blessings work)
---
Second, it is nothing like a taunt. Taunt puts your threats to the exact same level as the aggro bearer and force the mob to attack you for a bit. It has potentially infinite scaling and will always put you on the top of the aggro table no matter the threat differential between you and the aggro holder. Blessing threat is finite, depending on your group comp. It is nothing like a taunt.
---
than*
---
You're the one thinking classic is hard though.
---
You reckon? We do epgp and while i can see getting my set pieces as theres about 3 other shamans. Im not convinced ill have the weapons or cross class needed items by then and i raid every week.
---
Yes they did.
---
I was in Orgrimmar last night, on Firemaw, I tried to Hearthstone out.. nothing happened.
---
I sighed and began running to the zeppelin. 
---
3 and a half minutes into my HS cooldown I got a loading screen and appeared in Kargath üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy tbh, only like 3 mega servers are effected at all.. 
---
Minority is having a complain as normally happens against the less vocal majority.
---
back in 2005 the lag was far worse than it is now even with fewer people
---
From what you say prot/ret is the way to go if you want to do a lot of regular questing and the occasional dungeon. Till BRD tanking will not be very Hard.
---
I go holy/prot with consecration and just spam dungeons as healer or tank. Works very good. Make sure to get 21 in prot and rest in holy.
---
At least that worked for me. People are very pleased with my tanking performance so far.
---
Feel even better about my first trip to strat now. Got the cape AND shadowcraft pants off him in the only visit I've made in classic.
---
They had even more
---
What class do you play
---
This assumes that during these 20s, the bosses melee swings don't lag as well. Can we know for sure that this is the case?
---
Wrong.
---
If they insist on maintaining their own data centres, they should do a better job at scalability. Nowadays server power is not static and most if not all public/private cloud providers give you this basically out of the box. You don‚Äôt have to implement your own load balancers and autoscaling groups. That‚Äôs why it boggles my mind how this is still an issue for them and why they can‚Äôt just move to a third party cloud solution and be done with it.
---
Raiding fee is not a good idea in my opinion ...
---
In case you are using a DKP/EPGP or any other Points-lootsystem, you can Award a small Bonus on those Points for People donating some Money for the guildbank. Of course make that a cap per week or something and dont make the Bonus to huge.
---
How is Firemaw a mess? I'm on Firemaw and I think it's a great server. A high population is a good thing, unless the queues are a dealbreaker for you.
---
Roll classic PvP server, start leveling so she will be in STV when p2 lands. Give it to her raw and unlubed.
---
Not only that, but it has a Forge *AND* Anvil right beside the AH/Mailbox, and you can move between them without even demounting. I've made so much gold just buying ore and smelting it right away only to sell it on for profit.
---
Well, she even warns you for it...she may steal your heart and vanish afterwards.
---
that was blizz plan all along actually. Remember the you think you do but you don't : he was actually thinking we know you do, but we don't
---
They don't want us to play classic, it's not making enough money. No microtransactions, too hard to be addicting for standard people, unlike retail where you always have a bunch of easy daily things to do, creating even more opportunities for you to want to spend on microtransactions.
---
They didn't want to make classic, but somehow they finally did : why ? Maybe some higher ups in actiblizz, over blizz president, noticed a lot of people were willing to pay money for this game and figured why not do it for some extra income ?
---
Or maybe it was created as a gateway drug for retail, and as such classic will never be made as good as it could be. It will be sabotaged, always just enough to frustrate people into maybe trying out retail "maybe it's not so bad", "at least I have no queue, I can play something because queue for my classic is an hour long anyway I wont be able to raid with my guild tonight so might as well try"
---
If I were blizz president, the one who said you think you do but you don't, and I wanted to make as much money as possible, that's what i'd doing anyway. I'd be releasing classic, but making it not good enough to enjoy, and try my best with tactics devised with a whole team made for this purpose to frustrate as much % of classic playerbase into trying retail where retail is the real money maker
---
Reeeeeee organise your bags
---
I've purchased +21 wrist and +20 cape from AH, much easier than going for the drops since they are pretty rare.
---
To come back to your original question, I'd go for the epic mount.
---
First, You need to be certain that the rotation you do to DPS is optimal. There‚Äôs guides for that. Next step is to practice that rotation with things happening around you. The place for that is normally dungeons.
---
The thing in vanilla though is that there are not to many bosses around in dungeon where you can practice the raid boss mechanics at full. What you can do however if you are a standin one week is to you should join a pug. Pretty much just to practice. With time you get more comfortable with your class and your dps will increase.
---
A ‚Äúquick‚Äù fix to this problem is to get as many consumables as you can when you get a raid spot. That will increase your dps.
---
Isn't the hot call for front facing attacks something like 16%? Also she is more important than hit. You get attack per, and more importantly, crit. Crit doubles your threat and damage but also gets you more rage. 
---
As far as why most guides talk about mitigation over threat is because they expect on boss fights that you're using crowd pummlers, especially in mc where you're not hitting rage cap all the time in good mitigation gear. That weapon doubles your threat pretty much and as long as you have a good amount of agility, you're not gonna get touched on threat by anyone.
---
Are you also apeced for natural weapons in the balance tree? That's 10% threat right there, that's 2/3 the value per point as the best threat talent for bears. Hit is nice but crit is King for bear threat.
---
Well then I guess it's cool that 2 guys did what the whole collective tech world couldn't solve since online traffic was introduced.
---
I went basically same spec you are going at I think 54ish.  Was getting tired of not having some QoL stuff from prot.  So yeah people can parrot you can tank just fine as arms/fury! but the fact is it isn't fun and you are going to get frustrated.  When I went prot I never looked back.  Cheaper sunders, quicker taunts, being able to stun mobs, and spike-threat with shield slam were such quality of life improvements.  Also no longer had to worry about juggling between stances as much since I was able to stay in prot 95% of the time and not be locked out of key abilities (SS, whirlwind, etc) for those specs/styles.
---
&gt;in a 15 year old game that we all pay $14 a month for 
---
I think that's the problem. Blizzard doesn't care since the sub is for retail and in their eyes, Classic is just a bonus. Just another deceptive layer of tricks to try and herd people to retail.
---
You can stay arms for a long time, but at 51-55, I advice changing to prot. You want to have tactical mastery and shieldslam, it becomes much easier at that point to hold aggro and survive. But you sacrifice overworld farming and questing speed
---
Not immune, but unnaffeted by fear movement. In simpler words the feared mob with reckless curse on it doesn't flee, it stays in place, still beaing feared.
---
Similar to glyphs in wotlk where you could make some AoE fears work without them fleeing (i remember warriors' intimidating shout glyph function this way, instead of fleeing the tremble in fear)
---
Fine, i'll admit you may not have the best of everything by phase 3. But you do not need the best of everything to handle bwl easily. Not by a long shot.
---
To give you an example of how loosely tuned the bosses are, the individual dps requirement of patchwerk is around 400+. And this is naxx, not bwl. People are already doing way more than this dps even in blues and MC epics.
---
Got one on my 2nd rich vein, then never again.
---
Huh?
---
Looks fine to me
---
Blizzard broke the census addon shortly after launch, I don't think we've had any accurate numbers since then.
---
Also the fact that several private servers have managed to create servers capable of 200v200 pvp combat without lag. If some private server without billions of dollars can manage, so can blizzard. Its obvious the only thing they truly care about isnt the customer, it's their wallets.
---
Oh lawd...
---
I mean I can always log on my rogue and make her a corpse carpet (instead of roses) if we get ganked, but I don't want to scare her away from enjoying herself.
---
Saying only certain people can join who are of a certain country... that‚Äôs racial segregation in a nutshell..
---
Let her try classic and retail and let her see what she likes the most. Would not play on private
---
Will you be playing together? Classic
---
Will she be playing alone? Retail
---
At least guide her to play hunter
---
Citation needed. We've seen queues as big as the population of nost.
---
Seems valid at first glance.
---
Can you elaborate on this please?
---
Does it have a question mark? No? Then it's not a question. Try reading the sentence again instead of spreading your mindless bullshit on here like it's fact.
---
The underlying technology that the multimillion dollar company went with is inferior with high pop pvp to an illegal server operated in a Russia... that is a joke
---
Here we go again. People being sore about raid fees/taxes. 
---
We used to do that on retail vanilla, back in the day. Somehow, all of reddit opposes the idea. /shrug
---
not if you die, but it does if you spirit rez
---
"You get to have a pet"
---
That's an easy selling point.
---
Your keyboard is broken
---
"The technology just isn't there yet"
---
Epic Mount, nothing comes close
---
Yeah, nothing in classic is hard except for the fact that you need to actually gather 40 people and have them be prepared for raid.
---
The biggest problem our guild has is having 40 people ready to pull on time, meaning that the 20.00 first pull never happens before 20.20.
---
The rest of the bosses are a piece of cake, since they are so easily tuned that even if half your raid dies, you'll still down the boss.
---
Not being able to get nodes, herbs, quest mobs etc. was super annoying. :-)
---
I'm not a private server apologist, I LOVE Classic.
---
Of course there were queues. That doesn't mean the number of concurrent online numbers are that high.
---
Is the mage talent "Shatter" additive or multiplicative? I.e. if I have a base crit chance of 10% and 5 ranks in shatter and casting on a froze n enemy, do I now have 60% crit chance or 15%?
---
Also, where can I see my base spell crit chance?
---
Yep i think that is a Silithus quest
---
Wait seriously? Private servers of all things could handle more players?
---
I guess no one gave that dude the memo that everyone and their mother rolled a healer this time around. Maybe in actual vanilla healers were royalty, not anymore.
---
Having gold in the bank makes things much easier later on. Maybe you need a few ingots more for your thunderfury, just buy 'em from other guilds from the gold you have collected. Or need frost resist gear? Just buy frozen runes from the auction house. 
---
Most people don't realize how expensive the later raids are, because all they ever did was MC and they currently clear MC without any consumables whatsoever. That's not gonna be possible with AQ40 or Naxx.
---
So, given that you're playing a rogue, I can probably provide some assistance in terms of boosting your DPS.
---
What's your current gear? Specc? Race? 
---
Are you timing your instant abilities with your MH weapon swings?
---
Only took 57 minutes.  Easy farm.
---
Try and normal 40v40 and see for yourself how playable it is, regardless of the realm.
---
*Here‚Äôs a hint: not very*
---
How do you like the kinesis keyboard? I was looking to buy one, but they aren't easy to get ahold of in my country. It will likely run me $300-400 to get one with the wrist and angle mount sent to me.
---
does yours come with the tenting standard, or did you have to buy it?Also.. Cherry mx brown?
---
sounds like a legit horde quest, kill a bunch of animals that dont have standard body parts
---
You are just slow. Stop hiding behind the word casual. You can have the fullest social life and a demanding job but still be 60 at this point...
---
your mom is better than nothing
---
The problem with gold guides is that other people read them too and in some cases it leads to those prices plummeting making the guide useless.
---
An alternative is killing lots of beasts, most of them drop grey items that are worth a bit and those prices never drop.
---
Not unless you're zoomed all the way in to first person.
---
Oh yeah, i too remember trekking the catacombs as an 8 year old, being equal parts nauseous and intrigued seeing all the torture equipment. Then i reached level 4 and found that pool of blood, and thought that it was something truly scary. Then, when i entered her room and she came hurtling out of the shadows, i legit got so scared i died on the spot (well, in the game). Good times.
---
Server data including drop rates were imported from backups of vanilla.
---
I noticed everyone started migrating from SW to IF.
---
Enhance Shamans have the same problem that Retribution Paladins have. They are super fun or lame at high levels depending on procs.
---
Rogues are very much so more consistent and reliable. Equal amount of skill ceiling, much lower skill floor (for PvP.)
---
Yep, this is how you get 50-70% of your level in this zone unless you are very lucky. I would do some dungeons and skip that shithole.
---
But how do we know that the private server's drop rates are realistic?
---
Sorry, I'm not used to speak english and that sentence made no sense to me, so I asked. I don't get what I did wrong by asking and why you're rude. 
---
I do server warehousing on very large scales and try to be objective here. If I read the coments on most subreddits, I don't see much objectivity, most times it's just company bashing
---
In the end it is mostly world buffs and max consumes. DMT buffs + ONY head + songflower with death wish popped will get you so much rage that you can pretty much heroic strike all MH hits. The HS bug feature will help with rage for off-hand hits, but when you look at parses there is not much HS cancelling going on. HS is a very high percentage of their damage sometimes even higher than autos.
---
The only conclusion is being min-maxed on consumes/WBuffs gives them a really strong rage gen that allows them to HS more. Also to understand the insanely high DPS numbers they pull off, you have to understand that their whole raid is consumed up to the brim, they get some boss fights under 30 seconds which means furys get to spend the whole fight with death wish active. Even if you personnally would get all those buffs/consumes and played the rotation perfectly you might not end up with similar DPS if the rest of your raid isn't also min-maxing.
---
If crowd funded devs running a private server from their basement could handle hundreds of players fighting, there‚Äôs no excuse whatsoever that Blizzard themselves can‚Äôt.
---
And you don't think this amount of people will gather on one place in p2 where it actually will matter that every spell you cast will be delayed by 5 seconds or more, say for example for fucking world bosses?
---
Epic mount dude. It's the biggest game changer, esp with P2 coming in.
---
If you guys seriously expect blizzard to change WoW whether it be classic or retail to better or improve PVP in any form you're a fool. This is the same company that took WoW from what it was in Wrath to what is now in BFA where essentially no one plays it at all. The same company that fucked their game up so badly that you can't even have a 40 v 40 on retail with out 4 to 5 seconds of input lag.
---
IIRC WPVP battles were incredibly laggy in vanilla indeed and servers were crashing multiple times. Non-laggy WPVP was on private servers which isn't the experience Blizzard is trying to recreate with #nochanges attitude. I mean they have even imitated latency issues from vanilla with spell batching, so their server behavior might be intentional.
---
\#nochanges
---
This is why I always reserve the mount when I start Strat UD groups. I don't have any problem finding people willing to go, though the fact that I'm a tank and there's a tank shortage in 5 mans certainly makes it easier.
---
the raid UI is default raid UI + HealComm
---
Isn't it just regular Blizzard raid frames?
---
Used a variation of that : Hey guys XXX is fake afk at the entrance. Can you help me report him using /afk XXX so that it signals him
---
40 v 40 is fine from what I've seen.
---
This video is quite clearly not 40 v 40 though is it.
---
Yeah phrasing isnt the best, sorry.
---
Go Prot. Farm the fuck out of sorrow hill. Pull 4-5 mobs at a time or more of your comfortable.
---
You have a healer issue. But 3k on gheddon seems high, was it one of the pulses? 11k  ac and 7k hp is better than a warrior in full raid bis at the moment I'd say.
---
Holy shit thank you for finally saying it.
---
Too many people give way too much leeway, I can‚Äôt possibly wrap my head around defending a corporation, especially one as slimy as Activision Blizzard, when they‚Äôve done nothing to remedy the situation and have only fallen extremely short when delivering an authentic Classic WoW experience.
---
It‚Äôs fucking embarrassing, and anyone working at Blizzard should be ashamed of themselves.
---
Is there anywhere that Blizzard lists the known bugs they are aware of? I am just having trouble with the *Hints of a New Plague?* quest but not sure if the courier is bugged or if I am just missing them.
---
Meanwhile private servers can run 200v200 smoothly and wow in 2005 could run them smoothly.
---
I played all roles on my pally up to 60 with concentration, improved righteous fury, and the rest of my points in the ret tree. If you have the appropriate gear, there is no need to respec until you start getting to the harder dungeons (ubrs, scholo, strat). If you‚Äôre not planning to quest much and are going to focus on getting ur pre-bis during the rest of your journey to 60, then you should respec to make things easier on yourself and your party. That being said, kill speed out in the world as prot is not much different than ret while leveling, as you kill 3-4 mobs in 1 pull as prot then drink/heal while ret you just chain pull single targets. Either way just do what seems most fun to you
---
So far I'm pretty pleased with it. I've reached out to several online retailers asking if they could purchase this specfic keyboard and for what price. I ended up purchasing the keyboard including the lift kit, shipping and taxes for ‚Ç¨300,-
---
The Cherry MX Brown are nice, but I could have gone with something even lighter. This is my first modern mechanical keyboard and just went with the most standard keys.
---
Eve died bro, uninstalled it when classic came out.
---
Wile classic requires considerable amount of grind, it's finite. Not the case with retail: You can play all day every day, just doing same shit over and over. And that's something I will simply not do.
---
What are the Druid tanks doing that the Warriors aren‚Äôt? I‚Äôm a tank for my guild and it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm doing more work. Less really. Don‚Äôt need an MCP with a bit of threat gear, and have a ton easier time adding in resist gear than the warriors.
---
But not more fun. Rather devoid of any feeling of fulfilling rewards.
---
Scatter Shot, Feign Death, Freeze Trap, Aspect of the Cheetah, get out to your max (41yd) range.
---
You have now won. All you do is outrun him and keep a Serpent Sting on him and, eventually, he dies. Intercept only works if he gets close enough to use it, and since you move 30% faster than he does, he only gets close enough if you're bad enough to let him.

He's not your buddy, dude!
---
It kinda makes sense if your GM is to much of a wimp to tell people "No consumables, no raidspot" why should 5 people farm all the mats and consumables for the entire raid?
---
With battlegrounds right around the corner, what dungeons should mages be farming? Will it still be ZF or should I transition to SFK or Gnomeregan for twink items?
---
it's not about making them feel better. Everyone was a casual back there in vanilla, barely any exceptions.
---
This is very wholesome and trust me as a tank I notice when my friend who plays a rogue does anything.  Fantastic class to have in any dungeon group.

whiners
---
As a Healer myself, I envy you for being on a server where healers are in demand!
---
On my server it sucks, you need more time to find a DD, every group gets started by a Healer or is filled with it first because there are 5 people answering the first LFM :(
---
Those mobs are a shared spawn. Grind all of them and various amounts of boars, hyenas, and scorpions will spawn.
---
It's 2019 now and it's possible to play 500 ppl in the same area without lag, proof from private servers.
---
Sure, Blizzard deal with other things like battle.net and other server structures. But I'm quite confident the hardware and money put on 1 server in Classic is enough for every private server ever created.
---
They need to fix this, and they have 1 week to do so.
---
I dunno what it was, I was just stuck in place and couldn't move or cast anything :(
---
Yes, im not sure how other servers are but tanks are hard to come by in my server. I am currently a ret paladin and i heal just fine but i can't tank right now due to no items and some talents.
---
Thanks for the assist
---
My cat is too old to jump onto the desk now but before u looked away from the keyboard for one second and she would be laying down on the keyboard
---
"few hundred"?  Don't be an idiot.  There were more people on lights hope servers than on a classic realm.  At launch northdale had 18-20k concurrent for months at peak time.  Once it settled down it averaged 12k concurrent in peak for over a year.  There's no way classic realms are much larger than 12k.  Even the layered realms are likely smaller than this.
---
Is there a min level requirement for this, so that who you sell to doesn't aggro ogres
---
 But...DpS mEtErS bRo
---
Tell me about it. I can taunt and land 2 sunders and I will still fall behind a shammy on threat
---
It's definitely not. The hardest part is going to be farming consumables and maybe some gear checks. Raid-execution wise all of these bosses are hardly more than training dummies.
---
Warhammer Online when it was a thing. Except it lagged like hell.
---
&gt; WoW's network traffic and game mechanics are multitudes more complex than Eve's, so obviously it will handle these numbers even worse. The simple answer is that OP is quite literally asking for the impossible. There are stopgap measures that could be taken, such as drastically reducing view distance, but they will not fix the fundamental problem which is that it's simply not possible to smoothly have that many players on the screen at once given modern technology and the typical MMO architecture.
---

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw
---
Who the fuck cares?  The point is that none of this should be our concern.  Blizzard should do whatever is required to provide a decent performance, if they have network bottlenecking that's their problem to fix.
---
F, hope they can optimize the server quality.
---
In the meantime, I'm casually strolling on my pve server. :&gt;
---
I work as a server/network programmer at another rival game company. My guess is that the WoW codebase is a massively over engineered pile of spaghetti which has evolved and mutated slowly for like 20 years. For most of that time, they've been going in the direction of more and more phasing, probably unifying all their servers in the process. I'm imagining that everything is running in "the cloud", probably no dedicated hardware - all in the name of minimizing hosting costs.
---
All their software have been optimized for a world where people don't really see each other. Classic is literally just a hack to bring vanilla WoW on their modern software.
---
Writing a dedicated game server for vanilla WoW from scratch is fairly easy if you know what you're doing - you don't need to deal with 20 years of crippling technical debt. If you're just a couple of people working on it you can get a lot of work done really quickly. You don't need to worry about existing poorly designed spaghetti frameworks, you don't need to worry about existing customer support tools, you don't need to worry about business intelligence and data mining tools. You can keep it simple and efficient. Writing from scratch you can focus on optimizing everything for the big performance problem (giant pvp battles).
---
Of course, Blizzard should just have had a couple of senior programmers write a new Classic server from the ground up. But it doesn't work like that in a gargantuan global conglomerate.
---
Oh, and why is that racist if they decide on a criteria to join their guild? It's their right to do so, it's a game not world politics. 
---
Not sure if you're trolling or you actually believe this.
---
Unfortunately, dps classes this going ham on pull for top parse is *skill*
---
Unless it's got bad since I stopped playing my experience runs counter to this, it was a bit choppy visually but I never had input issues battling against Silverpine years ago.
---
So you're saying that the servers need to go down some times aswell?
---
I do believe many games are using players uid to generate random numbers and forget about any risk that some players might roll a lucky/unlucky uid that will collide with the way they use the numbers.
---
I remember passing a low level crypto / security test on my first CS year where you had to use your student id with a bit of hash as a key. Mine was solving to 0 in 2 steps while some had to run the hash loop more than 10 times all by hand. A bit unfair if you ask me.
---
The numbers are random but the way we use them is not.
---
Is anyone raid healing as this spec? I imagine since the only chain heal talent we‚Äôre missing is the 10% heal effectiveness it should only perform    that much worse? I want to heal in raids but also farm without having to respec and wondering if this works
---
Didnt they mention this was partly due to classic being backported from retail wow which has an absolute mess of procs and different effects that has to be checked constantly and that retail isnt designed to have many players in one phase at a time despite being an MMO (lol)
---
Its not the bosses that are challenging but the trash
---
anyone saying something different hasnt taken a step in MC
---
It provides some extra little buttons for various abilities, only useful if you don't want rarely used abilities on hotbars.
---
It can give warnings for procs.
---
It displays your current count of soulshards.
---
It can sort your soulshards into specific bags if you prefer.
---
That is it off the top of my head, you will be fine without it.
---
Better to have 4 shadow instead of 4 arcane imo. I'd rather have my pet resist fear and dots rather than sheeps.
---
Also you need rank 4 stam.
---
This difficulty is the only reason pve-oriented players still play retail, no?

A pug that's actually recruiting for a DPS? I'm confused, I've never heard of that before.
---
I didnt mean literally standing around. Just not everyone using sappers and arcane explosions while all stacked up 
---
Had plenty of 40 v 40s with light aoeing and nothing is going wrong. Snuck into MC and saw 3 groups fighting and they weren't lagging, but it wasnt a worst case situation 
---
And you know what? It happens. No MMO has every made a situation like that lag free
---
That's exactly what i was told, read up on and seen in vids. With future raids, things are going to get very expensive, and i'd rather be on the early side of saving up for that. Also if everyone is ok with it, there won't be a problem.
---
Sounds like Goblin Rocket since you mentioned his Enginnering. It stuns you for a good 30 seconds or something. Real good in 1v3 scenarios
---
They had way bigger load my man. They reached more than 14,000 players online at the same time.
---
I would say they are the same, at least in a dungeon you are interacting with other people are there is a chance for good items. I kinda skip a lot of dungeons but tried ZF last night and people just want to farm GY which is crap for me. Finnaly someone made a party for a Q run and they told me I am too low lvl (I was 47)
---
Why is it hard? You can throw in more cores, RAM and disk to servers on the fly these days. Automatically depending on the load even.
---
#1 Hunters &amp; #2 locks have pets that makes solo play easier and allows them to solo certain parts of dungeons that other classes can't or would have great difficulty doing so.
---
#3 Mages can also solo a lot and can get around to any major city cutting down on travel time and make their own food and water.
---
#4 rogues, mostly because stealth and cc/cooldowns can go a long way to soloing stuff
---
The first 3 also have good leveling speed and all 4 are solid in 1v1 / solo pvp
---
Mages and hunters have an easier time grinding gold.
---
Autists unite
---
Not limited to horde. No idea how 100 murlocs can see me with 8 eyes between them.
---
I think you die and then switch to succ when you Rez lmao
---
Gz! My server horde side already got 6 finished hands of ragnaros
---
&gt; PS LEVEL YOUR LOCKPICKING" 
---
Easier said than done haha. Kidding, I'm with you, my credo is, play the class to play the class not to gear. (Of course I want shiny loot but hear me out first). 
---
Loot won't make my game experience in terms of what I can do with my class different just **more efficient**. I love playing rogue, I can Sap, Blind, Cheapshot, Gouge, etc, etc. I can be an asset to the team, help the healer conserve mana, in an emergency pull aggro from heal and evade to gain time for the tank for him to catch up the stray mob etc.
---
This is all pretty doable before you hit pre-raid BiS or BiS and it's fun aswell.
---
Northdale. enough said lol
---
That's fine but I didn't get anything else than stones and thorium ;)
---
Real talk tho why would literally anyone care to see this?  It's not some crazy rare thing it's not one of the first it's just an item dropping
---
Thanks for the info. I've heard a lot of different answers as to what the actual droprate is in classic. Some people have said as low as 0.02%, others more like 0.2%.
---
This is done on a private server though.
---
Drop rates are just a guesstimate due to bad data.
---
Might be a lot worse than what this shows.
---
I Love how suddendly everyone is a specialist into delivering software at scale..Personally I don't think the issue are the server not beign good enough, but how the client is handing the load and which choices of optimisation has been coded with. Because I'm pretty sure that if this client was meant to be an 8.2 client, has been optimised in a layer and sharding optic, so might not be an "hurr durr" fix like a lot of you are saying, or just an upgrade, wow is an extremely complex software that has many point of failures if you start changing things randomly, I'm pretty sure that there is a bunch of smart engineers on the problem that are figuring out what is the best course of action to take to deliver the wanted customer experience, just be patient...
---
LFR, almost all fights you can just ignore mechanics and plow through. MC, you have to do the mechanics or you will wipe. The mechanics are pretty simple, and when they're done properly it's a breeze - but aside from Garalon &amp; the like, that's still more challenge than LFR presents.
---
I play on a medium server and do big scale WPvP fights regularly. Transfered from a high/full pop realm because of the lags.
---
Same people crying in this thread that wpvp is unplayable are probably the same ones who think if you're not playing on a full server you're probably playing on a dead realm and didn't transfer. I have no sympathy for them.
---
Battlegrounds are still probably a few months away I think (I haven't heard any announcements yet at least).  It's only honor and world PvP coming next week. 
---
Personally I'd stick with ZF for now for gold and maybe transition towards sfk closer to Christmas.
---
Hell you don't even need action happening, ony head got turned in at 7:30 server so SW was jam packed and we could feel the lag while grouping up in RRM, as we started to make our way you could see the server visibly having latency issues with people rubber banding like crazy, then you link up with the 3 other raid groups and it becomes unplayable as you try and take BRM.

You should go for a LBRS wolf. They're lvl 56-57 and have all the spells you need maxed out.
---
Since wolfs are only used for raids, you don't absolutely need a wolf with a fast attack speed (overall dps remains the same).
---
Regarding cats, it's another issue. You want a fast attack speed against casters in pvp.
---
that resolution tho. is this what playing on a laptop is like? cripes
---
Blizzard is cheaping out on cost for Classic WoW.
---
They don't even want to mention the lag because they know they can easily fix it.
---
They know they have no excuses.
---
I use bite when soloing, as claw uses up all the pet energy leaving none for the taunt...
---
With a caveat, the only handholding I would do is make sure she keybinds. Let her develop it from day 1
---
Have you checked solo dm east warlock? Mage is not in all cases &gt; warlock.
---
Be herb/miner. Run around arathi highlands and mine/herb. Thats basically what you can do.
---
Classic Dungeons have a much simpler but more punishing design, that‚Äôs for sure.
---
No need to fish. Just grind tigers in stv for whiskers
---
It does make sense.
---
They knew there would be a huge hype the first couple of days/weeks. The servers still needed to have a healthy population after the first hype died. You're expecting them to be able to predict populations, but they can only guess.

Depends on what your definition of mad is. If by discussing on a forum and stating facts is being mad, then yes I am mad. If it is "feeling or showing strong annoyance, displeasure, or hostility; full of anger." then I'm not mad.
---
He's not your dude, mate!
---
Private servers were able to make battles happens with more playeres than in them than any classic fight has come close to, with little to no lag.. on community funded hardware... in 2016.
---
It's 2019 now, hardware today is more than twice as good.
---
I have been in all max level dungeons with shaman as tanks, and it has not been a problem at all, they does so much threat that the doses don't over aggro, only down side is they have to drink after every pull. But so does the mage. And it's by far easier to wait a few more min on drinking then spamming 30more min for a warrior tank
---
It‚Äôs much higher than 3%. It procs all the time. It‚Äôs probably same 10% proc as on private servers.
---
Sometimes the loads got pretty heavy. At the peak of vanilla P servers before classic dropped, 1.3 million active accounts across about 10 of the most popular servers. 
---
Blizzard has 2.3 million active accounts in the US servers. That's 40 realms. Private servers have just one server. 
---
So if you just evenly spread populations across each server it's about 57.5k per server. Let's say peak is about 60% of the population on at once, that's 34.5k on per server. 
---
On the private servers let's use the same math. 1.3M spread across 10 servers. That's 130k per server, let's take 60% of the population on at once for peak: 78k players on at once. 
---
Some private servers had way more than Blizz classic servers. There was no lag on my end with 50mbps internet.
---
1k gold isn't much. I'd suggest investing in items that will increase in price. For example I bought a lot of Black Lotus a while ago and they have doubled in price.
---
Any rogues that have levelled as sub after level 35? 
---
With P2 coming out, I'd like to enjoy the WPVP encounters as I level to 60, but was wondering how big a burden levelling as sub as, considering I've not seen a single person say anything but "level as combat or bust".
---
How big a time difference is sub vs combat? I can't tell if people are min/maxing, or it's equivalent to Resto Shaman vs Enhance Shaman levelling.
---
One thing that irks me is that the Warchiefs Blessing buff is announced to the Barrens but not cast there. It's like Thrall is yelling that everybody gets free candy but only to his select few cronies hanging in his crib.
---
A multi billion dollar company in the year 2019 (almost 2020) can't handle half the numbers a community funded realm in 2016 could.
---
If you don't think this is Blizzard's fault you're a moron.
---
Your own pc dying is not the same as the server dying. Personally I remember city raids in vanilla where there was no lag. On classic the server starts having some issues even with smaller city raids.
---
You need to take Blizzard's dick out of your mouth and understand that Blizzard's game needs to have a higher standard than the pet hobby projects of some euro nerds. You need to stop pretending as if these ""problems" cannot be solved or at least seriously remedied by blizzard. The mega servers STARTED with private servers who regularly squished 10,000+ concurrent players on their server. Large scale pvp involving hundreds were not uncommon. The fact that these experiences at even a fraction the scale is impossible in Blizzard's own game is Blizzard's fault. Not the fault of some fundamental physical limitation.
---
I find this super fascinating, thanks for sharing.
---
I still have trouble understanding how exactly you would navigate everyone in a raid, so I'd also check out your YT channel if you make one :) for example, in the baron geddon fight. Would you have to manually find the one character who is the bomb and move them out?
---
Father of 5. I quit retail after my first son and it was the destruction of the old talent system from vanilla that was the nail in the coffin. I hate it, there‚Äôs no soul in retail to me. They traded challenge and character for player convenience.
---
He's not your mate, pal!
---
Yeah it's crazy... We once raided org with 150 people, the server exploded the second we got in.. i spent 10min CASTING an arcane explosion and alt f4...
---
It worked great o p servers I played on. Either blizz hardware is a joke or the code is worse than that of people who code on their free time.
---
Endgame is overrun with tanks though
---
Server size doesn't really matter much. A lot of people no matter what server is going to run into this issue in phase 2 when they decide they want to try and kill a world boss.
---
World pvp on my server in vanilla in the beginning was in hillsbrad moving back and forth between the camps. It died down a lot and the honour system didnt do that much to change it. When BGs came, world pvp was basically dead.
---
you'll have fun while leveling - the game does not start at 60 - im looking forward to playing a little bit each day.
---
that said im currently lvl 33 - rerolled once though/abandoned and 30+ ally mage to play with rl friends on horde side.
---
i am playing 1-2 hours a day, 4-5 times a week.
---
&gt; ... I could go on and on. 
---
You kind of have, you've replied the same thing twice.
---
Is that a feeling you have? Its been tested to 3.21% +/- 0.802 over 27927 hits.

---
&gt; several private servers have managed to create servers capable of 200v200 pvp combat without lag
---
Serious question, how commonly busy were those servers? I know people talk about "thriving private server communities" but I'd be surprised if those servers were actually as busy as Faerlina is today.
---
Private servers had massive battles with 0 lag so people don‚Äôt understand how retail can‚Äôt handle even a simple 20 v 20.
---
It‚Äôs all about the thorium, baby
---
Don't know about it, but bug with Outhouse in WPL was fixed ~5 days after I reported it.  
---
Don't know if it coincidence or just luck.
---
you didn‚Äôt mention whether you dotted multiple targets when the tank was gaining threat which is quite important, by your level you should know warriors can‚Äôt really keep AoE threat so if you wasnt attacking his target and dotting everything in sight you‚Äôre obviously in the wrong. it‚Äôs your role to manage your threat so if you caused too much it‚Äôs on you.
---
Wonder what kind of people think classic is harder than retail. Probably those who never played retail endgame at all.
---
top level main tanks are all dual wield in raid
---
Does anyone know roughly what I need to run the game at maxed out settings, with no lag, via a 4k monitor?
---
I currently play on a MacBook Pro and it's like having the oven on.
---
I was looking to build a PC to play WoW Classic, and have not built one in a very long time.
---
Is there a recommended set of specs to achieve the above?
---
?  I said rank 4 frost so he doesn't sit in Novas which are insta cast or get snared from biting a frost mage.  By the time they cast a fear, they would have been chunked down significantly and then I'd pop Bestial Wrath.
---
For PvP, stam is useless.  Rank 4 stam is 10 stam which is 100 hp.  Cone of Cold hits for 1K+ at max lvl.
---
I call total bullshit. Show any proof you've been in a battle of the size without server lag.
---
Ironfoe has a proc rate of 3.21%.  
---
896 procs on  27927 with a PPM of  0.802

---
It's not great imo unless the herbs are worth way more on your server than mine.  The goblins super easy you just keep your dots on him kit up then jump off he casts 2 garbage abilities that basically just means he stuns himself for long periods of time cuz they'll never hit you.
---
Princess is immune to nature so you kill her entirely with moonfire it takes quite a long time (like 8 mins for me) but that could be brought down with better mana regen or more damage (I'm mstly in resto gear).  You just run in big circles and whenever she gets close enough to melee you go bear form eventually she'll do her dust attack and you get to max range during that.   When you go oom pillar kite her on the rock until you're max mana.
---
Hurr Retail Bad Classic Good burrrhrrr zugzug
---
Could you make a list of the gear [like this](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/ckErTY77vRLRUqSpqotAo7)? (My gear before yesterdays raid). Enchants as well are important. Don't skimp on crusaders, but getting downgraded versions of the other enchants is a possibility. Not spending all the cash for +8 agi on prebis head/legs is fine, but you should still get the 1% atkspeed. 
---
Assuming you're using the bog standard Combat swords build, so nothing to change there.
---
The timing is pretty important, so keep focusing on that. I assume you're using an add-on to track it?
---
SnD uptime is very important, but not necessarily for **every** fight. Making the judgement on trash for whether you should pop 1 point SnD, 2 point SnD or just burst SS into Evis, is important, and depends on how fast you're blowing through trash. If you're suddenly standing there with dead trash and 8 sec on SnD, you're wasting damage potential.  
---
Also, make sure you're popping CDs on trash, and using Bladeflurry well. 
---
Another issue is consumables. Mongoose, Thistle Tea, Firewater, Jujus, Squid, and Dense Sharpening stones for the elemental bosses  and the parts where all trash is elementals (even consider an Elemental sharpening stone for your MH on rag, for the raids where you need to max the logs.)   
---
On top of the regular expected survivability consumables (restorative, gapp, gfpp, major healing potions), I'd also recommend grabbing some regular fire protection potions (unless you're willing to spend a fuckton on GFPP) for the baron area trash. You do 0 DPS when you're dead. If the other rogues are dying more than you, you'll climb on the logs. 
---
One last tip, is to remember to pop Bladeflurry on the longer single target focus bosses, as well. Even if you're not cleaving anything, the 20% atkspeed is a free extra SnD.
---
Where are RP events announced on an RP PvP server and what are they usually about? Still didn't encounter any
---
No taunt, no plate, no mitigation abilities, only minimal high threat generating abilities that are all on cooldowns, no threat boost spell/form for all other abilities... shamans are not tanks and never were.
---
Well if they're doing that and you're not then that is 100% the answer to your question.
---
Wpvp of tjat scale won't ever work. Blizzard would have already fixed the issue if it was possible. In beta it only worked beamcause of really low over all population.
---
They really are. Only 1/10 warriors Ive grouped with could keep aggro on 3 or more mobs They have to resort to weird tricks that the average warrior cannot perform well.
---
Paladins just have ret aura on and press Consecrate and have all the threat in the world. And no problem surviving either (I am healer so I know).
---
Drax is my favorite char from Guardians of the Galaxy :)
---
On raggy, you can have the person logging stand too far away to get updates from people standing on the opposing side, so most of their actions will not be logged.
---
In every way except jank
---
What's the gph without big low% drops, atm?
---
So glad I quit this dumpster fire in September
---
Fuck world pvp , its boring :P
---
aw man, this was so funny. thank you :)
---
Faerlina is an outlier because of all the streamers on it. But several private servers had tons of active players. About 10 had very very solid active player numbers.
---
Umm, yeah, the dungeons where you have an instant 30m pull ability, which deals 700-800dmg are worse for a paladin, sure.
---
Yeah, there are a couple of annoying mobs with threat drops, manaburn isn't an issue, I mean the necromancers drain abiltiy can be dispelled. 
---
I've tanked strat ud and scholo many times without any issue and I usually I'm not even last in dmg.
---
On my server (mirage) most alliance sit in IF unless the onyxia head is being set up
---
They're different games hardly worth comparing at this point. 
---
I wish people would just stop.
---
This is the first argument I feel that actually would make sense as to why it seems to be much more difficult for Blizz to handle big world pvp battles.
---
I don't know if it's true though. Do you?
---
Blizzard also handled this batter in vanilla. Although a lot of people lagged themselves back then because of potato pc's.
---
Tanks cant even get away with this unless its Live strat for Orbs.
---
It's an issue on retail too. When a nazjatar battle starts, suddenly you go from no issue to unplayable server lag because of multiple raids phasing into the same shard, usually alliance on my servergroup since classic launched and I guess all the horde went there
---
Can't tell if zoomer or troll
---
One private server &gt; A whole cluster of cloud and physical servers counting the retail ones too . Of course if you had a single server you could do it . I feel like most people here work minimal wage and have 0 understanding of how technology works but they complain like they are the experts that know the fix
---
We'll likely see an early release of WSG within a month or so, dude.
---
Depends if your guild is willing to carry you or not.
---
I don't really see it as casual vs hardcore, I think it's more about how invested you want to be.
---
If you have the time and you like to get really invested in what you're playing, that is what classic is offering.
---
If you want fast food gaming that you can drop-in, drop-out, retail does genuinely offer that better than classic, you can get *something* done there quickly.
---
The downside for many people is that getting the thing done quickly and easily means there isn't much intrinsic reward for doing it.
---
Actually I mean healers being demanded more. At least on my realm and every other that friends are playing on.
---
They have a long respawn and if you miss her she fights the elite alliance pack on the road and dies making for another long respawn
---
That's because pservers have approximated calculations.  
---
This single difference in what formulas for damage calculation used on pservers and official could lead to big changes in calculation times.
---
This is the EXACT fight it happened on.
---
my rng purely SUCKS on taunting him out of the raid EVERY SINGLE TIME.
---
Its almost as if P2 should be delayed until this shit is cleared. But hey gotta excite people at blizzcon!
---
I'm 99% sure you're wrong. Large scale pvp worked perfectly fine in the beta. Now it's shit. It's not about the client, it's the servers.
---
I haven't wanted to believe this for so long. But man it gets more true every day.
---
Classic is a fraud
---
Maybe I didnt take all of that into consideration. My bottom line is this: in 2018, Blizzard Activison made 7.5 Billion in revenue. They have the ability to make the servers stable. They just wont until it starts to hurt their earnings.
---
You sound some what of lone wolf who doesn't spend all the time doing dungeons and raids with groups. I would 100% recommend warlock. I have been druid main since Vanilla and I do love this class. But especially in Classic druid is group class. We have huge potential to help groups with all kind of situations. For solo play warlock is just so much better and I would think more fun as well.
---
Yeah, golden pearl prices on Mograine make me cry.
---
No, I just don't understand that sentence, I'm not an english native speaker
---
You think you do, but you dont....it turns out that it was Blizzard that doesn't...
---
What is there to counter argue? You‚Äôre wrong.
---
There is no excuse that 3 EUs in a basement can design a better server than Engineers at Blizzard who make upwards of 200k+ a year and you can‚Äôt possibly refute that.
---
Bigger clump of players will lag the game - it's not your hardware. Aside of that mid-or-higher tier gamin PC will overkill Classic WoW. I'm using an ultrawide 3440x1440 display with Vega 64 and that setup is getting bored running WoW and gets more active with games like Witcher 3.
---
He's not your bro, son!
---
I've always wondered this, are we sure the private servers got all the values right? I heard some groups killed patchwerk in 2 minutes using partly greens. I'll agree that people were worse back then, but I have a hard time believing that the top guilds like nihilum were THAT much worse than your average player is now.
---
Don't see how you had a hard time if there were just you and one other person there - did the place with probably 6-7 others running around and still got it done. Took some rather aggressive tagging, though. 
---
Pretty great XP to be had there.
---
Just look up some vids. Venrukis has nice ones.
---
But the answer is yeah, at least more than the current minimum threshold that makes the server lag.
---
I lol'ed out loud when I was watching the Undercity raid from Swifty's POV, and all of a sudden \*POOF\*, everyone gets TPd outside by a GM. No fun allowed!
---
"rank 3 arcane"
---
You didn't say 4, but 3.
---
As in, "I could go on" and you did go on. So why even say I could go on in the first place.
---
I suspect the lag in Classic is due to how badly coded the game will be. Bad coding can get you from A to Z, IE produce the desired outcome but take the long route to get there. Pair this with more players than the original game (or specifically, the servers) ever handled and you can see results like this.
---
I fear one of the reasons Blizzard haven't even addressed this is because they don't have a solution. Re-coding original Warcraft could produce gameplay changes that don't represent what classic wow was.
---
Everyone can be 53 and you still be able to do arena.
---
You can kite them all ;)
---
Classic launched end of August, not at the start
---
i honestly dont get how private servers were running smooth... yet classic servers run like shit in mass pvp
---
This happened in vanilla. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a pretty authentic experience.
---
Who cares if people know how it works? If you buy a new car and you cant get third gear to work, but you know it works on other cars, are you not allowed to complain because you cant explain how a gearbox works?
---
I didnt type the comment, but your reponse is useless and doesnt bring anything to the conversation, unlike his. I rather have 17 of the same comment from him than 1 useless one from you.
---
They can do it, it's called layering. People hated it.
---
I have levelled an holy priest in 8 days played, holy till day 1. Played 2/3 hours a day.. Hardest part, for me, was 40-50 lvl range.. dunno why but seemed endless. 50-60 pretty easy thanks to brd - ubrs spam
---
The mechanic itself is super easy, but the punishment for failing is harsh. In retail it's mostly the opposite, the challenging mechanics who are an integral part of the encounter have no real punishment for failing them (in LFR). So it's basically "10 seconds to move out or you wipe" vs. "1 second to move out or you tickle your friends".
---
Yeah, you just can't keep it c:
---
Well that's what I call an epic mount
---
He's not claiming that classic raids are hard, just that LFR is even easier.
---
What will be the debuff limit on BWL bosses?
---
I don't want to tank because fuck classic tanking.
---
I got 17 crystals yesterday. It's RNG.
---
Fuck eskil
---
It is so amazing
---
, , , ,Bro
---
k that's just fucked up.
---
So I'm gonna assume that you want me to take no arcane resist and bump shadow resist up from 3 to 4?  No thanks, Mages also blink in and sheep the hunter's pet.  Not to mention aoe'ing w/ arcane explosions.  Shadow is less an issue for me than you're suggesting.  Anywho, back to sleep, have a great day.
---
i didnt lag like this in actual vanilla at tarren mill southshore playing on windows me on fucking dialup this is BULLSHIT
---
As others have said, it's always +5 on MH. As far as OH goes it depends on your gear. Until you're in full BWL gear there's no way you can reach the crit cap even with full pots, librams and world buffs. That makes +15 agi the best enchant but sadly it's not out yet. Thus making Crusader the best OH enchant atm.
---
Once you're close enough to the crit cap, probably during the AQ event considering all the agi enchants being released then (although hardcore raiders will have tuned their gear to get real close to crit cap during early to mid p3), then Crusader will become the very best choice for OH considering its proc rate/duration makes it more than a 15AP boost.
---
Did this around last Christmas as well - old game, but still awesome. +1 on WC3 - and hey, Reforge is "right around the corner".
---
&gt; not in demand for 5 mans
---
Aw man really? I'm levelling a druid as I want to tank my way to 60 then swap to raid heal/healer when I get a few bits of gear. If that's the case I might as well go full feral, although we get worse in comparison to other tanks as the phases go on.

Wonder just how hard a warrior is to level..

I did tech support for 5 years for two different ISPs, both Verizon and AT&amp;T. If you had called in and said only one game was having this issue, they would have required me to send you to Blizzard. Their reasoning being that if it was the internet service it would happen to other games and streaming as well.
---
Will make sure to get some tests later whenever i catch him online next time!
---
I see your points. G'night!
---
You're going to a lot more of gronsblood and dreamfoil unless you get good rng with crystals and sapphires
---
Choose the one that you prefer. My girlfriend started playing classic with me and she loves it. She also never played computer games before, so for her it doesn't matter that it's an old game. I couldn't tell if she would like retail, but she'd not want to play alone ;)
---
Haha, that's a new one for me - and a good one!
---
could you imagine if Op's battle was lag free? it would have been epic beyond epic. holy fuck we are missing out.
---
You know, it‚Äôs funny that you say you aren‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúflame or be negative‚Äù. But everyone on this subreddit completely shits on retail. What a toxic environment classic has to offer.
---
That's some high level conspiracy theory here. I would rather attribute the problems to sheer stupidity and ignorance. I think they just don't realize how much people love classic.
---
Classic is a much, much better game than retail, full stop. If this is true then they are tasteless and corrupt.
---
:-) nice comment, take my upvote!
---
I have seen the same, 7:30 server, org, Wednesday night, everyone around waiting for head and you can‚Äôt take items of mail
---
Box, people rubber banding, it‚Äôs crazy!!
---
Or Planetside 1 in 2003.
---
Or Dark Age of Camelot in 2001.
---
Or Warhammer Online in 2008.
---
Warhammer is probably the best example. Game had some issues and bugs, but when it came to server performance with hundreds and hundreds of people it could handle it 10x better than current WoW. The have been tons of other mmo's that successfully implemented large scale combat, and it's ridiculous that the biggest MMO can't do the same.
---
He's not your son, dad!
---
No, even with layers large scale pvp didnt work.
---
Even on retail the 40v40 "epic" battlegrounds are a laggy mess.
---
are you going into bug caves for rich thorium as warrior? cause theres pretty much only small thorium on surface at edges
---
This is entirely not true. Cloud servers vs on premise servers is not why it's lagging out.
---
It's classic, no changes JUST like how the community wanted it to be.
---
Unironically there will be tanks who use Nat Pagle's Broken Reel on four horsemen in Naxx to avoid crucial taunts resisting
---
They have the money to fund a solution, they might not have the ability to solve it
---
This stereotype contributed to why I picked the female model haha.
---
Yep I cant even be bothered to join a MC pug that will clear 8 bosses in 2-3.5 hours, it's just too boring. Which is supposedly the best end game content. If I try to Scholomance speed run it's challenging lots of difficult decisions edge of my seat. I have never been so truly bored as forcing myself to do MC, paying 0 attention and just praying for the 0.5% chance of loot
---
The belt from arena and what else?
---
You're missing out, man.
---
Ahh the authentic vanilla experience it seems.
---
Only Vanilla didn't have this problem, because each server ran on dedicated hardware.
---
The problem is the new cloud-based server clusters. Bring back dedicated physical hardware for each server and the lag is gone.
---
16 for the rest of classic I think.
---
I respecced Hemo-Swords when I could get Hemo for the exact same reason, never looked back. As far as I can tell the leveling isn't bad at all, only thing is you need to be a bit more aware of what you pull as you can't nuke 2 mobs with Blade Flurry anymore. Imo the world PvP enjoyment I get out of it serverly outweighs the slightly slower leveling.
---
Since Faerlina server is mostly balding alliance player this make me happy, cant wait for BGs.
---
On classic, people are already doing more dps than required to kill patchwerk in their blues and MC epics. Patchwerk individual dps requirement is slightly over 400, and top dpsers are doing 700+.
---
it could be stupidity and ignorance. But then how come large scale pvp was going fine during classic beta, and now you can't even have 100v100 ? It's not like it's anything new also, and they planned p2 release for next week, so it would be about time to be worried about that, even for incompetent people
---
Is this the way you play?
---
its not fabricated, thats how it was on elysium. elysium was also able to large a large pvp battle but the overall quality of the server was still shitty. just like how you say northdale was "stable most of the time". blizz servers are stable ALL THE TIME aside from when 600 people are firing off aoes.
---
World PvP is probably the most interesting and engaging part of this game though
---
Nah, don't want a flappy bird :(
---
Is the dps difference really that big from a Tank pet to a DPS cat in dungeons? I mean, how Do it afflict the clearing speed of a dungeon (pre 60), I cant imagine that it's this big, but I'm more of a noob, so I really dont know.
---
I still remember back when my rogue had the Dishonourable title after getting enough DHKs from the gnome in Deeprum Tram. I vaguely remember reading/thinking that the lower you got the Dishonur that eventually even your own faction would not interact with you. Think I'm wrong on that part.
---
Woah you‚Äôre really have some nice insider information about blizz priorities and team‚Äôs motivations.. not at all a toxic random community barf at all.. 
---
You would think Blizz tries its best to listen to the community, interact and repent for its mistakes but some people just can‚Äôt stop complaining and showing at least the smallest amount of appreciation.
---
I saw that guy in tuesday on my way to MC. You guys on Blaumex too?
---
&gt; knowledge is a requirement to even have an opinion on the subject matter 
---
You can have an opinion about anything and no one will bat an eye. When you start being a dick with zero knowledge, your attitude is going to be rubbed in your face. I don't think it's a huge feat to be able to understand what I said.
---
I wish lol hes a freeloader
---
I have a couple of questions I hope someone will be able to help with. I have no previous vanilla experience. I have leveled my character up to 60 and got most of my pre raid bis I only need truestrike and better weapons. I am playing a swords rogue at the moment but intend to go daggers when I can get a main hand dagger from raid. I currently have the distracting dagger offhand and the core hound gloves that give +dagger skill ready for this.
---
My first question is. Considering phase 2. What spec should I go when I get the dagger? I'd like to avoid constant respec costs if possible. Would it be best to just go combat daggers? Hemo? Or something else? I'd like to do raids and some pvp.
---
Second question is. With this spec will I be able to output enough damage to do stealth tribute runs as well? Me and a druid guildy tried this but could not output enough damage currently to do the boss. Do I need better gear for this or am I just bad?
---
Classic is casual in terms of difficulty, but certainly not in terms of time investment and patience.
---
I agree with you but this is not a 15 years old game, but a 3 months old game with vanilla reskins and systems.
---
The structure is probably way different and they don‚Äôt care too much about some pvp battles so it will never be fixed.
---
My battlenet is constantly disconnecting. I had a massive lag in wow retail and some of my party members reported similar lag that day. If they can‚Äôt even fix retail and battlenet, then we can‚Äôt really expect them to fix classic sadly.
---
Yeah this is gonna be a huge problem. It just plain sad that Blizzard doesnt give a fuck
---
There is nothing wrong with cluster hosting like Blizzard does. It's actually how most of the large hosting systems work, look at Amazon Web Services as example. It's just the dynamic scaling that seems to be an issue at high loads, this should definitely improve!
---
Have no kids and only level 41. Man I gotta sort my life out...
---
Max level is 60
---
Your first link has no raid PvP. The second one the server lags as soon as they engage. 
---
What a failure.
---
You've earned your downvotes. Here, take mine. &lt;3
---
seriously? never thought about it. For me retail is mythic raiding only, that's... the only content in game actually. Others offer literally no challenge. Classic dungeons and raids offer no challenge as well, but its not about challenge at all, its about adventures -)
---
Like i've told my ingame friends - i raid in retail and play classic
---
Thick hide is pretty useless since it does not stack with bearform. In PvE and PvP you want to sit in bear anyway when facing heavy normal dmg
---
And?
---
He‚Äôs not your buddy, buddy!
---
Can you inform us what you think is mechanically difficult about them?
---
Here is your pvp experience can we now enjoy our money?? Thanks losers
---
That's correct, they always can get rid of the lag but it won't match the lag during vanilla #nochanges audience asked for.
---
This picture is genuinely unsettling.
---
If you have a pet out and you log off. Then the pet will not refund a soul shard when you take a flight point anywhere.
---
Problem with druid threat is the first 5 seconds of the pull. If you have never played a druid, 90% of our threat comes from maul which works the exact same way as heroic strike.
---
So you have a 2.0 speed weapon and you NEED to land a maul before damage can start. If you get a dodge or a parry for your first 2, you can have serious problems. Now throw in a miss for good measure and you WILL have serious problems.
---
"Why would anyone care"?! It's crafted to make the legendary "Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros" the weapon HE uses, you laugh now but when a shaman comes along and procs Windfury and your health drops within 0.00001 second you will then realize why this drop is amazing.
---
If you don't care to see this why comment about it. The guy pretty much got a Legendary. Hush!
---
they are not hard at all. Believe me, they will be closed in the same way, people close MC now, in like 1-2 hours at max. Classic is not about hard raiding at all. It was hard, yeah, but 15 years ago.
---
Hit stops you missing,not attacks being dodged.
---
Have a look at TBCs combat 41 point talent.
---
Playing an Undead Rogue is a real adventure. Often, just the sight of you triggers someone into the PTSD of being corpse camped when they were level 20, and 22, and 23, and again at 23, etc.
---
It wasn't me, but damned if they won't use me to take out their frustrations.
---
Until I turn on all the cooldowns and splatter them across the floor. 
---
Srsly, Rogues are OP at this low gear tier.
---
Clearly didnt do LFR ghuunn ahah
---
Maybe you should read up on servers and dont assume what you think is facts.
---
N O C H AN G E S
---
this is how I describe when someone looks like he stepped straight of a gay porn... and not even the star, just a useless little fluffer.
---
at least night elf girls don't have this same "I'm jerking off dudes for a living" look, since [when you put them side-by-side](https://i.imgur.com/cTxx7Ly.png), you can see they're basically troll ladies without the hips and personality.
---
People are defending Blizzard? Are you on something? This whole sub has become anti-Blizzard. How the moderators allowed this to happen is beyond my belief.
---
I don't even know what I'm looking at
---
You are probably right. I remember a lot of hacks worked on private servers in the past which would result an instant disconnect on retail, or maybe even ban.
---
If I put a scope on a bow, can I upgrade the scope later or am I stuck with the first scope for the entire time?
---
Is the mage talent "Shatter" additive or multiplicative? I.e. if I have a base crit chance of 10% and 5 ranks in shatter and casting on a frozen enemy, do I now have 60% crit chance or 15%?
---
Another instance of blizzard being right about having layering, the community ‚Äúreeing‚Äù about layering and then ‚Äúreeing‚Äù When layering is removed. Blizzard wins again. Armchair developers lose.
---
The lowest you can get dodge chance down to is 5%, no matter how much hit you stack. Not sure about the exact formula though.
---
Hit chance doesn't stop attacks from being dodged or parried, it only reduces the chance to miss your enemy.
---
Classic gameplay can be summed up in an old Sopranos quote: *"Col tempo la foglia di gelso diventa seta"* or transleted into: *"time and patience turn the mulberry leaf to silk"*
---
+hit does not reduce dodges, it only reduces misses. Increased weapon skill reduces dodge a tiny bit.
---
In TBC they added expertise to reduce parry and dodge.
---
Or just downvote me cause you know you won't be able to show proof of even semi-large scale pvp working decently on any server.
---
We should by blizzard shares as well so we can have boats also.
---
Hits are for the miss, the boss can dodge parry block
---
Both Warriors &amp; Dagger Rogues make far better use of it.
---
Why is that anyway?
---
Razorgore hehe
---
People saying that blizzard might not be able to do it are stupids maaa√†an
---
I just did that tonight
---
No, it shouldn't be hard at all, but it is.
---
i am ready for skull enemies to get dishonorable kills for lowbies, oh i am so ready
---
I am pretty sure you can overwrite it with a new one, like with enchants.
---
Faerlina is a ghost town compared to private servers.
---
Seems it's some issue with corsair and razor mice that others also have. I'll check what my dpi is and do some tests. Seems wow in raw input mode expects 400 dpi.
---
unless theres 500+ people firing off aoes in 1 spot the servers are stable 100% of the time.
---
It's still a complete bullshit excuse.
---
Lol ‚Äú?‚Äù Is the only response to this
---
well, for a mythic raiding guild they actually are easy. Mekka took like an hour first day of HC, yes, but jaina wasn't hard like at all. And second week it went like a breeze, imo its all about mythic on retail, yeah
---
&gt;Maybe you should read up on servers
---
point me where then? i remember they stating exactly this about spell batching, and the only thing i am assuming are based on objective vision of how they handled the problems and what effects they had.
---
And surely randoms on internets know shit aniway how to solve this issue, which is not what i am trying to do now.
---
He's 100% a troll, was defending Blizzard saying it's impossible to have 40v40 PvP without lag in another post.
---
Just throw some money and dev's on it. But nooooooo, Bik Boi kotic gotta keep his dev-slaves working on lootboxes for the next "manga-themed-shit-show-game".
---
PAW PAW PAW PAW PAW PA-PAW!  
---
A-HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
At the moment heroic dungeons on retail are similiar to beating Dead Mines with a group of geared level 25 chars. You haven't touched difficult contend and come to say how easy it is.
---
 "And then it will stop being a problem once battlegrounds are released again"
---
Dude even battlegrounds lag out as well if retail is anything to go by, it's fucking embarrassing
---
I think now it may have been down to us not killing all mobs since they have a shared respawn.
---
I won't call questing harder in Classic, it's not dark souls where you can dodge stuff and kill anything if you skilled, in classic mobs just hit you hard and you can't do anything about it. It is not a difficulty.
---
I miss Blizzard North
---
Ok pal
---
I know what the item is for lol I don't come to reddit every time an item drops because I know no one cares
---
Farm those mcps to get you out of rough situations is best bet for droods
---
It's not like the devs working on the game can upgrade server infrastructure as they want. 
---
They are not the one taking the decision here, we talk about millions in servers costs.
---
But yeah blizzard is a joke at this point
---
never played a hunter but you don't need to minmax your dps that much for early dungeons, if it's simpler to just have one pet then do that.
---
Nice try to make paid tanking more usual, Mr. Sneaky Tank!
---
This is exactly what I'm thinking as well, as a healer. 
---
The reason we see so many "fury/prot tanks" is that A) videos and streams of how well it works for tanking in Naxx and B) most people don't want to tank, but want to DPS instead (or at least have a spec where it's possible) and hey, if this video shows it **can be done even at Naxx level** it surely must be awesome for dungeons as fresh level 60 with limited tanking background too, right? Right? ...Right?
---
The issue is that said players don't look into why the spec is used, why and how it works, and what its limitations and possibilities are. **It's a great spec, but** mostly for higher level content when DPS need to push their performance to the limit in order to progress on the encounters, and at higher gear levels with buffs and communication with healers. 
---
If you're properly geared, chugging some consumables, knowing your limits and when to swap to shield+1h and have a two-way street unagi relationship with your healer, then by all means, go for it. If these conditions are met the run will probably be quicker and smoother, because you know how to tank, you know your spec and you wear decent plate pieces. 
---
I'm just tired of the odd pug where I have to sit and spamheal a "fury tank" who's wearing Devilsaur pieces with mail and plate and who's too deluded and busy watching the damage meters to realize he should swap to his shield and maybe not pull two packs at a time like streamer X did in video Y. 
---
Rant over.
---
Yeah i dno about this, farmed for 2 hours got one. Might be bad rng , need to try it more i guess.
---
HS is the worst -during leveling-
---
It's literally useless, and even tanking you almost never will have enough rage to use it, over more useful abilities like sunder or Mortal Strike (because you should level Arms, it tanks well and it's also very good for solo / questing, AND pvp)
---
But when tanking raids, you get tons of rage, and all your abilities are always on cooldown, so you need something to dump rage to be more efficient, instead of letting it stay between 80 and 100 -&gt; here comes HS
---
Cat with an afro
---
\-ballzy rogue zones out- 
---
Mage, - cast frost nova - 
---
Rogue - fuck
---
I played on every single one of Nost, Northdale and every other shit server that got put up after the former one got taken down or deleted by scrub GMs. Either you are delusional or just plain lying, but the server could definitely not handle the load on the zones when fresh. You could have 10 crashes every day when playing and the lag was tremendous depending on the load of the server/zone. It's just not true that it worked on the PS.
---
The ole catfro
---
**inb4 #nochanges gang arrives and claims that the game was designed this way, even tho it's shitty design, so it shouldn't be changed**
---
If you crit and intercept from minimum range, so you have 2 GCDs time in the intercept stun I like to disarm the hunter, so he can't use wing clip when he comes out of it. A well geared hunter in full mail gear can eat a couple hits and outwaddle your hamstring. Keeping him from wing clipping makes things a lot easier.
---
Yeah.
---
Also, these people don't consider that in Europe, the game wasn't released until February 2005, which means Europeans were EVEN MORE rushed back then.
---
No idea how I survived leveling in 2005, knowing that Dire Maul was already released and I'm going to be behind from the start. Knowing that BWL was going to be released around the time people hit 60. No idea how we considered the game to be fun back then, when everything was so god damn rushed.
---
Troll or serious? :D
---
I was in a guild that required ALL raiders to send in Black Lotus once a week so they would "stockpile" the herbs ready for AQ40/Naxx.
---
Guild folded after their second week because the raid leaders were so incompetent.
---
can mods just start banning this spam?
---
That's an oddly specific circumstance that you are saying now.
---
It seems more of a fps problem or a client latency problem than a server one.
---
Plenty of them ganking in Tanaris and Badlands.  I think they just aren't where you are.
---
oh, i was thinking in the context of dungeons at 60. 
---
for leveling the best way is actually full sp gear and sustaining mana with dark pact while dealing damage with dots and drain life. spirit build also works but it's a good bit slower.
---
If you are a miner the caves are veeeery good gold wise.
---
I grinded from 49-52 by just killing mobs in that cave and mining thorium and mithril. So many spawns that once you cleared the cave the first nodes in the beginning will start to spawn back so you can rotate back and forth while killing mobs on the way.
---
Combined with some devilsaur farming later I had my epic mount money by lvl 58.
---
Money well spent.
---
Carlsberg doesn't make Rich Thorium veins, but...
---
Private servers are also free. Stop whiteknighting Blizzard, it's a bit cringe.
---
Blizzard won't respond to it, ever. I remember when OCE servers at the start of BFA were getting hard lag every day for months. They eventually responded and said they couldn't reproduce it despite the fact we were getting it every single day.
---
What the hell? Finding a healer is often much easier than finding 3 dps...
---
i mean to that's how it was back in 2005, so you're getting a true classic experience.
---
Lol what. So a group with 3 mages who rain down a shit load of AOE spells simultaneously at the start of a pull and steal threat - that would still be the tanks fault in your world?
---
I mean, you‚Äôre the one trying to make classic look like the superior game with your comment.
---
Dwarves are notorious daydrinkers. Usually too drunk to care or to rumble.
---
Why not double lifesteal
---
Alright bud. You got me!
---
Wow, 2 in 2 minutes. crazy luck
---
Then go play on a pserver with zero integrity to the client. You can modify the paks/cabs and fool the server on all sorts of shit because they're not triple redundant. All the wild cheats get caught easily enough, but someone that knows what they're doing can easily modify a pserver client. Not to mention abuse a dozen other legacy systems that have since been overhauled because they're abusable, like the old GCD system.
---
You want integrity or speed? I want both, but I'll never sacrifice the former for the latter.
---
Devilsaur set gets you 2% hit AND crit, as well as a shitload of AP. Even with the best non-epic pants, Trueaim are slightly worse than Devilsaur. Weapon skill isn't that important for hunters, as /u/cokeface said. Hit is easy enough to get on other pieces, without losing too much.
---
TIL blizzard servers have a popation of 40k +
---
amazing that we still have queues
---
You mean about 80?
---
Way too low for blasted, right level for badlands and uldaman tho
---
&gt;dude wat, literally nobody wanted sharding/layering,  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;i did not talk about that - in fact, sharding and layering was what kept world pvp lag at bay and now that it has been slowly removed now thes eproblems are surfacing again.
---
Yes, but if layering never was added in in the first place there wouldn't be any world pvp lag in the first place, nor would there be overfull realms that will have a hell of a time in terms of questing, getting into dungeons, etc, etc. 
---
And aren't people already getting tired of "#nochanges" being thrown around left and right? Seeing what's become of retail I guess I land on the side of that annoyingly hashtagged motto, but it's getting so old seeing it mentioned everywhere where someone finds a problem of any sort and just throws the hashtag out there for sarcastic or mocking purpose. Or maybe it's just me being grumpy.
---
Ninja say what?
---
I do too buddy, I do too...
---
I think the developers perhaps remember the point when the talents were stretched to breaking point, which was in Wrath, not Vanilla.
---
Uhm, no offence, but that just sounds like you've misunderstood the GUID numbers. Did you check immediately before the encounter, after zoning in?   
---
 What you're describing is exactly what would happen if he had a lower GUID than you. He had the highest threat, so he gets the first fireball. Lowest GUID (main tank) gets aggroreset, second highest threat gets fireballed (you), lowest GUID in range gets threat reset (MT). Repeat. 
---
    
---
Given that every other guild testing this is seeing the same consistent results, but you get the complete opposite, makes human error a slightly more plausible explanation.
---
By all means though, I would love to see it on caps/video, and I'm certain the guys doing the testing over on fight club would love it.
---
To everyone comparing classic to private servers. Its similar front end, its completely different back end. In private servers you could dupe, hack, cheat, manipulate files and server responses, had no reliable backup, had constant crashed, had constant rollbacks, had no complex interconnected systems like battle net etc
---
Its not even comparing aples to oranges, its comparing aples to rocks.
---
Yes, this sucks, yes Blizzard should respond to this as soon as possible, but don't be a moron please and compare classic vs private.
---
Really? I remember doing multiple raid group raids on cities without much problem.
---
Sure, but you don't get a baseline bonus to all threat like in bear or defensive stance, and you don't get Righteous Fury for yourself and Salvation for everyone else. Basically you get a damage and threat increase on your melee attacks and an earth shock on a cooldown. You aren't a tank, and never were. The fact remains.
---
Vanquisher is horde only. I guess asking dagger/sword you're on ally. Take the sword.
---
Why do you WANT to respec to hemo?
---
Is this post from 2005? Because I had this issue in 2005, lasted till 2008 and then I stopped playing.
---
Say spell batching one more time mother fucker
---
Yeah warlocks are great and get even better with the raid and gear progression because locks lack the necessary spell hit.
---
Mara Princess/Rotgrip/Engineer runs make a decent profit, DM East makes a decent profit and you can even farm the first boss of North without much troubles (even in it's nerfed form) should you desire (not a lot of gph). Incendius farms are possible too, though not that profitable, but if you want the bracers.
---
Add a team member and you can farm a shitton of endgame content.
---
...no. if you are having trouble with that, your gpu probably cant handle all the particles or your internet is just not good.
---
DK Primus has some numbers for the more popular servers. Idk how reputable of a source they are honestly but I know that the servers were loaded.
---
It's not that tricky to level 2 pets at the same time. Once the first pet reaches your level it will stop gaining experience so you just swap it out to the other one until pet 2 catches up to you. Once you are a higher level than your pet , the pet will start gaining experience again.
---
Still a bit of a pain though.
---
There are some quests you can do in swamp of sorrows, duskwallow marsh or badlands.  One thing that I am enjoying with classic is that you can't just do one zone to get even 5 levels, you have to visit several.
---
You can also run the later SM dungeons, Razorfen Downs or Uldaman to get the few levels you need to start in Tanaris.
---
Something todo while i wait for bgs, plan on making 3 or 4 twinks then taking a break until p3
---
Pussy Vs Environment
---
I think he is just tired of the circlejerk where your average molten core run is cleared in 2h by toddlers in Quest Greens. When people talk about classic raid difficulties it is always either the easiest thing ever or harder than retail mythic raids, which are both annoying and lacking in nuance
---
&gt; Reddit and forums are acting like blizzard are covering their ears, refusing to fix the problem
---
Yes because that is what Blizzard does, time and time again you brainlord. First time?
---
Why wouldnt they have the ability to solve it?
---
Yeah but people still manage to nuke the raid with geddons bomb. Classic bosses just do so little that people get overwhelmed when they suddenly have to deviate from their 1 button rotation.
---
I totally agree... find around 40 people that aren't half asleep and your raid will be fine even in the later content.
---
All the videos were recorded prior to the patch the patch/hot fix a week or two ago that changes it
---
As an Undead Rogue playing on a PvP server: I can confirm this is 100% accurate.
---
Yeah gonna roll on a warlock I think, plenty of versatility.
---
There's a tank on our server that asks for 25g per run and he gets flamed to fuck every time he does, cant imagine what would happen to a healer asking 50g lol.
---
What the ratio of A/H on that server
---
&gt;mages and warlocks the best ranged dps. 
---
Hunters are better currently. Mages and locks don't have the gear available yet.
---
Servers weren't ready for launch. Servers aren't ready for Phase 2. Countless bugs still in the game. FUCK IT. SHIP IT. GOTTA RUSH OUT THE CONTENT CUZ 2019  
---
????????
---
They can do it without layering
---
I'm not even level 60 yet bro. Pretty sure i'm not playing this game too much.
---
Yeah, I made some comments about the content shouldn‚Äôt be set by hard core or no life players, and I‚Äôm getting a lot of push back.
---
Couple of things:
---
1.  I'm not going to screen cap/video things.  So take it for what it is worth.
---
2.  This is exactly how it played out.  I created my character within a minute of launch.  Buddy didn't start playing for 2 weeks after launch.
---
Not a single boss in classic is hard, if you think they are - you're beyond help.
---
Oh sorry didn't understand.
---
I'm atm at dagger dagger atm and I think I'm wasting some talents like improved ambush etc because when questing I don't use those skills
---
I agree this is content that would be eaten up if properly presented
---
Yeah, there‚Äôs lots of ways to do it, just saying that the leashing hotfix broke the vanilla feel of the quest
---
Wow then stop going outside so much
---
which expansion is close to classic? BFA or the upcoming BFA 2?
---
this issue also exists in retail btw, big battlegrounds like ashran are unplayable but they do nothing about it
---
Hunter if you want to be able to solo all of it.
---
Warlocks and mages can‚Äôt do the elite quests that require long kiting. 
---
I did the winter spring elite cat quest solo at lvl 57. I did all plagueland elite quests solo. Right now I‚Äôm doing DM north tribute run solo. 
---
Hunter is the number 1 class for the lone wolf.
---
I don't think it's the batching. I think it's that it still ultimately uses the retail WoW's server code which was changed to support phasing/sharding. That's why players glitch when they move across zones, because it's using that underlying system still and it needs to be removed and reverted to how it worked before that and it would probably fix all their lag issues.
---
So you are mad about a choice you made and taking it out on others? Does that sum up this rant?
---
Fish, mine, herb, DE greens from dungeons, DM jump runs, respec, roll a dps alt, work the AH, sell runs to lowbies, etc. 
---
Hell on my lvl 24 alt I can make some 20-30g now with the current spike in blackmouth fish and strangle kelp.
---
As a healer you should have already understood you have a low damage potential and should have been stocking up on DPS alt gear.
---
How exactly does bonus healing work? It says up to ‚ÄòX‚Äô , so is it like a chance based system?
---
Next time I‚Äôll shoot you an inv ;)
---
Video removed can someone post an explanation?
---
I mean they started with 2 servers EU PvP servers, then released 2 more, then 2 more, etc. So obviously the first servers will be overcrowded compared to the last ones added. If they had the current amount of servers all from the start it would probably be fine. Instead you have massive population disparities.
---
Stealth tribute runs with rogue(s) in DM north. Or duo jump runs in DM east (have herb or mining).
---
It was planned like this from Blizzard but scraped afair
---
its too late for nochanges, they made big changes with saying servers are "medium" when really they are busier than the most crowded servers they ever had in original trilogy. they created this problem themself, just like the created the "need" for layering
---
40 is big, it takes alot of time and effort, gratz! Dont listen to the above dickwad.
---
Batching likely makes it worse.
---
You have 2 hamburgers, the first one you eat bite by bite, all goes smooth, the odd bite might be a bit big and take slightly longer to chew and swallow, but overall its consistently masticated.
---
The 2nd though, at most you can break it into quarters and the whole fucking thing has to go in as one, chewed in one, the swallowed as one action. Same amount of burger overall, but a lot harder to deal with the parts.
---
This is what batching is. Because we just *needed* to simulate lag from 2004 because of the off chance you might 1 in 1000 tries sheep each other at the same time.
---
About the right quality of post for this sub
---
Lol he‚Äôs really not.
---
If they keep rushing out content like they have so far, then AQ should arrive first week of december.
---
Private servers had self-published numbers that were never verified by even something as simple as a census addon and were repeatedly busted out for lying about said self-published numbers whenever the people running them inevitably turned on one another. Half the popular pservers that lasted more than 6 months before sperging about F R E S H had dungeon and raid finder analogues that grouped you with the opposite faction.
---
But do go on lol, I'd love to see the verification you can provide as to when and where there were 15k concurrent players. I played on privates for over 8 years, pre-tbc, tbc, and wotlk, and never saw anything remotely like that.
---
Nah, that's simply not true, unless you're using the stacking to avoid threat reset strats. Some random caster will have aggro when she lands, as the tank had been reset, and they generate aggro while she's in the air. And the tank having been threatreset will need to build a fuckload of threat to regain aggro. If that caster panics and turns ony towards your healers and you get one of the normal breaths, you're in big fucking trouble. If he turns the tail into the raid, you're in big fucking trouble, if people don't position themselves correctly and get tailswiped, you're in big fucking trouble.
---
The issue is that this can be any shitty mage or warlock, having to make decisive plays. If that one person fucks up, it can easily wipe you.
---
I remember some hunters getting shit for raiding with an owl at some point - tank(s) an melee people got tired of them flapping in their face all the time. I can totally see where they are coming from, lol
---
&gt;Dunno If anything is needed for rogue here.
---
2x tarnished elven ring.
---
No, no it's not.
---
If you're marketing a product and one of its main selling points is severely hampered by added bells and whistles, you're doing it wrong. 
---
Obviously it's a different product from classic. Good fucking thing I didn't compare the two, right?
---
Yeah, we‚Äôve known about these issues for years now in retail, it‚Äôs not like a month or two of delaying phase 2 for classic is gonna change anything.
---
Dude... did you read what I wrote?
---
I literally answered someone who stated that MC and such are easier than LFR.
---
So anything that strays from that is pointless here.
---
Nah even with layering in first place the server capacity could have been calculated to accommodate for wpvp easily before expansion, layering was mostly for game resources like xp and mobs.
---
You are going to have to link the logs, and tell us who you are, if you want help imo.
---
You mean daughter?
---
Any shock + rockbiter already inflicts tankable threat.
---
Wow are you homo?
---
I have two 60's and I'm GM of a quite large guild who leads two separate raids.
---
Currently I am planning to lead a third raid to help out people who can't make our raid days.
---
My other two 60's are a Warrior + A Shaman on Grobbulous
---
I am stuck on choosing between a hunter or a Druid, I feel like a Feral druid will allow me to play a bit more easier for people with tanking (as I'll end up tank for sure) but I also really like the idea of playing a pure DPS class for a bit. Any suggestions? Warrior is a tank and Shaman is a healer.
---
Sorry but some tryhard flaming another guy because he plays a race he actually wants to play in a role playing game is just laughable and I couldn't take him serious.
---
retail bad, classic good. kind of a shame you boys can't enjoy one thing without bashing another. /r/classicwowcirclejerking
---
With AQ event numbers the current servers would catch fire.
---
Not being 18/33 is gimping your severely.
---
Where, in any of my comment above, did I say that pservers did not have great performance. No where.
---
Smolderweb is supposedly balanced yet the Alliance always outnumber us in almost any area and when they don‚Äôt, they just call for help then /lol at you when it‚Äôs 3:1.
---
Trueaim and Plaguehound actually provide a *larger* benefit than the devilsaur set until you have the other correct pieces for pre-bis. You're right in that other blue pant combos would be *very slightly* worse than devilsaur overall, but trueaim are still a great option. They were even better when the game was newer and devilsaur was as expensive as it was. I don't get your point about weapon skill though, the weapon skill on those gloves literally translates to 3% hit.
---
Obviously, it all comes down to what other gear you have at the time, but trueaim are really strong gloves to have.
---
They won't get honur, but they won't get dishonor either.
---
Get full world buffs, full consumables, dont die, don't play seal fate swords (lol), find a better guild that clears faster. A big part of getting good parses is fast kill times for high cooldown uptime.
---

---
I don't think the log is public yet as I can't search and see it?
---
&gt; Is there ever a raid where fear ward won‚Äôt be needed
---
Yes, every raid that exists.
---
You won't believe it, but horde actually cleared content too without having 98% of their priests abusing dwarves.
---
But parses themselves are pretty simple. If you get a 50, that means that 50% did more dps than you, and 49% did less than you. (For your class). This is why it can be tough to score good on some bosses without the right strat or gear. An easy way to get logs on ony for example, is to just pull a lot of whelps and aoe them.
---
Pull two mobs is only dangerous early on and for a few classes. Pulling two mobs as a priest after like lvl 15 just means you need to drink.
---
Silver Hand was an RP server, sir. AKA a Normal (PvE) server. I know because I started there before transferring to Emerald Dream literally so I could do world PvP. So uh. Idk about your anecdotal perspective
---
Am I on Facebook?
---
Not making fun but... if you manage to get to lvl60, got most of your pre-raid BIS and found time to start Retail  then... are you really a casual? I mean it's probably more than 250 hours in 72 days
---
Yeah he's talking shit.
---
Do you know the way?
---
So is parse mostly DPS as a rogue?
---
thats why im upvoted and youre downvoted
---
This is the solution. Worked for me via a /console command afew weeks ago.  No issues since.
---
How else will I entertain myself at work?
---
Go Combat, Seal Fate isn't worth it till AQ/Naxx.
---
That's a start I'll try that thanks
---
Content being too easy isn't the issue. It's the fact that every new tier of content everything you've accomplished so far becomes meaningless. New lfr drops better loot than raids of last tier and so on. It makes every piece of gear you get feel less rewarding, because they only hold value until the next raid is released.
---
Is two hours that bad?  Only been raiding for a few weeks so should improve.
---
Hey everyone, I'm a new-to-WoW player a level and a half away from 60 and I need some serious help. I am a human, fully prot, warrior tank.
---
 Let me preface by saying during the whole leveling process I didn't look at guides. I wanted an authentic as possible first time experience to what it was like in 2006 and I feel like hyper in-depth guides with a decades worth of knowledge about the specifics of the game was cheesing the system a little bit. So, without looking at guides and doing my best to make sense of things, I've been playing as a fully, 100% Protection tank. Once I got Defense Stance, I never left it. To this day I have not once switched stances nor bought a single ability that requires a different stance to use. No charge, no thunderclap, just Sunder Armor and Shield Slam. 
---
Over the past three days I've been trying to tank Scholo/Strat. Previously I've had no issues tanking and holding aggro, I've run BRD emp like 15 times now before trying my hand at these two. Now I can't hold aggro for two ticks of combat and it's gotten me flamed incessantly. I got booted from three groups after a couple of early wipes and quit the last one because I lost all confidence in my ability as a tank. 
---
I spent a good chunk of last night and this morning looking at tanking guides on wowhead and youtube but they all mainly focus on the Talents and Itemizations of particular builds and offer little to no insight on maintaining aggro, what off-stance abilities I should invest in, and when to switch stances during combat. 
---
If anyone could help me out with even just a starting resource so I can understand better why I'm fucking up so bad, I'd really appreciate it.
---
Thanks a bunch  this helped out a ton actually
---
Rogue mace spec gives weapon skill
---
Heroic raids are hard. They are only easy for mythic guilds which is a tiny percentage of the player base.
---
Well, I hope that's true so next week goes better.
---
Right? As a vanilla player the topic of this thread and the thread itself complaining about it is vintage WoW.
---
&gt; Its obvious the only thing they truly care about isnt the customer, it's their wallets.
---
I mean, yeah. They're an Activision company now. That kind of goes without saying.
---
I don't know....maybe our guild tanks know some weird voodoo. But she always just lands and a tank drags her to the wall and then we start dpsing. I only saw her turn towards the raid in a pug where nobody buffed salvation.
---
Slashers waaaay
---
Sure, if you're a healer or a tank, ask away, you're entitled to it, I wont care.
---
But when I decline and you start crying and bitching, I'm entitled to laugh about you and parade your cringe to everyone.
---
Thank you for the info mate. Is hemo a good spec  with this? Or is combat way better?
---
Parses are entirely dps. If you did the most dps out of any rogues, you will get a 100 parse. If you did 2nd most, and there are 1000 parses, you will get a 99, as you did dps equal to the 99th percentile. If there are 1000 parses, and you get a 50, that means that ~500 did more dps than you, and ~500 did less dps than you. Parses are not based on anything besides dps.
---
Sadly doesn't work for me, just creates the second issue I posted.
---
Preferably a glass-offhand with filtration properties that add +7 to my Dizziness &amp; +7 to my euphoria traits respectively
---
But does gutterspeak translate the same way to alliance as well? Or does it translate to alliance the same way common would?
---
Indeed
---
Actually you kind of were and it was kind of scrapped, there's still strange items in the game:
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13168/plate-of-the-shaman-king](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13168/plate-of-the-shaman-king) 
---
They scrapped it because of aesthetics, plate didn't look shaman enough, also we have a class who can damage, heal and tank...
---
But threat is the least of problems on shaman, single target hes on the same level. Aoe you use oil of immolation. Mitigation is more of a problem but the game is not that hard so it doesn't matter.
---
Stop being a tryhard and play cool shit.
---
Yeah private servers did it much better.
---
It's funny because the servers were better regarding massive amounts of people back then than they are now.
---
Is parse related to all guilds performance or your own guild?
---
Also that doesnt seem to be true as some people did less dps but a higher parse score?
---
I'd honestly be surprised if Faerlina had more people than Nost on it's peak. That's 15K concurrent players. I'm pretty sure Blizzard doesn't allow that many people on one realm, even with layering.
---
I like how you left combat but were still stunned 
---
Pro gamer move there
---
How so you "Link Up" with other raid groups?
---
Looking at your post history, it would seem like you're projecting
---
Not sure I agree with this conspiracy. The game is legitimately amazing. They had to do an insane amount of work to get it to the level of polish that it is currently.
---
Apparently, the lag has with the sharding tech to do, it was explained to myself by a guildie that has experience with such topics.
---
I think a post of someone hitting 20 would get removed rather quickly by the mods.
---
No one is asking for perfection... People just want to have semi-large scale pvp battles without 10 seconds of lag or more.
---
All I am saying is they could upgrade their servers. It's not like they have razor thin margins. Dont forget Activison is one of the most wealthy gaming developers known to man. We are paying $15 a month to play a game that came out in 2004. At the very least, they could make it so we can play it the way its intended.
---
except it does.

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c9ggbb/how_does_the_thick_hide_druid_talent_actually_work/?st=k2omqc8r&amp;sh=605aec1b
---
No I‚Äôm homo I was just asking because I want to know who all the other homos are
---
Im going to tell you the solution none will want:
---
sharding and layering.
---
Thats what theywere made for
---
Go Druid. Feral is an extremely versatile spec all the way through Wrath, and although not a pure DpS in the long term is just super handy to go around doing whatever you like, not to mention the absurd gathering power.
---
The main issue of complaints seems to be people playing on Streamer servers to be honest. People warned them what would happen. I'm playing EU Flamelash, it's a full realm but queues are 5-10 minutes max if you get in before peak. I've done Blackrock Mountain PvP 40v40+ and it wasn't unbearably laggy. Barely even lagged to be honest.
---
People on Streamer servers complaining about how their server is fucked is just white noise to me. You were warned so many times, so many times. You ignored the warning. Transfer out or stop complaining.
---
Ah yes, of course you reference the most dodgy servers instead of the good ones lol
---
Well the person you replied to makes a decent point.  If private servers were free and classic is $15 a month why does classic have worse performance?  It's actually sort of embarrassing how bad the lag is when there's large scale battles compared to what private servers were able to do (again for free).
---
You don‚Äôt need to do anything special to any of them. I never used wing clip on the silithus guy, haven‚Äôt even learned scorpid sting for the burning steppes one. For every boss I just kited around with serpent sting, concussive shot and scatter shot when needed.
---
Imagine doing a simple task like making breakfast. You grab the bread, you put it in the toaster, you push the lever down, you go to make a cup of tea. Everything runs smoothly and easily.
---
Now imagine your kitchen is full of 20 other people in hardhats clustered around you, measuring and making notes on their clipboards on every step you take, everything you touch, and comparing notes on everything you do and only letting you proceed with each action once they've had a conversation and compared notes to make sure you're not cheating at breakfast and making it in a way they don't like. Your toast goes cold before you even manage to boil water for your tea, but you have hard evidence that you are legitimately making breakfast.
---
That's basically what the server's doing. Private servers don't care, they skip the validation and run smoothly, at the cost of security, whereas official servers prioritise security over pretty much everything.
---
I'm somewhat sceptical that these issues are entirely based on this issue, and believe there may be bugs in play on top of this, but it certainly doesn't help.
---
Why not to combine "single mob farming" with questing?  
---
You will get bonus exp, gold and items.
---
This would change my view. Gonna test it as soon im home.
---
Ah yes, tier 3 decked out warrior tanking on a p-server totally proving your point.
---
Any clips / datetime of this :)?
---
You speak as someone who didn't play a private server because nothing you say is true
---
This is a popular misconception that the more money or manpower you have the faster you can solve engineering challenges. This is just flat wrong. See Brooks Law for an example.
---
This comment also seems to think that Blizzard is fine with the game having issues. Considering the amount of support they have for all of their games it‚Äôs kind of silly to say they don‚Äôt care. Saying they are only motivated by earnings is fairly laughable since it does hurt earnings by having issues with the game. Who is going to want to play a game with major issues?
---
Seems like a lot of comments in this thread are living in a fantasy world where Blizzard made Classic to bleed the community dry and could care less about anything else.
---
I‚Äôm way above 150 taps now and haven‚Äôt had a single one.
---
In vanilla I got one at least every other day. My luck is not what it used to be.
---
Why the hell are you seal fate? It‚Äôs a colossal dps loss with your gear.
---
Which one of the 'good ones' had 15k concurrent players and 1000v1000 WPvP with no server issues, as the user I was replying to has claimed?
---
\#NOCHANGES
---
This is not a problem just on streamer servers lol. Gehennas has these issues all day, and none rolled here because of some streamer. Also 40vs40 works, we all know that, but as soon as you go 80 vs 80 or above the server completely stops functioning.
---
I think the 100g is for 2-manning it. Basically the partner of the healer gets guaranteed all items from the bosses. Still way much to demand though.
---
&gt;It's funny because the servers were better regarding massive amounts of people back then than they are now.
---
They absolutely were not.
---
70 people in one area: laaaaag.
---
Classic launch;  200 people around me in Northshire: seamless.
---
Wow they really giving us the real classic feel the lol.... I remember those days. Update your damn servers wtf this game brings in so much money
---
"Stop being a tryhard and play cool shit"
---
Sure, a 15 year old game that's been theorycrafted to the maximum says you can't tank, but lets try it anyway just to be sure...
---
Healer here, so can't provide much in terms of constructive criticism as my tanking knowledge is fairly limited. I'd advise you to look through some of the videos by [Skarm tank](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ), I much prefer written format when it comes to guides myself, but this guy is quite structured and detailed in his videos, at least those I've watched. There's also the Fight Club warrior discord channel which gets praised on here daily, might be worth looking into. 
---
If the people you started the strat/scholo runs with were 60 (and somewhat geared) it might be more difficult to produce enough threat to keep up with them, at least if they start unleashing their AoE before you've had a chance to establish some aggro with Demo shout/Sunders/revenge. If you just got booted without any discussion, questions or tips that sounds like some pretty bad groups in general. You could try tanking Dire Maul East, it's way easier than either of those two. Use marks for kill order and ask the DPS to follow and respect them. 
---
Also, you should really pick up TC, Charge and the other stuff - not having those limits your playstyle. TC reduces enemy attack speed (survivability!) and Charge can give you a headstart on Rage if you spec for Tactical Mastery in Arms tree - I believe most, if not all, deep Prot builds spend a number of points in either Arms to reach Deep Wounds or in Fury for other goodies. 
---
Other than that, just keep at it, and don't let yourself be dissuaded from tanking from a few bad experiences. Looking up guides and coming here, you obviously try to improve your playstyle and have a good attitude about it.
---
Maybe grab a [Krol Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2244/krol-blade) or a [Sword of Zeal](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6622/sword-of-zeal) (these go for less than 100g on my server - hidden gem!). Other than your build, your MH seems to be what holds you back the most.
---
Yeah I would agree with that, that‚Äôs just a waste on the subreddit
---
I mean as a whole on classic ignoring sub posts
---
So, what you're saying is you didn't check the GUIDs via the macro, and are unwilling to check if you're wrong?... Did you e.g transfer server? That resets your GUID. 
---
It also hasn't been proven in any way that GUID is entirely incremental, nor whether things like reserving a char ahead of launch affects it, etc.
---
It's not that I think you're lying or anything, you're just going against what others are documenting and reproducing consistently, so seeing the proof would very much be helpful.
---
I'm ready for P3. I don't really care that much about those massive battles where all you do is stand around and hope that enough other people attack the same target as you do so that it can die before the 20 enemy healers heal him back up.
---
Sure, it looks cool if it doesn't lag to no end, but I like small scale battles like Warsong or 5-10 people fighting it out at the entrance to UBRS or BRD way more than raids vs raids.
---
First time lvl 39 shaman it's the best class for me so far. Windfury procs are like fucking Pringles once you pop you just can't fuckin stop it's so fun. 
---
Switching to elemental at 40 for some PvP good ness with chainightning etc. Idk I've found the class to be super fun but I've always liked the concept of a melee type mage
---
You should do donations for dkp, with a weekly limit. That‚Äôs probably the best way of amassing gold for a bank.
---
Dungeon my friend! The game is set up to have slow leveling zones as to force your hand into dungeons every 10 levels or so. ESPECIALLY the later levels that take ages. 52-53 is a good time to try and get into BRD with a novice team. 57-58? Try Stratholme undead side! 54? Sunken Temple it up! 44? Go smash Zul-Furrak! 48? Mauradon it up!
---
Hi xander
---
Top 10 reason for a gkick, right there.
---
Whaaat. Flamelash isn't dead. Is it? I've been playing on it since launch and I never had the feeling of it being "dead". Horde/Alliance raiting sucks tho. Around 65/35.
---
Most of them.
---
People of self importance.. mhm, no
---
I mean stuff like farming materials, getting a mount, leveling and generally moving around is all a lot harder in classic. Not necessarily difficult the same way as mythic raiding is, but in that it takes much more effort to do.
---
That's not true lol
---
Well the servers cant even handle 2 v 2 guild, 80x80 people. The servers just freeze for like 10 seconds. So if they dont fix this in 1 week, phase 2 is going to be rough, because that is a small fight considering what we are going to be up against...
---
Are you doing the 2005 wands only ranged DPS strat?
---
But, yeah. Pug it some times.   
---
You'll see the chaos that can erupt when people have no clue what they're doing.
---
Do  some dungeons for xp (collect quests for them if you haven't done them yet) and then when you are a few levels higher go back to questing.
---
&gt; How do you all feel?
---
Like you're wasting your time posting a "petition" to Blizzard on Reddit.
---
Since I‚Äôm such a slow leveler I went PvE this time so I don‚Äôt have a horse in this race but
---
If lag is as bad as they say it is it should be addressed first.
---
Usually you can bait them to charge right into a trap, at which point it should be an ez kill
---
Umm, they still are though, but that's not the problem. They won't create servers optimized for 200 vs 200 battles because they wouldn't ever happen on most servers and it's so rare anyways. It leads to unnecessary costs on the upkeep for server capacity you don't need. 
---
Blizzard is creating servers based on average load and making sure natural spots of congregation work fine. You don't treat rare or temporary stress as normal workload. This is all to reduce costs in upkeep, which is important for any company.
---
On a side note, it's funny how OP plays on Faerlina... the most infamous server in the entire game for it's exceptional overpopulation and streamer culture. I'm not surprised, however. You only hear about these complaints from extremely overpopulated servers like Faerlina and Gehennas.
---
I mean, if you are just spamming arena, the healer won't get anything out of it besides what you pay them. I wouldn't expect 100g, but 5-10g a run sound reasonable.
---
Wow... Well there goes all your luck for the next year
---
If you go on my server, pick mining and mine for me then I‚Äôd do it. How many hours a day can you mine in return?
---
Sadly they won't, streamers are a priority for them again.
---
I'd honestly love to watch you perform in MC then watch you perform in the current retail raid on Heroic. Not Mythic, just heroic.
---
I'd truly love to see it.
---
I'm sure it's been tested and all, but what's your computer usage at a big opvp battle? Could it be client side issues? Asking as I had little to no lag in opvp big or small but CPU loads get a bit iffy.
---
I doubt the server lagging has anything to do with his comp.
---
It's probably that the anti-Blizzard guys are the loudest. Probably an indicator that Blizzard isn't really pleasing the masses atm, but that's up for interpretation.
---
Literally did, I played in snuffed four the last 4 years and now the alliance is dead :(
---
Private servers 600 ppl no lag hosted from toaster in russia
---
Im going to need 15 arcanite bars . 40 devilsaur leather and 12 elixirs of shadow power . Can u do this all in 2 weeks ? If so i will buy ur game time .....
---
So then the answer is simple. Blizzard needs to improve the efficiency of the backend. Can they compromise on areas to give a little on something in order to gain a lot on performance. 
---
If the answer is truly the backend then its even worse because they know the issue. Backend performance can be improved. There isn't an excuse other than finance and if that's the case then they need to have the balls to say it.
---
Thanks! I am doing quests as well, I was mainly asking as I'm specced into single target and sometimes I just like to switch brain off and farm.

bro a dude running a server from his parents basement delivered better experience than mulitbillion company
---
He's not your dad, Comrade!
---
So you want less than 200 people per server?
---
&gt; In private servers you could dupe, hack, cheat, manipulate files and server responses, had no reliable backup, had constant crashed, had constant rollbacks, had no complex interconnected systems like battle net etc
---
Honestly, NDwas a much more stable existence.  The launch fiasco of Classic and not being able to login at all was worse than the occasional crash on ND.
---
The raid xp bug, again, infinitely more game breaking than anything on ND.
---
The worst thing to happen on ND was when a script kiddie brought servers down for a few days
---
I can grant all of that is true, but if there servers are unable to handle the work, they shouldn't have increased the cap on server population.
---
They mentioned over and over how a Medium classic realm would be more populated than a High vanilla realm.
---
If you don't have the infrastructure to sustain it, raising the population cap is irresponsible.
---
You can do ony with 15-17 people w/o best gear
---
I remember doing city raids on Stormscale and Zenedar without much lag. 2+ raid groups. On classic I was defending Undercity with around 40v40 and there were several seconds of server lag. (Flamelash)
---
Some people in vanilla might have confused their own pc lagging vs servers lagging.
---
My favorite is when me and the boys are killing/questing and then all of a sudden everything just vanishes.
---
ok so lets just gather everything up here real quick.
---
blizz servers are completely stable unless 500ppl start aoeing in one spot.
---
northdale is stable most of the time with its peak of 6k players. would you be able to link a video of a 500 player fuckfest on northdale please?
---
EU log in issue is some technical issue thatll get fixed.
---
this is all sound about right? blizz wins but no matter what youre going to complain.
---
How does this work with resist?
---
You could use two tanks, A with FR gear to minimize dmg, the other, B, the one not getting threat wiped.
---
When Fireball hits A and B normaly A gets Threat wiped, what if A resists? We need to figure out if that threat wipe is hard linked to the damage or if they work independant of each part of that mechanic
---
That's some interesting info, thanks for pointing that one out!

I don't understand how casuals can enjoy Classic, or any MMORPG really. I have to go hardcore into it to enjoy it. I show up to every raid and those evenings are not negotiable. I don't care if the in-laws visit, I'm gonna raid. 
---
What do you even do as a casual? Just log in randomly hoping to join a raid? Farm dungeons with random pugs? Fine if that's what you enjoy doing, I just don't understand it.
---
My guild did ony with like 27 people and half of us were new to the fight.
---
It works fine for you in very large scale pvp? Like 5 raid groups vs 5 raid groups?
---
My PC doesnt need to be better TO RUN A GAME MADE IN 2004! 
---
My PC can run RDR2 on ultra dude.
---
I suspect this is due to current Blizzard infrastructure being optimised around the sharding of retail. And I'm guessing they either never thought about the difference, or just didn't think it would be an issue. 
---
I mean, they initially gave Europe two English PvP servers, and probably expected all large gatherings of players to be limited to the first few weeks, which would be handled with layering. 
---
They have been woefully unprepared for pretty much every part of Classic.
---
Well considering I want to start from scratch I doubt I can get high end materials in less than 2 weeks... But I can try though
---
its not bad I'd say but if you want to get 100 Score you cant competet with other guilds clearing in 45 mins, simply because most of the bosses die in one Adrenaline Rush wich results into crazy DPS Numbers.

[Freezing Band](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=942/freezing-band) is pre-BiS and will last for a while, until it is inevitably replaced, that is correct. But I don't talk about PvE here.
---
The proc effect is strong in PvP and always will be. It is relevant enough for non-mages to pick it up, just for that alone.
---
Ah ok, I'm with you. Yeah, ultimately trueaim aren't absolutely perfect, I just personally have found them to be insanely useful when swapping pieces around. Same with Warmonger's 3% hit, both just come in handy when you're getting unlucky with other pieces.
---
&gt;12th November is 3 months 2 weeks.  
---
Classic launched 26st of august. Meaning it's only been 2.5 months when phase 2 launches. 
---
&gt;Considering that pretty much all that phase 2 adds is world PvP, and there's no new raids or even battlegrounds, it seems a bit drawn out to me.
---
World bosses Azuregos and Kazzak can be classified as raids, open world raids. 
---
&gt;PvP is a huge part of the game, atm the game feels unfinished.
---
PvP is already in the game. Just no honor system. The doesn't feel unfinished, it feels unrewarding. But that shouldn't mean content should be rushed. 
---
Battlegrounds aren't even until phase 3, which means your argument of "the game is unfinished because of lack of pvp" doesn't hold up as an argument for early release of phase 2.
---
Facepalm, you farm SM Lib, you missed the most farmable version of the instance

Speed running scholo is harder than doing bare minimum in MC? No way!

Try speed running MC and you'll be on the edge of your seat too, it's a question what you make of it. Just like scholo is stupid easy if you take it slow and safe, so is MC easy if you take it slow and safe.

the pseudo-RNG in classic is hilarious... in raids you can do a boss fight and get 0 crits then on the next one you average like 3x what you should

---
Someone else brought this up, so just to explain. If you have a 2k pop server vs a 10k pop server, the 10k pop server will have a lot larger pvp battles. If you have a 200 pop server the pvp battles would probably be like 5-10 people.
---
When you build a highway you obviously dont build it thinking that every single person in a city is gonna be on it at the same time. But you also dont build 2 lanes for 1,000,000 people and then throw your hands up like you can't do anything.
---
Yep, battles throughout history have shown that no matter which side had more mages or warlocks only strategy and tactics determined the winner!
---
Pro tip,
---
Take the standard 2/31/18 spec for raid and get some gear before you switch to a full pvp spec. 
---
It‚Äôs not fun to pvp in leveling gear. Some glad or Beaststalker is enough.
---
Thats why it takes timing as a warrior to know when to use the shouts lol
---
how do you take care of the antimagic/antifrost?
---
Classic does handle battles this size though. If we want anything solved, the first step is cutting the misinformation off. 
---
[On Grobbulus we had city raids with up to 400 concurrent players participating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goCpyRjZCm8) and there was no noticeable lag besides in very specific points like Orgrimmar's backside bridge, however when the numbers go up to 500~600 on a very small space it starts to get real shitty, like [when the server rolledback when alliance raided UC last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/drz8rz/on_grobbulus_the_spirit_of_warcraft_classic/). 
---
Spewing out random stuff just because you want to hop on the bandwagon won't help anyone.
---
Some people do hundreds of runs without seeing this drop; it's RNG, and you've been on the good end of it!
---
Looks like you missed his point lmao
---
I love classic wow, but the one thing that is keeping me from playing like I'd want to is the raid groups.  I work in the evening different nights each week and cant commit to a raid schedule.  So I either dont get invited because people who can make the raid times show up or if I do make it in the run I have too little dkp or lower loot priority which makes it all just about a waste of time.  Retail doesn't have those restrictions. So that's where I'll spend my time for the most part.
---
Clips or day and time?
---
I did it the day that it came out. We cleared Uldir within like 45 mins with not a single wipe.
---
Yeah especially for strat, i wont take a druid if i don't have a spriest or dps shaman to make up for their lack of resses and disease cleanse.
---
Transfer's does not matter as even medium servers experience lag when semi large groups fight eachother. (Something that will happen more frequently with pvp and world bosses added). 
---
Can't really blame the playerbase for the mega servers as blizzard sort of made this problem themselves by being super conservative with servers around launch. Expecting people to get their whole guild to transfer of a server isn't all that realistic.
---
Well the thing about that is, vanilla‚Äôs gear was fucking awful. So you could never find equivalent gear in all slots each time a new raid came out or a new tier set came out. 
---
The BiS gear changes every time a new raid comes out in classic as well. Why grind for MC gear when Naxx gear will be much better?
---
If spell cast time is &gt;= 3 seconds - it will get 100% bonus healing.  
---
If it's 2 seconds - then it would get 2/3 of bonus healing, etc.  
---
For Hots/Dots it's duration/15 seconds.
---
Exactely my point . It would take u prolly about 3 months to be able to provide any material that would make it worth it . That means having to reup ur sub 2 more times or more ......  this is not worth it . Ur just trying to get someone else to pay ur sub .
---
Just go anywhere with a lot of mobs in your level range and kill them?
---
i stopped retail at the end of wrath, it was just to much "hand-outs" and free gearing without any work for it.  
---
After that ive been sitting on private servers to get my "fix". vanilla and tbc is where i think that wow is where the game should be, its sad they went away from that "game state"
---
How is Molten Core, Ony, and every other 5 man dungeon not boring to you? I walk in, I sweep the floor with my friends and all fights are essentially tank and spank, and we collect loot.
---
Literally has always been like this. Expecting the servers to be able to handle 400 characters in one zone all fighting just won‚Äôt happen. This is why they started sharding and other shit
---
BAh GAHD, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!
---
That's an excellant point. If you didn't have those personal restrictions I take it you'd be all over classic?
---
That may be so, but you don't run one dungeon 50 times hoping for that one item. You just get a chest full of shit, then replace it all later that day. It's all about the ratio
---
Still sounds like a problem with retail, imo.
---
Guy got to max level, tried the 2nd level of dunegon difficulty, and still did not feel challenged or that an achievement was made.
---
I'm at work so I can't give you a particularly detailed answer right now but the 20% boost in damage on your glancing blows is substantial. As 40% of your attacks are glancing blows. Unless your weapon does 20% more damage and you find gear that is good as yours but has an extra 3% hit on it I would stick with axes.
---
For a tank I recommend the annihilator axe because the debuff stacks with other armour reducing abilities and this increases yours and your raids damage significantly.
---
***MMO****RPG*: ***Massively\* Multiplayer Online*** *Role Playing Game*
---
With the caveat: **Massively Multiplayer Online** can now only reliably work with up to 50 active players in a locale before the game becomes completely unplayable. 
---
From what I've gleaned so far: This is a combination of technical factors including updated game/server code in retail that is optimized to work with modern cloud based server hosting architecture designed to easily scale horizontally with more shards, but due to the only moderate maximum footprint / performance of their cloud hosted VMs/Servers, and the fact that classic is having layers disabled &amp; isn't sharding capable, the classic client running en masse on patched retails servers are unable to cope even less than with the expected amounts of concurrent players in the same zones at p2.
---
I would put it like this from a customer service point of view: you are paying for a service with your subscription. If you are unable to play the game as it was intended, designed, and originally released and developed, it becomes a customer service issue which many people will consider cancelling their subscription over. I was refunded subscription time a few times back in vanilla when they had external network issues causing the game to become unplayable which wasn't even their fault. The fact that this will not just happen in the specific circumstances of large-scale battles, even just very large and active gatherings of players in the world, such a world boss raids, the AQ event, Naxx invasions, and even now at dungeons entrances, and that people can deliberately abuse this fact to grief others and the servers themselves, it's absolutely game breaking.
---
I hope Blizzard will look into either patching their server code (eg. variable tick rates per zone to cope with more players) and/or vertically scale their classic VM footprints further to cope with the increased load world PVP will cause (pay their cloud hosting company more $$$) , otherwise I can see p2 being a very rocky patch period, with many players cancelling subs, and the trend continuing until this becomes a non-issue. 
---
My worry is that Blizzard will be looking at profit margins and the actual playerbase of WoW Classic to determine if it is worth the extra support/cost with current architecture. Since the servers were patched to block player stats, it would be interesting to know how much of their WoW subs are made up of classic players and how much they stand to lose if they don't deal with this issue. Above all, I want to see Blizzard respond to player concerns.
---
Mate, not everyone has  the money to just buy the sub, that's why I'm trying to find a way to pay back somehow. I could offer some other stuff, but since I doubt WoW players would want some other game accounts or items, I thought that maybe this is a better solution.
---
He, along with the vocal majority in this thread, are incredibly ignorant about this. They have no understanding of why optimizing servers and infrastructure for 200+ vs 200+ PvP battles is a laughably dumb thing to do for the ones who put the least bit of thought as to why.
---
But that's gamers.
---
Obviously you can have a 100v100 battle on a server with even just 200 people. On lower pop servers that requires at least some effort of planning, and it doesn't happen organically. If your objective is to Lagg everyone out, then I say: You get what you ask for.
---
I don't remember 100v100 battles ever being a thing that would happen flawlessly in vanilla?
---
If people would rather that classic be more like private servers, and less like vanilla, that's a valid point. I just don't see that brought up.
---
Grind the whelps in Badlands till 44 then start runing ZF. You will get a fair chunk of gold from the small flame sacs too, they sell for 1.90g each on my server. I know this may be boring option but it will get that hump out the way.
---
when Ironfoe procs, you speak dwarven for a couple seconds, I suppose horde players could also just proc IF and then speak to alliance players normally.
---
Hunter,  but the best parts of classic are absolutely the group content
---
Introduced my GF to wow.
---
First retail, before classic launched. The interest kind of fizzled after 30+ levels.
---
Then we tried again in Classic, and now she is hooked and even play by herself. 
---
When asking why that is, she says it was simply too easy to take down mobs - not really a challenge at all. The punishment for pulling too many mobs in classic, or generally how hard thing can be to come by, makes the reward so much more fulfilling. 
---
Leveling is also more exciting, as you get a talent point each ding, you need to train each ability's level, and she feels more connected to her character, then she ever did in retail.
---
I definitely recommend Classic based on her assessment, but it requires that you level together, as many things are not as apparent in Classic than in Retail.
---
It only happens when i play wow. Seems there's an issue with some mice when you hold your right click and move the camera. The mouse pointer keeps moving but it should stay put.
---
Basically, a LOT is happening when players are moving around in the same space, interacting with the world and with each other. Movements, trades, sales, fighting... All these little events, let's call them that, have to be communicated to the server(s) and then to all the players that are there, so that everyone receives all of those events and sees stuff happening.
---
But the server does not just act as the conduit for all these events, it also runs a lot of checks to make sure people can't cheat, that everything happens as it should. The server also 'plays' all the monsters, so for all of those it's making decisions constantly about how to move, behave etc.
---
The argument that's being made here, is that a private server does less of all of those things, and/or does them in a more simple way. This would cause behavior to be more simple, and cheating to be easier. A 'real' server would be doing more, and this difference would increase exponentially as more players get involved.
---
What. Take brutality main and Mira‚Äôs song offhand, without doubt. Why put a 50 dps weap Oh and a 37 dps mh oO
---
Thanks, this explains why I never got past rank 7 or 8  and this time will probably not get past rank 6. But I don't mind, I'll be happy to do some battlegrounds in my pve gear and that's good enough for me.
---
I agree 100% I love classic so far but TBC was just one of the best times of my gaming life. Everyday was just pure joy on that game.
---
Yea I agree with what your saying, but just because a company has billions in their bank doesn‚Äôt mean they invest it for this kind of thing. They might feel this is adequate enough for the total experience of classic. Or they are looking into different solutions to fix this but it might take time and reasonable amount of money to solve.
---
Yeah, I leveled to 60 twice and was working on a third because all I could do was get my preraid.
---
Or offhand Dalrends MH Brut. But not offhand that 50 dps weap. Wtf üòÇ
---
It is sadly a problem with blizzard api that don't allow weapon swaps in combat. So you need to create a macro and use that instead
---
Didn‚Äôt this happen back in vanilla too? So if anything it‚Äôs a very authentic experience.
---
What are the days of the week that raids are most common? I've got a good stockpile of raiding food and potions I've made, and want to sell them at "peak" times.
---
I had a slightly different macro for the rawmouseenable:
---
/script SetCVar("rawMouseEnable", 1);
---
Might be worth trying in case it somehow acts more comprehensively than the basic macro commonly used.
---
I'm not playing on classic and I agree with you on what you said, I just want to point out that even on retail this kind of lags happen on "large scale" PvP battle, a couple of hours before BfA came out Hydra and Ziqo went to nagrand arena to do a huge fight and it was lagging extremely badly, there was almost 10s delay on spells and MC were completely bugged. They also went to play an alterac and do a huge fight at one place and while it wasn't that bad as nagrand it still was lagging a lot. I don't know if the same kind of spell batch is implemented on retail tho.
---
I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs the same on retail tho ;)
---
Well the equivalent of getting your mount in classic would be getting flying in bfa. Both take a lot of time. It‚Äôs not equivalent to compare getting your mount in classic to getting a mount in bfa. Farming materials in classic for professions is still very similar compared to retail, because a lot of the gear requires way more than just finding some materials from nodes and such.
---
Are you into PVP? That's a lot more accessible then the raids I guess but probably not as fun and just as time consuming if taken seiriously
---
Why are you guys comparing LFR to MC? MC is the "hardest" raid available and you're comparing it to the easiest retail raid available.
---
Compare it to the hardest retail raid available, Mythic Eternal Palace, and suddenly your "if you fail it wipes the raid" statement applies to both except the Retail version there's a million more things going on and your sole responsibility is more than just casting Frostbolt.
---
&gt; If your PC can't handle 100 vs. 100 horde vs alliance spell effects, Frost Nova, reins of fire, consecrations, you need to either:
---
&gt;     get a better PC
---
&gt;     turn down graphic effects
---
&gt;     shut up
---
TFW you can't distinguish between serverlag and hardwarelags. This thread is about the servers, which seem to have the same problem they have in BfA. I haven't yet seen how this looks in Classic, but assuming it uses the same code BfA does I'm not surprised it's a shitshow.
---
He doesnt have a point lmao
---
It's hard to pvp in vanilla without raid gear.
---
I would say, choose the game you would want to play with her. Let her play a character that doesnt make or break the fight so people wont yell or insult her even if she messes up. 
---
If you play classic, you will spend a big portion of your time in dungeons, raids or pvping. 
---
Choose an engaging profession for her. I dont know what he likes doing but I can see how engineering can be fun. 
---
Help her get her items even if you dont need anything from that dungeon. Dont send her grouping with pugs, at least be there to support her. Pug groups can make you quit sometimes lol. 
---
One thing which helped me a lot early on (new player as well) was being on follow behind my friend. He is an experienced player, he new what he had to do and what to kill. All I had to do is follow and kill stuff until I found what I enjoyed doing. It can be confusing early on.
---
Bottom line is that if you have fun, she is more likely to have fun as well. If you burn yourself out quickly, you will spoil the experience for both of you.
---
A lot of people are acting like your damage will be useless. You'll still do more damage then a lot of classes just not compared to raid specd rogues. MC is really easy, so unless your guild is super sweaty, it's probably not that big of a deal. 
---
I just did MC with the guild and I was in my BRD pickpocket spec which was hemo/prep/ghostly strike and down to BF in combat and I was still in the top 8 in DPS.
---
That being said, I'm back to raid spec because it's nice being top of charts for most fights. Just talk to your guild and see if they care. It is tough for rogues to find spots because there are so many
---
I thought that the meta builds for [Horde](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005323105-0230152020050150231) and [Alliance](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/00502310503-0230152020050150231) were 19/32/0. What is 18/33/0? A [Riposte](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005223105-0230550100050150231) build?
---
Hemo really benefits from a slow main hand because of how the attack calculations work. combat is generally preferred for leveling but hemo is fine if you are worried about PVP.
---
Actually that's a fair point. I was thinking classic overall, but you're right, in current gear hunters do beat mages and warlocks, thanks for clarifying that for me!
---
And yet, the exact same thing that is their greatest strength is also the root of their greatest failing.
---
I think anyone can agree that bug protection and bot identification are extremely valuable things Blizzard SHOULD be doing.
---
But the fact is the server can't handle it.
---
They made a huge deal about increasing server population caps, and they must have known how that would effect the server.
---
If you can't run those necessary processes at the new, higher limit, then it never should have been raised in the first place.
---
God I wish somebody would friggin bring needtoknow to classic
---
Yeah I understand that. I sort of regret putting the way I did. I dont think it would be that tough to make it run smoother, maybe I'm wrong. 
---
I just think a game originally released in 2004 should run like butter with server technology nowadays. I feel like they just went to their storage and dusted off the 2004 server blocks and plugged them in lol.
---
I thought you guys wanted no change from Vanilla /s
---
Brutality Blade is the third best MH sword in the game currently, so yes. Ofc put that in MH.
---
These look amazing, and i've tried to use them but i cant get them to work properly.
---
First of all, the unit frames are showing the correct values, but the color fill of the health is not updating properly. For instance - a party member takes 100 damage and the entire unit frame turns black and it looks like they are about to die. 
---
And another issue occurs when i try to change so i dont see the unit frames whilst playing solo. Instead of disappearing, it shows a big black box where the unit frames are supposed to be. 
---
Any help would be greatly appreciated, because these sure look amazing!
---
Brutality MH - Mirah‚Äôs Song OH.

I can have riposte I guess but why would it for raiding?

That is a smart attitude, but as a tank, my weapon is not the largest source of my threat, and that's the only thing I roll against a rogue on. But for dps warriors, the competition is fierce. Mages, however, don't compete for anything.

Well if he had krol or viskag brutality goes into oh

Hey it would not be wow classic without poor performance
---
An awful lot of people are neglecting their family, job, and health because they're addicted to this game.
---
I have a question regarding possibility of raid loot trading.
---
1) For example if raid group kills the boss and there is some BoP piece that nobody in the raid needs. Is it possible to invite someone who didn't participate in boss kill to raid group, summon that person to the instance and give him that item?
---
2) As far as I know raid drop BoP pieces can be traded within 2 hours after drop. If it is true, can loot council take some BoP item and then trade it within 2 hours to someone in the world, who was not in the raid group when the boss was killed?
---
Let me say this, a shaman should be something you feel invested in, you must want to be a shaman, it does not matter if other people will let you play this or play that for what truly matters is what you want. Yes, you may have to heal, yes you will be expected to play your class to it's best ability so you will have to use totems and that is likely the only reason you will be desired over other classes. This is not a bad thing, you are a shaman, you are wanted in a raid, and you will be powerful. 
---
A shaman is something else from a mage and a warrior. A shaman does not channel the arcane, but the elements instead. A shaman does not use the light, but can heal all the same. These are things you will not get from a warrior or a mage, a mage will not heal, a warrior will not cast magic. A shaman is a warrior, a healer, a sorcerer. If that intrigues you, then you should play a shaman, you will do well for even a shaman can do well. 
---
You should not be a shaman if you are trying to be a mage, or a warrior, or a priest with exclusion. You are a shaman, you are not a restoration shaman, or an elemental shaman, or an enhancement shaman - just a shaman. If being a shaman in it's entirety attracts you, then be a shaman, if even one part does not, then do not be a shaman.
---
Considering you're much older and played the game before, you're smarter and know the mechanics of the game better. 
---
Vanilla isnt for casuals

There's far far far too many anything to ask for anything

I agree that classic's leveling journey is more rewarding. We will definitely be leveling together so that takes the edge off a bit from the difficulty.
---
I'm curious. Has your GF had any previous experience with gaming or PC gaming specifically?
---
why is that human doing nothing half the fight?
---
Did you even look at a core's source code like TC once? You can't do all the shit that was possible back in the days with WPE, it's obviously core specific but TC has a lot of security check to prevent packet editing.
---
That's weird. I can understand having tons of rogues and hunters, but not enough mages and fury warriors? Maybe you guys are picky? Because just because there's tons of mages and warriors, doesn't mean there's tons of GOOD warriors and mages lol.
---
Pally healing the lock taps prob makes it a leveling machine
---
What's that addon that shows player information when you mouse over them?
---
maybe hes just misinterpreting my use of it.
---
Goons here, blackout, cyno changes didn‚Äôt do anything to change stale meta...
---
Go Alliance on Gehennas, you will not regret.

World of Warcrack.

Tbh shaman and warlock tanks are just as effective as a paladin tank so we're about even lul
---
So you‚Äôre saying the lag is pc related even tho most steamers have 5k computers?

**Snuff** is a [smokeless tobacco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_tobacco) made from ground or pulverised [tobacco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco) leaves.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuff_(tobacco)#cite_note-OSHFT-1) It is inhaled or "snuffed" into the nasal cavity, delivering a swift hit of [nicotine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine) and a lasting flavoured scent (especially if flavouring has been blended with the tobacco).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuff_(tobacco)#cite_note-OSHFT-1) Traditionally, it is sniffed or inhaled lightly after a pinch of snuff is either placed onto the back surface of the [hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand), held pinched between thumb and index finger, or held by a specially made "snuffing" device.
---
You think they're ignorant to this kind of performance in thier game? You think that blizzard is this stupid and just ignorant?  Open your eyes they dont care they're not stupid or ignorant they know thier servers suck they just can not care less.

I mean, when you first started in bfa on release, you start of with garbage gear and eventually get better gear as time went on, in that current patch. Same thing in classic, started in questing gear and you work your way up to something better. The problem is, classic has awful stats on majority of gear. There‚Äôs not many options in general. 
---
It‚Äôs all in the way you look at it and you‚Äôre choosing to look at it in a negative manner. Just like I am looking at gear in classic in a negative manner.
---
I just want the first set of blues, I'll be happy
---
But you don't want to lower the max population of a server for an event that is relatively rare (with all that's going on on a server I'd say extremely rare even).
---
So maybe, yes Blizzard should discourage large scale battles. But freedom is critical to any MMORPG. So while you could discourage them by for instance not introducing world bosses (where you basically push for these types of events), you can't simply say "don't go to each other's cities and fight each other on a large scale", because that's the nature of the game.
---
1) only characters present for the boss kill can be traded  
---
2) no, because 1)
---
Just asking how you distributed your points so that you end up with "18/33", that's all.
---
How are Grizzly screwing with allys/ cheating? Genuinely curious about it as I never heard about it :)
---
Owls are nice for leveling, but for raids I'd switch to a wolf for that Furious Howl buff.
---
&gt;TFW you can't distinguish between serverlag and hardwarelags. 
---
Sure you can. Be at the event and have no lag.
---
Krol? No. 
---
Viskag? Yes
---
Go for about 600G on my server...I had one drop and held onto it for about 2 weeks and watched the price slowly creep downward. 
---
Wouldn't be so sure it's going to go up at all.
---
It is due to the 1.12 talents, pre bis and consumables (which are not even necessary).
---
BWL is going to be more difficult but still can be done without consumables. But more People will go for consumables which will make it about MC difficulty. ZG is quite easy too. AQ20 as well. 
---
AQ40 is going to be much more difficult for People that have not done it before. Same for Naxx.
---
Don't get me wrong it is going to be more difficult in BWL than it is in MC. but you still won't struggle a lot I'd say
---
Sorry, I didn't address it in my first post, but I was well aware of the powerhouse combination that is spiritual focus and conc aura, and use it all the time. I hadn't actually considered the interaction with imp concentration aura and spiritual focus, but that's really only because we haven't even hit the level where I could consider taking advantage of that. Having 5/5 spiritual focus early on was a huge help, so I wouldn't change that, but I guess I could consider respeccing when that's possible.
---
It is, look YouTube Videos ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Well, to be fair, he did say his GM wanted him to try it.
---
There is no failure in science. Only experiments!
---
Same here man, no luck in un goro or steppes.  EPL has them consistently.
---
No. Your misusing it.
---
&gt; Yet literally 90% of my server is 60 now with full preraid BiS and partial MC.
---
Do you ever considered that you dont need to be hardcore to do that? Because leveling doesnt need much time as shown from people like APEs who just farmt effeciently and didnt fuck around a lot? They killed ragnaros on day 5? Even if they went overboard thats just a max of 120 hours playtime (thou I belief they still slept), so 120 hours down on like what 40 days of playtime to reach 60 is nothing more than 3 hours a day. You just need to be efficient.
---
I would say its not that many people are hardcore, I would say a lot of people are slower than average.
---
To raid 2 hours per week for clearing MC and Ony doesnt sound hardcore to me, its not like everyone is raiding 7 days a week, 6 hours progress to get ragnaros down.
---
Many people just arent used to classic wow and therefor they need like 20 times longer to level up while on retail they get guided throu the "campaign" and level up how the game wants them to, in classic if you have no idea where to quest next or which mobs to grind to end up fcking around and simply running around clueless from north to south in an area can mean you spent 1 hours doing nothing.
---
You dont need any potions like the attention seeking content creators like punkrat have told you to "for MC you need to farm 800 potions and so much fire resist gear and so on" but this was just bullshit cause classic is easy and for MC you dont even need to be level 60 to clear it.
---
Consider those people slow while the average player should be 60 by now, and no there is no level 60 who is insanely hardcore, just people like JokerD or the Apes are hardcore - still hardcore not used in a way that they spent 120 hours a week on progress, just hardcore in a way because they now everything down to the important detail to be faster and more efficient than everyone else.
---
One swipe of that mighty tail and it's all over.
---
Why can't they fucking pay for it when a basement team of fans could?
---
Haha, i like to tryhard and my current guild has Retribution paladins and other dpsers performing worse than tank in damageoutput already.
---
My buddy grinded it out and by the end he was playing 8-12 hours a day just pvping.
---
Same problems on live forever, so wouldn't bet on it
---
You can find the macros pinned in the onyxia channel on https://discord.gg/RbCZJtw
---
&gt; Did Nostalrius have 12k online every day and big 100v100 (and bigger) battles at least 3 days of the week?
---
Yes.
---
Stopped retail after TBC :(
---
Uhh, 17/3/31 I assume? But to the question, you sound geared enough - get yourself the lbrs fireres buff and some potions, and you are good to go
---
#nochanges doesnt have anything to do with it. Blizzard increased the servercaps  even a medium pop server has more players than a full server did during vanilla. Thats the problem. 
---
During the release there were only a handful of servers to chose from. And they all filled up. And then blizz released more servers and those also filled up so they released more. 
---
The playerbase has evened out a little bit with the free transfers but most people dont want to leaver their guild behind. And getting a whole guild to transfer is just nonsense. 
---
THATS the issue. There are to many players per server and the servers cant handle it.
---
I like the first reply to that thread:
---
&gt; Can this be merged with the other 500 topics on this?
---
Whenever the battle is bigger than 80vs80 usually
---
I concur, Blizzard doesn‚Äòt listen to fans, they realized they can make bank by rereleasing an old buggy version of an already existing game.
---
&gt; One solution to this would be to reduce the view distance, so each player sees far fewer other players. This reduces the network traffic requirements, which have a good chance of being the primary bottleneck here. It's incidentally also the solution private servers took; Classic view distance seems to be at times almost twice that of most of the private servers I played on.
---
This is extremely important in this discussion and its a point that a lot of people seem to miss. The "default" view distance in Classic WoW is *really* high compared to other PvP games, which makes a huge difference.
---
Can you recommend a good addon for this?
---
Completely agree. I meet a lot of people who think we should have Classic forever with Classic+, and don't get me wrong, I love classic and I don't want them to rush it. I want 2-3 years of classic, so I have time to experience everything and enjoy the content. That said, I think that TBC was the high point of the game. There are small things that people didn't like about it, but the raids were fun, yet difficult, the talent trees were varied and distinct, yet balanced, and there was stuff to do in the game each day, but you didn't feel forced to do it.
---
Yeah the new server cluster in the bad cloud is running on hopes and dreams! Bring back the good old machines where there was real hardware for the problems! /s.   cloud server structure is not the issue.
---
That failed intercept tho.
---
I think having a kid might, in this case, add a level of motivation to how he spends his downtime. You might have more free time and thus not be as motivated to spend it "efficiently".
---
This......
---
This is the dumbest thing I've heard today and its only 1 pm.
---
I just trapped Simone at the beginning. Keep cheetah up and serpent sting on the pet as you kite it around the water. As long as you stay at max range Simone won‚Äôt hit you with her chain lighting.
---
Nah. My orc warrior has been running around at honored for a while, now. 
---
I think you have to be at Xroads when it happens to get the buff.
---
They couldn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs the thing. People are just rose tinted glasses on it all.
---
Just don't eat at a restaurant, or get take away, once per month, and your problem is solved. Manage your finances better and you'll be fine. You don't have to cut many corners.
---
If you are on that thin of a budget, I think a WoW subscription is the least of your worries.
---
So this logic assumes Blizzard is aware of the number of checks and balances required to have Classic function correctly?
---
Then why are this issues happening? They know what it takes yet they're not prepared? Do they lack the skill or engineering knowledge? Honestly I think that's far worse than them just being greedy. 
---
Ignorance or willful negligence. There's really not a third option here.
---
i love the gigantic mega servers that are ‚Äùsomehow‚Äù worse than private servers ran from some russian potsmokers basement and the layering that also existed back in the day #nochanges
---
The typical classic expirience.
---
I guess you are right...
---
Please point me in the direction of where it says how interpret what I see.
---
There's no attunement, but to unlock the door for West and North, you need the key from the first boss in East. Note that the key drops for everyone, and you only need one person to unlock the door to the other two dungeons.
---
I liked the singleplayer alot, the online is not so great I agree lol
---
You are delusional
---
Haha, nah bro, you see all that FR drop and screen tear? That's your PC!  /s
---
On the other side of things, that's what my PC looks like in world pvp and I have a 1080ti. Nice rig if that's yours
---
but why? theyve solved these issues you have on retail. why are you here complaining for them to make the changes theyve already made?
---
Have you ever actually felt like activision-Blizzard really cares about classic wow?  From J Allen Bracks famous ‚Äòyou think you do‚Äô quote to the under anticipation of population to their generally dismissive attitude to wards the success of classic WoW; nothing has felt like A-Blizzard really cares about the game. Every step of the way I‚Äôve felt this company is dragging its feet.
---
Seems to be what a lot of people say YouTube vids talking about it. Everyday, around 12 hours of straight PvP. 
---
That's so crazy to me.
---
Well this solution changes gameplay significantly or it doesn't work right? 2 raids that go into brm either won't see the other faction because they got sharded, or they will see them and this issue happens again. I don't think it's a fix as much as it's just a pvp deterrent
---
Fairbanks represent
---
That wasn't my thought at all, if you read the post.
---
I fully accept that some (many?) players have no honour and are perfectly happy to one-shot players many levels below them just because they can. P2 won't change that.
---
Players pushing higher Honour Ranks won't be ganking lowbies because there're no points for them and it's just wasted time. My error was thinking that when a target went grey it counted as a dis-honourable kill, rather than just a zero-point kill.
---
As I mentioned above, there will still be plenty of people that will still gank lower level players. Such is WPVP.
---
I hardly doubt that Blizzard is going to swap from a cloudbased Server System **back** to the physical Server blades they used to have up to (I think) wotlk?
---
They would have to get those Servers first which is expensive. And then Change the Server which would mean downtime which also costs Money etc.etc. 
---
It won't happen until PVP is out I think. But hope dies last right?
---
Wow, look at that view distance. Players popping up literally 20 feet away :D And you're using this to prove, what exactly?
---
Not really 20 years ago i had to know a lot about computers in order to use them it was an entry barrier. 
---
Now they are so easy to use and cleanly designed that even a todler can interact with it.
---
Nah at about 80-100 there's a couple seconds server lag. I have ~100mbps down and ~100mbps up. It's also easy to differentiate between server lag and pc lag.
---
The exception to 1) is the chest from majordomo. Anyone can step into the instance to loot from the chest, but they will then be locked to that raid ID for the week.
---
Well large scale battles happen between raids so a lower pop server will still see 2 horde raids grouping up to wipe and alliance raid or vise versa
---
I‚Äôm not experiencing server lag and like I said, I play on Herod. You guys are just the same vocal minority that made retail what is is now
---
Gl killing those so called ‚Äúopen world raids‚Äù buddy, if we have to bet it will be 3 months into p2 and not even 5% of the playerbase will even have a chance to kill him... thats nonsense p2 brings nothing towards pve since diremaul was already in
---
I thought all mattress stores were just for money laundering.  There‚Äôs tons in my city but they‚Äôre always empty.

It's right over there. /Points
---
Kukusk points over to iFunny.com where memes are misused and are not funny.
---
Turning off fps Cap foreground background fixed all the issues I had, dunno if the right click mousemoving bug is fixed aswell by this
---
Not really, theres 1-2 quests you can pick up inside and maybe 1-2 outside (I think one goes from Org&gt;Feralas&gt;DM) but none of them are entry attunements. Technically the flow is east &gt; west &gt; north since east has the key for west and north, but only one person needs it and a lot of people have it already
---
All im trying to say is the time it would take for this to be beneficial to someone . It isnt worth it .
---
This makes me sad
---
Even being near/under her you can escape Deep Breaths by being smart. Knowing where the safe spots are and positioning yourself accordingly while remaining both behind her and in melee range isn't hard at all.
---
As for whelps, I completely agree that warriors should be dealing with them in p2, however rogues are better off dpsing Ony. Because threat on whelps during p2 has an influence on who she'll target when she lands in p3, so we have our usual 3-4 warriors deal with whelps and everybody else deal with Ony.
---
Only have had warriors or their healers targeted this way for the past 30 Ony runs or so (we run 4 to 5 split IDs per reset). Another way to deal with that same problem is have everybody but warriors use the gnomish cloaking device (or vanish/fd) during the transition to p3. But that requires everyone to be engineer which realistically isn't the case in most non full hardcore guilds.
---
dm:e solo bosses is insane money
---
Of course but the problem is not two raids. The problem is when there are 10-15 large PvE guilds all going for a world boss spawn at the same time. Which only happens on the mega servers.
---
Yeah, like 10x more people massive. Full servers in Vanilla apparently had about 5k pop, on my server its about 50k...
---
Well. A lot of people say that any server that isn‚Äôt layered anymore is ‚Äòdead‚Äô. I‚Äôm also enjoying my time in flamelash, horde side though.
---
yeah blizzard took it literally and used 15 year old hardware XDDDDD
---
the avg internet speed and processor is probably x100 times as powerful as back then but for the server hardware to even be x2 as good thats too much to ask
---
Arms is definitely King when taking in multiple mobs
---
Nestea plunge
---
It is miles better than any warrior. 3k has to be a crit. Our warrior with capped fire res sometimes gets hit for those crits.
---
If server lag wasn't a thing, it still wouldn't really be that great.   You would either get zerged or they wouldn't be able to get through your wall of aoe death.   If there was zero lag when P2 hit, we would have a massive battle where the side with more people takes over and the other side fights for a little bit until people realize its a waste of time and leave.   Either the one faction will stick around and just bully anyone from the other faction, to the point of making it impossible to run things, or they will get bored and we'll be back to where we are now.   
---
I'm waiting for P2 to drive the faction imbalance on most servers to even more extreme levels.
---
ExtendedCharacterStats and DejaCharacterStats both do it. ElvUi also has it as a DataText option
---
Yep
---
Or the correct answer, C, private servers simply don't offer the same quality. Read up in this thread, a private server simply is a completely different thing. Apples and oranges.
---
A billion dollar company and they can't get some servers right.....
---
&gt; Not to mention some realms (like faerlina) had player numbers in the tens of thousands.
---
And where are your numbers to "show this" on Faerlina?
---
^\#nochanges
---
it's not the same at all. You don't need to do 4 world quests a day or 12 every 3 days to maximize some reward, daily runs, daily quests etc. These things are designed to make you log in every day otherwise you feel like you're missing out. It's draining in the long run.
---
Dire Maul will always be there, I don't miss out by doing it today and not tomorrow, or leaving for a week or whatever.
---
No, because it has nothing to do with unoptimized or horribly written. Private servers were simply much less complicated, and therefore of a lesser quality.
---
I thought this issue popped up as you stated grouping 200 or so people together. If 2 raids tried to wipe 2 other raids is it nice and smooth? Genuine question
---
Fury warrior uses cleave and WW - but so does arms. Arms is the way to go while levelling until 50, hands down
---
the fuck you even talking about dude?
---
Its not a fps issue, the game keeps running at 50-60fps, just the characters that start moonwalking and rubberbanding everywhere due to server lag.
---
200 newspawns barely interacting on a starting zone is one thing, 160 people casting spells at each other is a completely different thing, theres way more data going on and the servers just cant handle it.
---
ye its a bit sad, but its still a very good game, and it still req time and commitment, and its incredible at makeing social friends that can last years.  
---
So its kind of a bummer the game is not "hard" anymore. But the "back-bone" of the game is still there and that is why people do it over and over.
---
I main a restodudu and I will have to agree. Geddon is a really tough fight, as your physical mitigation does nothing, as all the hits are fire spell damage. Your bigger hp pool is what makes you better than the warrior for this fight, so I'd say get more fire res if you can.
---
Also, your healers are bloody awful. You need to have like 2-3 healers assigned to tank heal (we use 3 for rag and we use a druid there as well)
---
They need to find a way to fix their shit
---
Currently unacceptable and the players dont give a fuck what checks are happening.
---
Failure coders.
---
Better wait till p5 then
---
What's all that stuff with the ogre suit about?
---
As an Uni student, that is planning to study abroad in 3/4 months I really can't afford to do anything, basically I'll just have to sit home still and save as much as I can, but i really wanted to play WoW Classic and it would help me not wanting to go out and spending more money, you get me? And basically I just want to be good enough till I can buy WoW Tokens and not require money anymore, until then I don't mind giving people something in return.
---
Wow, we have close to that number and some of them have really good gear. I am going to organise a raid in the next few weeks if that's the case.
---
You are right, they offered way better experience for a larger amount of players VS blizz.
---
You were really helpful buddy, thanks
---
I legit 3 manned it yesterday with an eleshaman that was dpsing and healing lol
---
I mean... have fun with that, but unless you saw me enter stealth while running towards you you‚Äôre literally just guessing and wasting rage.
---
1. Different code. It's possible that private servers had more efficient approaches to dealing with large scale player battles. I also read that some had reduced the player sight range to help with this.
---
2. Lower population. Even if the battles are the same size, all the people on that server contribute to server load. So a 300 vs 300 player battle will do much better if there are only 600 people total on that server, against a server with 6000 people total. but we can't make any assumptions there unless Blizzard releases total active players counts for servers, and that's probably not happening.
---
You can do both fury or arms for leveling, at least until lvl40 when mortal strike comes into play as a clear winner against bloodthirst. 
---
Sweeping strikes are not as useful in solo play as you might think they are. Yes, you can kill 2 mobs at once easier but then you will spend time and money on food for regen you could have saved. You get less solo grind downtime as fury with Blood craze, Enrage and Flurry
---
Wait, you expected a heroic dungeon to be difficult though? I‚Äôm not sure I understand this post.
---
I know you're just being affable, but for anyone else who may not know, ElvUI is a fairly well regarded UI, I'm pretty sure anyway. I use it - took some time to setup the way I want it but it's working well despite my limited screen space (15" laptop).
---
Well Warlock can do everything that can be feared, long kiting isn't the limiting factor, fear is. Mage can do everything that can be slowed but it's usually more dangerous for mages than hunters and warlocks. Other than that I concur.
---
No problem man so we have to raid at 3am instead of playing in prime time and all fixed... for real do you ever think before submiting?
---
And apparently you don't know how real servers are operated. Neither do I, but comparing 2 things that simply aren't the same product and use that as an argument is what's really lame.
---
I would appreciate an update from Blizzard on this issue, but I don't pretend to know what the solution is, if there is one.
---
Yep, it still should be a challenge for the people who got the gear.
---
Why is this guy getting downvoted?
---
Multi billion dollar company
---
Scholo and Strat are absolutely no problem and actually my favorite to tank on my meme-adin. The mana drain is actually self-dispellable. Most of the aggro drops can be solved with a stun, blessing of sacrifice or BoP.
---
Something like DM West is much more annoying.
---
No changes already failed. You have different server configurations
---
People still play retail?
---
didn‚Äôt read the whole thing but classic twas a simpler time and retail is full of garbage
---
Well tbh eve online prevents this by slowing down the game
---
I followed every guide to fix this and nothing worked. I had a cheap mouse for my laptop, a $30 or so logitech. Plugged that in and works perfectly. Only thing that has worked.
---
50% of the time it works all the time.
---
Comparing a shooter with bullet physics with a slow paced mmo with barely any complex interactions in comparison.
---
lel.
---
because server transfers are bullshit, no one is going to leave their guild on a full realm to join some empty one
---
they should've given us enough fucking servers from the start, everyone except blizz themself knew that we need more
---
Yes, I believe that this would require information from the server that is not normally available, and so no mods can make it available.
---
Is xp from grinding much worse than xp from questing?
---
Yesterday I farmed cloth from harpies in Feralas with an average of 30k xp/hr. I then tried questing in Searing Gorge with an xp/hr of 13k but with 55k peaks when turning in quests. The xp count was a bit inconsistent since it resets when logging out and I had a couple of breaks. Hence it‚Äôs hard to gauge the difference.
---
Would I be almost as well off just grinding mobs? I mean I need to level my tailoring anyway and watch TV while gaming so I wouldn‚Äôt get bored. I just don‚Äôt want to fall behind my friends even more if it‚Äôs significantly less xp per hour.
---
Nope. Even those lag in the same large scale PvP battles. Although people think otherwise for some reason.
---
Oh man, my cat used to sit on the top of my chair behind my head while I played wow! She died recently.  Snuggle that furball for me, would ya?
---
No changes refers to gameplay. I don't know why people keep spouting #nochanges. I haven't even seen a single person asking for 2005 lag (but we still got batching and leeway ty blizzard)
---
&gt; You can shaman tank any dungeon in this easy game.
---
Easily for the shaman, sure. Not for the healer.
---
Fetch me the  breastplatestretcher!!
---
After 120 levels and the second difficulty level of a dungeon I expected an increase in difficulty, yes. I said 99% of the content of retail is mush and it is. You might not die at all in 120 levels thats basically farmville for old ladies not an rpg.
---
As already explained earlier in the thread, the private servers had practically zero integrity checking and almost nonexistent AI for mobs and environmental mechanics. 
---
A better comparative is current BFA which starts to lag with it with 20v20 matches, even in some battlegrounds.
---
It's a better idea to work 2 hours and play 20 hours a month...  In opposition to play 60 hours a month "for free" except you are not planning to successfully study.
---
Yea same thing like 8ish Tuesday on horde. Logged into my bank alt and couldnt get items/money from my mail. Was lagging out
---
If the WoW Token already affects WoW Classic then what's the difference for the tokens to be there too? lol
---
With fear its alot more room for errors, mainly pulling more mobs. 
---
Kiting is a straight path you can predict, and plan acordingly if you see any bumps ahead.
---
Facts get in the way of a good narrative though. Don't deprive me of my delicious outrage, sir. I need my pitchfork and torch!
---
Seems like people have different memories.
---
I remember BRM being massively laggy when every guild was fighting to get into MC.
---
Vanilla did not have 2019 hardware, but vanilla also had worse bot detection, less logging and way less server validation than now. For instance, teleport/flight exploits where a thing? Remember the corpses spelling out gold sellings sites. That was possbile back then, because of less server validation.
---
4x dps has a lot of damage, so you keep 3 mobs CC and nuke one, healer can outheal
---
Does everyone in the group need the suit I assume?
---
Ok Boomer.
---
Too bad black lotus doesnt work this way
---
Best cat ever
---
All you say is true and anyone with an IQ over 75 knows it.
---
What OS
---
Only if you blockchain your clouds properly as a service.
---
What even is your point?
---
I was there during the huge Southshore/Tarren Mill battles. Wasn't *this* bad.
---
That is NOT true.
---
If 2.5 happens it should be world PvP events in EPL and Silithus. 
---
Unfortunately world PvP isn't really a thing because of significant lag. 
---
So yeah probably BGs come early because what else are people going to do? 
---
Wish Blizzard would acknowledge what a lot of people are documenting and talking about daily.
---
Depends. The 2 games have entirely different economies after all. I'd assume getting the token would be cheaper in one of them.
---
Are you guys out in the world or soloing DM:East? Because the world is pretty tapped at all hours for me.
---
pservs were usually megaservers as well, both nost and ND had no upper limit player cap im aware of with up to 10k+ ppl online at times with minimal effect on world lag, that said the general quality of the live servers are better they just exponentially lose it the more packed players are together
---
cats &gt; dogs /s :)
---
rofl, okay zoomer
---
Most of your xp come with the grinding in classic. That's exactly why most leveling guids tells you to kill every thing when traveling from a questgiver to the thing to kill/collect.
---
Shill post
---
The people making comments like these are really being disingenuous... 
---
Changes like launching a game with layers, the sharding of zones, and not using the classic client are all part of the reason why this is a problem.
---
My paintjob was better tho
---
If you are 100% set on enhancement, tauren is a solid pick. As elemental you dont want the increased hitbox, because you get caught by melees way easier than as an orc. 
---
However the extended melee range is a godsend for any melee, even more so for enhancement as you get kited to the moon and back. 
---
Slapping something with windfury from 15yards away (it feels like it sometimes) is nothing to sneeze at.
---
What the fuck why would anyone WANT lag in there game. No changes to the gameplay please, who in the fuck wants to relieve shit tier internet lmao
---
Some great examples are mentioned in the comments here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/bzp404/p_servers_vs_classic_beta_differences/
---
Grinding can be quite efficient, but grind quests with little running and a tight quest hub will definitely be better. The thing is, you won't find that for all levels - so grinding will probably be more effective during those intervals of quests scattered out around the world. 
---
So the very unsatisfying answer to your question is; it depends.
---
yeah but the gear wont matter if you dont know the mechanics
---
Its not stupidity and ignorance on thier part they know exactly whats going on and they dont care sorry to break it to you.
---
You are 100% correct, but also in the minority.  It's pretty insane to have three 60's...I am curious about how Shadowlands will drop, wouldn't mind bouncing back to retail, but for now BFA is just not good.
---
I disagree, quite a bit. Druids, especially now, are very good tanks that can tank anything easily. Your pre-bis is wayyyy better than warriors pre-bis. You also have way better resist sets for MC. Once warriors start getting T2 and BWL stuff they will start to really compete.
---
Hey man, with respect to the 9/31/11 build do you have a link to the talents? Also is it highly gear dependant? Im looking to do some PVP but also be relatively raid/5 man ready so this seems ideal. Thanks
---
The part I am comparing is 100 people running around in the same place, where the server has to send updates about 100 clients movement, to 100 clients. Doesnt matter what type of game it is.
---
I hate to rehash it but it literally is a point and click theme park game nowadays
---
You want to go through and explain each one of these points in detail for us plebeians? Four hoops per firing? AI is synthesized? Guard pathing is elementary and conjectural?
---
You have any proof for ANY of this? Or you're probably just confident enough that throwing around some big words will mean most people will just believe you without question?
---
This
---
Eve isn't a bit similar in that actions are on a 1second tick I believe just as most spells and abilities in wow are. Only difference is that you can move around with wasd in wow which is not on a 1 second tick
---
waiting for swingtime next year
---
Same for the chest in a DM tribute run
---
Neatherwind has nice guilds and good faction balance
---
Any solid data on how much you lose for a dishonorable kill ?
---
I know right. So easy to use
---
Wait, you have two possible classes?
---
So Blizzad gave you the possibility to migrate to another realm which you didnt take, and now you complain....Yeah right.... 
---
Deal with the consequences of not migrating
---
Is it really? Atlas loot and everyone in my guild says it's P6?
---
You seriously ask someone to ruin your degree...  Honestly  even begging for 10‚Ç¨ a month would take 3 hours a month in any City...  You don't want to earn money it's not that you cannot afford. 
---
And "playing for it"  will consume catastrophical amounts of time...  So you won't end up with a degree after all.
---
just go DME , you'll get 3-5 each run
---
That was a nice big text, except it didnt lag in 2004
---
The technology regressed since then?
---
Best way to kill them tho
---
7d18hrs main and 2d2hs on an alt I made when a friend who joined wanted to play.  So I would probably be 60 if it wasn't for that
---
I currently off tank and have a decent relationship with the main tank, we already have similar gear and we just alternate item drops that we need. Both of us are gearing up nicely. We also have an agreement that when our first binding drops we roll and whoever wins it gets funneled for thunderfury first. The real challenge is disappointing the dps warriors when key threat items are given tank priority. Namely onslaught girdle / band of accuria.
---
Unpopular opinion on reddit
---
Before level 30 there‚Äôs not much difference between Arms and Fury (Fury might be slightly better). 30-60 Arms is much better with sweeping strikes and mortal strike. I‚Äôd you wana save 1g due to respecing just go Arms
---
Depends on the run, strat undead you have about 3 second to whisper someone for the healer spot or its gone
---
7,5k+ is nostaralius info I got by googling it, others said 12,5k, so getting the middle seems realistic.
---
I got a database of german servers which showed 8k (Lakeshire EU) - 16k (Everlook EU) players at peak times. Fearlina and Whitemane should be more populated, so 20k seemed realistic.
---
There's no good way on getting numbers, so tell me a more realistic one and a source
---
not even wow private servers
---
if I respec to deep resto shaman for dungeons/possible raiding am I screwed for any world farming or upcoming bgs?
---
They're banking on it being unplayable.
---
They're going to say "we told you to transfer" and then they're going to say "but don't worry we're kind God's, we're going to open up more transfers".
---
They're shutting off layering on the remaining servers next week, they're banking on an unplayable game that forces people to relocate.
---
A drug dealer knows their drug, they know you'll transfer if your arm is bent enough.
---
It directly increases your overall damage. Of course it is. It's mandatory.
---
I remember lagging on the flight path about the time I left The Barrens when everyone thought someone was ringing the gong.  AQ was entire server lag if you were on Kalimdor.
---
Set comes out later.
---
Have had literally zero issues with mine.
---
BFA is not a better comparison considering the amount of spell effects each character has in BFA.  A better comparative is vanilla wow private servers which is literally the same game with the backend tuned down a bit.
---
For no reason, he is wrong. Blue sets are included from the beginning
---
Pay beforehand. If you want to pay back later, there is a thing called "credit card" already for such.
---
How come? 
---
In WotLK sart+3 was rather hard, yogg +0 was a true nightmare, LK 25 HM before 10% (or more) buff was extremely challenging as well. I hardly call it "free gearing without any work". Have you raided normals or 10 ppl raids? That's not true raiding wrath experience at all.
---
1 week*
---
Welcome to the club! My boy is nearly 5 months now, im allowed 1 night a week to raid where the missus has him. Get yourself a good guild that runs onyxia and Molten core in one night and your sorted!
---
I think you'd be more time efficient just grinding some IRL money. The im a broke uni student is BULLSHIT. Get more money if you'd like to spend more money.
---
Nothing is stopping you from doing 25man raids in Classic though, if you feel that will bring more of a challenge. In fact, that's what many guilds are already doing as they realized they could do it with significantly less than 40. It makes it more fun for everyone involved while also bringing more loot to the table.
---
Dammn 248 dps as a rogue? :( that feels very bad. 
---
I've got one question. This DPS is calculated over which period of time? The time you actually did damage or the time you entered combat?
---
My recount addon seems to track my dps while I am attacking.
---
So, I may end up in this situation: less total damage than others, but higher DPS (because it counts the time I fought only).
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Probably yes. no (as in you can play without it, but i wouldnt recommend it). Yes, 10% is big. no.
---
&gt; So, without looking at guides and doing my best to make sense of things, I've been playing as a fully, 100% Protection tank. Once I got Defense Stance, I never left it. To this day I have not once switched stances nor bought a single ability that requires a different stance to use. No charge, no thunderclap, just Sunder Armor and Shield Slam.
---
Ok you've been playing Warrior (the hardest class to level) on hard mode. Like super hard mode. I'm literally in awe that you had the perseverance to get to 59.
---
So first things first, I'll go through and give my thoughts on what you've written.
---
&gt; nor bought a single ability that requires a different stance to use
---
Go and buy the rest of your skills. Even ones you don't think you'll use. Lots of people skip skills when levelling to save money, but at 60 it's a good idea to get your full toolset. Warriors probably have the fewest skills to buy as well.  
---
If you can't afford it right now I'd make this your first priority.
---
&gt;  I have not once switched stances 
---
Stance dancing is essential for making the most out of your toolbox and making efficient use of your rage. Examples of things which are great for tanking and not in Defensive stance:  
---
- Thunderclap provides a 10% damage reduction to physical attackers and decent AoE threat.  
---
- Berzerker rage provides fear immunity and extra rage generation.  
---
- Mocking Blow is your only backup taunting ability. 
---
&gt; Over the past three days I've been trying to tank Scholo/Strat
---
Yep, these dungeons are significantly harder than anything you've probably tried before. In general I wouldn't advise anyone to attempt to tank these places pre-60. I'm guessing some groups took you because you can be waiting on a tank for hours sometimes.    
---
The main thing that you will struggle with is just learning all the mechanics of the dungeons.  
---
Enemies in most of the dungeons before this are pretty basic. They hit you or cast damaging spells, simple. To make the end game dungeons interesting they have more complex abilities, some of which interact with the threat table.  
---
So my first suggestion is to be up front with the group. State that you haven't run these places very much and don't know the mobs layout. If that means they won't take you? GOOD! It's a waste of your time and theirs.  
---
Whenever I'm up front about it there's usually someone in the group who will let me know any special abilities I need to be aware of and which mobs to pull.
---
Another option is to go along as a DPS and watch what the tank does. Where they stand to do certain LoS pulls, which patrols they wait for, the order of pulling packs etc. 
---
&gt; Now I can't hold aggro for two ticks of combat and it's gotten me flamed incessantly
---
It happens. I consider myself a fairly decent tank but had a rough time doing a Strat Living run and got a bit of aggro from my team.  
---
Strat and Scholo in particular are much harder and also run by players who have been playing the most. So you're likely to run into people with less patience.   
---
Take a break sometimes. Go do some mining, level an alt, whatever. Tanking can be stressful and tanking a struggling group even worse. Remember to just play when it's fun for you.
---
OK, so some questions to see what should be the next steps for conquering Stratholme and Scholomance:
---
- Do you have a guild?
---
- What kind of gear are you wearing? Mainly blues/greens of the bear? How much +Defence do you have?
---
- Would you consider taking a week or so off from dungeoneering? I think it would help for you to do some questing with an Arms spec to learn the non-Protection part of Warrioring.
---
Err greater arcane protection potions? Literally useless
---
I had the luck to visit searing some 3-4 weeks back, there was just me, another Horde and 3 allies - all just there to level peacefully except this one Ally priest who quickly learned the error of his ways. If there's a lot of ganking, a quiet grinding spot may be preferable. I hear hippogriffs in Feralas are good, and in TBC I also did lots of Naga grinding (as Horde) in a cave on one of those islands.
---
We do have tremor totems tho
---
Christ... go outside more
---
Check the responses I posted the video link
---
It's definitely a trade off, but IMO they are being too conservative.  I guess this is me talking as a person participating in these battles and not some random person on the server who obviously doesn't want the game to crash cause some nerds are fighting over pixels.
---
Dont add him on battlenet, you will buy him a month and see nothing in return.
---
You're literally bashing retail. Why can't you just speak about how great classic is? It needs no comparison, it's simply a great game.
---
They could hire a team of programmers to redesign and reprogram the game engine and server code to be fully optimized for Classic without all the layering and sharding and other code accumulated in retail wow from the last decade. Seriously think about it, they expanded vanilla wow into what retail is today, [and then turned that all around again and turned it back into classic](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq1ult/behold_our_saviour_omar_gonzalez_classic_wow_dev/). There's absolutely no way that doesn't come with a fuckton of overhead and spaghetti code.
---
Other than that cat, your game looks like Emerald Dream expansion.
---
Lmao.  You would have loved literally zero chance to even fight back any time you're in the open world.  Sure.
---
You have no fucking idea what you're talking about.  I played all of Vanilla on high pop PvP servers.  This was like nothing I had ever seen.
---
Lost chapter is gay
---
commit a depraved crime involving violence and children.
---
I get that rank 14 should be something really special. But does anyone else feel like It'll be a LOT worse this time around compared to vanilla back in the days?  
---
Even rank 10-13 will be extremely hard for the majority of players.  
---
I want to mainly PvP and i enjoy a challenge, but it's going to be demoralizing when the best way to gear for PvP is through PvE.
---
Based upon what has been seen on private servers, then no, everyone won't be clearing AQ40/Naxx in 1-2 hours (but some will likely do it of course). And it's pretty safe to assume that the average "hardcoreness" of private server players is higher than it is in Classic (since not as many casuals would have wanted to dabble in private servers).
---
Getting the pattern and mats for it is the biggest expense, training tailoring is a fraction of those costs/time needed. If AH is nicely stocked you can get all cloth at a good price and if not you will have to farm lots of cloth. Is it worth? Yes, very good item that lasts for very long. Did the thing for my mage and archmage robe.
---
10 stitching in 2 runs? You need to sign up for a lottery.
---
I‚Äôm so disappointed that people still don‚Äôt know how to screenshot in 2019.
---
I actually had a shaman tank run DM:T last night with very few issues! And he wasn‚Äôt even fully specced for tanking. As a healer I just had to stay on my toes and it was fine
---
Because it's 15 years later, 15 years of company experience and 15 years of dealing with this issue over and over and over
---
If you need quests just keep bouncing around zones until you're good for the heart of Tanaris.  Otherwise just run some ZF or grind some mobs.  It definitely is a little rough patch in terms of quests, find some mobs and grind baby grind!
---
Ok I don't wanna be rude but saying stuff like   "There is no challenge at all in 99% of the available activities" followed by "I ran a heroic dungeon" is ridiculous. Retail is different when it comes to labeling stuff and all. Heroic dungeon is basically easy mode for max level players and mythic dungeon is normal mode for max level players. Then you got M+ with infinite scaling which is way more challenging than anything Classic has to offer. Any competent player doesn't consider anything lower than +10 a challenge. I'm not even talking about rankings here just a regular weekly +10. Then you got raiding of course which is tons more challenging than Classic.   
---
I don't feel like Classic rewards Casual players at all tbh. The game is about hardcore grinding if you want to be at the top. I don't think thats wrong or anything but it's definitely not casual.
---
i mean... eve does but
---
i'm not sure anyone would agree that it counts
---
Not all of us play in windowed mode.
---
&gt; They have baited us with their fucking cheating bullshit and led multiple horde raids right to us.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Welcome to vanilla raiding.  Your not gonna get loot in every raid.  And by chance you get lucky and obtain most/all mc and ony loot you're still gonna have to run it with your guild which also means weeks/months of no gear.
---
They don‚Äôt reddit, lol
---
Very hight
---
&gt;And most of these are deliberate choiches because the players wanted them.
---
?????????
---
Your entire post is a massive strawmanning, attempting at defending Blizzard at the cost of your dignity. At lest have some grace when attempting to defend Blizzard.
---
as a shareholder, and part of a shareholder's class action suit against $ATVI, I can assure you that there are no boats.
---
this is just me armchair architecting but i wonder if they could dial back the protections as population in an area goes up.
---
but then the fight could potentially have bad actors that sway it one way or another, so thats probably not a great idea either.
---
Your cat is certainly uglier
---
iirc they mentioned somewhere in a developer blog about classic that retail still has batching, but instead of a single queue they have multiple queues that each have their own priority (different spells/actions have different priorities), and the tickrate is probably much faster than 400ms. I‚Äôll see if I can find the post.
---
I'd love to see your video of a raid clearing AQ40 / Naxx, 1shotting everything while playing 1handed.
---
Plus the level coefficient and bonus penalty for spells learnable at levels 1-20.
---
Worth watching: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLyXin7jpqM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLyXin7jpqM)
---
When a large systemwide battle happens in even online, in game is slowed down to 1/10th to allow the servers to calculate and for players to make decisions, entirely different ballpark man
---
If only someone would‚Äôve warned about this 6 months ago so blizzard could prepare. 
---
Oh wait, we said exactly this would happen. They‚Äôve done nothing about it.
---
I'm in a similar boat as him. I've made pretty much all of my money selling tank runs. I thought it was a given that people paid for geared tanks regularly. I whisper people who are looking for tanks usually to get in groups. I don't spam chat with my service quite as much because people like to flame you for it for whatever reason. 
---
I don't usually charge gold straight up front because people don't like the idea of me taking gold out of their pocket. I do strat live runs for orbs or I will sell scholo / strat ud runs for unneeded greens / blues. 
---
I've got my epic mount, LH helm, flurry axe, edgemaster, and my reactive disk and I'm still sitting on about 1k gold about to start stockpiling consumes for the rest of the game. It's certainly a thing and certainly profitable.
---
You don‚Äôt need too MC is a cake walk, bosses just fall over. My guilds first raid we one shot everything but Barron.
---
Yea its gonna lag at first when 400 people clashes, but it picks it self up way better than the videos beeing posted on this subreddit
---
I dont know how it relates to my comment, but it sounds like you had a bad tank. A good tank should be able to keep threat on 2-3 targets at the same time. 3-4 starts to get tricky and 4+ can be downright hard to manage unless you got aoe trinkets, engineering shield, grenades etc.
---
[No problem!](https://xkcd.com/1053/)

That's exactly what this thread is for :)  
---
If I didn't want to answer people's WoW questions I wouldn't be here.
---
&gt;Does anyone enjoy this place?
---
It's an unfinished zone where they could have added many quests to make that leveling segment better.
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy.
---
That was fuckin great, lol
---
Take note of the exp you are getting per mob and per quest. I remember in the 40s while grinding in feralis thinking to myself I'm getting 150exp per mob and need to kill 30 for this quest (4500exp) to turn in and get 1500exp. 
---
It's part of why I don't mind, in fact I love, quests where it's kill 30+ of this, or farm a bunch of low drop chance items. Quick question completion can feel nice but the best exp is often when you're grinding for 'annoying' quests.
---
It‚Äôs cool, but what‚Äôs the point? You sell the accounts later?
---
This only gonna get worse. Next generation of computer users will be making a photo, get it developed, scan that photo and upload it some outdated image sharing site like [photobucket.us](https://photobucket.us)
---
World pvp is fine for me, never lagged once. Get a new toaster
---
You wanted historical fucking accuracy, you got it.
---
People never wanted layering in the first place! Layering was literally betting on classic wow failing as a game. They overpopulated the servers and planned on enough people quitting by phase 2 for them to be able to remove layers, except people aren't leaving classic wow in droves, they're staying.
---
Is there context missing or something ?
---
Thanks, just saw the clip - oh man that really sucks, having GM interfere with the world just because the servers cant handle it... I mean, the world was ment for ally and horde to raid each others cities etc.
---
Really hope they can come up with a solution to this.
---
Mythic level raiding is cleared by something like 1%  if that of the player population in retail. Less then 5% make any meaningful progress at all into mythic.  Only people who think vanilla is harder than retail are people from pservers who never played retail. What makes classic better is literally everything outside of mythic raiding and high level mythic+. My dream MMO would be a game with the soul of classic with retail raid difficulty and mythic+ dungeons, would just need to change how they do rewards in them to keep them from being the only thing worth doing ofc, but that would be fun to have.
---
I love being in Stormwind on Gandling.
---
It‚Äôs relaxing.
---
Just a shitposter, ignore it
---
Just go cookie cutter combat swords or daggers. I‚Äôm pulling 500dps in blues with Corehound Tooth. Buy mongoose elixir, Winter Squid food buff, and get health stones from your locks. Learn the fights. Use adrenaline rush and blade flurry at the best possible times. Make sure your group comp is set up well enough for you. Warrior, hunter, shaman, and feral Druid all give nice buffs.
---
I'm jealous. My dog will sit in my lap while on the couch watching TV but not while I'm sitting at my desk :(
---
&gt;Classic launched 26st of august. Meaning it's only been 2.5 months when phase 2 launches.
---
Yeah I didn't do the math.
---
&gt;World bosses Azuregos and Kazzak can be classified as raids, open world raids.
---
World bosses are 100% pvp events, with rewards.  It's impossible to do the world boss without pvp.  Considering it PvE is like considering AV pve because you have to kill a npc to win...
---
&gt;PvP is already in the game. Just no honor system. The doesn't feel unfinished, it feels unrewarding. But that shouldn't mean content should be rushed.
---
&gt;Battlegrounds aren't even until phase 3, which means your argument of "the game is unfinished because of lack of pvp" doesn't hold up as an argument for early release of phase 2.
---
"If it's a BG, it doesn't count, because it's not WPvP, and if it is WPvP it doesn't count because it's not BGs!  Let me contradict myself some more..."
---
World of Roguecraft - still relevant 15 years later.
---
 I dislike the retail playerbase, I dont want to join a guild and have a second job, and since people want an "easy run" when plugging raids, most group Ilvl requirements are above the ilvl of the base gear of the raid, so I have to farm LFR for months looking for only titanforged gear, because apparently you have to be way above the content to join a group for it. Made me do scummy stuff in the past, like joining a mythic progression guild, let them gear me through heroic, and I quit to just pug raids on my own time. (I know dick move but better than farming LFR endlessly.)
---
Plus all the end game content is an endless grind that feels mandatory, and I dont find it fun in the slightest.
---
Taking strat live for an orb is the only time I see tanks asking for anything
---
Yeah - I didn't do the math.
---
Open a ticket, but dont hope for much. I waited 5 days for a response but they said they couldent do it.
---
Spiteflayer on EU server seems to spawn in around 9:50-10:10 server time. I only camped for it about 20 min before i got mine.
---
Oof.
---
Yes, you could make a trust.  In fact after a few months you will notice the top pvp rankers on your faction will start to cooperate with eachother so they don't literally have to play 24/7.  
---
Your 1 kill example, while I know is just an example, but I believe you need to have like 10 or 20 HKs for the week to qualify and be included in the numbers.
---
Yikes. What's your /played? Three geared 60s since Classic launched 10 weeks ago is nuts.
---
It can absolutely feel 80:20 especially while leveling. I leveled herbalism and mining post-60 at different times and going through contest leveling zones was eyeopening. I'd lose track of how many horde I'd see before spotting another alliance.
---
They are just trying to make it like it was in 2004. Authenticity
---
Trean's bane is second to o ly the reaper on 2h fury raid dps on orc at least (meaning axes)
---
Yea Ali also get a sword from that quest. It's ok but not as good as omens
---
You have to understand that early MMO's were supposed to be virtual translations of pen and paper RPG's like D&amp;D.
---
Video game mechanics were designed to emulate actions you would take at a tabletop game. 
---
"/Log off" doesn't really translate that immersion, so "/camp" makes more sense. That's also where things like "/whisper" come from, as the idea of "private message" doesn't make sense lore-wise.
---
Slowly over time, MMO's became more like video games and less like tabletop games, but some of these legacy commands exist as fossils of a lost age.
---
Man if you only knew my life lol so don't speak about what you don't know, and i'm not a scammer and neither I want to be begging, that's why I could offer other games accounts from me (that I think that they're more worth than just 12‚Ç¨) and maybe other things, so shut up and if you can't help, just leave me alone
---
EVE has time dilation, which is basically artificial lag lmao
---
Social Media Generation can‚Äôt do anything without their phone.
---
Glad you enjoyed it mate üôè
---
Oh they can figure it out....its a matter of do they wanna spend those green backs :)
---
you still dont do aoe dmg.
---
a more accurate representation phase 2 would be 17 lvl 60s camping flight paths that 40-50s usually go to
---
Greetings from Dreadmist - Alliance. Congratulations!
---
I dont need to know your life to see you are a lazy little shit.
---
You got 2 hands and 2 feet right? Then get to work you lazy slob.
---
Did you just compare the best AoE dungeon tank in the game to... A hunters pet?
---
&gt; Top arena play in retail is harder than ganking randos in Classic.
---
Why are you making such a silly comparison? Why don't you compare the actual PvP content of Classic to the PvP content of Retail? You know, like mass world-PvP and premade BG teams duking it out? 
---
It's like stating that Retail is easy because Heroic 5mans are easy. That's just going to get you laughed at.
---
Bet you've not levelled a warrior and tried to take on more than two mobs at once. THAT's a challenge.
---
Even 200 on 200 ppl causes issues, it's entirely possible to have this kind of a skirmish even on low-pop realms.
---
I mean, if they wouldn't have interfered it would have just straight up crashed the server. Not the GMs fault, Blizzivison's fault. And we all know they care very little about us classic players
---
It is really bad for anyone but a human warrior, due to the lack of ability to get weapon skill for maces from edgemasters.
---
Ah Yes! Just flip that off switch.
---
its impossible to convince you that one of largest companies in the US, actually knows what the fuck they are doing and arent complete fucking idiots. but they do it cause they can make more profits, its cheaper to lie than set up new shit. if you think blizzard is not lying, you are so far up blizzards ass you couldnt get out if a fucking spelunker came in for you
---
What a response. It works just fine for you, and the game isn‚Äôt changing much. Like other addons updating and different phases coming to the game?
---
Even Alliance hate the gnomes.
---
Can someone help me confirm my understanding as a filthy casual; that in order to earn the full BLUE set pieces I will have to achieve the top 6%+ of the server for a minimum of 10 weeks?  And for the full EPIC set pieces I will have to achieve top .3% for 12 weeks?  From reading other comments, it seems like the time commitment for EPIC Sets is basically a full time job; 8-10hrs per day??  Any estimate on how much time the top 6% bracket might require?
---
Ah yes, I see.
---
No, it would be like you opening the hood of a car and giving me a quick rundown of the purpose of the carburetor. Telling me to go look at the code myself would be much more accurate to that analogy.
---
Blizzard will never fix this, has been a problem for years upon years in retail and they for sure wont dish out any cash to fix it. The only 'fix' they will do is adding WSG after a few or two of people complaining about lag in p2.
---
Would you mind sharing the good loop? I am having troubles finding enough veins.
---
Thank you!!
---
Honest question: what is so hard about that boss? AFAIK it's mostly a dps check, but with the numbers that all those prebis rouges and warriors are pulling already I don't see how that can be an issue with free resources and executes all day. Is there a hard mechanic I'm not aware of for that boss ?
---
Well of course, but why would everyone say otherwise, including atlasloot, which is correct about every other phase.
---
I've seen the posts but i got confused after people told me with quite strong conviction that it wasn't the case.
---
Thanks for the answer anyway.
---
LFR comes out after HC is realeased.. People are always outgearing LFR. Hell in Legion I was even outgearing HC ToS because of how easy it was to get gear.
---
I mention Mythic dungeons because the general message of OP's post is that retail is too easy compared to classic, which comes across as the usual retail bad, classic good style of posts. I don't think there's anything wrong with my statement that retail ultimately has harder content mechanically than vanilla ever did.
---
Likewise with OP's post, he was comparing the experience he's had in classic so far, to what he experienced in retail. As you say yourself, AQ40 and Naxx are when raid mechanics fortunately did grow more engaging, but the Classic content that we currently have, ie Molten Core can absolutely be cleared by a frost mage using one arm. (Especially if being carried by others, as could have easily happened with OP in retail.)
---
Yeah is it honestly hard to hit print screen? What is up with this new phenomenon? It has to be a zoomer thing.
---
They have a horde guild and use their alliance characters to see when we are leaving to head out and start camping us right outside Morgan's vigil all the way into BRM.
---
They give horde guilds details on when we leave and where we are so they can grief.
---
They collude on the devilsaur market.
---
They are scummy players
---
It will be a lot worse, yes. Servers have more people tryharding, as well as players who have been doing this for years on private servers.
---
Back in ye ole vanilla, everything was a lot more unknown. Sure you had people playing a ton, but it was never optimized to the same degree as it is today.
---
Blizzard took cost cutting step too far.  
---
They got these shit ass servers and canned the good ones to save on dosh.  
---
Retail also chockes with 20-30+ people on screen.   
---
Its seriously embarrassing.  
---
Not only that, but when reset day hits on retail, the following raid night its impossible to use chat (outside of guild) because everything has minute+ long delay.
---
Yea you are right, its just sad that this is what it have come down to. We probably wont see a change anytime soon.
---
Yup. In Classic, the content becomes casual AT max level and you start doing end-game stuff. Meanwhile Retail the content is casual BEFORE you hit max level and decide to start doing end-game stuff.
---
Imagine you're playing correspondence chess with your pal. You make one move per week. The post office has to process one letter per week.. Now imagine 100 people in your area playing correspondence chess **in pairs** (this is equivalent to people questing far apart from one another not affecting each other's gameplay). The post office has to process 100 letters per week. Now imagine all 100 players from your area are playing **the same 100-player chess game** together. Each player has to inform each other player about their intended move. Now the post office has to process 10,000 letters per week.
---
You double your server performance in every regard (cpu speed, ram speed, network speed, ..), each player doubles their network speed. You can expect to increase in-game interaction by at most 40% assuming perfect scaling (which is near-impossible to achieve in practice and an active research field: due to Amdahl's law, even if only a tiny fraction of your program does not scale perfectly, eventually you hit diminishing returns, meaning even if you increase server performance by **infinity**, you still only get a constant speedup. This is why 14y of hardware progress are not as helpful as it seems it ought to be).
---
Nah this is the big boy BRS fight club
---
Aw shit I broke the first 2 rules
---
That's your own fault for playing on a massively populated server. You had (and still have) the opportunity to play on a decently populated server, but you and people like you keep believing that the future will bring dead servers and only one of each type populated, which happens to be whichever one the person that thinks this is playing on.
---
Quit bitching about overpopulation and move to a different server. There is no Blizzard fix, you are doing this to yourself.
---
I love it too, I started in BC so SW will always be the capital for me.
---
Please tell me more sensei
---
40 here with a 3 year old and wife, i'm 60, half pre-bis with some epics as i've cleared MC 3 weeks running, i also have a druid thats level 26 and i never touch the game usually when she's awake and i also spend a bit of time with the wife, so its purely out of hours play and yes i uninstalled retail long ago as it has no sense of achievement or reward whatsoever. 
---
Having spent as much time as i have now in classic/vanilla i'll never go back to retail regardless of how they butter it up, its still got the same fundamental issues its had since cata which totally borked the original wow feeling.
---
Dude, have you ever heard about priorities? Not everyone wants to burn their money in games you idiot cunt. And obviously I won't scam since I could even go first, so don't loose your time because it's you being ridiculous here.
---
He used Blink
---
If they are using the same or similar tech from even 10 years ago I bet they are just being cheap because the server capacity isn‚Äôt dynamically allocated, ie. every zone has a server and they just eat the extra cost when no one is in the zone and don‚Äôt scale up for way above average activity.
---
Not playing bfa atm. But Shadowlands look very promising
---
I don't know who ever said classic isn't for casual, it's amazing. Always something to do, always having fun. Levelling is the best.
---
10000000% i know you are right, that is my point, they are skimping,  instead of providing a good service that benefits the game, they go the cheap route that is raking in cash with BFA, my point is, that blizzard should offer a far superior service to F2P Pservers, but they arent. and lots of people are defending em.
---
Searing Gorge is a unique location - small with all quests tightly packed around center. (But nowadays SG is a death trap for Alliance, because there's bunch of Hordes hunting for players :) 
---
You shouldn't call "peaks when turning in quests" something specific. It's part of the questing process.  
---
Yes, you get lower exp from killing, but it compensated by quest rewards.  
---
For average player proper "quest chains" give more exp than simply mob grinding.  
---
For example "Jame's Alliance Leveling Guide" is exactly about it. What quest to pickup, what to skip, how to do 4-6 quests in one "run", etc.  
---
Take Un'Goro for example: You enter it, do 3 quests at the entrance, gather crystals, run to Marshal Point, do one quest there and then pickup bunch of quests and do full circle around Un'Goro.  
---
At the end of the circle you will complete ~8 quests, so your exp per hour will skyrocket.
---
This won‚Äôt be fixed, period.
---
Only when fights are like 1000v1000, wich no other MMO can handle to begin with
---
I dont think so personally, but I have a few friends that are new to the game whom think otherwise. My point here was more that these raids aren‚Äôt out yet, and if you‚Äôre basing these statements of your private server experiences or whatnot it kind of removes you from the main demographic currently playing the game, was all :) Wish you a pleasant day with positive non-elitist thoughts ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Just get enchants &amp; stack world buffs, get all your consumables and don‚Äôt die or go afk during raid
---
Hunters really don't have it much worse then any1 else. Warlocks got soulshards, tanks and healers needs two gearsets etc
---
&gt; How is Molten Core, Ony, and every other 5 man dungeon not boring to you?
---
Where did he/she say anything like that? It seems pretty clear that he/she only commented about retail. Why are you trying to put words in someone else's mouth?
---
The part I find odd is that in a situation where 2019 hardware and a significantly more modern code/client allegedly can't adress this, they double down on it and increase  server caps, making this scenario more common. But I think we will know their stance soon. The world bosses spawning and the honor system avtivating will create a larger shitstorm.
---
Yea, not in a 100v100 fight, in a 1000v1000 fight yea, but not a single MMO or game for that matter can handle 1000 player vs a 1000 player :D
---
lol @ them thinking I'll turn off my adblocker for this
---
I think capitalizm reached its final goal. 
---
People are defending multi-billion dollar company that they are actually paying , for something they cant do, while bunch of hobbiest could do it for free. 
---
Wow.
---
You are confusing FPS with network lag. Older graphics cards couldn't handle it, however the server lag was never near that bad.
---
All true, but a warlock can't really kite. Fear is what makes you solo stuff others can't. So fear is the factor if you can fear it without pulling 50 of its frieds you're golden.
---
I didn't come up with any analogy. Seems like you can't even read.
---
Look up Bone slicing hatchet from Strat, alternative to serathil that you can get as a drop
---
The 5 weapon skill is really powerful, but using a different weapon because it is stronger than whatever else you have is not necessarily bad, it's literally what every race who doesn't have bonus weapon skill does
---
The guides are all focused on Def and damage mitigation. 
---
You need TPS (threat per sec) help. This will come from HIT gear. You want 3-5% at a min to help with what your describing. You also want a fast weapon to help gen starter rage. 
---
If you can charge and stance dance into def with talented tacts master this will help. 
---
I found it easier to do the following: mark a skull for first kill
---
If you can safely charge!
---
Charge and TClap
---
Dance to Def and shield slam
---
This hold the first target, then tab sunder and demo (even though its nerfed). 
---
This buys me enough rage to shield block and start revenge and sunder spam. 
---
Also your stun helps with any mobs that try to run off, buying you time to Sslam or taunt
---
If you cant safely charge
---
Try to hard CC and set up a charge while the mobs are coming to eat the mage/hunter that pulled. 
---
If you pull, pop Brage and ask for a few sec to get threat. 
---
Also use of Oil of Immolation and Dragon Chile help with a multipack. 
---
Really, this is the worse type of pull, as you have zero rage and the dps go full retail on you.....
---
If you could post your spec this would also help and focus (dungeon running/raiding) this would help in other tricks/tips. 
---
The reward from LBRS boss chain +2 hit gloves are amazing. Dont let the fact that they are chain fool you. That +2 hit will carry a long way, this with being human racial for swords and maces goes a long way for dungeon runs. 
---
Biggest issue tanks run into is, hit is not advertised as a must have stat. Trust me when I say, you want a good a min of 3% (2% if your human with a mace or sword) hit for dungeons and 5-7% for raids. Else your dps will be threat capped or worse they die when they pull a taunt immune boss.
---
I‚Äôm glad I rerolled to a pve server...
---
If you want to avoid minmaxers, do what I'm doing to do and join AV instead of WSG
---
Maybe my server is just very fortunate or I'm not paying enough attention.
---
Must be a mental thing because paying in drops sounds much more reasonable than straight up gold. I guess because there is a chance I wouldn't win those drops anyways so unlike the gold it's not necessarily coming straight from my pocket.
---
Thanks for the corroborating support. I'm going to have to pay more attention to the chat to see if this is a thing on my server.
---
Eve online
---
as opposed to just spreading lies it's a decent argument.
---
Stop defending Blizzard. Are you getting paid by them to tell us to shut up about the servers? Probably not. We want the game to be playable during large scale PvP. It was playable on private servers with the same sized battles. There was lag, but it wasn‚Äôt as bad as it is now on ‚Äúofficial‚Äù servers. 
---
If there isn‚Äôt a solution to this, Blizzard just needs to tell us. However, I do think there are solutions to this but it seems they don‚Äôt care and aren‚Äôt doing anything about it. 
---
We all love the game which is why we play. This is why we criticize it, because we want the game we love to be playable, and to have fun. Being a white knight for Blizzard isn‚Äôt going to help them improve the game. 
---
If you‚Äôre going to try and say ‚ÄúWell you wanted the classic experience‚Äù then why are there layers? Why are there other changes but when it comes to unplayable lag it‚Äôs a nope that‚Äôs how it was back then, gg! 
---
So tired of this issue that could be rectified but it just.... isn‚Äôt
---
Not sure why but I haven't had any of this on bigglesworth. I've had big raid battles down at Mc entrance.. heck even today we had 80-100 people fighting in front of onyxia and I had no troubles at all, smooth as can be. Not sure why I'm immune..
---
If it's an exploit why did they never fix it in such a long time?
---
I don't usually advertise the run.
---
Usually I just find a group that is 'LF1M scholo need tank' (or strat ud) and whisper them that I'd be willing to tank it for uneeded blues / greens. Some are fine with it others would rather sit around and wait. 
---
I've seen many groups decline and then go for the next hour unable to find a tank.
---
Blueset yes, which one though? We don't really know for 100%.
---
This was super entertaining.
---
I am not here to defend blizzard. If anything they can defend themselves.
---
Blizzard has right to take blame and complaints and I don't negate that.
---
I am here to hopefully shed some discussion over topics the community seems confused over, rather relying on karmawhoring.
---
Yeah i heard about priorities. Clearly you dont want to play wow if working 1-2 hours IRL is to much to ask. 
---
Jesus christ, you are in for a rough ride once you can suck your parents tits no longer.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs not the same size battle that people are complaining about in classic either. Looks like about half the size.
---
I have a similarly-patterned cat who is also very snuggly, though when I sit at my computer he prefers lap. I have begun to wonder just how indicative fur patterning is of certain temperament tendencies.
---
No lol, he is dead and everybody dissapears.
---
The video is almost 5 minutes long that's the only example you got?
---
Because eating a 1k overpower is a lot better than eating a 1k white swing and a 1.5k ms crit followed by a 2k execute.
---
Grinding can be viable in it's own way. It probably isn't as viable as speed clearing dungeons (or doing xp runs like brd arena, ZF gy, etc) if you're looking for pure leveling speed, but it's reasonably comparable to questing if you kill pretty quick and/or have a good chunk of rested xp.
---
Like you mentioned, questing is kind of spiky because there are longer periods of running around not getting xp while avoiding mobs that aren't the ones you need, running back to turn in the quests, flying around between zones, etc. Grinding is more steadily-paced and can net you quite a bit of resources if you have some hours to kill and just want to fight non-stop.
---
I honestly really enjoy a good grind session. Put a show on my other screen, find a spot with good drops and just go to town. It's kind of cathartic. 
---
Example: 
---
Over the past couple days I've put in about 3.5-4 hrs grinding the Felwood fire elementals on my 56/57 mage. In that time I've farmed 140k xp which, I mean, like 35-40k xp/hr isn't *that incredible* but I'm not super concerned about speed leveling, it's XP I needed anyway, and I've also gotten:
---
-20 elemental fire (worth 5g+ ea and rising on my server)
---
-2 essence of earth (~12g ea and rising)
---
-20 heart of fire (40s ea)
---
-5-6 essence of fire (3g ea)
---
-a handful of elemental earth (1g+ rn but might pop a bit in p2 because restoration pots)
---
-probably 40g worth of dreamfoil/silversage/plaguebloom/gromsblood that spawns in the area
---
-probably 40g worth of random vendor/DE greens
---
-maybe 10-15g worth of grey vendor trash.
---
I can confirm. It's even better with enchanting. 
---
My played time at 60 is around 3 day and I have like 900g with Hide on the Wild and Truefaith, no epic mount tho... 
---
Most of them are from dungeons (some from Mooncloth Bags and enchanting when I'm chilling in IF).
---
I'm thinking about dropping Tailoring for mining, respec and try DM:E solo runs.
---
This is a dumb idea. Sorry.
---
Not sure why my last video was taken down as I didn't break any rules or guidelines.  So I am posting this here again.
---
I play on a PvP server, who touched you?
---
Pretty much all servers are. Pservers felt alive.
---
Lol can‚Äôt take screenshots?
---
Well aocrding to the spreadsheet, if you place in the top 6% of pvp players of your faction each week, you'll reach rank 8 after 4 weeks and 10 after 10 weeks.
---
In the top 15% it's ~10 weeks to reach rank 8.
---
In general you have take a look at your target rank, which will be 5000 RP for Rank 3, 10000 for Rank 4, 15000 Rank 5 and so on.
---
Your weekly decay is 20% of your current points, so, if have 20k points, you lose 4000 per week.  
---
So to reach rank x, you must beat the decay on that rank by ~1000 to reach that rank within 10 weeks. So, if you aim to reach rank 10 (40000 RP), you should aim to finish in the top 6% or better each week to reach it within three months.
---
Started in Vanilla, my first character was a human.
---
I feel strangely attached to Stormwind.
---
Pretty much. Realistically what will happen is that you get into a raid as fury-dps and there will be maybe 2 or 3 encounters where you have to tank. You'll have your normal fury-spec for that but you'll change your equipment to prot-tank-stuff including a shield.
---
The whole concept of maintanking with a fury-prot-spec and finetuning the balance between offensive and defensive gear is something for highend-guilds who try to compete for records to clear a raid as fast as possible. For that the amount of threat the tank generates is the key because that's what's holding back dps who also have highend-gear.
---
Doing it just because it's theoretically possible and the tank wants to see high numbers too is not a good idea. It's a burden for the healers and just increases the risk of wiping.
---
If you want to MT, then you should be prot. If you want to DPS you should be fury. If you want to dps and occassionally off-tank an add, you should still be fury. You should almost always wear tank-bis for tanking. Good bis-lists even take threat-generation into account and recommend pieces accordingly.
---
It's not ideal, you'd definitely want an ele/resto build.
---
OP did.
---
&gt;For example, killing 5 mobs at the same time at level 20 is easier on Retail than it is on Classic, since that gets you killed in 5 seconds.
---
OP didn't mention anything about this. He was talking about end game pve.
---
Also, 'one of many reasons'? Sure. Keep fooling yourself.
---
If you just learned that you have to obey this weird, pointy-bearded rear-leg walking being and it starts stripping down to its pelt and starts dancing in front of you, wouldn't you too take the first best opportunity to run off? 
---
Sarcasm and humor aside, that sucks. Hope it gets resolved.
---
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Sundays. All around 19.00.
---
If I am running with guildmates, of course I won't roll against them on something they'll be using for weeks. But if it's a pug run and something like these pants drop, you should fully expect the healer to roll against you for them.
---
Some say he is still stunned to this day.
---
EVE online does large scale pvp.  The trick they use is called time dilation.  Everyone is the zone gets slowed down and time moves slower.  Allows for thousands of ships to fight.
---
No but a good Roy can beat any frost mage
---
But don't you want the classic experience? Or you want the classic experience that's convenient to you? Lol
---
To the people complaining about WPVP lag may I ask what are your PC spec‚Äôs?
---
Example? im asking whats happening, love the defensiveness tho
---
You need to get top 6% to go from rank 9 to rank 10, which takes 3-4 weeks. So you need to be top 6 for those weeks.
---
See what people forget is that along with their financial and technical power increases comes proportional increases in red tape.   
---
The actual WORK that would need to be done to do this is easy for this company. The process of getting it done, however, is anything but unfortunately.
---
I was a mythic raider until BFA. I played during the beta and it left a really bad taste in my mouth, so I never started it. I have played some to unlock allied races and even considered going back to mythic raiding, but eventually I didn't.
---
Some of my problems with the game feel like paradoxes. The gameplay feels too bloated, with too many combat abilities, but at the same time, it feels like it has no depth. Many of the rotations come down to "spam what's available" and "align your offensive CDs well". The game is way too convenient in regards to everything, but when something is not convenient, it feels awful. In example, not having a flying mount in Mechagon or Nazjatar. Those areas can be horrible to navigate without a flying mount. 
---
I like Classic because it feels more grounded in all aspects, I actually enjoy the slower pace (although I wouldn't mind a few more combat abilities) and loot feels more valuable. I got an Azuresong Mageblade and I know that I may not replace it until late next year...and that's totally fine. During Legion I ran ABT in all difficulties because of potential titanforges being an upgrade over my mythic gear. It actually **felt bad** to get a legendary (because it could be the wrong one) or a warforged item or a +10 titanforge because it could have been better. 
---
Another paradox related to the slow pace of the game, I feel that the combat pace is too fast in retail (haste should have never reduced GCD), but at the same time, when they originally added lots of spells to the GCD, the gameplay felt awful. I played Shadow Priest in Legion, which had one of the fastest gameplay in the game, but during beta, the gameplay, even if not changed at the core, felt horrible (because of losing Mass Hystery and the megahaste). Another paradox, classes have too many things. Too much AoE, too much self-healing, too much CC, but remove CC from some of the classes and suddenly they feel worthless. 
---
Things like this makes retail confusing to me. It feels too fast, too bloated, too convenient, but you lose something in one of those areas and it feels awful. 
---
The terrible state of the faction balance is a big turn off too. I just don't want to play Horde, but most competent players end migrating to that faction just because of the overall pool of competitive players, which just makes the problem worse. 
---
I feel WOW retail needs a "clean up" of some sorts, but it's not going to happen. A large % of the current retail population is happy with the content available, so why alienate them in favour of people who prefer to play Classic?
---
It does not happen with 180 pilots, right? 
---
It happens with thousands?
---
?
---
Gw2 has battles like 100v100v100 lagfree
---
having played GW2 starting in the beta, the lagfest of two blobs colliding into eachother in WvWvW is exactly what WoW suffers from. Arenanet has also effectively forgotten what WvWvW is even thought it was a key selling feature of the original game -- they'd like to pretend it never existed. 
---
there's literally blob meta specs focused on AOE and heal/health pools to survive that zerg.
---
By harder i mean i can't just pull 10 mobs and kill them all easy peasy without any problems when I'm questing. Numbers are also flying everywhere and you don't know which ability did what yellow dmg number on the screen. It's a total mess.
---
But don't you want the classic experience?
---
Thrash procs generate additional rage, which is what makes it so powerful
---
So I‚Äôm going to be rolling a new character to play with my dad who plans on being a Druid and healing. I was wondering what class you guys think would compliment that. Don‚Äôt really want to make a warrior or hunter because I already have those classes.
---
he died and got instant released, so he couldnt see people around him. due to the slight but very playable lag he was still at hes corpse.
---
Just a heads up, most people dont.
---
&gt;hardware
---
Ok, zoomer.
---
Still nothing beats an image pasted in microsoft word document which is then sent your way.
---
Because it limits them to 3 attacks in the next 15 seconds, none of which you care about.
---
The very first thing a warrior will try and do to a rogue is bleed/slow you. If you‚Äôre locked out of stealth and get slowed? You‚Äôre fucked. Well not entirely sure but it‚Äôs not *good*.
---
But anyway, as a rogue it‚Äôs pretty damn rare for me not to dodge at least one attack every 4-5 seconds no matter what, so that overpower is coming regardless. An early evasion means that‚Äôs *all* they get.
---
What is the best alliance FP for getting to Sunken Temple?
---
Honestly I don't know for sure, I just assumed on the talent's description :)
---
If someone can confirm one way or another that would be awesome, to me it doesn't look like 50%+ on frozen targets at all...
---
ye im sorry but i have no clue what you are talking about or what the point of it is, it all sounds like rambleing i have a hard time to read.
---
why i quit had nothing to do with what is hard, what is other guilds doing etc etc. i could not careless. 
---
I quit because the game turned into something i did not like, and i was right on it also, the natural raid progression died in wrath. And to this day it is the same system that made me quit the game that retail uses.
---
Yeah. It's courious that these people are the same ones who are screaming "Russia is interfering in our country's system", yet this is exactly what they're doing in this situation.
---
https://youtu.be/fYFD06UFscw
---
No it doesn't matter, but why give a piece to something useless tather then a few more dps.  I also have said through out the post its not as clear as healer or dps gets item. Look beyond the raid reward the person who puts in more effort to help the guild. Does person 1 help new 60s get geared? Oh that shaman needed an arcane crystal and they hooked them up, etc. If the spriest or healer is a raid logger, why reward that to them earlier. 
---
  As an spriest main (one asked to swap from holy to spriest) I geared my holy prebis, farmed mats and gold to make my truefaiths and as good as gear allowed me, I then did a ton of work on a shadow set. All while helping others get the gear they needed and a lot of times put my own gear in the back seat. Multiple pug runs when noone wanted to run with me. I'm lucky my guild rewarded my work and weren't like well you're the spriest, you wont get until we have everyone geared. If it gets to the point you dont wanna upset them, pick the top people who are in line to get the item and make them roll. Easy fix.
---
Overgeared to the max.
---
Relying on dmg reflect buffs and consumables.
---
Resorting to tricks with engineering items and damage reflection equipment.
---
Great example...
---
oh man was questing with my buddy as enh and he was significantly over leveled just helping me out. Halfway through grinding trolls in STV he was like "Pull more buddy we can do it"   
---
KK \*CHAIN LIGHTNING THE CAMP\*
---
I have played wvw for a long time i have never lagged out in wvw the same way in wow where the server is caped out. Sure GW2 should do better fps wise but the GW2 servers are not the issue.
---
I mean, then you can't really bitch about not finding tanks.
---
You really don't need great gear - throw some plate on instead of your leather pieces, boom, job done. Just also roll on tank gear in your instances and you're set. 
---
Hell, I mostly dual wield in dungeons and only equip a shield for hard-hitting bosses (Baron, Rend, Drakkisath, Rattlegore). I'm just dual wielding in Defensive stance and spamming Sunder instead of Bloodthirst.
---
It‚Äôs not that good of a PvP ring honestly - you want to sell this thing ASAP. Only going to start going down in price as people start getting PvP and BWL gear
---
If you want to go ret in pvp and only heal for raid content, you dont need more then illumination.
---
I would put the rest in the ret tree.
---
Should you want to pvp heal, the prot tree is more beneficial for survivability and utility.
---
Holy reckoning is also hella fun!
---
It's not the most uncommon topic having a hard time finding tanks into this shaman simply mentioning that they wish more people were open to shamans as tanks or that they are gearing their shaman for tanking. No bragging required.
---
Doesn't take much for someone to leave if they can't handle a shaman rolling on tank gear for instance.
---
You weakauras for classic?
---
It has the same type of info as TMW.
---
Yeah definitely, the horde get it in one extra zone so alliance should get it in three extra zones. Makes perfect sense.
---
Classic was always good for casuals players, because (a) you set some goals and could slowly go for them at your pace and (b) later content releases do not invalidate everything you've done so far.
---
In retail, if you want to stay relevant (not top tier, simply relevant) throughout an expansion, you need to put into the game an insane amount of hours, doing mostly trivial content, which is probably the worst kind of grind. And there is no end to it, either.
---
I play druid and can tank or heal. I asked in LFG for tank or healer for strat live. 3 tanks instantly message me " I can for orbs". Decided to tank myself and search for a healer instead.
---
Retribution Aura + Righteous fury (threat modifier) are plenty to keep most mobs glued to you. Anyone that‚Äôs pulling threat in my group automatically gets Blessing of Salvation (except the hunter... they can FD).
---
So, +5 weapon skill = 3% +hit against lvl 61-63 monsters? Or it does not scale like that? I mean, trolls with +5 to bows (305 total) have +3% hit to what, exactly? Legit question. Thanks in advance!
---
Dusk wood, you need to run through the dead wind pass and into swamp of sorrows

Interface.......social.....tick the block chat channel invites box

Interface Options &gt; Social &gt; click the box that reads "Block channel invites" &gt; Profit?

Itemisation is 1.12, we already know this. Whenever it is that an item's getting added, it'll be added in its 1.12 iteration.
---
Reading one minute of text is to much for most people. And then people wonder why IQ is dropping in the west. Computers do all the thinking for you.
---
Very annoying. I report every single one, I know it is a losing battle but I'll do my part.
---
Yeah worded my reply bad, wanted to say that I think that our tank is reading too much reddit and thinks he can only keep aggro on one mob at a time. That gave him some kind of excuse to dont even try harder. Because reddit is always right...
---
What's the crit cap?
---
You don‚Äôt understand how the stock market works, do you?
---
Only if you're mind controlled at the time, right?
---
The ring isn‚Äôt actually good for Mage PvP - rather have resistances than another freeze. 
---
PS I‚Äôm playing a mage and have 2x of these
---
For a lot of people , myself included. Quests (save for a few exceptionally interesting ones) are merely a means to an end. I wanna do dungeons and raids. Quests are there to speed up getting to 60 nothing more nothing less. So the add on streamlines it.
---
Now I don‚Äôt disagree the value of having no quest helper. It‚Äôs there for sure. And tbh I wouldn‚Äôt hate having no add on. But that‚Äôs my feelings towards it
---
I love the alt+z press to activate shadowplay?
---
I play classic because it's a nice time-sink. I know where it is going and that I'll eventually reach my self-set-goals.
---
I don't like retail because it constantly changes everything. It's like a hamsterwheel you need to constantly be in and eventually all your progress becomes meaningless sooner or later.
---
Another thing are the game-systems. Instead of giving you a bunch of abilities for you to pick when you think they are most suitable, they are arbitrarily interwoven for no other reason than making the game more difficult to play at the highest level. Then there's the items. They all feel extremely samey and there's basically no real decisionmaking in itemization. I'm a druid in classic and I have to have a lot of different items to be good in different aspects of the game because which stats are most valuable for me depends on what I'm doing.
---
Well then I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with mommy tonight!
---
It's 15. [source](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0))
---
how is he seeing enemy buffs? dont see him casting detect magic
---
I guess you could finish the questline even after the gates has been opened and simply character transfer to a lesser server that has not opened yet, if that option is open by that point. After the fact simply transfer back to your main server.
---
That aside... Acti/Blizz made record profits in 2018.
---
well, its a private server. it instantly put him in spirit form when he died. it didnt teleport him to the graveyard.
---
The most picked classes are Warrior and Mages, so though it may just be his experience its also much more statically likely.
---
This is the part about cats I like more than dogs. I feel like 80% of the time Im a dog person until I just want to snuggle on my lap or something lol
---
It‚Äôs classic, you don‚Äôt need simcraft you retail booger.
---
block channel invites option is your friend
---
They are but it‚Äôs beside the server  performance point.
---
im a millennial lol.
---
It took me a solid week for a response on a fairly simple subject from a EU account where i could choose my character and all.
---
Its not your account that's making it take time, blizz support in 2019 is just the worst.
---
a massive **Horde vs alliance raid pvp war**
---
Seems like a mouth full to even say that. Who the fuck else would be fighting???
---
&gt;dont compare pservers to blizz ones, doing so is ignorant.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Did you just take a picture of your screen with your phone, then take a screenshot of that picture and post that?
---
Amazing.
---
ofc its blizzard fault but saying "lol billion dollar company" doesn't make the problems go away. You can't throw money at the software engineers and tell them to wave a wand and poof all servers are up with no lag, these things take time...
---
you mean 2 rogues can kill the end boss alone?
---
I enjoy helping the opposite faction because I know of they cross me, it's very satisfying murdering people as a warlock.
---
I read it and it is nonsense. Blizzard has the resources to make it happen but isn't pursuing. It is absolutely a valid comparison.
---
Oh shit it's The Quartering, what's up Jeremy
---
Lol @ the guy still mad he couldn't get through stv on pservers. Don't even know where to begin in terms of pointing out all the wrong in your post.
---
Other than your definition of Casual I agree with everything you said. 
---
I still stand by the game changing during Cataclysm. Dungeon runs became speed runs. It‚Äôs no fault of the players either, I blame game design in making dungeons stupid easy to blitz through. 
---
I enjoy group content and I enjoy it being challenging. I can‚Äôt get that in retail until Mythic and I don‚Äôt want to go through all the easy crap to get there. 
---
I don‚Äôt know how to explain it I guess but Classic feels different than retail and I am enjoying it a lot more.
---
The buff or the understanding? I could understand just fine completely on my own.
---
You have a taunt. It's called Earth Shock.
---
Azshara could do with being finished off.
---
But TBClassic would be good too,
---
Reasonable arguments isn‚Äôt ‚Äòdeflecting‚Äô, thats conversation son.
---
Honestly that is a great question. I would like to test this.
---
Feel the Rhythm! Feel the Rhyme!.... Love the guild name!
---
It also goes on to say this:  
---
&gt; A second pass that takes all Honor contribution for your faction into consideration is performed. If that calculation comes in higher than 25 HK, then everyone less than the new contribution floor level is also culled before ranking calculation is done. 
---
So maybe 25 to be safe with how massive the servers are?
---
Literally everything he said was true.
---
Ouch, now that's not a very nice thing to say now is it?
---
Did it at 10 am, nobody to contest. Demons are easy to kill in one spawn. But this was a while ago with a lot less hunters having leaf.
---
&gt; Classic is great for casual players but not enough complexity to keep more experienced players engaged. ... All PvE is easy, and it gets even easier more geared you become. No challenge whatsoever. 
---
You can make it challenging yourself. During WoTLK there was a guild doing an *Undergeared Project*. They would do raids, including ICC and RS, in just blue gear. They all played a character/role they never played before and they didn't use voice chat either.
---
Since blue gear is more than you need for the current endgame content, that would have to be changed or limited to for example lvl 50 gear max. But the other rules (google "undergeared project") can be applied.
---
Honestly everything up to a 2.5 that includes BGs but not BWL should be rushed.
---
Thanks a lot pal, I'm hoping to get some good clips during the p2 honour farming sessions üëÄ. Although my realm is 60-70% horde so I'm probably gonna be the one who's farmed üò¢
---
My channel is here if you're interested
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOgiBvNYxv22xdr2q7eJaEQ
---
you mean from experience? yeah I don't feel like it procs often enough either. 
---
I don't know what my base crit chance is but let's say it's 10%.
---
I notice I crit a lot more when the target is frozen but it doesn't feel like I crit 60% of the time, but it crits often enough that it doesn't feel like it crits 15% of the time either.
---
imo looking around for quest objectives with no other indication other than "head northeast" isn't fun. 
---
And then some of the directions in the text just make no fucking sense at all.
---
PvP is quite literally the only reason to play Vanilla, If you won't accept that then I dont know what to tell you
---
I actually got a 3 day ban iirc fro doing the ‚Äúwhoa, did you know if you put your phone number in trade chat Blizzard automatically blocks it out, ***-***-****!‚Äù
---
Dont fret, mine only slept through for a few weeks, then back to only a few hours at a time!
---
for the buff.  I have no idea why you were able to understand it, but I know MC buffing was a thing on private servers, and I have no reason to think that changes in classic.
---
You can do both. I use questie to make sure I don't miss quests and don't waste too much time wandering in circles, but I also read all the quest text quickly. Many people simply aren't interested in quests the way you are, their favourite part of the game might be the dungeons or PVP.
---
Can Garr purge Flask of Supreme Power? I was thinking about popping one of those badboys for tonights mc raid
---
This may be a bit extreme but ELVUi has a pretty nice aura tracker that shows over target frame. But you would also be completely reskinning your entire UI with that add-on. I love it personally, but it's a drastic change and that may not be for everyone
---
Adblocker is disabled for no man
---
Well, the server will still fit as much as a full layer, so amount of people won‚Äôt rly change, just the queue will be insane.
---
I looked it up and you are right...What the fuck is wrong with people?! Although it seems the majority is not happy either way because apparently what got implemented is way overtuned which I agree with... Even vendors feel very laggy, I just hate this "mechanic". I was so looking forward to actions registered instantly since the technology is finally there and they add a dumb limit like this.
---
Thank you for the detailed explination!
---
This is exactly what I was looking for.
---
I'll definitely make use of this knowledge.
---
Lol
---
Brilliant, and well done.
---
Rags was my 1st Wow moment when I jumped off my chair when I finally downed him in vanilla! üòÇ
---
Well i know the more money the company makes, the more they get fam
---
It might be a shock to you, but you won't really need MC raid bis to enter BWL and you don't need pre-raid bis to enter MC either. Hell, it was cleared by people in quest greens now. So your "natural raid progression" argument is invalid right from the beginning. Feel free not to like anything but using falsified arguments to support your claim as "right" is... well, whatever, feel free to do it also. Cheers.
---
Well, it's either use an addon or go to WoWhead to see the map.
---
...which is exactly what we did in the past. Only instead of WoWHead, it was Thottbot.
---
Personally, I love these addons, because they can direct me to spots that aren't well-known (thus not camped by fellow questers).
---
I played through on my warrior without quest help but for my alts im going for speed.
---
I have played for 15 years now and haven‚Äôt had to open tickets for anything since WOTLK. But legit haven‚Äôt even able to open a direct GM ticket ever.
---
‚ÄúUnacceptable amounts of lag while 400 people fight each other‚Äù. Is this intentionally a joke lol?
---
&gt;Taking some time to enjoy leveling before the end game doesn't make a player bad, this isn't a private server.
---
It makes you bad, because you have one set of stated goals and then fail to even remotely act upon them. With your played on the main, you should be 60 if you cared about getting to the end game and being a part of progression. If you don't care about that, don't complain about others getting to do it.
---
You're literally saying "I want to play slowly, so Blizz should put a freeze on updating the game until I can catch up to those who don't want to play slowly."
---
That's ridiculous.
---
Definatley not true! People are logging in on only one server all over the world, there are way more people logged on to one pserver than 1 blizz server.
---
Congrats OP. SFK is one of my favourite dungeons and Shadowfang one of my favourite looking swords. Hope the dungeon didn‚Äôt get boring for you after all those runs!
---
I have never received a crystal.
---
No. It isn't.
---
Nope
---
ye now, Classic is not even anything like vanilla. we are already playing in the "catch up- pre tbc patched game".
---
still does not change the fact that vanilla has a progression system, you need to gear in prev raids. 
---
In retail you dont.. that is the diffrence.
---
It‚Äôs not rewarding. I pushed to 1400-1500 up early every season but won‚Äôt go back to retail anytime soon. Leveling in Classic is 100x more rewarding than grinding io for gear in retail. Of course this entire post and comments are subjective to opinion. Mine being, classic leveling is more rewarding than retail leveling. That leads to lack of fulfillment and the end game content in retail is pointless to me because the rest of the game blows. OP makes perfect sense to those of us who feel this way.
---
Yeah its just as bad in retial if not worse because of how much more complicated the classes are
---
This is so epic.  Our server isn‚Äôt even close to this at peak times
---
Your next few posts are you explaining whats happening tho. So it does bear repeating. Is that the only example you have? If you can watch this video and the OP video and think they're on the same level then I dunno what to tell you.
---
Im fairly cetain this isnt the case.
---
its 2 ranks max and I think 3 ranks from the first 4 ranks.
---
So 1 week is possible but you will need to kill more than anyone else to get there
---
It's not impossible to level a twink just because the honor system is released..maybe you shouldn't try warlock porting in brd for a while but people over dramatize the reality of pvp. Worst case you can just corpse walk into a dungeon and level there.
---
I use the Immersion addon, and read some of the quests when they seem to be fun. But reading on why I need to gather 10 Wolf Flank is not what I want to spend my time on.
---
There are some "Treasure map"-quest where I've been turning Questie off, just so I can try to do it 100% on my own.
---
If your prebis with some plate instead of the leather, tbh, you don't even have to put on a shield
---
Next time please add a tldr. 
---
We use them because we don‚Äôt like questing just want to get to 60.
---
First off CONGRATULATIONS on being a new Dad!! This post is my future self right now as my first kid is due Feb. 3rd. I'm lvl 58 on my main and as soon as he's born I know I won't be able to play much anymore but that's fine as I plan on lvling an Alt who's purpose to is actually read all the quest text! I want to talk to NPCs and really get the story of the world from the ground perspective, not just the books that Blizz puts out
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone was expecting the first classic raids to be awfully exciting. Different story for the later ones though.
---
I mean, giving tank first orb is fair imo but yeah, in your case it doesn't make sense since u can do both parts.
---
Lol dude that video was super laggy haha. Outside thralls room when you charged that guy, the damage didn't register for like 3 seconds
---
Check this out: https://youtu.be/fYFD06UFscw
---
False.  Can gain more than 1 rank per week at lower honor ranks.
---
&gt; Who said anything about giving up or not experiencing life?
---
You somewhat implied that when the overall debate became about spending all your time playing wow instead doing something productive for your real life.
---
And you said that wouldnt have happended anyway because you would just waste in on another game or watching tv.
---
&gt; I just think people are not honest with themselves when they think that they would have used all of this free time to go and do whatever if they didn't play this game (or other games).
---
They properly wouldnt, nor should they. But wow can be very addictive, and playing video games in an excessive manner isnt a good thing. And people who do could absolutely gain a lot of positives in their life by spending less time in front of the screen.
---
&gt; Classic wow came out August 26. Before August 26, were you learning a language, or learning an instrument or whatever other bullshit thing people come up with?
---
Classic came out a little over 2 months ago, but wow came out in 2005 and this is also a universal thing for video games and other hobbies alike.
---
&gt; No you weren't, you were spending the time you now spend on this game doing other similar activities - watching TV or movies, or playing another game.
---
Now, im not the target audience here, because i manage to maintain my life okay. And i play video game is periods of my life, sometimes a lot, sometimes not at all, right now im playing alot. And yeah... my life have honestly suffered a bit as a consequence. Im working out on average 1 day less a week, i have said no to some social things because of raids or wanting to game, my dating have suffered a bit and the girl im seeing has seen less of me. 
---
Some of these things have annoyed me, and i will have to figure out a solution if im going to play this game for the next year.
---
If i didnt game right now, i wouldnt game something else, i would do more homework, i would have more sex, i would work out more, i would see my friends more.
---
These are not problems, not yet, and im sure they wont become problems. But your point is wrong, i wouldnt just do the same thing in another fashion, and its an actual problem for some people who have let video games control too much of their life for too many years.
---
ah,thanks, that still sounds like a pain for people who work xd
---
Like Slandebande said, from where is this point coming?
---
you ddos the server and wonder why it crashs
---
Same reason why they use cars when they can walk.
---
Shh. Don‚Äôt interrupt the circle jerk of people who have no clue what they‚Äôre taking about.
---
First three-four weeks after launch I guess. You aren't geared so much and can wipe if fucked up with cc or dispels.
---
thanks!
---
are there any useful enchants for healers for the hand slot item?
---
Why at this point when the Classic population is only going to head downwards would they spend more money...they should have before it started up at all :(
---
wanted to post exactly this! Ty but no ty
---
they don't care or just noobs
---
what is sad about me still enjoying the same game I enjoyed as a kid? I think it's sad you get angry at strangers because they're happy
---
There was 15-20k people on Nost when world bosses were released.
---
I mean, most private servers cap at around 2.5k-5k people at most. A lot more going on in the WoW Classic servers.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
Pop distribution.
---
Looks like he snapchatted his monitor.  You‚Äôre giving him too much credit.
---
&gt;I want to mainly PvP and i enjoy a challenge, but it's going to be demoralizing when the best way to gear for PvP is through PvE.
---
But that's how it was in vanilla...
---
Who hurt you?
---
I want this
---
Yea, itll be a fuckfest. Just pve for your gear, heh.
---
Looks like you'll be the cat soon enough.
---
Holy hell this is insane seeing it put into numbers like that.
---
OR download Titan Panel and let the addon do the math for you!
---
Thanks so so so much for the in depth response and link to the guide at the bottom, this is more than I could have hoped for. Ill post my gear and stats and stuff when I get home for you
---
Do you mind sharing what gear you and your priest use, was wondering if I as a warrior with my priest could do it even if we're not fully BiS geared.
---
ITT: people who have no idea what taunt actually is
---
I'd say some sort of tank, if you have a dedicated healer. You guys would set the pace tanking that way. 
---
If you don't plan to Raid, Paladin can tank dungeons just fine I'm lead to believe. Spec into holy for Consecration at 20, jobs a good'un!
---
Things that never happened for 300.
---
I was with you until you went full crazy talking about how much harder it is for Blizzard to throw hardware at this problem than a little underfunded private server operation.  Just... no.  Hardware wise, Blizzard can throw a lot more at this problem than a private server operator.  Software wise, Classic *could* operate the way a private server works.  It may require work to get there, but it's a choice to do so or not involving trade offs.  
---
The argument that Blizzard can't do this falls apart if private servers did it.  Assuming that's true, this is obviously possible.  What it will take to get there, what they would lose if they did and weather Blizzard will make that move are unknowns.   They *can* do it.  The question is, will they.
---
That or buff MC and Only to make them somewhat of a challenge.
---
Thats the thing.  The servers have like 5x the amount of people.  We're seeing world PVP that we never saw in vanilla because of that.  It's totally different when there are like 300 people trying to PVP instead of 50-100.
---
&gt;people
---
Not everyone thinks the same. That's the basis of your argument, that "people" are a hivemind entity where everyone agrees. I'm baffled at how common this kind of strawman argument is (not just in WoW).
---
&gt;Spell batching has been here intentionally and people complain.
---
I didn't want this.
---
&gt;People ask for server increase 
---
I didn't ask this.
---
See? You can't even argue it's the "majority" unless you have surveyed it.
---
it's annoying that even if you go into settings and block this you still get a notification that it was blocked in chat.
---
And how many of those parses involve killing a boss in ~1 minute or less? There is a difference in being able to blow all your cd's and peak DPS in short fights compared to sustained DPS over several minutes.
---
You should see how fucking many Blizzard stans are out in force on this sub defending and deflecting as if they're getting paid
---
mind sharing the app link? thanks!
---
I have over twice your shadow spellpower and mostly run dungeons with guild tanks. I only really pull aggro if I get crits. (at which point it won't really matter since the mobs is going to die before it reaches me). 
---
So while you should definitely watch your threat and try to focus target instead of multi dotting (even if that is higher dps in dungeons), I do think the tank has some blame in this for generating very little threat.
---
r/Whooosh
---
Black Lotus is far more reliant and less time consuming if you know how.
---
This is it for me, I've done 1-60, 1-70 etc more than a couple times with no addon. I've been through it all before. There's no fun in leveling. Hell I don't even have an alt past level 15 yet.  I find leveling tedious, and boring. The addon's allow me to just grind without focusing.
---
I didn't find anything when I went there. I found most near the Giants/saber rock.. but those damn cats are toxic. They daze you 90% of the time.
---
This is a big deal, a huge deal in fact... But, please don't sit here and try to make people believe that just because P2 is releasing that GIANT WORLD PVP BATTLES 100v100 will be a normal thing. These things don't just pop off... It'll still be the random encounter here and there except now someone gets honor for winning... Jesus Christ people.
---
Nostalrius actually had more people playing on that 1 server than current classic servers. Was about 13k players online when I was active.
---
\+55 healing, pretty much. It is rather expensive.
---
Immediately turned it off once the music started. Jesus
---
Worked here
---
I'm jealous. That cat spoils you!
---
You're not going to pve with mace spec though.
---
Not everyone was born in a golden nest like you. I have a small income that is enough to pay for my shit at Uni, and the small extra that is left is what i have for my hang outs and other stuff. As stated before I'll be studying abroad soon so every extra that i have I must save it. I really hate people like you, that think that they know it all and judge people by the book. People like you I proudly lift my middle finger because you only bring bad to others, and that's what you're good off. Obviously I can pay for my fucking sub, but then later on I know i'll need this money when i'll be abroad. So like i said, priorities, probably that's something you've never heard off since you're so rich and you have everything.
---
No layers here
---
I'm in the same position as you. It is absolutely worth it, just logging in and running quests for an hour or two is tremendous fun.  
---
If you want to get serious later however, you might run into some problems. Finding a group for a dungeon and running it can often take more than 2 hours if you are doing it purely with randoms. For this I've tried to shift around time a bit, so that I don't play for a couple of days, and free up time to put in \~4 hours at a time later that week, to get some dungeons done. If that's possible, you won't have any issues.
---
EvE ships are also static 3D models That have a particle effect or two coming from them. You're not having to animate 500 individual characters running around. Also there's no terrain beyond  a few items the the players may have built, so you're mostly dealing with a bunch of XYZ coordinates for the ships instead of worrying about LoS or collisions.
---
Yes, terrible. Literally unplayable and not enjoyable at **all** times. /s Nothing will happen faster just because somebody cried about it on reddit. Happens *sometimes*, but this issue is not as simple as for example spell batching or choosing the best version of alterac valley.
---
Was just gonna say hop in the discord it's talked about a lot.
---
Made me lol
---
Oh my god. Fucking stop with this constant "if you want to make it harder, take off your gear, take less people, play with only your tongue" bullshit. Nothing is stopping me from just quitting the game either. Classic has ended up being the exact same as retail. It's fun for a month or two then it's absolutely boring once all the content you can clear is done. MC/Ony is done in 3 hours and is also completely not interesting in the slightest. There was such potential to make this WoW 2, and we threw it away. All under the name of #nochanges and other brainless things. 
---
I don't have the time or patience to play in a top guild. So any guild I could play with or any pug I can get into will run into a wall trying content with less than 40 people. A lot of guilds will just simply need the full group to clear content. The fact that 40 man even exists is absolutely terrible. They should have retuned the game for PvE with no debuff limit and no HoT limit and 25 man content. As it is now I don't even want to raid log it is that boring. I will come back for BWL, but I am stating my opinion that the grind that is Classic WoW has officially worn out its welcome, and I am pretty done with it. I don't care that I can artificially make it harder. That is a fucking dumb argument and anyone who makes it is an absolute moron.
---
What about the finger posture, seems a little cramped from a layman's view.

There is no fixed limit. You can get 13000RP per week. Rank 1 is 15 kills only. R2 is 2000RP R3 is 5000RP, then its always 5000 steps until R14 with 60000RP. You lose 20% of your current RP per week. So the max you can get is from R0 to R4 in one week.
---
People were waiting in queues with more people than that to log in.
---
That was excellent üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
There's something called respect, if someone disrespects me or throw bullshit at me i don't see why would I keep my respect towards them.
---
haha I didn't hear the end of it from them for the rest of the dungeon afterwards.
---
It's a super fun class, I just have to try and be more aware of where the pet is lmaoüòÖ
---
&gt;obviously aware
---
I haven't seen anything implying they are.
---
Is there a way to check what quests I've already completed?
---
I'm told I need a quest to save the princess in BRD before I can actually kill her... but I'm not sure what part of the quest chain, if any, I've already done.
---
That Wowhead data is not reliable. It included any character created (any level as well) and ignored activity. It was even faulty, not matching the census done on a daily basis on some of the servers Discord.
---
So you don't want to "burn" your money into games, but you are asking others to do it for you without any guarantee of paying back(in mats) cuz you didn't even start to play yet. You are even more ridiculous than I thought when I read the OP :D   
---
You are not the only one who wants to play WoW while studying, get a temp job for a few hours a week like everybody does if parents won't pay for it..  
---
If your priority is begging strangers on the internet, then I pity you.
---
Read the rules.
---
They have the ressource to fix it clearly. 
---
It has been stated multiple time here, the context between private and classic server is so much different that comparing them on the technical end doesn't make much sense.
---
Doesn't change the fact that blizzard are cheap as fuck
---
Lots of armchair engineers in here
---
Yeah that isn't true. You would get automatically banned doing that just like here.
---
Private servers had no player cap. Maybe before speaking you should do some research. Look at most shutdown.  20k people on and thousands outside of major city's and still responding better then blizzard servers will 100 people in the same area.
---
He has fairly low spellpower. If he's focus targeting and gaining aggro without critting the tank is doing a fairly poor job of generating threat. 
---
But as you said it's hard to say anything concrete without being there.
---
He‚Äôs still playing wow
---
You seem to be the only one to dislike such a beautiful thing.
---
3-4 weeks top 6 % of all people pvping on your server, JUST from rank 9 to 10. you had to be top of the pile to get to rank 9 before that.
---
and since you are measured by the top performers (you gain ranking relevant to the floor and ceiling of your bracket) fun times ahead. anyone expecting to get blue set as soon as its available gonna have a rude awakening.
---
im currently on sapper and FAP crafting-duty for my circle of pvpers. yesterday i crafted around 300 sappers and 200 FreeActionPotions for &gt;one guy&lt;. and thats neither his first, nor his last delivery. thats about 900g in Sappers and 400g in FAPs. you are competing with people that spend over 10.000g in pvp consumables, every ony/MC pvp-bis and every available support. our warrior got 3 pocket healers (Shami for WF, Priest for dispell/heal, druid for HoT/Decurse &amp; Controll CC).
---
im confident that he (lionheart, bonereavers, onslaught gridle, quick strike ring etc.) alone could wreck most people 3on1. hes unstopable now. now add perma available FAP + full buffed (flasked up healers/himself) and compare how much you get done.
---
+ they are doing it for 18 hours every day for about 4 months.
---
thats your competition. your reward is the difference between you and them.
---
You‚Äôre the man! Thanks so much
---
I've been having this issue as well. This did not fix it.
---
I'd pay for a skilled, geared tank. I would not pay for a healer though
---
I‚Äôve heard people talking about this for Onyxia, but I don‚Äôt understand why everyone is calling it a GUID. In this case it‚Äôs just an incrementing ID. GUID isn‚Äôt just an ID
---
How do I find a discord? Sorry for being such a noob lol
---
I mean, they are all the same quests basically go kill this, go grab that, go talk to x. Really they‚Äôre pretty boring
---
If only there was a thing you can do hourly to make money...I forgot what it‚Äôs called though.
---
Sounds good, thanks for the tip! :) will try this tonight.
---
It's intentionally slowed down on the server side so the server running the node the battle is happening on doesn't crash, but that's also mainly used for fights 5-12x the scale that's happening here.
---
Eh in the end game dungeons if you are running the fury BiS you will get blown the fuck up. I have seen it all the time.
---
He's just running around like "This is my home! What the fuck are all of you doing here!?"
---
"Stop stepping on my grass!"
---
I was coming to make exactly this comment. It appears they went for the fully authentic experience.
---
So what I'm hearing is level a pally tank then at 60 respec to heals. G2G
---
It doesn't feel like it's lagging, it just feels slowed down. Nobody cares about the exact ms turnaround time of a server, they care how the game feels to play.
---
Theres 1 spawn per zone per hour and they are highly contested.. rich thorium nodes can spawn inside DM and be farmed over and over with no competition 
---
Also I've never seen someone get 3 black lotus from one node..
---
My dude, which part of I have a small income that you didn't get? I'm working to have my own money you shithead. And I PAY FOR MY EXPENSES. And obviously if I had a fulltime job i would do shit at Uni, and this job that I have isn't enough for much of the things I want. So that's why.... PRIORITIES. And only if you knew how was my life, your opinion is worth 0 to me, people like you won't make much difference in the world.
---
christ windows shill are strong in this one
---
For every streamer dinging to 60 in 15minutes 42 seconds there are about 100 normies in the same situation. Most my play time is during the weekend. During the week I do non dungeon stuff. Questions grinding etc
---
Weekend I do dungeons because of the time it takes to find groups etc. I managed to get to 60 the other day with 11 days played. I did have a few sick days from work which helped boost  otherwise I would still be mid 50s. Mage life aoe helps loads as well.
---
But I would say take your time. Alot less stuff to do with limited time once you hit 60. My week is now farm zf while I try and find a group for a quick dungeon run. Weekend is where I try most my BiS grind
---
Maybe if I was a girl that would work ahahahah
---
Really? what about planetside 1 and 2?
---
also other challenges like Ironman
---
Apparently not, but I do know the are releasing the new r14 caster items which came out later than the original ones because the OG caster weapons were complete fucking ass.
---
hurr durr DAE Warrior hard to level
---
On world bosses, very easy I'd say.
---
The other way around would be to have a massive amount of reroll filling the low ranks
---
Same here, was extreeeemely easy and quite disappointing. Luckily the Silithus demon restored my faith and kicked my ass.
---
This quest is one of the big reasons why my first alt I leveled to 60 was a Hunter, I really enjoyed the challenge of beating the demons and have a newfound respect to Hunters with the bow.
---
I don't understand why anyone would actively seek out to cheapen the challenge on the easiest boss even if it was for the sake of authenticity.
---
I never said bandwidth is the issue, speedreader.

1 private server &gt; a whole network of classic/retail servers on the cloud

I‚Äôd definitely argue against this. I‚Äôll have 2 hours to play and ‚Äúooh perfect for a dungeon‚Äù. 
---
I have been trying to find groups for scholo and ud start for days
---
I can‚Äôt play during the absolute peak time and no one wants a Rogue in their group. The shortage of tanks is ridiculous. 
---
It takes me an hour to find a tank if I start a group.

I need a new guild maybe.

CoD processes actions on your own system, be it your console or your PC, and that is literally a fact. It processes your actions and sends it to the p2p host.
---
Classic verifies every action multiple times is also a fact.
---
Incidentally, you being a dumbass is a fact aswell.
---
The most vocal people are normally the minority though.
---
Melee them to death?
---
Yea I think everyone agrees that healers asking for money is laughable.
---
haha well I've already spent on the coins it gave me to give silver to someone else in the sub so something useful came of this scribbled joke that no one but us will probably see :P

Come on guildies, it's MC time!

I‚Äôm hemo CB now and god do I miss improved sprint

Why that‚Äôs in the raiding tree who knows

I guess I'm going hemo I guess it's kinda a mix of both because next I'm going coldblood
---
It is easily achievable in 1 weeks time, just start murdering a whole lot of people.
---
Eyy, new dad here as well. Little man is 2 months old. I plan on getting all of my dungeon set for each class since raiding is out of the question for me! I enjoy the leveling experience more anyways.
---
‚ÄúO‚ÄôRly?‚Äù ‚Äî- private servers that have existed for over a decade
---
You nailed it. Support DPS. That is my preferred role and didnt know it. The utility from shields and other spells is so satisfying.
---
I can see how useful hex would be in that scenario. Since the damage reduction sucks, would you just spam Hex rank 1 on everyone since the heal reduction is consistent throughout the ranks?
---
Its not close at all. In fact the rumor is next november, so its even longer away than Legion to BFA.
---
Eve doesn‚Äôt slow tick rate down until more than 500 or so people show up to the same battle. Eve‚Äôs ‚Äúgcd‚Äù is also less than WoW‚Äôs. 
---
100v100 is handled fine.
---
That would be exactly my point about post-cataclysm quests and while the stories are definitely better, they took away most of the exploration.
---
As I was saying: Using quest helpers in Classic means that you settle for the worse stories but then also cut down on the exploration that came with them.
---
Is there a book for prayer of spirt or do you just learn it from your trainer? 
---
55 hpriest hoping to just buff the whole party
---
You spend 100g on consumables a week? Even if you were, that's like 2 hours of farming, maybe even less? You'd still play less than 6 hours a week, which is really not that much.
---
I know this is an old post but I've been looking for a similar addon, and I found this newish one. I hope it will be useful to you. https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/extratooltip
---
"better"
---
Congratulations!  That is def a really good feeling!  Enjoy it brother!
---
What? I don't give a shit about COD
---
you said private servers acts like COD and classic is somehow different. That's false.
---
Logged into retail before the stress test and it was unrecognizable. No skill trees, no Paladin auras, or basic spells that are part of the class
---
oh on the high pop servers it'll 100% be a lot worse
---
Didn‚Äôt we have stress tests for this exact issue?
---
No, it isn't. It's a lack of funding or concern for either the development team or the servers themselves. This is 2019, and we're paying $15 a month. It should, ***at the least,*** work just as well as a free server ran by volunteers on donations alone. At first, the argument wasn't it simply wasn't possible. Well, the Light's Hope team proved that was wrong. No need to ask me how, Blizzard already flew them out to their headquarters I assume because they wanted to learn.
---
So the question is, why aren't they doing it?
---
Also, I just wanted to clarify something. So your argument is basically that ***Vanilla WoW shouldn't have large scale PVP at all,*** or large amounts of players standing near each other, am I understanding that correctly?
---
Probably someone new to tanking.
---
Just log everything and process your checks afterwards. Ban the cheaters.
---
I think rank 10 is the best you can get with moderate engagement (i.e. 15-20 hours pvp per week)
---
Rank 8 is probably doable with as little as 5-6 hours of pvp per week.
---
It really remains to be seen, the server dynamics will be much different than on any server due to the vastly increased number of players. But I can see getting good placements be fairly easy early on when there are many low level characters who will also be eligible for rank points.

Please stop with the ‚Äò2018 record profit‚Äô nonsense. 2019 through Q2 was a nightmare for the company, and they knew it was going to be a nightmare in 2018. Doesn‚Äôt matter how well the company is doing today if it‚Äôs going to fail tomorrow. As of today, stock is down 13% from this tim last year. It‚Äôs not all rosy at Activision/Blizzard.
---
And yet my game was buttery smooth compared to battles I‚Äôve had on classic with 1/10th the amount of people. We will see when world bosses are released here, but I believe it will be unplayable.
---
Sounds like one of those two is not true.
---
wowclassicbis.com is absolute garbage. Please don't use it.

Well yeah, nothing I can do about it, looking forward to the shitshow that will be p2 honor system xD.

Reading the quest text provides you with info you need to complete the quest i dont care about the story. I'm sure your reading all the quest text even with question s/
---
This is the stance Albion Online took with their players. "We know the servers are shit, and can't support large battles even tho its the main advertised feature. However we are confident enough ppl will stop playing and the server will eventually work better with a much decreased load".
---
Where is that game now? Oh yea, went f2p and still continued to lose players.
---
Wow that is so sad
---
Honestly? There aren't as many catch up mechanics. In retail they always want the new content to be accessible (which isn't a bad idea!) but that destroys progression. 
---
What i've always wanted was incentives for more geared players to return to molten core and raid with players who aren't geared. Gearsync the more powerful players down to keep it challenging and reward them with something useful. 
---
Some kind of system that keeps "old" content viable so that way they could keep the progression system without the "dry out" factor (where you want to go to molten core but can't because everyone's done it already).

I highly doubt they have the time to do a full server upgrade before Phase 2 at this point.
---
An add-on like questie can. Not sure what others ones do. If add-on isn't an option for you then I'd recommend going to wowhead looking the chain up and following each step / speaking to the quest givers until you find who you need to speak with
---
WTF - is this a vanilla #nochanges thing, or is it a classic bug?
---
What was the loot?!!
---
The base game is easy enough to let everyone get a taste. If you're looking for difficulty then higher mythic+ dungeons are way harder than classic ones.
---
This shit again
---
Are you saying that we should introduce time dilation to WoW? 15 second GCD sounds about right :D
---
Horde are the "good guys" and Blizzard likes to coddle them.
---
It's of course very rough estimation and will depend on your server and how competitive people are. 
---
From my experience: 
---
* playing 10 hours/week will slowly (2-3 months) get to to rank 7 maybe 8 if the server isn't very competitive and then you will hit a plateau. That what I would call the casual limit
---
* playing 20 hours/week will quickly lead you to rank 7-8 and from there it will be 5-6 weeks grind where you will have to create/join a pvp guild and not take a break to reach rank 10.
---
* playing 30hours/week will put you in the 2% which may take you to rank 12
---
* playing 40+ hours will be where people aiming for rank 13-14 will be
---
(again it's just rough estimation)
---
depended on server, i hit 14 playing significantly less than that because of a small server and a group of people who kept honor caps low
---
/run if n~= 1 then CastSpellByName("Find Herbs") n=1 else CastSpellByName("Find Minerals") n=0 ;end

s0sm00th
---
The priv server released its code to the public, just make your own priv server and accounts for your guildies, might as well test boss fights dual whielding hand of rags also.
---
I actually have Questie already but I'm not sure where I'd look to find that info
---
I know you're using sarcasm, but I'm pretty sure there's not more than one rank 14 at a time any given week. So over the course of the year you would only have 52 per server, per faction. Am I wrong? I don't ever remember there being two grandmarshals at once, and once you're in the top 10, the line was pretty orderly of who was getting GM next and everyone made sure their honor slotted in accordingly. Of course there were outliers that messed it up, but they quickly got grounded out.
---
\-Not a Grand Marshal, but dated 1, so yes I didn't see him unless it was in game for about 3 months. lol.
---
Was on my lock alt farming Hillsbrad sentinals, tigerstrike mantle drops, 2 Kills later Sentry Cloak
---
we are not talking about difficulty, never did. 
---
if you join a guild in vanilla that did AQ40. they gear boosted you in mc,bwl,zg. That is gear progression in raids.
---
The same thing was in tbc, you join a hyjal guild. They got you gear form prev tiers.
---
Two books, one for lvl 48 the other for lvl 60.
---
Version 0.2 is on its way up to CurseForge and the twitch app.
---
Added Bash, Combat Resurrection and Tranquilizing shot.
---
Added the functionality to whisper your target when using a buff on them. Will not whisper yourself, and only works for people in your party/raid.
---
This functionality can be turned on and off for individually spells and is disabled for auras only usable on your self.
---
If the Rdruid in question is bad (from exp) yes.  
---
If not, I will always give them a chance to try.
---
It really won‚Äôt be as bad as people think.
---
I'm not saying that it's difficult on a mechanistic level; but if it's super easy and with training wheels I suppose every guild should have been 10/10 after the first weeks in Vanilla too. 
---
Of course it is going to be easy if you've raided for over a decade, gone through a multitude of different mechanisms and strategies on probably 100-200 bosses and have a clear picture of how each fight in MC+Ony works and how to maneuver through it (either through memory, reading or watching videos), especially as we've been granted 1.12+ talent trees and are going through the entry-level raids of Classic. I'm sure you were pretty clueless and lost too in your first-ever raids; I definitely was, back in Kharazan where I first did some raiding - laptop too potato to handle 40 man back in vanilla, ugh.
---
But to those who've just done dungeons and are still learning their class, gearing up and probably don't get all the raid instructions (because they've got no context of how the fight works), it is going to be difficult. In dungeons you get away with a sheep or banish breaking for 5 seconds or some other odd number, in MC you lost 1-3 raid members.
---
Our tank has like 350 FR so he resists 99% of the knockups, no need for him to ever leave melee. also, we use tiny threat and it always shows him ahead.
---
Holy. Dungeon grind and collect your prebis
---
I have the exact opposite experience.  Speaking from an endgame perspective. If I only have an hour or less, retail fills that time perfectly. You can‚Äôt do anything in classic without multiple hours of free time.
---
Can confirm, ive always been a pvper and never raided properly but i raid lead mc and ony now and its easily done within a night. Takes about 3 hours total and is pretty chill.
---
&gt; Yes your character has a GUID 
---
Kinda says it all, the incrementing part of the GUID you're talking about doesn't and can't exist on its own, it's part of the player GUID so that's what people are calling it.
---
I am completely and fully kitted out and I don't need any gear from any dungeon anymore. 
---
It's a mutual exchange. They are going for a shot at the gear they need and I am going to get some farm. Tanks are in low supply. Both parties win. What exactly is the issue?
---
oof    :/ only cristals i get is either blue red or green but no arcanit pepehands
---
Retail isn't easier.
---
&gt;You just read what people are not saying
---
No need to project.
---
- 4x16 slot bags (or larger if available on your server)
---
- All bank slots (with 14 slot bags in all slots, of course)
---
- All appropriate enchants for your character

- Speed level professions on an alt for even more gold

What is a weapon, if not a hand slot item?

You are preaching to the choir here. Post this in /r/wow

Wrong. Fastest is what /u/bignastycm1337 said

No useful glove enchants for healers, which bums me out as both an enchanter and healer.

Not sure why ppl have to stop saying facts...

It is an absolute fact that 2018 was the most profitable year ever by Acti/Blizz. You may not like it. It might not support your narrative, but its a fact. We each person takes away from this fact might be different, but facts are facts.
---
5g?  Damn son, either your server is super cheap or you are slackin on consumes! Standard MC consumes for me is:
---
2 x Mongoose = 4g
---
1/2 x Greater Fire Prot Pots = 5-10g
---
5 x Major Mana Pots = 10g
---
Total = 19-24g
---
It goes deeper than this my friend.
---
I happen to know from years of playing that if you tame any Cat as a hunter they will refuse to eat anything but meat or fish.

But strap a saddle to one of that exact same species of cat and suddenly it'll be chasing an orange root vegetable on the end of a stick.

What‚Äôs with the game boy stickers? So many!

Mixed with server side, and it worked, because they actually tried. And like you said.
---
&gt;Doesnt matter what type of game it is.
---
I know what snuff is now, but when I was I kid I thought it was cocaine, as it was a powder pile. Forgive me for not being 100% on my real drugs in a game where I flew into a city full of griffons with a Sea Giant in the bay on the back of a griffon.
---
This deserves to be in the best Scientific Journal that Azeroth has to offer!
---
Original classic servers handled this fine. The legion engine is more taxing than vanilla's engine, maybe.
---
&gt; People who bought Stranglekelp/Oily made bank.
---
... for what? I legitimate cannot find a usage for Oily Blackmouths.
---
How long does it take to get a white wolf mount reward from Alterac Valley? Do I need to win a lot to get it? On my server my faction is a minority, so I expect to loose all the time...
---
I guess its more of a timing thing than rotation.
---
What produces more dps while managing threat during Phase 1 of Ony, should i do 4 or 5pt slice and dice to fit an an extra 5pt eviscerate? At what time should I blade flurry as to not waste white damage when she starts to fly, am I able to use X cooldown in X phase and have it come back again for later phases. Small detail stuff like that.
---
Yep, use swing timer but need to practice using it better. Not using max consumables, and not tracking procs, but will moving forward.
---
1900 was my kc on blue sinew.  200 grouped, 1700 solo.  Don't give up!
---
Sounds very petulant. Blizzard told us the servers aren't equipped to deal with the massive increase in players. They told us that they would have to use layers. They told us that the servers wouldnt be able to handle it.
---
We all ignored this cause the game wasn't out yet and we woudn't care about this stuff anyway once we were all playing the game
---
Yet now it happens everyone conveniently forgets Blizzard warns us about this the entire time.
---
It's classic WoW.  They didn't completely revamp the entire underlying framework of the game.  They just shimmed in layering to handle the user load.  The graphic handshaking and other elements are still pretty much the original classic code.
---
Knowing all that, if your position is that Blizzard should just "fix" all that.... that's quite the feat.  Would you pay another $60 for the game?  Do they think classic has enough of a lifespan to invest that kind of money/time/effort instead of other ventures?
---
You sound like you don't want to play classic.  This is exactly what classic was. 
---
&gt;Many of us played on servers before with similar populations where this wasnt an issue, certainly not to this degree at least.
---
No, we did not.  If you were around for any of the classic 100v100 raids, you'd know they were a massive festival of dropped framerates and people disconnecting.
---
I mean this is pureley dependet on the server size tho. I play on Gehennas and I dont expect to be able to reach 13/14 without 70h/week prob. more and only if you play premade.
---
Found lib of Constitution. Had it up for 55g. Guy PM's me offering me for 40 telling me they sell for 20all day
---
Just buy it from them then! It sold on ah within the hour.
---
So many blizz shills here who never played on any recent p servers and don't know how much better pvp performance were.
---
It sounds like his problem is DoTing up everything in sight.  Not a problem DPS-wise but it is hell on a tank when the warlock random pulls mobs agro 1 by 1 due to DoT ticks.
---
That is LITERALLY the point that OP is making. But sure. I'm projecting and you're not.
---
Sorry I should have mentionned it: estimation are for BG
---
World PvP in my opinion will be very chaotic and almost impossible to predict: one week you can find a very good spot and finish in the top2% and the next one in the same spots, you'll barely be in the top 5%
---
But yes: if you play 6-8 hours/day, you won't have much problem to reach rank 10 especially if you play with a group of similar player even though it will probably still take a month or two.
---
Gryphon is a taxi. Not mount.
---
As a troll, you should aim for 5% hit chance as a tank (dps go for 9%). The ring is a good start, other options for hit chance are gridle and bracers from UBRS for another 2%, satyr bow from DM E and tarnished elven ring from tribute chest DM N. 
---
Additionally, there is Lionheart helm for 2% on its own, but at the cost of 900g
---
Did you make the test at day or at night, I heard that gryphons fly faster at day because they are cold at night.
---
Quests mostly just serve to give you a more "focused" grinding.
---
My thoughts exactly...
---
As ele / resto you want both, they're point for point the strongest talents in the resto tree.
---
'No brainer' ele / resto talents in the resto tree:
---
5 / 5 improved healing wave (-0.5s cast time)
---
5 / 5 tidal focus (-5% mana)
---
1 / 1 totemic mastery (+9 yards totem range) IF you don't have 3/8 earthfury (and helm, shoulders, belt/boots are BIS/near BIS healing pieces)
---
2 or 3 / 3 nature's guidance (since you aren't raid dpsing, 5 mans at most, you can decide whether you want to put 2 or 3 points in this. If you're wearing Banthok, you have max hit chance (99%) against level 60 mobs, you lose 1% against level 61s but that is only against a few bosses in Strat UD / Scholo &amp; some mobs in UBRS. But you could also max this and get an additional +10sp dmg from using Barrage Girdle not Banthok and have more +hit for level 61s / 62s.
---
5 / 5 tidal mastery (+5% crit on nature spells)
---
1 / 1 nature's swiftness
---
You have 1-3 points to play with depending on choices or having 3/8 earthfury. You can put them in ancestral healing for additional chances to proc +25% armor on tanks in raids and it's not bad for 5mans. With standard buff totems in raiding, totemic mastery (reduced totem cost) works out to about 7mp/5s - i.e. not a massive change. It's mainly good if you're spamming fire nova / magma / changing totems a lot like for pvp. You can put the points in healing focus for reducing casting interruption on heals, this is a pretty good choice, although you don't have the points to max it out as you ideally would for pvp.
---
On the ele side, 'no brainer' talents are:
---
5 / 5 Convection
---
5 / 5 Concussion
---
1 / 1 elemental focus
---
5 / 5 call of thunder
---
1 / 1 elemental fury
---
2 / 2 storm reach
---
5 / 5 lightning mastery
---
You have 6 points to play with. You can put 5 points in reverberation, although i wouldn't because 30 / 0 / 21 is designed to play around lightning, not shocks. You can put 3 points in call of flame to buff your fire totems, this is nice with putting 2 points in improved fire totems to buff magma and fire nova (and this would be good with points in totemic focus because the fire AOE totems are so expensive). Personally I put 3 points in elemental warding because it helps a bit with all the fire damage based fights in this phase (Geddon, Onyxia, Rag), and 3 points in eye of the storm which is nice for pvp and makes up slightly for the lack of healing focus in 5 mans.
---
Because I am 60, have pretty much the best gear I can get atm, but don't have the time to farm consumables for speed clearing content in under 2 hours when 3 hours is already stupid fast. 
---
I already have an alt, and a second alt. The grind just is not fun for such little content after that grind.
---
Whatever happened to weather effects in retail? 
---
I was farming crusader all day and the weather adds great ambience to that awful tower. Rain, fog, dusk orange glow, torch sconces lighting up at sundown.
---
Never got crusader for the record.
---
What m website should I use ? I am trying to find a decent bis list for Druid heal but all the website have some differences don‚Äôt really know which on e to trust !
---
Yep, full time student just dinged 41. Getting that mount this week felt so good. Like MMO accomplishments in the old days.
---
Yeah, we frequently found ourselves thinking that and how much can be done with the world editor. I can't wait for reforged, especially if they add features to world editor as well!
---
So classic has a lot of bad itemization and weird stats to worry about like hit rating and healing power and resistance gear to name a few. Hit chance is the worst offender IMO. 
---
However from what I can tell, even when Naxx is out there are still BiS items for every class that drop in Molten Core or even in dungeons. I came in during Wrath so I don't know from experience but it seems like Molten Core will almost always be relevant. I imagine it will take quite a while to get every rogue and warrior equipped with thunderfury at least, and the shamans and pallies will all want sulfuras for pvp fun.
---
To a lesser extent, I remember in wrath guilds still ran ulduar every week to get the healing mace for all of their healers. Each raid tier used to have a way of staying relevant. Now in retail it seems once the next raid comes out everything before was useless. This is good for those that like to just keep grinding perpetually but a lot of people prefer to keep the gear they worked hard to get for a longer time frame.
---
SM Ruin is mostly affliction thru the leveling.  No reason to cast SB.
---
And then get a message each time you blocked someone, with the same text as the popup..
---
Then I must be crazy, because he just told us the video you just watched of players having ***30 seconds of delay*** in a PVP setting, in a game released this year, with a $15 a month sub cost, is working as intended.
---
&gt; This is no changes intended behavior. 
---
Unless words somehow changed to mean things other than what they mean, ***that's exactly what he just said***
---
No you didnt.  80 on 80 happened all the time without issue.
---
Consider switching servers if you're that upset with it. Most of the other servers don't have this problem and are still well populated.
---
GUIDs are different than just IDs. You can Identify something in multiple ways. GUIDs do not increment without creating a function to do so, and it would be horrible design to do it. GUID is just the wrong term here
---
Clean your monitor ffs. Lol plus it's easy to turn these off
---
does anyone know if honor still will be updated weekly or in real time?
---
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
what do you mean? Classic is free!
---
You guys are working off the assumption that I would be just tanking a dungeon anyway. At this point I'm farming as much gold as I can to be ready for later phases. I'm either going to farm in the world or farm in your dungeon.
---
Why should I just charitably tank dungeons for people when I can get nothing out of it myself? The pay is to make tanking your dungeon worth my time rather than just farming in the open world.
---
Blade Flurry begs to differ.
---
The reason people are breeIng through MC and ony is this is a 15 year old game that has been data mined and min maxed for those 15 years.
---
What does this do?
---
&gt; Yes, but if layering never was added in in the first place there wouldn't be any world pvp lag of this proportion to begin with, nor would there be overfull realms that will have a hell of a time in terms of questing, getting into dungeons, etc, etc.
---
Yes there would.  Vanilla still had the mega servers.  Blackrock was notorious for telling people to get the fuck off Blackrock.  Not to mention how many people rolled on shit like Faerlina because it was the streamer server.
---
&gt;And aren't people already getting tired of "#nochanges" being thrown around left and right?
---
I played the game for about 12 years and I know what shit they added because people actually wanted it and what they added as weird shit.  I can tell you a huge amount of the #nochanges people were either private server people who just wanted bigger, better support private servers, or people who never played vanilla and had no idea what was going to drop.  There is plenty of shit Blizzard has added that people both wanted and enjoyed.  Shit like dual-spec was probably the single most requested shit during vanilla.  Can't have it because #nochanges.
---
The #nochanges want a version of the game which never really existed and then get mad when something they wanted to happen turns out to have a massive drawback that everyone else saw coming.
---
1. Blizzard aren't responding directly to me
---
2. Blizzard aren't responding to my posts
---
3. Blizzard haven't released a statement saying they've fixed it
---
4. I'm special
---
Here's OP's literal quote:
---
&gt; Yikes. Retail is simple mush. It feels insulting after playing 60 levels of classic. There is no challenge at all in 99% of the available activities.
---
Do with it whatever you want.
---
which rank is the trinket?
---
Honestly it would be hilarious if they said this, but hopefully they fix it
---
OK boomer
---
Personal Preference seems only logical, yes. As I said, I can't get myself to enjoy most open-world games even though the yare immensely popular. But I still want to understand what people like about them.
---
And as I said in the original post: I totally get that some people just wanna go fast. I just don't think the majority of WoW Classic players play the game just to be fast, but maybe I'm wrong with that.
---
Well, you don't have to pay for the expansions, but you have to pay the monthly fee
---
Sorry your arguments are good but the fact that Private Servers have managed to create a 100000 times smoother PvP experience than a multi-billion dollar company blows all if your arguments out of the water.
---
There‚Äôs simply no valid argument against that fact. If the whole client side thing was different, and it made it much easier to handle more people, why in the seven hells doesn‚Äôt Blizzard do it?
---
Ok boomer.
---
I think this issue needs to remain on the front pages of all the forums until blizzard delivers a response. I haven't done large PvP battles but I know from watching videos and streams that the game becomes unplayable. Back in 04-05 we blamed it on the technology. The year is 2020 and we can no longer blame it on the technology. The technology is there, it's just a matter of blizzard is willing to take action. I surely hope so.
---
No absolutely not
---
If it was truly no changes the servers would be hosted on hardware and not on a cloud server, so the comment is completely disingenuous but it gets a rise out of people.
---
Naw
---
Try looking for Swatter, it's meant to catch and hide a lot of debug errors. 
---
You could try uninstalling and reinstalling grid, deleting your wtf folder, etc.
---
I'd try Swatter first as the rest sounds like work
---
Okay
---
Epic lag and an inability to actually do anything on my terms? Yup, glad... I‚Äôll wait for epic AV.
---
What server are you on? I'm on benediction horse and at first I was in a similar boat. Then eventually people started pugging onyxia and mc after a while, no reserve loot or the head is reserved.
---
Alterac Valley will be cross server and no you won't need to win but it would be faster
---
Also true for weapon damage skills (like rend) this is why Slower weapons are better.
---
We're almost certainly going to get cross server battlegrounds, dunno if there was official confirmation tho. And even if it somehow wasn't the case, being a minority doesn't matter, it's a 40v40 anyway. If anything, the other faction would have multiple hour queues while yours would be instant.
---
AV is not a chore to grind out at all, I can't remember the timeframes but really it's one of the easier factions to cap out in vanilla.
---
No, Lag is when there is a dissonance between what is happening and what is being reported.  
---
What eve does is slow down the mechanics themselves, so there is no time lost between actions and reports.  
---
It would be like, if they reduced our movement speed to 1/10th, increased the GCD to 15s the server can report actions as they happen, while its slower for us, no data is lost between something happening and it being reported.
---
This is not baked into the game. It's a separate piece of **invasive** software that acts like an antivirus, scans your **entire computer and RAM including assets that have nothing to do with the game** and disconnects you if there's anything funny going on. It's called [Warden](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Warden_(software)) and although it does the job of cracking the nut, it does it by smashing a piano on top of it.
---
From rank 10 to 14, you are of course required to play in premade. 
---
And yes: you can probably add 50% to each numbers on the biggest and more competitive servers.
---
I bless the rains down in Booty Bay,
---
Gonna take some time to corpse run cause I'm bad ooh ooh
---
Not at this point. Best options are riding skill or one of the gathering enchants.
---
World pvp only until BGs. That 20 to 30 hours is time spent specifically doing pvp, not farming, selling, traveling etc.
---
Tarren mill vs Southside is also unplayable light.  40v40.
---
I think I want this (but do I?)
---
Nope. Anyone who played actual vanilla and private servers can you tell you as much.
---
You being completely fucking clueless about how massive the powershifts are.
---
The only thing it scales with is the balance talent and the T1 3 piece bonus
---
Really Cool setup, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I like multi-boxing. Getting repeatably ganked by 5 Paladins on top of each other is awful and frustrating and frankly imo is cheating. I can understand the appeal of multipboxing but it‚Äôs completely antithetical to the games intent. Still very interesting though!!
---
It's better than shooting Shaz with a gun for two minutes
---
Then I guess either the mount speed enchant for hands or boots affects flight speed, because a few weeks ago some random guy and I both took off at the same time from the same place, GOING to the same place (can't remember where). I started slightly behind the guy, and by the end of the flight, I was a couple yards ahead of him. He and I even had a conversation about it mid-flight. Strange that the carrot doesn't have the same effect.
---
Literally had a healer back in TBC when I was leading raids who's cat wiped us at least once a week. I thought she was just making it up because she'd accidently walk forward, hit a hotkey...until I was at her place and witnessed it first hand, the cat would hear the in game countdown and try and jump on the keyboard.
---
People used fly hacks in as recently as legion.
---
The authors are assessing the interaction between in-game flight point travel and the item Carrot on a Stick, presenting the hypothesis that this item does not affect said travel time.
---
However, the number of experimental repetitions performed in this study is very low and the use of the Trinket during the tests is merely anecdotal. Furthermore, the presented flight times have no standard deviation and statistical methods used are not described.
---
Despite the observed results, I would advise them to assess these concerns by performing additional experimental repeats and corroborating their findings with pictorial evidence or live imaging data.
---
Nice
---
Camelot Unchained, while still in heavily delayed development, can handle 500 v 500 or more. I've been in huge battles in the beta and alpha and the only limitation was my shitty (at the time) video card. Now that I've upgraded it runs very well. 
---
The engine had to be built from the ground up for that purpose but I'll be damned if it doesn't deliver on the promises.
---
I find that crap stupid, yet in some ways I can understand if you ran the dungeon over 100 times and your item didn‚Äôt drop. I‚Äôve been doing a ton of ubrs with rogues in the group. Sometimes they win sometimes I do, it‚Äôs how the game is. This week a MH dal rends dropped and a fucking hunter won it. Me and the rogues were furious, we quickly changed it to ML which we should have done from the beginning. But other than that, I don‚Äôt like feeling like a loot whore so I don‚Äôt mind fair competition.
---
Here to be fair, Ladaric is right and he has explained it pretty well for people.
---
So you respond with a request for proof that you were in non-laggy mass world PvP, with videos showing very laggy world PvP? And this proves your point how? And of course it lags less as time goes on... Half the people died during the lag, and corpses take zero server actions.
---
I might be a special kind, but I wont give anyone special treatments. If a tank asks for anything of monetary value, he is off my list. I'd rather wait 1h for another tank than let him get all the unneeded greens/blues. But thats just out of principle.
---
Tanks can already find a group for anything they want in seconds, I aint giving them shit.
---
thank you. I suppose what i was asking is when do i know what i don‚Äôt need to buy, but this answers it as well as other responses.
---
Thanks g
---
Yeah definitely understand that rogues are the master race so there‚Äôs a million of us
---
I‚Äôm way behind guild so our tanks don‚Äôt really run dungeons anymore so I almost always have to PUG it up
---
Cest la vie
---
Well said kupo
---
Though wow has seen many improvements through the years, its still a pretty old program. I doubt throwing server resources at it will fix the program. The retail client was almost exclusively singlethreaded until recently.
---
Imagine thinking the majority is always right.  I on the other hand am always right
---
The video I posted was a very playable wpvp from both sides and that's my point, it does get laggy at some points but it's not something that makes a huge battle with 400 people unplayable, that only happens when there's 500+ players in a smaller space. Identifying exactly the circumstances that cause the game to get fucked is how we're going to get a solution, not saying "I PLAYED 50v50 AND IT WAS LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE!!!! FUCK BLIZZ".
---
Also, I've seen this video over and over, we all have seen it. However comparing Nostalrius/Elysium to Classic is a bit shallow considering Nostalrius had no kind of protection against client manipulation while WoW is one of the safest MMORPGs around in regards to cheating and that certainly takes a toll on server processing. This isn't an equivalent comparison. 
---
See, I'm not on Blizzard's side here, they certainly fucked up somewhere when developing Classic, but if we really want this issue to be solved we gotta pinpoint exactly what causes it and spreading misinformation certainly doesn't help at all. We gotta choose whether we want to mindlessly complain or get it solved.
---
So, what, five paragraphs to say "world pvp is broken forever and you should not expect it to ever work"? That's pretty defeatist and probably wrong.
---
Amazing video good stuff keep it up
---
Best response so far, not just in terms of length but because you come from a unique background and thus have a different perspective from most players.
---
To say that classic end game is harder than retail end game is just inaccurate. Classic is great for a lot of reasons, but difficult raiding is not one of them.
---
The majority of people don't transfer off large servers, they move towards them.  Despite allowing transfers to smaller servers, the vast majority of people stay on the big servers, then complain when there are too many people.  The same issue is present in classic that is present in retail, people want to have access to the most other people possible to do things.  No one likes being on small servers.
---
It doesn't matter if a server is having a massive queue time, people still rolls new character there.  The pop cap was only going to piss people off, not make everything magically better.  People need to understand the reality is everyone is willing to be a on a megaserver for the benefits, but will never leave if given the chance.
---
EVE Online would say otherwise.
---
I love tanking. Max level Paladin/Warrior/Druid/Monk all tanks on Retail and a 60 Warrior, as well as a tank alt I'm working on in Classic. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean NO ONE likes it.
---
okay thanks guys.
---
Maybe they look for him so they can ask him how he is. You never know.
---
Its perfectly fine to offer money to tank something. Its still going to be a really low gp/h if all you are going after is the gold anyway. I just refuse to take any tanks like that out of principle, but I understand why some people agree to it.
---
Really fucking done with the cat pics in a video game reddit
---
Private servers could handle it. Why cant Blizzards servers handle it?
---
I got that buff on my level 7 rogue. Went to the farm where the endless boars spawn like crazy and oneshot backstabbed for an hour. I got whispers that I am a lunatic or something. Must have looked disturbing lol.
---
Maybe you missed the joke here
---
It's very much worth if you're trying to make money as a non shadow priest and you don't have a an alt to farm with. I average 20-40 gold an hour with this farm. Not the best, but very good for a holy priest(my spec).
---
Yup, I'm sure there is a lot more going on behind the scenes with the current application than the classic one had.
---
Wow a coordinated ony head drop with guilds working together. Must be nice
---
Arms is really really good until lvl 40 because most of the early talents are meaningful at low gear lvls.  Pre 40 your toolkit is kinda small so taking talents that actually do a noticable something is really good.  Once you have access to some button to push for damage that isnt heroic strike you can really start doing what you want.
---
Also tactical mastery and anger management are straight up awesome for tanking
---
DME is good because people usually factor in herbs/ mining, the same goes for Mara runs. Why not drop your professions and pick up gathering? You would really maximize profits from doing runs this way.
---
I was extremely lucky and got the Spell Power enchant from MC early on. I can usually spam chat for a couple hours and make 45-60g/ hr.
---
Pepega STREAMER B A D Pepega
---
I feel bad for the tank though if he has warlocks DoTing multiple targets as much as possible while you have a single high target DPS like a rogue, fury warrior, etc.  Dude gonna have to just give up on holding agro on something and just taunt it back before it kills that DPS.
---
Mongoose is around 1g each, and greater prots are about 1.5g to 2g each.
---
I'm a huntard so no need for mana pots. You can feign death during the fight, resetting combat, then drink back to full mana in about 10 seconds
---
Ancestral grace can proc off chain heal bounce crits, which means if the heal bounces to a tank after healing another member of the raid you might proc it on them. But I agree it's best that 1-2 tank healing priests pick up inspiration and are in charge of making sure the tank has +25% armor up. It's useful for 5 mans as well.
---
This is why druids are going extinct
---
People with bad pcs lagged, the servers didn't. I did multiple city raids in vanilla with 2+ raid groups and the server lag was never as bad as it is in classic.
---
If there was an actual effect, it would be more than a couple of yards. Unless it's the shortest flightpath you could take.
---
The difference is more likely due to client-side rendering delay.
---
I feel like the only ones saying this are the ones who never actually played Vanilla.
---
It was not like this in Vanilla.
---
I‚Äôll trade you a wow token for 200 classic gold every month on Herod

Would you mind telling me about your PvP rogue experience? Are you talking about BG's? And what spec are you playing? I really want to be able to do fine in PvP without having to respec from combat swords each week, I can't afford it.

You could do something else too. Just cause you don't want to do the hard content doesn't mean that the game is a travesty.

Lights hope and north dale both had lag but just had slightly less of it, playing from na my ping was always 125-200, and I gave up trying to fight the Zerg raid groups since it would lag, not as bad as I‚Äôm seeing on these servers but still noticeable.
---
Though we did have a 40 vs 40 fight a few times in low level areas and my delay was about 3-5 seconds only 
---
You are right about it all, but north dale and lights hope also had issues (though with such a small team/ ability to gather resources, they have much more of an excuse than blizzard does)
---
I can already see Blizzard banning people who raid cities for disrupting gameplay because they don't know how to handle it.
---
Lol. No. You can type ./em and then type whatever you want.

Yes, I've been to a bar. I got there in my car. You remind me of Dr. Suess with poor typing skills.

Private servers can handle 1000 people in the same zone without lagging. Why is it that Blizzards servers cant handle 200 before taking a big dump on itself?

Classic PvE (or PvP if you think she'd like that). I never gamed before but the immersion and social interaction of classic got me hooked and it felt very rewarding whenever you level, get a piece of gear, or complete a dungeon. You also set your own pace in classic, which is really nice when starting out.

People always talk about rogues and ambushing/bursting people down, but the reality is rogues strongest asset is their control abilities.  Sap can't be dispelled (It can be removed through other ways).  Sap can take a guy out of a fight for awhile.  Cheapshot opening into a faster kidney can prvent them from taking action.  Kick and gouge to interrupt casting and help lock down a healer.
---
yes, bursting a guy down is cool, but if the guy didn't die then you are in a bad position.  Burst is cool, but good pvp is about control.  Isolate and eliminate will when more than the big dick burst attempts.

Sincerely,

---
true, it was much worse
---
even just 3 guilds attacking each other over azuregos or kazzak just plain out crashed the server for everyone
---
Rank 10 will definitely be harder at the beginning, but chill out to achievable levels after 6 months hopefully.
---
For palas no matter which role you play its always gear &gt;&gt;&gt; spec. Im tanking every 5man easily with the 21/0/30 ret hybrid with zero points in protection.
---
Imp. Righteous Fury is inarguably the best and most important prot talent, everything else in there is completely negligible as it only gives you slightly better survivability which can be offset with better gear. Threath issues can be offset with dps using their brains, even if thats really a lot to ask these days.
---
&gt;Private servers also shirked alot more of the computational power onto the clients which made it much easier to handle more people.
---
Where are you getting that from? The big popular private servers used official clients that had only been modified to connect to different game servers.
---
WoW clients have been doing character position prediction since the start. That's the whole reason you see other characters "rubber band" that's an update from the server being used to update the position prediction the client is using.
---
Everytime you press the macro you will switch to the "find xxx" that you weren't currently on already. So hit it with find minerals on and it will swap to find herbs. One spell that you can keybind instead of alternating between the find minerals and find herbs abilities.

---
I have all the mats minus PHoB and Arcanite bars... i run a lot of 5ms haha
---
I don't care what the root cause is. It's unacceptable. If a FREE SERVICE is offering me better performance than a MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY why would I keep giving ActiBlizz more money?
---
The dogs in BRD have heightened stealth detection, so that's one thing. Personally I've found Vanish to be much less useful than I remembered for avoiding death in a wipe situation.
---
The DME farm has also cratered herb prices on my server so it's hardly worth the effort now unless you also have access to some decent alchemy patterns.
---
&gt; This is Classic WoW. You're complaining about lag in a 200v200 battle. In Vanilla, the entire server crashed well before those numbers were achieved and the lag kicked in before a second raid group started to form.
---
Server infrastructure and technology has improved in the last 15 years. Actually paying a subscription to use 15 year old infrastructure would be kinda baffling tbh. From what I've gathered they started sending more information per player around WoD to compensate for more complex boss mechanics. However, when you consider that NONE of the pros make it to vanilla wow it is really hard to ignore the flaws of that. But hey, at least we can watch someone get flinged into the whelps on our log sites.
---
Thanks, that's pretty much what I was thinking when I heard about those addons. However, I remember almost all quests from classic or private servers, so I actually don't need an addon like this. (hell yeah, I love twinking )
---
Thats really low of you to try to insinuate that im a pos father because we disagree on how fun a version of the game we both play is.
---
Wouldn't that be an argument against its ability to host large battles instead of an argument explaining how it can?
---
Nah it‚Äôs more like when you can‚Äôt get high normally so you start taking dabs only
---
Words.
---
If you want to make it the fun way, get a lot of "of the Eagle"-gear, dot 5 mobs and start wanding while trying to survive. Then eat/drink and repeat. Sort of like AoE in a smaller scale. You have multiple "oh-shit"-buttons: healthstone, sacrifice voidwalker, health potion etc.
---
If you want to make it more fun, change VW to Succubus - you'll kill faster and die more often.
---
Thank you, oh kind one.
---
I will use this knowledge well and spread it as your holy word!
---
All hail AVWoW!
---
You don't compete with the top 1% or even 5%. you just need to compete with the other 95%
---
I'm very aware of it, I'm not complaining and I will (hopefully) not be affected since I probably will get my alt to 60 before p2 as well. 
---
What I was trying to highlight was that this:
---
&gt; Players who are still trying to ding 60 can keep trying to ding 60 
---
The range from 48-59 will be drastically different before and after p2.
---
NA server

How long is the maintenance for?

Most active level 60s will accidentally do that usually. It's 15HK too, I believe.

You'd get lag with more than 80 sitting around the mailbox back then

I often make groups as a DPS and I don't think I've ever spent more than 20 minutes forming a full group for any endgame dungeon. What servers are people on where they take *hours* to fill slots?

I also never, ever do reserves, so maybe that helps.

&gt; This is based on that bracket 14 = 13k rp, in reality bracket 14 receives 12-13k rp so these numbers arent 100% accurate.

In reality everyone will most likely receive 13k, because people in that bracket will coordinate to have the exact same honor. It's only a small handful of people and you bet they will work together to not screw each other over.

jokes on them i dont have 5g to begin with
---
You don't understand how the internet nor servers work and its clear by your comments elsewhere.  The issue is the server sending and receiving packets to the player.  When the server bandwith spikes unexpectedly, as with large scale PvP, the ISP immediately throttles it and the server doesn't communicate with the player's client quick enough.  You're also misremembering about vanilla lag, and you can find videos to prove it.
---
" 11,000 players simultaneously in the starting zones at one time without so much as a hiccup. "
---
Sauce?  This seems like a very real number for sure.  But sauce to be confident.
---
Private servers cannot be compared to Classic servers.  They ran different, and in a lot of cases much worse.
---
This is not to dismiss the fact that laggy WPvP is going to be lame as hell.
---
It might have read wrong, I thoroughly enjoy pvp, at my level. Starting classic late I‚Äôve been camped by 60s and higher levels and that is tilting, but just fuels my motivation to get to 60 a crush these noobs that camp low level areas
---
I mostly play with guild tanks or tanks on my friends list so I haven't really have a bad tank in a good while. I can't remember any of them dropping threat to dots. I think most of them would just leave the focus target since it dies so quickly and it doesn't really matter if the rogue takes 1-2 hits before the mob dies. It's only a sample size of 8 tanks though. I also never see any of them running after the target if I get aggro from a juicy shadowbolt crit since they know the mob will most likely be dead before it reaches me.
---
Well written, would still not pass peer-review. Needs more references.
---
Hitting all the stereotypes in 1 post. Check.
---
Nah
---
Lots of gold changes lol
---
It's honestly a problem a lot of people run into with the level boosts that blizzard has been giving out for a while now. Get a free level 110 character with purchase of the new expansion so you can jump right into the new expansion content, just leads to people jumping straight to level 110 or whatever is 10 level below max and being overwhelmed with the huge assortment of spells that will just be dumped on them.
---
I know orcs are sometimes rogues and the ooga gang were trolls. Night elves have shadowmeld but that is as close as the alliance gets to becoming a rogue :p
---
I assume knowing what you are doing amounts to sweeping strikes -&gt; whirlwind -&gt; shouts?
---
This works, but takes several GCDs and a lot of rage. It will take around 4s to do the combo if you start with all the rage you need, and 6-8 if you start without rage and can't charge in. It is rare to have a mage wait more than 1 gcd before opening up.
---
I can only assume you are trolling once i read #4.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs ridiculous that in 2019 you can‚Äôt figure this out.
---
Blizzard: we are offering free transfers off over populated realms. Take them or there will be issues
---
Players: &lt;ignore blizzard&gt;
---
Months later
---
Players: servers are laggy on my ultra high pop realm boooohoooooo
---
Idiots

That, and only one flight path has been used. An interaction between the Flight Path and the trinket cannot be excluded. Furthermore, their extrapolation to other mounts is a tenuous claim at best. These animals have vastly different morphologies, which suggest they might have different diets as well. Especially when taking the beak or maw morphology into account.
---
Although the authors do point to an interesting phenomenon, their methodology is simply lacking for these conclusions.
---
Sounds like you need to reroll paladin and never run out of mana ;)
---
lol that won't happen. Hopefully they keep an eye out for account sharing and characters that are online for 48hrs+

Have you actually tried 20v20 pvp in bfa, or are you parroting what you see on the internet?
---
Dunno if something has changed, but atleast on launch when I tried it out 20v20 scenarios worked just fine without lagging. Ive seen the videos of laggy big fights, but lets not just spew shit around that it gets unplayable everytime a few players are in the same spot.
---
Damn sick burn
---
Go to the fight club discord, theyre problably the most active class discord and love to theorycraft. Imo you should go for the same hitcap as orcs or humans ie 6% and look for crit from there
---
&gt;Lights hope and north dale both had lag but just had slightly less of it, playing from na my ping was always 125-200, and I gave up trying to fight the Zerg raid groups since it would lag, not as bad as I‚Äôm seeing on these servers but still noticeable.
---
I really hope you aren't comparing 125 ms of lag to 30,000 ms delay. He clearly said, sometimes it took ***THIRTY SECONDS*** to register a command
---
Also, 125ms is pretty much standard over wifi depending on server location. In my mind even 250ms wouldn't be considered "lag" because it's still absolutely playable. "Lag" usually means at least 400ms to the point where it interrupts normal gameplay. 250ms is still quite responsive  
---
Northdale had a few problems, but lag wasn't one of them. I remember launch clear as day, that shit was smooth as butter
---
They're just not needed much. A 5-man needs 1 tank, but a 40-man doesn't need even remotely close to 8 tanks.
---
Stalagg is a fantastic server for alliance! Plenty of space for you to spread your wings, also population means you can find good guilds easily.
---
I like those Reported guys
---
As a rogue, I opened up on someone in BRM
---
Three Reported Rogues came out of nowhere and opened up on the same alliance and proceeded to own BRM for awhile 
---
Rogue master race
---
How do you guys deal with rogues stealing your devilsaur skins? I'm a druid so a couple times I've been able to kick them out of stealth with hurricane to detect them. Is it worth potions? Those only last 10 minutes though. 
---
Honestly I don't even care if they kill me it's just so infuriating when they sap while I'm skinning and take it. I'd rather the skin despawn. Any ideas welcome!
---
except if you mess up you now have to wait an hour for the next kill
---
KITTTAAAAYYYYYYY!!!!!!
---
Not to my knowledge, did he set his WoW to Russian and it gave him a Russian name or what?
---
If it was 20% of 50g it would be, people are just more loss averse than not
---
I'm not even playing a tank so I'm not saying this out of self-interest. Every single one of your examples are false equivalences. If someone joins a group then refuses to use an ability, they are obviously a prick. Are we going to pretend a healer would rather wipe than use a mana pot, or a rogue die than spend 25c on a flash powder? 
---
Even following your example, tanks use health potions AND spend more on repairs, whether they die or not. "Extortion" would be if the tank refuses to taunt. The tank selling their tanking services IS their profession. The most dedicated tanks are prot too - not great for farming mobs. What if they don't want to run around competing for nodes or fishing? Are they only allowed to have fun or make gold in a way that's acceptable to you?
---
Even you saying other classes have less inventory space is wrong. Tanks need at least two sets, and good tanks will have different pieces for different dungeons, resistance sets, etc.
---
When you say "playing the game for fun" what you mean is playing their game the way you want them to. It is up to them what they do, and they can choose to make the most of their time. As a tank, their time is worth more than yours.
---
Hey, that's my meme. You should have used the one with HoR
---
There are limits as to how many people should be in one area. People bitched so hard about layering and now that it‚Äôs gone ‚Äúthere‚Äôs too many people one area and we‚Äôre lagging out QQQQQQQ‚Äù
---
I absolutely remember SS/TM wars crashing quite a bit.
---
Server stability in vanilla was fucking ass.  Part of the reason they said they did BGs was because there wasn't a reliable way to have that big of world pvp.
---
I've seen druids and I've seen warlocks. There are Druid Warlocks?
---
I'll curse you in the name of Elune kind of thing?
---
Yeah this is the rogue gold making method atm
---
That‚Äôs interesting.  I have 6 toons.   4 of them are between 20-24.  The other 2 are in the 40s.  Flake out around the same time
---
6% with the added weapon skill. 9% without. 25% for off hand. 
---
Getting your mainhand hit capped &gt; getting Crit capped &gt; raising hit even further
---
Raising hit even further is dubious since people are queueing heroic strike and then cancelling it causing their offhand to have special attack hit chance
---
some people do
---
more than one guild on my server requires full consumables and for raids. which really is a pointless waste or money
---
Idk, I tried asking him twice, but then he logged off.
---
Yeah I didnt have it before.. it just suddenly started like a week ago. Only thing I remember I've  done different is update my addons
---
Never had heard of that discord. Thank you
---
&gt; You're extorting people for your service. 
---
Yea I think you have an extremely flawed understanding of what extortion is. 
---
**ex¬∑tor¬∑tion**
---
/ikÀàst√¥rSH(…ô)n/
---
The practice of obtaining something, especially money, **through force or threats**.
---
Deciding *not* to help somebody is not forcing or threatening anyone. Nobody is entitled to my time and me choosing not to spend it with somebody does not mean I am extorting them. You can chillax with the hyperbolic language now. 
---
&gt; Every class has associated cost to doing certain things. You know how long it takes to get 300 lockpicking? Did yuo know it cost shamans money to revive after wipes? Did you know it cost priest money to cast group buffs? did yuo know it cost rogues money to cast vanish and blind and use poisons? Do you know how much mana pots go for? and how many mana pots are used per run just to heal? If that healer uses 5 mana pots in the next hour. That could be 10g right there.
---
&gt; #**Warriors dont have to buy reagents like other classes.**
---
Like I'm not here to do the whole dick measuring contest or anything, but warrior is the most expensive class in the game if you really wana get in the weeds on this one. They also don't have access to insane farms like mages, hunters, and other classes. By the way no healer is spamming major mana pots in 5 mans. They might use a superior here and there somebody pulls something extra. 
---
- Lionheart: 1200g
---
- Edgemaster (depending on roll / race): 650g
---
- Flurry axe: 350g
---
- Axe of the deep woods: 150g
---
- x2 force reactive disks: 1200g
---
- Cloudkeeper(if you're tryhard): 1800g
---
- Repair bills: lol
---
- Cost of using engineering grenades and sappers every run: alot
---
&gt; if you feel you need to get to paid to partake in a game you chose to play. That makes you an asshole.
---
That's not what's happening though. In phase 1 my goal is to farm enough gold for all of the items listed above. The only shit I'm still missing from the list is the extra force reactive disk and cloudkeeper. I log in and farm right now. I don't need a single piece of gear from the dungeon you want me to tank. The group is compensating me to stop farming in the open world to help them in a dungeon I have no chance of an upgrade in.
---
Nobody is forcing them. Nobody wants to force you to buy a tank. Most that have me are super glad I came because I am a tryhard and I do make the run go smooth for them. I'm happy because I get to have a little extra gold in my pocket. Why are you sitting over there pissed off that 2 parties got to make a mutual exchange of goods and services that resulted in both parties being happy with the exchange?
---
Retail requires a much larger, longer, and more boring grind than classic at max lvl and gear basically resets every patch and you do it all again.
---
Classic at 60 you could just log in on raid night for 3 hours and be done for the week.     
---
 Classic is also mechanically much easier.  Sounds pretty casual to me.
---
Do I look like I care about karma?
---
For fighting casters: priests for example, remember when when you successfully kick a spell it locks them out of that spell type for 5 seconds. If you conserve your energy a bit and chain that into a 5 pt kidney shot that's essentially 11 seconds of cc.
---
yes he snap chatted this and then since it doesn't save to the phone he screen shotted the picture
---
Definitely not a small achievement man! Congrats! I really have respect for those that can build a guild up to do that! Especially with everyone seemingly being in a guild.

Ran into that same pet problem around two days ago on Maraudon, hahaha. Was doing a full quest run with a dysfunctional team, and when we finished the orange side, we jumped down the cliff side and onto the oozes below to shortcut up to Celebras... but the hunter forgot to dismiss his pet before jumping.
---
Cue big cat taking the long way around, followed by 20 angry plants.

"Ohhhhh fuck."

What's missing from all these "Servers can't handle WPvP complaints" is an FPS meter and network stats of the people posting them.
---
That‚Äôs funny because my realm has zero issues even with hundreds and hundreds packed into one area. I wonder why that could be.... do you think maybe it‚Äôs because I listened to blizzard and transferred off an ultra high pop realm!?!?

Deviate Delight is a good sized server with a good balance.  Early on it was more alliance, but I think it has evened out.  PVP isn't over the top, of course we will see come next week! 
---
 Progression is slow on the server ("Dad Server") so not much concern about being left behind.
---
It's not really fair. I've never been in a run with anything other than free roll on orbs for everyone. If you need the orbs you can run the dungeon and roll on them like everyone else.
---
Sorry if I wanted to click 1 button and buff id roll mage :P
---
I did not mention anything about the layoffs. I simply stated the fact that in 2018, blizzard made record profits. This was contrasting the above post about how blizzard made record revenue. I was offering a minor correction, that is all.
---
You are the one trying to create a narrative around your personal beliefs, and how you feel about others discussing the topic. Stick to the facts, buddy.
---
R2
---
So what's your point? He's not doing raids so why are you trying to argue which one is harder?
---
You just confirmed his point - the casual content in retail is so easy its not even worth doing and is boring.
---
Expected a mix of troll and serious comments, thanks all!
---
Yes
---
Healer least in demand compared to dps? I just don't fancy tanking in a months time when I hit 60 vs all the purple geared chars and losing aggro.
---
You can't customize warlock pet names (you could reset them at some point via pet trainer, don't remember when). That's someone with the Russian client picking a latin-alphabet name for his character, but the pet used the Russian client name. I thought Russian-client users had to connect to Russian servers in Classic though.
---
For the record, that VW name translates to something like Dzhazratkhe. Your average VW name.
---
Tl Dr, At first i didnt have questie, but then reading the wiki page where the pointless quest I should complete is was taking more time than playing the game

I don't see how one talent point every 10 levels is worse (or different) than one meaningful talent every 10-15 levels in the current Classic tree. 
---
I think it's an agree to disagree as I've never once thought the Classic talent trees were engaging or interesting, just something I open and click every level. There's no guesswork or point to changing my trees as I knew what spec I was going to be going into it.
---
This isn't a defense of the new talent system, btw, as I feel they desperately needed to be reworked and I'm not trying to convince you that this is a better way. Just laying out my own argument for why I don't really think the Classic trees are fun and exciting.
---
It is mostly background computing that doesnt exist in pservers.  A-synchronization helps but there are batches of data moving for every action, and multiplying that stress by hundreds of players in an isolated area bogs it down.  There are too many checks and warden parses to have any efficiency in open world pvp.  Hopefully they can find a solution, they have obviously heard and seen the problem.
---
Come on. Have you never seen a non-standard UUID/GUID before? Also for all we know to Blizz it actually means "Game Unit ID". But they use "GUID" in their API so people are correctly saying the issue is to do with your characters "GUID".
---
The way the bracket ranking system works it necessarily has to be weekly.
---
As a person who has worked with servers before, it's funny how many gamers think they work like magic. Fixing server issues is work. Like actual work. It takes time, I suggest the community relax a bit.
---
 /purr
---
Its obviously not, and you're obviously clueless my dude.  You're trying to say that you had zero lag in vanilla, implying that they're using hardware that's OLDER THAN VANILLA, which wouldn't even be able to effectively run a modern OS.  Jesus christ dude.
---
Hey, how much work is it to run a guild like this.  Any tips on growing it and starting to run raids and things?
---
Why? That video is shit.... Just a bunch of mages running around aoe'ing.  The other people there basically dont even matter.
---
/shrug
---
doesn't look like lag to me. but i guess its an ignorant private server, so idk
---
Sure but they didn't and unless you got a timemachine you can't change it either. We moved as a guild to earthshaker, the realm is hitting high consistantly, everyone is happy here.
---
Server transfer worked great for us and looking how laggy gehennas is I'm glad we moved. Sometimes you have to have faith, we were the first guild on the realm after moving and ya early on it was dead AF but it worked out in the end.
---
Wintergrasp we had easily 100vs120 people fighting on my server. And it ran like a well oiled machine.
---
Did WC on my 21 shaman yesterday and forgot to loot one of the gems... really don‚Äôt want to do the whole thing over again but rocking staff of org instead of crescent staff feelsbadman. Any other non-rng sources of a good 2h axe/mace/staff around level 20?
---
*Laughs in Blackrock Mountain*
---
My main is a rogue who has mining/skinning and I'm planning on dropping skinning for engineering at 60. I'm making a hunter and I'm wondering what professions would be good on him while leveling? Was thinking either skinning/LW or just skinning/herbalism to make gold. Any ideas?
---
That's a private server. He's saying large scale PvP never worked on official servers.
---
What are the other numbers in the chart for?  I get that the top row says top% of playerbase you finished in, second row says how much RP is given for the week based on that percentage.  What are the other numbers for - ex 1/1/3/5/8 ??
---
People are angry at mages specifically because a significant number of them hog entire areas of easy melee mobs and refuse to let other players do their thing. Many will even refuse to group up with people trying to kill quest targets. Many have also become a miserable pain in dungeons too as they just AOE everything all the time. Essentially, they have totally dethroned rogues as THE meme class.
---
no lag though
---
Isn't it terrible for a warr?
---
Rewriting an engine is a 5-10 year process. The engine is also core to the entire game so what you are proposing is they make wow 2...which I would be cool with but is not a real viable solution
---
Wow, that is a great tip. I will probably make a trash gear set to swap in and out of.
---
From reading your post I think you're saying strength is more important than agility for tanking? Isn't it the other way around?
---
Man, all I hear is my resale value crashing....

---
There's also upwards of 10 independent actions a single eve ship can be performing simultaneously, exponentially more if the ship has drones.  Large pvp battles in eve actually do become unplayable clusterfucks.
---
Never said it had to be, it just irks me :)
---
Which is like ww1, slowly throwing bodies at the opposing machine guns until you overwhelm them and seize the trench.
---
Now this I agree with
---
Well we usually have 4 top healers neck and neck and then 2 or 3 that or just ok. But I mean we are still all getting geared.
---
These Private servers had a higher population cap than todays servers. Nostralius reached 17,000 player logged in at the same time.
---
I know. But then someone would have to admit he was wrong
---
Nope.
---
That's why I moved to bloodsail buccaneers from Grobb... As horde got stomped everytime I went to brm and had infinite corpse runs... So frustrating! I prefer pve servers atm
---
Private servers didn't handle these numbers any better. I played on them and gave up because the ones that were decent ended up being shut down. Even the decent ones had all kinds of lag and roll back issues.
---
This guy vanilla servers.
---
Yeah I know those people exist, in fact they are probably in the majority. I just don't understand how they find that fun. 
---
Totally cool if you do of course, I'm not very elitist towards people outside of my guild.
---
I was being conservative :P
---
It's weird right?  I loved flying mounts, Transmog, Deathknight tanking, I even liked the simplification of the talents when the number of skills being added became redundant.  To pretend like the changes added into retail were a complete derailment would be to ignore quite a bit of solid work.
---
But I didn't like a new super grindy secondary profession.  I damn sure didn't paying for flying a second and third time.  Let me reiterate that.  Getting a new ability feels like progress.  Buying an ability I already had multiple times in a form of gating content is garbage!  I hated the multiple levels of raid difficulty.  I hated even more that gear had a rating rather than just a hard set of numbers attached so you didn't know if someone was carrying around the crappy LFR version or the heroic 25 man version.  I didn't like the normalization of the tanking classes so that it became trivial as to which one you brought to the table.
---
But when we talk about trying to come back to retail.  Leveling always felt worse with each expansion and all attempts to make the leveling process more appealing didn't really change that it was more a burden to pile through than a fun experience.  Too many dailies and too much content made it feel like a chore.  Oh and most importantly each expansion immediately negating all the progression you made and hucking it into the abyss made each expansion feel less and less important.
---
I'm so not interested in retail I don't even know what the newest expansions offer and pretty sure I don't care.  And not because its a bad game but because there's so many things other games do better (probably at least in part because of things learned from WoW itself).
---
The harder question is, why is Classic good? 
---
I think it comes down to Classic is a fun game to play, and retail isn't a great MMO.  The distinction of what service each game needs to provide is important.  Classic the game, you level to sixty get your gear run the raids/pvp and when you're done that's it.  Retail the MMO, you know that all your progress will get dumped the bulk of the map will become irrelevant so that there is an increasingly big world that is increasingly easy to ignore.  And while you could argue that with all the changes retail as a game it is more polished. Its massive amount of content makes it too big to approach as just a game.
---
No I'm implying they are using different hardware and a different engine that's not optimized for classic, or not using enough because they don't want to spend money on classic.
---
Wtf I don't think I'm german enough to understand this
---
Maybe you do.
---
I'm confused as to what kind of security you think there is that would cause server load issues.

&gt; There's still so much I have to / want to do before BWL comes out
---
And what's stopping you from that after BWL comes out? BWL release doesn't invalidate MC.
---
Classic isn't like retail where only the last released raid tier matters. You will still go MC, when BWL comes out. You will still go MC and BWL when AQ comes out. You will still go MC, BWL and AQ when Naxx comes out.
---
On the other end of the spectrum, I have literally nothing to do besides the weekly raid at the moment, so phase 2 is very welcome.

you literally just proved my point
---
there are a ton less things going on in the background on pservers than on retail servers, thus why no log, but also a ton of other issues and why they label it BLIZZLIKE
---
nice try though
---
Classic is accessible to start from lvl 1. I tried making a character on retail and it just feels like youre out of place, level 1 thru 10 were a ghost town and by that point I was ready to uninstall and go back to classic.
---
That's a good point. I suppose I wasn't thinking of it being slowed down that far compared to normal speed. It would probably sound and look like the warcraft 2 clanging of weapons slowly on buildings in wow with the extra frustration that I feel anyway when a slow is put on me in-game.
---
This seems like abuse of the system. Might even be bannable.
---
Skullflame shield is basically the *only* benefit to being a prot paladin. Scales 100% with spellpower making aoe farming a breeze.
---
It was annoying af
---
its not really a challenge, it's just slow and sluggish
---
Yes.. It's theoretically possible to go from rank 0 to rank 4 if you are in the top 0.3% of honor gainers on your faction on your server.  Most people who participate heavily in pvp will end up rank 3 after the first week.  After that it then becomes unlikely to gain more than 2 ranks at once unless you are very close to ranking up to a low rank and hit the top bracket.
---
Nicely done, thanks for sharing
---
I don‚Äôt agree with OP either, but you‚Äôre misunderstanding him. He‚Äôs not saying the game engine is the problem, he‚Äôs saying the server side engine is the problem.
---
Lol. You make it sound like we are speaking of amateurs here. I dig the fanboism, but come on already, admit they don.t give a fuck already.
---
By now I'm convinced the spell batching is just because of how bad the servers actually are and are not an intended effect.
---
I've seen videos of the massive battles, I'm a software developer and I actually have a games programming background.
---
My naivety to Eve may be making a bad judgement on the extremes of the calculation requirements, but I think Eve is significantly easier to calculate and also hide gaping latency issues.

Chill. You're talking about THE most popular server, right when the servers update, all doing the new content. Don't expect miracles here.

Nope.  
---
Again big difference between local FPS lag and serverside lag in how they manifest.  However the vast majority of people incorrectly conflate the two.
---
It doesn‚Äôt fit that for anyone anymore. There are no massive 40 person communities because the internet is just so much older now. The friends i went back to play classic with I met playing back in the day. There is just nothing to invest time into atm with classic. Servers are so big that I can avoid anyone I don‚Äôt like. It has a similar feel to retail, except the gameplay isn‚Äôt even fun.
---
There can be multiple r14‚Äôs, you just need more players in the system to open up slots. Only the top .3% can make the top bracket so if you only have 300 people, the top .3% of that is 1 person 
---
If the server has 3000 people with more than 15 HK‚Äôs that week, then the top 10 honor earners will be placed in the top bracket
---
Further what can happen is honor stacking. If those 10 honor earners all agree to stack at the exact same honor (give or take 100 honor) then they will ALL receive the top end of the bracket (13000 RP). This doesn‚Äôt take RP away from whoever is the #1 honor earner that week, but instead gives additional RP to those 2-10 top honor earners l
---
It‚Äôs a really neat system with intricacies that look confusing on how the outside but if you read into it it‚Äôs pretty simple, it was just never well documented back in vanilla.

Just don‚Äôt break cap, and you won‚Äôt be blacklisted by the bracket leader ;)

Lol you're the one that thinks we can't  pvp because blizzard has a bad internet connection.
---
I was on Khaz Modan in Silithus when the gates opened. The lag was extremly bad even before the mobs started pouring out and everyone started fighting. My guild had to run to Tanaris to fly out as you couldnt click the flight master in Silithus. The server crashed about 10 minutes later.

Not asking for changes, just asking for a more balanced experience
---
Unless you're a tank, in which case you have to learn how every class's mechanics work. It's not even difficult. Dps are just braindead
---
I'm sorry to hear that. I will buddy
---
Private servers also had no security or vary little allowing people to cheat, blizzards servers have checks to prevent that but slowing down large scale stuff.
---
I don't think this is true in how WoW does it. I first stumbled upon GUIDs in TBC I think, back when Blizzard first made combat logging usable (the initial combat logging in Vanilla was completely unprecise, spotty and weird). I believe it was in TBC or 2.0 patch, maybe even the TBC preparation patch in Vanilla where the modern combat logging was introduced. That log had for the first time GUIDs in it. And I found out that those GUIDs did not change, not even after a character transfer iff the transfer was to a realm in the same battle group.
---
Therefor my conclusion was that it was the primary key in the database for the user, as battlegroups back then were known to all be in the same datacenter and having the same database backend system (the last was found out like many things when there were issues that concurrently cropped up on several systems but not on others).
---
Back then it really was just an incrementing number, expressed as hex-string.
---
Now in the mean time, there's sharding, realm mergers/connections and changes in how WoW operates, so the GUID was changed to adapt to this new environment and now GUIDs seem to be prefixed with origin-realms and they do change on realm transfers, according to 
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/GUID](https://wow.gamepedia.com/GUID)
---
But the way they are made has nothing to do with Windows, which has a different structure (timestamp) embedded, amongst other information.
---
and we get spammed with these posts daily.
---
i mean... maybe if everyone and their brother didnt try to go to the streamer servers just to be "close to popular people" like a bunch of sheep you could play on  a regular server where the PVP is fine.

Execute does not scale with anything. Not your weapon, not AP etc. A fresh 60 with a lvl 5 green wep will execute just as hard as a Naxx geared Warrior.

---
CAMP TO CHAT!
---
Yep. And it's not like they re-released Classic for free like SC:BW... they're charging a monthly subscription to people who weren't playing on retail anymore, so money isn't the issue there.
---
You right I'm bad
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pF9yEZLB9jk
---
I would half way say yes, then half say they enjoy money ALOT
---
A tank offering their services to expedite a groups search for one in exchange for compensation is not extortion. That‚Äôs supply and demand.
---
A member joining a group under the pretense of being a fully contributing member, then refusing to provide what is expected without compensation is extortion. Luckily, absolutely no buff or utility is vital to completing any dungeon.
---
It‚Äôs all about the understanding and expectations of the group. If you offer services prior, no big deal. If you join THEN try to hold them ransom, you‚Äôre a shitbox.
---
As for making money with alchemy and engineering, have you seen the herb and potion market plummet with the release of DM? Mana potions have dropped on my server by 25%. Dreamfoil went from ~2g/ea to 50s/ea. I‚Äôm sure anything using thorium has dropped similarly. So you‚Äôre making 2K gold is relative to the timeframe. If you got in the game early and make profit off the market while the supply was much lower than the demand, that‚Äôs irrelevant to someone getting into the game now when the market is dropping. It can take far more effort and time now to make the same amount then it took you.
---
Its only wasted if youre using a 2 hander; its less efficient than some other stats, sure, but still gives you extra white damage, which is a large chunk of your overall, and even with this being the case, a lot of hit pieces will still do more for you than the nonhit alternative.

Mostly verifying that the request send aren't breaking any rules and is a legit request to avoid exploit and hacks.

&gt; I've tanked an instance here and there on my shaman. If the group plays vanilla style, the biggest issue is mana. You have to drink after every pull.

No not really, going oom is an exaggeration. I hyperlinked a sham tank guide above your comment that goes into it, in more detail.
---
Shout out to fellow Grob Mobbers.
---
Thanks for spelling this out.  A lot of people are under the impression that you just need to farm X or Y amount of honor a week.  It depends on the other people on your server, and that can make it vary wildly.
---
Drop skinning when you've 60, it makes enough money to be worthwhile whilst levelling. I'm on a druid with Herb/Skin and I won't drop skin until I hit 60, there's just too many beasts to kill that are skinnable
---
I saw lag with what looked like less than 80 people.
---
Between players and NPCs it will probably lag in AV like it does on retail
---
Private servers main goal was to provide a good experience for their players. Blizzards initial goal was to prove we didn't want classic, now their goal is to figure out what aspects of classic to implement into retail WoW for when classic "dies"
---
Because the mana cost is lower on the downranked heals every 1 point of healing power adds more mana efficiency to the lower mana cost spell.  
---
For example lets use 300 healing power as a base and compare greater heal rank 1 and heal rank 4 and average healing numbers.  
---
At 0 healing power and the typical talents for a raiding healing priest:  Greater heal rank 1 heals for 981.5 (average) at a mana cost of 314.  This equates to a hp per mana of 3.126.  We will just refer to this as mana efficiency.  Heal rank 4 heals for 780.5 (average) with a mana cost of 217.  Mana efficency = 3.014.  As we all knew from the start of this discussion GH1 is more efficient than H4 at 0 healing power.  
---
At 300 healing power and the same talents:  Greater heal rank 1 heals for 1239 with the same mana cost.  This equates to a mana efficiency of 3.94.  Heal rank 4 heals for 1038 with the same mana cost.  This equates to a mana efficiency of 4.01.  Now at 300 healing power H4 is more mana efficient than GH1.

My main is a 46 druid on a PvE server, my friend I followed has recently stopped playing though. I want to re roll on a PvP server, how do I choose a server though?

I'm on the east coast but I think west coast servers work better for me since I usually play late at night. 
---
I was thinking either Grobbulus on west coast or Herod for east coast. Any thoughts on these or any other suggestions or some quick reviews of high pop servers that are good?
---
I'd like a server that is high pop but doesnt have queues, is somewhat faction balanced, and has a good community and strong PvE progression guilds. I'll be concentrating on raiding mostly. Any thoughts?
---
Do the whole thing over. This will probably be your best weapon until lvl 29 when you can get Corpsemaker. I did the same thing so i feel your pain &gt;.&lt;
---
You think that everything is CPU or Memory bound? If you work in IT/Software development, you know that there is more to it. They are not changing a 2004 game drastically from a code perspective. You opted in for playing a 2004 game, this is that experience. Retail receives weekly patches in order to improve various aspects of the game.
---
Developer here. Of course they can fix it, there is no blocker in sharding the workload other than simply investing the time to do it. If, and that's a big if, that is indeed the issue. You don't have the source = you don't know.
---
So blizzard looks at those numbers, sees that there is a very active, very vocal, likely niche market and provisions servers accordingly. They didn't expect the significant mainstream appeal and reaction. 
---
Nobody did. Anyone who says they expected the sort of response classic got is lying through their teeth.
---
Vocal forum users, blizzcon fans (which are already your hardcore fan base and not an indication of casual interest) and unreliable and unvetted private server numbers is enough to point to the existence of interest. It is not nearly enough to quantify that interest and absolutely not enough to think that the interest would be in the hundreds of thousands or more, not in the tens of thousands.

Every single action you take has to be Ok'ed multiple times before it happens, it has to be checked if your allowed to do that, if your in range, if its the correct value, and probably some other stuff before your ability goes off.

Exactly, it almost becomes like a chess match
---
They are miserable... No tips, just try and survive it

It's mostly just tanks that really want the FR gear. Everyone else seems to do fine with a pair of greater fire protection potions (drink one 2 minutes before the fight, then drink another after the first's absorption is all used)
---
One reset easy
---
Can someone tell me what addons is being used? The raid frame and the mouse over heals is very nice :O
---
uldaman bro. A bit of badlands. You can also go in feralas. At level 44, you have A TON of quests in south-stranglethorn, feralas, hinterlands, tanaris, with quests making you bouncing between those areas. You also have zul'farrak, then maraudon at 47, sunken temple a bit after, then un(goro, felwood...
---
It's also important to take even what look like minor quest. A dwarf in stormwind asked me to check the sunken temple, and it spawn a big quest chain across several areas including 3/4 steps in the hinterlands.
---
the 44/55 bracket has a shit ton of things. You are at the end of the "pre-40 void zone". Be strong. I'm at 48 and still have an insane amount of available quests do (more than 40) and have let a few grey quest.
---
Main related takeaway I see from that is he goes from the start, maybe 5-10% into  Rank 11 to 75% into rank 8 with 119 Dishonorable kills. Interesting since that is two full ranks. Which is much more RP than 11,900 points.
---
You dont need all the FR to down domo and rag. Get the FR buff from UBRS.
---
This. So many posts on this issue by people who don't understand they're asking Blizzard to solve one of the most fundamentally difficult computer science problems in existence.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I think layering was sort of like a necessary evil in a way. Don't get me wrong, I like not having layering on classic. server identity etc. Thats pretty good. but people treated layering as if blizzard added it in as a joke only just to upset and mess with people. In reality, there were advantages and disadvantages to layering. It sort of fixed a tonne of the problems that were plaguing the game, but at a trade of server Identity. And now with its absence, The servers will definitely go to shit over time. I'm not saying that they should add in layering again, but I'm just saying I understand why it was adding in the first place.
---
People are mad that the game can't handle massive scale pvp the game was never able to handle.

you can use many scripted emotes for cross faction communications, like  /point  /shrug /nod  /happy /bonk /no /beckon  etc etc.

I have managed to establish some cooperation between the to factions with only those.

You have never worked with server hardware have you? Anti virus/HBSS will really slow down a server when it has to check every single packet coming in and out of the server. I see this all the time in the data center i work in. We over provision every server to accommodate this.

I feel like I'm the only paladin tank who knows about mana pots and JoW/SoW.
---
I can spam consecrate pretty much the whole dungeon stopping to drink only on pulls with lots of range dudes (BRD has a few of these).  Consecrate never misses and it's one of the largest threat generators we have, even going down 2 ranks is plenty to hold threat for MC geared dudes (unless you've got a warrior dps who blows their load in the first 3 seconds of the fight).  SoR is just for burst threat at the beginning of the fight, judge it once or twice on bosses and immediately switch to SoW.
---
Threat wipes are my bane in dungeons, but those are countered as long as you don't run around like a chicken with your head cut off, they're going to hit you regardless, stand still.
---
Hunters definitly need mana pots, unless you are a slacker and dont care about your damage done. Other people are putting effort into the raid, so why shouldnt you?
---
Great advice.  As a tank, I notice Rogues who actually kill skull first also.  It seems like this is unusual for some reason.  I hate it when the kill order isn't followed.
---
No wonder there was serious account sharing going on to get rank 14.
---
I've levelled on other servers as a hunter and ditched the quiver both times. The extra bag slot space is too important.
---
Use my brain? Lmao maybe you should practice what you preach.

It makes 0 difference how many realms you have. Did you eat glue before writing that comment?

Indeed, there's no magic thing that happens because it's named a GUID. Or requirements that come into play except the one crucial one that uniqueness must be enforced (in some unspecified way). 
---
The way GUIDs are currently, they are indeed globally unique and there's never the same GUID referring to two different players.
---
The way they initially made them, they were unique only relative to the datacenter/battlegroup the player was in. But within that context, they too were absolutely unique.

You said it yourself. You prioritise other things over wow. But in reality you aren‚Äôt. You‚Äôre just a sheltered kid used to get things u point at.

---
If you can‚Äôt afford 12$ as a monthly fee, don‚Äôt play wow. Go earn money.
---
Of course, but that‚Äôs just validating input. Emulators did that too, for sure.
---
Except he's not, he's assuming Blizzard are conforming to Microsoft's standards, and just calling **part** of a GUID an ID and telling people that they're wrong for referring to the whole thing as a GUID, which it is. Even if the relevant part of information is an incrementing number, which it is, the entire thing is still a GUID, you can't just mentally separate them and call people wrong for not thinking about it in the same way.

Honestly this whole conversation is getting pretty ridiculous at this point

"guyz i bashed retail, upvote plz"
---
There were 10k+ people during peaks of servers like Lightbringer and Northdale, both those servers had massive battle like Nostalrius and worked SIGNIFICANTLY better. I NEVER EVER experienced lag when dropping a fucking head in Stormwind and we had literally 10+ guilds sitting in front of the statue on some days, yet Classic shits the bed when 3 40 man raids acquire Dragonslayer. Not to even speak of the joke that's any large scale battle which worked ten times better. I don't care if the solution is to have dynamic draw distance, buying more hardware or praying to a Dark God, fucking make the game playable.
---
&gt; Considering the amount of support they have for all of their games
---
How many thousand gold-sellers am I going to report before a GM gets around to banning them? Their support is not what it was back when I last played a Blizzard game (WOW, circa 2005-06).

---
That is a great guild name! Gratz on the kill.
---
That was my experience aswell on Gehennes EU. All the hordes were super nice and just /cheered and watched me kill the demons.
---
Because private servers are an emulation based on capturing client side packets and likely skipping tons of processing official servers perform.
---
! Thank you, this definitely makes sense. I thought I was going crazy.
---
Always played warrior since vanilla never used macros and dps has always been good for my gear level. I doubt it would help it that much to matter.

He described why +5 is strong on MH daggers.  Nothing he said was wrong - in fact, it's all correct.  Quit being a dick
---
No one cares
---
&gt;You're extorting people for your service. Instead of just playing the game for the fun of it.
---
Speak for yourself, bud. Not everyone enjoys spamming dungeons, especially when it's entirely selfless. This isn't extortion either, no one is forcing people to pay for tanks. If a group doesn't want to pay then they don't have to, they just have to spend a longer time and wait to hopefully find a tank that's feeling charitable.

&gt; This is a popular misconception that the more money or manpower you have the faster you can solve engineering challenges. This is just flat wrong. See Brooks Law for an example.
---
This is assuming it's an engineering problem and not a 'Corporation doesn't want to spend the money on the' problem.
---
I fully believe it's the latter rather than the former.

Classic feels more like an adventure.

I think people also have to realize that World PvP is going to decline *massively* just due to natural causes. It takes a lot of effort to organize, it's not hugely rewarding (in terms of actual game rewards), and it will be harder to get going as time goes on.
---
There's a reason people gravitate towards BGs.
---
Oh no! ... thank you for not killing me lol (unless you have then booo!). 
---
Also my guildies will pbly find that hard to believe as lately I spend a LOT of time in the cities RPing and not you know ...  leveling üòè
---
I miss the vibrant overstated world and armor designs of TBC, its part  of why Cata also appealed to me.
---
The free action potion
---
If you like your class and can find a good guild stay with it and wait for BGs. PvP realm at best will give you raid-ganks at BRM (or server crashes due to such attempts) and some randoms open world (you can flag yourself for PvP on a PvE realm too). Most realms aren't faction balanced and on top of that there is zero guarantees that both factions will participate in PvP or things like War Effort equally.
---
At this point I'm not even sure that this is something that layering would even help with.
---
Tuesday when they released the anniversary event on retail, I was doing the raid event and with a party of 30 people would get 1k - 2k ms lag from the instanced raids.
---
I was also experiencing that same kind of lag in Diablo 3.
---
I used to believe that it was my internet connection that sucked. But Blizzard servers are the only place where I experiment lag like that.
---
I dont know my numbers but they're about the same- I've been 300 mining for  2 weeks and still no arcanes
---
That's the whole point dude you need to find the most difficult time for the majority of players. It's not that crazy for gamer's to stay up till 2:30 AM even on a work night you're just going to be tired af at work. 4-6 AM in the morning is another story however, if you stay up that late you're basically pulling an all nighter and no one really wakes up that early voluntarily unless they have work early.
---
Imagining Ralph as an ogre makes completely sense though
---
Yes there are certain bop items are are super OP.
---
\- Ultra-flash shadow reflector / gyrofreeze ice reflector.  both reflect shadow/ice damage for 5 seconds.  Those 5 seconds if used well should make a mage/warlock 1v1 significantly in your favor.  examples - mage novas you and starts casting frostbolt into you.  you can now free channel a bandage to full health unless they fireblast/sheep you.  you jump a warlock get him to 50% - 90% of the time theyll coil you.  coming out of the coil you use shadwreflector now you cant be feared or doted up.  Their only option to win at this point is to healthstone/pet sec and then try to land a fear on you when your reflector is down.  
---
\- Gnomish death ray.  channeled ability that can hit for 1k damage.  amazing to use if your snared and cant get to your target.  ie mage nova, hunter improved wing clip, warrior at low hp kiting you with hamstring etc etc 
---
There are more examples (look up gnomish net-o-matic, rocket boots, mind control cap) but I wanted to provide a few real pvp examples to drive the point home
---
Blizzard nerfed the server stats because one of the players said "Free Hong Kong"
---
It may not have been at release of the pvp system, but there was a rank you couldn't decay from.  I want to say it was like rank 5.
---
It isn't difficult to get to about rank 5-7 with not too much pvp time if you are willing to go up a rank a week.  If you want to go faster you might need to dedicate an hour or two a night, but it still isn't too bad.  It's one reason the system is tricky.  You can rank up fast early and you think it will be easy, and then BAM you have to grind 15 hours a day for a month.
---
it's really the time gating which makes the difference.
---
farming rep in nazjatar and mechagon for pathfinder was such a chore. you have to do your daily quests and you kind of have to do them every day, otherwise you will fall behind.
---
same for the essences.
---
farming ap is kind of the same.
---
you can log in every day and do the ap world quests. sure you can do isles until your head explodes, but those aren't nearly as effective.
---
classic is far more "flexible" with their chores.

i can either do 2 hours for 5 days or 10 hours a single day and the outcome will be the same, thats not true for retail at all.
---
Can't you skin from cat form? You can't be sapped as you're considered a beast when in forms. You also can't be sapped if you're in combat, so you could moonfire or entangling roots some nearby mob.
---
100%. I'm currently leveling my second char, 58 hunter, and I have an easier time finding spots in 60's dungeons vs. my 60 BiS and raid geared priest.
---
For raids, healers are pretty in demand though. Especially priest on horde. But dungeons? Most healers would rather run dungeons than solo quest/grind, so I think that's a large part of why they're in pretty low demand.
---
"I've seen a video so I know how it works"
---
Lets take one of those large battles.
---
A fleet of 200 ships enters the system.
---
Upon system entry, on top of all the existing calculations going on for that node, the server now needs to calculate how each of those ships appear.
---
Each pilot has a skill for the ship that calculates bonuses.
---
Each pilot has a skill for each of the different type of modules on that ship. For a standard battleship fit lets say 1 skill for the main weapons, another for the smartbomb, another for the resistance shield components, another for the active shield components, another for the propulsion module, another for the weapon enhancers, another for the damage control module, another for the ships velocity, another for the ships agility, another for the ships hull, another for the ships armor, another for the ships shield, another for it's warp speed, another for it's cpu, another for it's power grid, another for it's drone bay. Another for it's locking speed, another for it's locking range, another 4 for each of it's ECM resistances, another 8 for armor and shield resistances. There's also several for the capacitor, for how much each module must use and the cycle time and damage for weapons - all separate skills.
---
That calculation is multiplied by 200, just for the ships entering the system.
---
Lets fast forward to entering the fight. The position of each ship, it's velocity and agility must all be registered and tracked. Each ship now launches 5 drones. Each drone, for all intents and purposes, count as a ship to the server. The server now doesn't have 200 ships to track, but 1200. Just for the one fleet - there could be 5 more fleets in this "small" 1000 ship battle.
---
Most movement commands in fleet-fights are based on relative position to other ships, so 199 of those ships will probably need to know the position of the ship they are approaching/keeping at range. Something that needs to calculate and update each server tick with a 3 dimensional position.
---
As each ship actives shield modules the server needs to calculate how much resistance needs to be given for each ship, and how much capacitor it will use. The capacitor now needs to calculate how much regeneration is done. This isn't a nice static mp5 number, but varies with every cycle as regeneration is based not just on skills and modules, but also the % the capacitor is at. 
---
The same calculation is being made on shields which also have a variable recharge rate, with or without damage being applied.
---
Damage from direct weapons is nice and easy. Just a simple calculation based on the pilots weapon skill, the type of ammunition loaded, the range of the enemy ship, a damage variable for the ammunition between two numbers, a damage variable for the range between two numbers, the angular velocity of your ship compared to the enemy ship. The resistance values of the enemy ship. Whether the hit was regular, glancing or penetrating or a miss. The enemy ship is also receiving repairs from friendly ships which are calculated based on the range of the friendly ship, the module type used to repair, the skill of the ship repairing.
---
There's also smartbomb damage going on which applies to all ships, friends and foes within a certain radius. It also applies to the drones (1000 of these, plus the 200 friendly fleet members in range) The damage taken depends on the skill of the smartbomb being used and the resistances of the ships receiving that damage. 
---
In addition, links ships are providing aoe bursts of buffs with a variable maximum range, and variable buff being applied based on the skills of the ship providing it.
---
This is just a tiny snapshot of what's happening in a large battle. I could go on.
---
if you /cheer at the demon, does that could as interrations and resets him cos he suddenly feels good about himself ?
---
For one I do. I‚Äôm admittedly behind the curve but am catching up. Even then I‚Äôm still at risk of missing out on Rag. Again. Joined a few months before BC last time and hit 60 a week before it came out. It‚Äôs been something I‚Äôve wanted to do for 10+ years, kill Rag at 60, and because they‚Äôre rushing the content I might not get to do something I‚Äôve wanted to do for ten years.
---
I'm not sure about the large % of people liking retail. It might be a bias because only people enjoying retail are staying. I came back end of legion because I was hyper for BFA, but after cleaning the second raid in HM and started the MM progress I was burn out by the evershiffting goal of AP grind and Titanforging so I ended up quitting again, just waiting for classic. 
---
So yeah I guess the majority of the playerbase like it but it's because the other left. Classic showed it I think, because old players massively came back (at least it seems, as in my guild most of the member don't even own BFA or legion)
---
no, it can't, shut up
---
I don't think it's my computer though it honestly could be. But several occasions as I was going through a dungeon with two guildmates, I noticed my latency spiked from 23 ms to 600-800 and it eventually disconnected me.
---
Now I was running Discord at the same time flawlessly as well as a browser.  I usually have these three running in unison without issues.  I could go for hours without issue then this happen
---
It occurred twice during the dungeon where everyone stopped on my screen until I got d/c.  Returning I was back to 23-32 ms.
---
According to the census data wowhead posted awhile back it is stalagg
---
I have been playing during northdales launch day for their last fresh server called Silver Hand and there were indeed more than 11k people online, both factions obviously. Starter zones were a shit show but it was playable, and no layers.
---
Sulfuras is going to drown in blood soon.  Excellent!
---
That's a good point. But regardless of if the populations are too large for the servers, this is a server infrastructure or coding problem.
---
Space is one thing, but it shouldn't be a problem to have players near each other and that seems to be a major problem on classic servers that LH seemed to have pretty much solved
---
It's much more complicated than you think. The problem is not serving many thousands of people. They can easily do that. That's no big deal. They can accommodate millions of Overwatch players at once...
---
The problem is that you have to make sure that all players see the same reality. This reality lives in the memory of a server. If you want to add more servers, but want to keep players in the same "reality", you need to somehow make the servers agree on what actually happened at any point in time. This is an incredibly difficult problem to solve, and in certain cases is literally impossible to get 100% right.
---
Blizzard uses sharding in retail since it's the most scalable way to work. It is almost exactly what you described. As load goes up, based on region, multiple shards are spawned. The problem is that you can no longer see everyone at once, since people can be in different shards. If you have a shard for the in in Orgrimmar, you wouldn't be able to see anyone outside. When you run out, everyone inside will despawn, and everyone outside will spawn. Just like what happens in retail when you zone. It's not the solution people wanted.
---
Now there are ways to handle this stuff, but it's usually not done in realtime. For instance: on Youtube you have the view counters that go up. However, in different places in the world you'll see slightly different view counts because the video is being served from different servers. However, eventually, the counts are synchronized and reach the "final", correct, number. This "eventual correctness" is a property often used in databases, but it doesn't work well in games.
---
There are ways to make your game more scalable, yet keep everyone in the same reality. But that's stuff that needs to be designed down to the networking model level. It's a huge effort, and it will lead to certain quirks that don't exist now. There is simply no perfect solution. To seamlessly have tens of thousands of people in the same world, they will need to rewrite a whole lot of code from the ground up. It really isn't something you can just patch in quickly.
---
Like you said, in vanilla server populations were smallers and you had to queue up much faster. Also, you didn't have big streamers that can cause huge flocks of people to bunch up like what happens now. Vanilla servers would've had massive queues, and likely also still went down. I think we just didn't see those huge raids like we do today.
---
Wrong
---
Parallelization might help but won't solve the issue. N to N communications problems in which each state change is dependent on responses from all other objects aren't inherently parallelizable. The calculations *might* be parallelizable dependent on what's being calculated, but the communications are not and that's the bottleneck. There's even a risk that going parallel could make the communications *slower* because of the added overhead of inter-processor communication (it might not, depends on architecture and where the bottlenecks are).
---
Same thing on stalagg in Org. Fps drops to the 40s and everything lags miserably. This is WITH an extra layer. These servers are a joke in their current state, it's not a suggestion they NEED to amp them up if world pvp is going to work at all.
---
No, sorry.  I specialize in priest and I'm not really comfortable giving people advice/numbers on a class I don't play or understand fully.  I know shamans and druids have a lot more complications because they have more ranks of their heals available before level 20.  For whatever reason spells available prior to level 20 have a reduced coefficient which from research I believe is roughly equal to (Base Cast Time/3.5)\*(Level Skill Becomes Available/20), through testing on my priest I found this was accurate for heal rank 1 (the only spell in my graph purchasable prior to level 20).  I simply don't have the comfort level that the same applies to other classes and their down ranked spells.  I also don't know the typical raiding specs and how those might impact the efficiency numbers.
---
you should try getting into a casual guild for raiding one night a week, sounds like your gear is good enough!
---
Just how? Why does it lag this bad? Even pservers aren‚Äôt nearly this bad, and they had to support way more people in 1 area.
---
&gt;I'm not sure about the large % of people liking retail. It might be a bias because only people enjoying retail are staying. 
---
&gt;So yeah I guess the majority of the playerbase like it but it's because the other left.
---
You're right with this, it may be a fault interpretation by me. I just don't feel that Retail will ever get fixed by engaging in bold and risky changes to move away from the action-RPG vibes back into the RPG elements. 
---
BFA had many changes that resulted in no change at all. One of the problems with M+ during Legion was that mass AoE and CC were the way to go (mostly melee then) in terms of offensive strategies. So they toned down AoE and CC overall (or so they said). I caught some MDI some weeks ago on Twitch and the compositions were almost the same as late Legion M+. Replacing BDK with Prot warriors, but a mass of rogues and monks. All those changes and nothing changed?
---
Thats the one
---
The reason Classic is a better experience for casuals is because the floor is much higher in Classic than retail (although retail has a higher ceiling in PvE.)  All classic content has at least some chance of failure and requires a pretty healthy investment of time or effort to accomplish.  This means that achieving goals in Classic feels like an actual accomplishment, even very casual goals.
---
Retail has gotten to the point that it's only fun if you want a game with no challenge at all or you want to push the very highest levels of progression you can.
---
Non-progression content is only good in retail if you're happy doing mini-game content with no real challenge (including world quests/emissaries) for minion, mount, transmog, and welfare epic rewards.  Most of this content can be completed solo and with pretty much zero understanding of your class and almost zero chance of failure.  
---
Pushing Mythic+ and Raiding in a premade group (not LFR) is the only actual challenging content left in Retail.  Many casual players don't want to spend the time finding a set group to run with, and don't want to constantly PUG content meant to be done in an organized group.
---
The 'middle' content of Retail (Heroic 5 man dungeons, elite quests, random Battlegrounds) have all been neutered to the point that they are not even slightly challenging or the rewards are so bad that running the content is pointless since you get better rewards from doing solo quest content.
---
Remember when they offered transfers off that server? That was their solution. You chose to stay on an overpopulated server.
---
Awesome intro! Good pvp video.
---
Even if I agree that there's a lot of ppl not knowing what they are talking about regarding this issue I wouldn't say your statement makes much sense either.. Why would using a newer or older client matter for server lag/stability?
---
And claiming it's a non-issue? It's hardly a non-issue if the server crash/rollback cause of lag during big battles/world events.
---
Having said that, the stuff about a couple of guys in a basement is also kinda silly since blizzards infrastructure obviously contains more moving parts that they need to take into consideration while you have no idea about what was done in order to make those huge battles possible. The fact that Blizzard host several servers in the same location with them sharing the same network capacity might also be a factor.  
---
Did the big fight with 200v200 or whatever take place during prime time for the server or was it made during off-hours as a joint event between some guilds? I agree that the battles look a lot better on the footage from the private servers but I haven't been part of it myself and I don't know how the game was to play outside those battles, maybe something was changed to make it possible that ruined other parts of the gameplay.
---
Learn how to reset fights.
---
A phone screenshot, of a cropped photo taken of your computer monitor?
---
Huh.  That does indeed seem like a bug.  :(
---
It‚Äôs not as obvious as you think. A lot of us with favorite games think our experiences in the game reflect the culture of the company. This is simply not true. Companies are motivated by profit only. No matter how many times they change the company logo to rainbows during pride month. Companies are not here to be our friends.
---
According to this response, yes. It is not intended, but there seems to be a bug which happened to me when I did not complete the Show your work before re-learning it. Now I cannot learn either specilization.
---
&gt;The only thing that kinda got moved a bit ahead is DM and for Europeans it was actually later than in Vanilla.
---
You're thinking of maraudon dm wasn't out at release for europeans. And everything is sped up so you're wrong on all counts
---
For PvE content Alliance undoubtedly have it easier. Fear Ward and BoP completely trivialize certain boss mechanics. Ally never have to worry about a shitty Tremor Tick for fear breaks on Ony or Nef or Garr. On Garr you just have one of your tanks hit with a BoP and boom free stack dropping while Horde has to do some bullshit with LIP and running as far from the boss as they can.
---
Plus pally buffs in general are better than totems in addition to paladins being better healers.
---
Not to mention Ally has better access to raids until phase 6.
---
Phase 1-4 Ally can set their hearth wherever the hell they want and get to BRM with a portal to Ironforge. Meanwhile Horde guilds all demand hearth set to Kargath for raid days. Phase 5 all raiding guilds set hearths to Cenarion Hold and then Hordes fastest way to get to BRM is UC portal and a 10 minute flight. Phase 6 Horde finally has some easier access to Naxx, but Ally can just set their hearth to LHC and combined with Engineering trinket is on even footing for time it takes to get to AQ.
---
I‚Äôm new to WoW and managed to hit 60 last night (yay!) I‚Äôm planning on trying to do Molten Core tonight for the first time. Does anyone have any tips/tricks for a beginner Hunter?
---
Time dilation doesn't happen in EVE until you are looking at 500+ people and even then it really doesn't slow down until you are over 1000. I have fought in quite a few nul-bloc engagements where each fleet had 250+ ships, and there was no lag present at all. Have also fought in extreme TiDi, and while slow, was at least manageable.
---
AWESOME!   
---
" Hello you have encountered a bug that is 15 years old that we didnt fix back then and we ... probably wont fix now either - Byeeeeeeeeeeeee "
---
That‚Äôs weird. There‚Äôs got to be a secret workaround. The guy hasn‚Äôt logged back on for me to ask again, but he was ignoring my questions earlier so he probably won‚Äôt explain it anyways. Thanks for trying though!
---
Strangle Forne Kale?
---
I've had that happen yesterday. Two were questing in Arathi Highlands while we were hoppity hoppiting to Scarlet Monastery.
---
Three of us (tank, healer, 1 DPS) got to the dungeon and started the run. We cleared a boss and a rare mob by the time the remaining two got there. It was, by a large margin, their loss... since they ended up traveling to SM individually and got ganked a few times. We traveled there grouped up and were able to fend off the Horde within reason.
---
If there's one person missing, it's possible to start the run with clever CC and mixing up the roles. You don't have to literally be on standby until they get there.
---
Obviously they‚Äôre not the ones making the decisions. And obviously the yacht buying shareholders also exist. We need to turn those billionaires into millionaires.
---
I think the leveling process itself is more enjoyable for what I'm trying to accomplish. On one hand, the appeal of Classic is being able to go at your own pace and not rush through content, but on the other hand, I want to see progress. Maybe not bum rush through the content kind of progress, but a level a day or something tangible. Not having to read through the text allows me to actually enjoy the journey by way of just actually getting to play the game and grind mobs and such, so I am able to reap some rewards from what little play time I have.
---
I'm not sure if I was able to adequately encompass how I feel about it and my reasons for it, but hopefully my explanation helps.
---
I don't have the same experience in Tanaris. It seems relatively tame.  
---
I'd say it's more like Fort Irwin.
---
This is because of the way your ISP is routing traffic, it has literally nothing to do with Blizzard. Try playing through a VPN.
---
My cat only wants to be looked at. Idk what you did but you made him submit to you and now he lets you hold him. Teach senpai
---
The bombs he gives you are inferior to ones which require engineering - iron and thorium grenades stun the target and can be thrown whilst moving, which is a life saver when you're being chased.
---
In my eyes the ultimate engineering item is the Goblin Rocket Helm. An instant cast 30 second incapacitate on a 20min CD. It is effectively a get out of jail card that can be used whenever things go badly, such as if a 1v1 unexpectedly turns into a 1v2 (or 1v3).
---
But, this isn‚Äôt an official Blizz subreddit, is it? Will Blizz devs even see?
---
Shield block &gt; revenge &gt; shield slam &gt; sunder is my normal rotation. I'm already accustomed to tab targeting and have view target of target on so I can quickly cycle through and see whose aggro I've lost to someone else. As for banking rage, that's something I've never really been able to pull off unless I was running someone through a dungeon 10+ levels below me. Casters gotta drink after every fight and in the time they're done my rage is at 0.
---
 I've never been complacent in thinking my mitigation ever did anything at all. I don't have thunderclap, I only use demo shout as an opener, and I don't use heroic strike.
---
 I'm not scared of dying; the biggest issue I'm facing is that everyone else dies in a second and I can't currently do anything to stop that from happening because my AoE threat is very bad and I have been unable/unsure how to fix it.
---
Get enough un-subs and the rest of us can play? I see what I wanted you to make me see there.
---
While both your initial statement are true, I believe you are overlooking an important factor of cat psychology. In my many years of experience with cats, both first hand and recounts of others observations, cats will beg for, chase, steal, and otherwise demand food that they will absolutely refuse to eat when they obtain it.
---
What are some recommended gold farming methods a warrior can grind solo?  Fury spec and mostly pre-raid bis geared.
---
Yep, tell dipshit enh shammies over-threating to use fire shock instead lol.
---
Flank and take out casters using AoE. In large scale pvp you'll have issues going into to big fights head on. Use stealth and good pathing to reach your target, then corpse camp casters if you can.
---
Fuck, out of all the comments here, somehow this one sits best with me. No exposition but plenty of flavour. Straight to the point, and I can figure out how it all ties in
---
Definitely appreciate ALL the input, but this one was perfect
---
Now you know why horde is hard mode in dungeons and raids.
---
It's extremely easy to do in 2 weeks and not very hard to do so in 1 week.
---
So we all start with 0 RP (rank points) when P2 releases on Tuesday.
---
You need to get to 5000 RP to be rank 3. In order to get 5000 RP in one week you need to be in bracket 7 which means you were in the top 23% of players to earn honor that week.
---
pvp servers are not for casual play, unfortunately.
---
Any time I tried to play IoC the game immediately started to lag as soon as people started fighting in the middle, even if you're capping a side base away from the fight it still lags badly
---
Lmao damn what a champ. Generally speaking the agreement is that after you get R14 you don‚Äôt fuck everyone else out of it that helped you get there. Unless you have some vendetta against your play group.
---
Unbelievable I was just thinking about refreshing my subscription. Thank god i saw this before!!
---
Actually our team yesterday as well killed Ragnaros for the first time after so many tries in previous weeks. Dat feeling was amazing, proud of all the guys so much and... it dropped 2x hunter legs and fire relfc trinket. Like fuck you firelord!
---
Yup, all these QQers can take one for the team!
---
Stating +5 scales your BS/Ambush isn't saying they also don't scale off of AP man.  He's explaining why people use +5 on MH.  You are splitting hairs looking for a reason to argue.  Ridiculous

I think you are just used to warriors who are shit, hunters are definitely tier 2 dps. 
---
You should know that I am talking from a horde perspective, with windfury. If you are playing alliance I imagine the situation may be a little bit different.
---
Sadly rogues are one of the worst classes for team fights. If you open a healer or CC them you‚Äôll likely be nuked immediately, so your best role IMO is killing people on outskirts, punish players that push too far in by stun locking them there, or ambushing sitting players that are eating/drinking behind their group since it‚Äôs an auto Crit and usually guaranteed kill
---
&gt; As you can see, rank 13 to rank 14 takes alot longer then the lower ranks and this is because of the decay. It is literally impossible to reach rank 14 unless you are the top 0.3% of players for these last 3 weeks.
---
I'm confused. Why do people think this is a bad thing? Everything loses its value when everyone can easily do it. Rank 14 should be rare as hell, achieved by the best or the absolutely insane.
---
These things might not matter in retail, but Classic is a much more social game. I think these are proper achievements that one can be proud of.
---
Earth shock is threat generation, not taunt.
---
ES only works if it over-powers the 1.1 or 1.3x multiplier for pulling threat from people in range/melee respectively. Usually easy to pull off a healer, but often wont work if a mob is meleeing a melee dps. Taunt just works and ignores threat entirely.
---
Does it? When did that occur because just the other day it was clearly following the 1 hour reset
---
Genius.
---
Have you tried finding a guild so you have people to talk to when running MC instead of playing classic like retail where everyone is a nameless bot you have no reason to talk too? Classic is a social game, if your not socializing and your getting bored that's your fault, I run with my guild and never have a point where I'm bored because of the people, so who cares if i have a 0.5% at loot when I'm having fun and laughing at the stupid shit said over voice.
---
Dunno why people dismiss this argument so fast. It's kinda tiring to see all those comment comparing classic to pservers when it doesn't seem technically comparable.
---
I'm so with you on this one /u/AEnoch29. Also what is this with people calling response time for "lag". The number displayed in miliseconds are the time it takes for the client to send a request to the server, and the server to send a response to the client - equals response time. As long as the response time is within reason, and is stable, a game like world of warcraft is in no position to be critically unavailable.
---
Once you start introducing packet loss, you generate the "lag". "Lag" is when the game client does not receive the answer from the server fast enough OR in the correct order.... YES internet im looking at you, if you got a general understanding of how network and therefore the internet works, you would know why you see people skipping around. Let me introduce you to the mere protocol used, UDP/IP, soon to be 50 years old and is still by this day, using the same principals as back then.  This protocol gives a flying f.... to when packets are received, as long as the sender and receiver is correct. So in short, once A LOT of clients sends data and receives data, packets tends to get lost/dropped. Therefore newer games got these "lag" tolerances build in, to predict where the players are in the world and what actions they take (there are quite a few videos explaining this around CS:GO that is actually really good, e.g. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EwaW2iz4iA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EwaW2iz4iA)).
---
Oh and a note, if the packet is lost or dropped, the client asks for a new one, no problem - which gives more packets soon to be dropped. The joy...
---
So back to WOW and why you experience "lag" as a player once in an area with a lot of people. Its simple, your client gets a massive amount of requests on location and other information that it needs to process at the same time. and the same happens the other way, and not only from you to the server, but from you to other players and vise versa. So the more people around the more requests, the more packets are send and voila packet drop, "lag" and game over.
---
Is this a flaw in the game? maybe. Can this be fixed? definitely. But there is just soooo many factors around this that affect the so called "lag" that it is hard to give a concluded answer on how to fix it. And this is not the first time i hear about a game getting "laggy" due to network traffic being too much, and definitely not the last time either. I'm most confident that blizzard are to address this issue, or not, depending on the effort/reward side of it. But one thing is curtain - if one wants to break the game, one sure can by simply doing stuff that its not supposed to.
---
Edit: typos, side note, and all the other usual jazz.
---
My guild has a shaman tank for MC/Ony. Its definitely do able for most fights and is more than do able for dungeons.
---
Currently trying to resist going and making a tanking set myself (also shaman).
---
on my server is 6-700g :| i cant be bothered to farm DM, i'd rather mindlessly farm essences while i'm watching something
---
at this point its become a sort of completionist thing lol i feel compelled to get it myself.  dont even really care about the attack speed upgrade
---
Sentences where context is important!!
---
In Vanilla people didn't clear MC as fast, and not as many people cleared MC period
---
I play on Stalagg and it has been an enjoyable server so far. No more queues but still very populated. There is a bit of an imbalance with favor to horde, like 60-40, but I think a lot of servers struggle with that. I will say that if you choose to try Stalagg and are looking for a guild to stay away from ‚ÄúCrustacean Gang‚Äù as I‚Äôve heard multiple people say that they steal loot.
---
As someone with terrible luck, fuck strath live. I've never seen more than one orb in a run, and even then I feel lucky when one drops. Every farm group I've been in tells me how terrible the drop rate is this time and falls apart after a few runs. How can I have so many runs that drop no orbs, but other people get them consistently?
---
Are the small numbers representing number of weeks?  Like I would need to be in the top 22.80 percentile to get Rank 3 in one week, am I reading that right?
---
Well that‚Äôs the classic experience !
---
I cosign this site.
---
So realistically if you PvP like 10 hours the first week is there an estimate on what tank you would be on first reset?
---
What a cute boy! He looks like he loves to cuddle.
---
This is indeed very helpful. Side question:
---
How do you complete your Warrior quests at the available levels? I just got the level 20 quest chain and it needs me to kill a level 34 boss in RFK? And I saw the WW Axe chain also needs me to kill overlevel mobs. Do you pay people for help or do you just grin and bare it?
---
"Never". I played several community hosted servers in the last 5 years that could handle massive pvp just fine.
---
15 years in fact
---
Man you're asking blizzard for the impossible, they have never been able to get the coding right to support a full blown 40v40 let alone a server wide fight which could number in the thousands
---
I'm a developer who works in security. There is no reason to believe that increasing security decreases speed. That is deliberate disinformation.
---
The guy you are replying is implying that fielding the mininum amount for a raid disqualifies you as a small guild which makes no fucking sense
---
How do you equip in combat though?
---
The first week when people are gearing up. 
---
Its really impossible to compare because retail has so many sources of gear and catchup stuff.
---
Oh no Loch Ness Monster - you ain't getting my three fitty

Bring a lot of food and arrows, listen closely on what the lead is saying, enjoy yourself
---
PvP in classic is absolute cancer imo. Just some of the least balanced stuff you will ever see. Not to mention you have to respec for it. I already have 2 60's and a 50. There just isn't much left to do until BWL.
---
Weapons can change during combat, not armor.
---
In large-scale wPVP rogues are typically cannon fodder.
---
Wow.... Thank you lol!!!  I'm currently lvling Gnome Engineering and planned to swap to Goblin.  So you're saying I should complete "Show Your Work"?  Then I would be able to switch?
---
Best result
---
Yep I agreed that it wasn‚Äôt as bad, but just not picture perfect, launch was smooth but they still had server glitches/noticeable lag
---
yea requiring someone to have no life to achieve something is not a bad thing
---
Pservers also made the game from scratch with guesses and weren't held to #nochanges while Blizzard is trying to copy the exact way the game worked.
---
Are we going to pretend that healers use any mana pots let alone 5 an hour. If it's a bad run I might use 5 in mc. Something has to go real fucking wrong for a mana pot to be popped in a dungeon.
---
Because u made a spec that basically abuses the mechanic.  You don't need to use that spec though.  Other specs are just as good, and don't get anywhere near that kind of benefit.
---
That's assuming that number isn't insane hyperbole that you almost certainly pulled out of your ass.
---
Depends on what you want to do.  Ret paladins can tank OK while leveling because of righteous fury but you will struggle to keep everything on you without consecrate (holy) or improved righteous fury (prot).  Ret is more of a solo-play leveling or PVP spec.
---
I'm not gonna call this a repost, I'm gonna call this what it really is, a 12+ year old copypasta. It'd be like if someone posted the "Paladin time is meant for surfing porn" post from the old WoW forums.
---
many did, many will
---
nostalgia fades and ppl start to be annoyed by such things
---
Hmmm I did not realize that could be done. Assumed completing own would lock you of of the other. Or is it a matter of having both in your quest log at once, turning in one, then resetting before completing the other?
---
Chug a free action potion, use any snare break and make that mage regret not immediately hiding. 
---
Being able to hard counter nearly all of their CC for 50 silver is hilarious.
---
&gt;I just don't feel that Retail will ever get fixed by engaging in bold and risky changes to move away from the action-RPG vibes back into the RPG elements
---
And you are right I think. Classic+ or TBC+ is where blizzard can improve the hard RPG formula and being able to fullfill both side of the community. Retail player are not at all hard rpg fan now but more new generation of instant and fast paced action. And it's fine.
---
Haha you definatly do, the UBRS buff is only 83. You need atleast 80 unbuffed being a DPS. I'm a tank and I need atleast 200+. If you're killing rag with 83 Resist please show me.
---
And in other new the mass murder has been taken into custody. While he was told if his right to remain silent he just kept shouting "did I get rank 14?" Over and over again.
---
I knew that about the beast thing but I definitely did not know I couldn't be in combat. Most of them open with blind though. I normally heal then skin in bear form so I can at least try to kill them if they steal it. Thanks for the advice.
---
Wait you had fun gaming!?.... perfect!
---
Tanking both as fury is entirely viable at least. Most would say its better even.
---
It only requires to have less life than anyone else
---
I am a tank :P
---
Ones with more dps and less healers, and near chain pulling.
---
Just started a 5 man shammy team, loving it so far :)
---
Maybe blizzard is tired of your shit. They are extremely understaffed for support. How about reporting really game breaking shit and not what your sensibilities have a baby fit with.
---
In other words grow the fuck up.
---
EDIT: For anyone that missed it.
---
&gt; I play on an RP-PvP server and occasionally report extremely odd named. (Eg. Slayerxxx,Killerboy, etc...)
---
&gt; However, I notice EVERY TIME i report someone for a Non-RP Name, I get disconnected and sent to the login screen. Anyone else experiencing this?
---
&gt; Thanks all in advance.
---
&gt;
---
It‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt *really* want it to work. They don‚Äôt want to admit they were wrong. The idea is to get people so fed up that they go back to retail.
---
Krom is the east coast RPPvP server right? I've heard pretty good things. Are there plenty of progression raid guilds and a decent population on both sides?
---
Thank you. Finally a response from someone who understands how networks and the internet works.
---
Thanks brother !!
---
Calm down there slugger
---
What's your words per minute?
---
I'd totally gear up to tank, I could pick up off pieces while healing (should be easy since it doesn't conflict with warrior gearing really). You need to overgear instances to do it endgame, but hey if it's a hobby that's fine.
---
The issue being I'm not nearly invested enough to do the 50g respec swap between hybrid healing/dps for raids and enh tanking for 5 man.
---
Simply Google classic add-ons. Cursedforge is a good site. Alternatively, you can install and update addons using the twitch app. 
---
The twitch app does literally everything besides choosing on its own, I recommend it. 
---
In case you wonder, there is a folder in classic/interface/addons where the addons will be placed either way you get them
---
Expert research.
---
Excuse me was this peer reviewed?
---
PS: nerf paladins, HoJ duration is OP :( end of joke
---
You're supposed to be able to train 225 engineering -&gt; learn gobblin specilization -&gt; craft all the gadgets -&gt; unlearn engineering -&gt; retrain to 225 -&gt; read a book in tanaris and then learn goblin engineering to get the bombs as well
---
Leatrix Plus has an option to enhance profession/quest/trainer windows, makes them much better.
---
Try checking any of the good spots in off hours. Water essences place in epl is often empty for me or just has another person.
---
Here‚Äôs a hot take, spamming all your aoe abilities until you die is not fun, and I‚Äôm glad it isn‚Äôt going to work.
---
ClassicCastBars on the twitch desktop app. Will show the dots you have applied, with timers counting down, on your target just right above your actionbar. :)
---
Nice setup, but i hate multiboxers because it makes the world feel smaller and it worsens the social environment.
---
Spend tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars and years upon years rearchitecturing and rewriting the server
---
Yeah, that's how it should work. I didn't complete show your work which bugged it for my character and now I cannot learn either specilization anymore.
---
Can‚Äôt think of anything more vanilla tbh
---
Tanking isn't about surviving, it's about making sure every mob in combat hates you enough to beat on you.
---
That requires hitting everyone with abilities and damage.
---
That requires rage and access to your full set of abilities in all stances.
---
Their engineers probably aren't, but the project managers in charge of what money gets spent on? 100%
---
Making a point that not everyone who plays hardcore wow is a basement dwelling neckbeard. If you read the chain you may have picked up on that, instead, you got *T R I G G E R E D*.
---
Well you should be able to switch even without completing it, but seems like there is a bug that can happen if you don't complete it.
---
The battles are awesome, especially BRM. Going in as an organized guild is so fun and I like planned pvp events but god damn every spot for any item worth gold is always camped by horde. I dont mind setting an odd alarm at 2am to farm arcane crystals but even when I fish for winter squid I get levitating shadow priests camping the essence of water pools killing me, every enchant drop is occupied by a party of 2-3 horde, I'm lucky I hit 60 early and just farmed enough felcloth for my epic mount because I'd have no patience for this shit and I love pvp.
---
Also I love the idea of having imp sprint for PvP for casters and hunters
---
Honestly it is *possible* that they actually can‚Äôt fix it.  What they need to do is understand that enough of their customers are technical enough to st least understand some basics in programming, and make a public *technical* statement as to why this is an issue that is not easily solved.  Notice the emphasis on technical, and not *PR*.
---
I‚Äôd be fine if they gave us a realistic reason on why their engine chokes with so much going on, or why their architecture actually can‚Äôt handle it - it‚Äôs possible.  Just don‚Äôt treat us like ignorant fools and pretend silence or PR spins are a good way to deal with it.

If you are talking about those zergfests, then you have no role.  The only ppl that matter are mages and healers.

Luckily that won't be the norm.
---
Dude I play 3 hours almost every night after work, and even I miss the days I could play wow non-stop!
---
Not only that, but Look at how fast BWL and MC bosses were killed.
---
The world first BWL kills were within a few days, barring Nef. MC is a similiar story, with most of the bosses falling within days of eachother, except the last few.
---
Hello fellow Paglet!
---
They can figure it out, it's just whether they predicted they would have to pay for it. Based on the quarterly earnings call from last year we found out two things. Because they barely mentioned Classic WoW to investors before the release, they expected it to be a bust. Secondly, based on their annual revenue, even with an additional 1 million subscribers, it would only be a 2.4% increase in their annual revenue.
---
Classic WoW, as much of an amazing game it is, does not make any money for ActiBlizzard especially because it is offered with their retail subscription. It probably won't create even a million new subscribers. Their goal is to retain players, and hope you visit retail to spend money on micro-transactions. So, sadly, even though they deployed Classic WoW relatively well based on expectations of the current company, I doubt they will be putting almost any money into it unless absolutely necessary.
---
Skinning herbalism is a good combo, alternatively herbalism/alchemy. Additionally you want an alt with disenchantjng for a little bit extra money from greens.
---
So your preference would be for them to spend their time mining and fishing instead of running people through dungeons, lowering the supply of tanks even further?
---
It's going to be a problem even on low pop servers. The game currently can't even handle 40v40 very well...
---
I only enjoy pve so I kept my tailoring on priest. The small income from mooncloth transmute is nice.
---
First of all thank you! So it dont matter how much my pet Fights, it doesnt Upgrade their abilities, am I right? (besides the ability from the pet Trainer) So every few levels i gotta do these tame and train mechanic?
---
What private servers have been doing with far less players on their servers********
---
There I fixed it for you.
---
1. Using your basic stunlock will win you most fights (CS-&gt;SS/Hemo-&gt;Gouge-&gt;KS-&gt;Blind-&gt;Sap-&gt;repeat)
---
2. Learn your match-ups. E.g. vs mage you are very unlikely to win w/o you cds, vs pala you're fighting against their mana bar, not health bar so you shouldn't try bursting them, etc. etc. Every class requires different tactics.
---
3. Use NugEnergy or similar energy tick addon. It basically provides 20 free energy each time you open, if you open correctly. Also, it's the same ticks for health regeneration/eating, which can also be useful.
---
Congrats on the kill buddy. It feels good to accomplish your goals in this game.
---
Does anyone know what the respawn timers on the world bosses are? I‚Äôve seen different responses.
---
I think it's actually broken in how they implemented it, too, though. 
---
Some things execute that should have been gone from the batch. You can often get hit by stunnned/CC'd mobs for isntance.
---
Since I haven't had charge or thunderclap, I always start a fight with 25ish rage from Bloodrage which has made it so I can use one, maybe two abilities in the first tick of combat (which I usually do demo shout as an opener and a sunder on whoever is skulled. After that though I am immediately losing aggro because in the time I get 1 hit in (5 rage) the party has already chunked the mob for a third of its HP. I can taunt and maybe  hit another sunder or two before everyone's panicking and running around like chickens with their heads cut off and leave me chasing them around the room.   
---
I don't use demo shout much but people have said battle shout generates more threat than thunderclap so I've been trying that and I still was unable to keep up with how much threat people are getting  
---
I mean obviously now I'm going to respec and throw everything in the trash and relearn to tank-- this is just how it's been going.
---
I would recommend owls, wind serpents, boars or gorillas depending on situation if you want something other than a kitty. 
---
BT is only the best for pushback against casters who struggle against it. In PvP there are a ton of situations where a specific pet ability can be amazing.
---
Also does anybody in this thread know if Takk the leaper or w/e its name was is around and worth taming?
---
I have anecdotal evidence that disproves this. More than once I've left a flight path microseconds before/after someone and often have conversations as we travel together.  
---
Also more than once, a player that was a few yards behind me has caught and passed me while flying. And the only explanation we could suffice was his Carrot equipped. I think further testing is in order.  
---
Are return flights always the same length as the original trip? Or should OP have tested the same route with Flight A and Flight B?
---
It‚Äôs not an axe I would spend 300g on. I think half that price is a bit more realistic. Maybe 200g
---
Don't worry the reviewer will ask you to quote 15 of their unrelated publications.
---
What is your goal?  If you want to tank, you can skip SoC all together.
---
Don‚Äôt hate someone simply because they have wealth. There‚Äôs nothing inherently bad about billionaires.
---
I guess every realm is an RP realm, RPing that classic isn't bad.
---
Thanks for the projection. From what I saw however, most of the effort to reach high brackets are made when your rank is quite high already.
---
In other words, don‚Äôt try to reach bracket 14 each week especially in the beginning, it‚Äôs not good for your health and the decay will not change too much in the beginning
---
Why haven't you cancelled your subscription? Money talks.
---
What profs are you?  If you're a miner, I'll PM a good spot to farm.  Just went from 450-1k gold in the last week farming this area, but being able to hit the Rich Thor that spawns is a big part of it.
---
So I got OEB a while back and went 2h fury. I actually do pretty well against the DW. It‚Äôs pretty rough with out world buffs. The main thing I wanted to share is that slam should be avoided at this stage in the game. You just don‚Äôt get enough rage generation to use it very often and with the fights being so short in MC it makes it even less used. Put the points into execute and what ever else you like but slam will end up being a waste of talent points.
---
Plenty dude. The same game on private servers did a much better job, and many have posted evidence of such. Besides which there are any other mmo, planetfall for one, and things like battlefield etc
---
I don't think it's OP that needs to grow the fuck up. RP servers are meant to have RP names, but your bad attitude is petulant.
---
You sure that was the servers and not peoples bad computers and internet connections?
---
Both of our opinions are lopsided with bias. I have the love of farming as much as the next guy, trust me. 
---
But on a high pop pvp server as mine, there is not much benefit to risking the time in the cold snows on a sinew some people get theirs under an hour and others have farmed insane amounts more than you or I and still not seen it once. 
---
Just based off the classic discord, you could be doing a lot more with your time. Farming, alt leveling, pvp, all kinds of stuff to do or shenanigans and so forth. 
---
If i had been on pve or low pop I‚Äôd probably have stubbornly sat there til it dropped but it is a completely bad drop rate. It‚Äôs reported to be unknown of the true rate but it‚Äôs something like 0.5% or less and then add competition from other hunters or pvp interruptions and you have a recipe for misery you don‚Äôt need to put yourself through. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even tell hunters i hate to farm it lol
---
Get serathil if it‚Äôs less than 100g, doubles as a tanking axe. I got that a few days ago after being in the same boat as you and seeing nothing else drop.
---
DW deathbringers is the dream. If other warriors are spending DKP on 2 handers (which we‚Äôve also seen zero of) it‚Äôs plausible you end up with first 2 deathbringer as an orc fury.
---
Edit: if you‚Äôre loot council isn‚Äôt stupid enough to give them to tanks.
---
lol the people on shitty computers in 2005 think this is how it was cause they were always watching a slide-show anyhow.
---
Such a unique post. Sure haven't been 5009 of these already. What a unique, amazing, and totally not lazy contribution.
---
Which 3 buttons and why. Thats the thing.
---
youre putting your current knowledge of knowing what the rotation is and applying it to a brand new player.
---
Most players dont know how to do the most BASIC functions in the game when they start and the game is so easy content wise you dont need to know your rotation to level you can smash your face on the keyboard and kill shit.
---
I think you underestimate how casual the majority of the playerbase actually is
---
If all 1000 players are in the same place, the movements of 1 player need to be communicated to all 999 other players.
---
If you're alone, it doesn't need to send anything to other players at all.
---
Let's say there is a big raid with 1000 people and you do  a frost nova attack as mage. The server now needs to check the distance between you and 999 other people. That's actually a really expensive operation. So if you have a fight with 1000 mages spamming AoE abilities, you need to calculate 1000 times the distance to \~1000 other players, which is a million distance computations. If they are spread out in 20 clumps of 50 mages, you only need to perform 50\*50\*20 = 50k distance calculations, literally 20 times less than if they're bunched up. 50 clumps of 20 mages: 20\*20\*50 = 20k, just 2% of the load.
---
As you can see, the more clumped up players are, the worse it gets. The rule for this example is that if you double the amount of players in a spot, the load quadruples.
---
It's not about hatred, it's purely utilitarian, it's about making a better society.
---
Guild must be &lt;I had a stroke&gt;
---
It's almost like we've already seen the 40,000 other posts about the servers in regards to phase 2 already. We get it loser.
---
Thank you badgirl72 :)
---
In that case, I can be a bit cold, but I'd be looking for any replacements. If they knowingly kept questing, it's on them. There's got to be some people around the BRD entrance or BRD chat that wants to do the run again.
---
Stormwind isn't the alliance capital in classic. Well, in game lore says it is, but players disagree and hang out in ironforge due to its more convenient location. Go there and report back on your findings during peak times.
---
Yes. Especially hunter PvP.
---
Nice guild name! I used to run JamaicanBobsledTeam on pservers
---
...You didn‚Äôt think you could sap?
---
Yes I am.
---
Any of the "large scale world pvp" lagged like a motherfucker in vanilla like it apparently does now as well.  People are comparing it to private servers which had an entirely different method of processing the information, and one which is a much larger security hazard.
---
They aren't comparing classic to vanilla, they are comparing classic to private.
---
Mind getting me their gear list?
---
ohhhh i was under the impression that everyone hit by the fireball got his aggro reset?

---
Was this not the authentic wow classic experience you wanted?
---
Elvui I‚Äôm able to move that stuff there but like the top comment there are plenty of weakauras out there
---
People leveling late in the game complained that the open world was dead. No players around to help with elite quests which were a major part of Vanilla/BC. People asked to either dumb down all the elite quests, remove them or find a solution to all the dead lowbie zones. So blizz implemented cross realm phasing that completely destroyed any sense of community for the sake of catering to new sources of revenue/new players. They thought they could please hardcore raiders and casual lowbie levelers at the same time but really didn't understand the basics of their own game community.
---
I played a Tauren enhancement shaman in vanilla and made high warlord. Perhaps it is not ultra ideal but I never missed not being an orc and war stomp can truly be a god send, as someone mentioned above.

It's not "hard" to achieve, it's just extremely bad for both your mental, social and physical health. It's also an incentive for the players to "cheat" by sharing their accounts. This is a terrible game mechanic, any game designer will tell you that.
---
fuck multiboxing
---
I play on both of those servers actually. Herod leans very heavily towards horde for population, and is still layered so once p2 hits that's something to keep in mind.
---
Grobb is one of the most balanced servers I believe, it usually sits at a "high" pop on login, and has a rich wpvp rp community if you take the time to find it. As it was originally the only rp-pvp server in NA there is a weird mix of rp and non-rp that happens and honestly a big part of the enjoyment of the server for me is watching that interaction go down.
---
You also need to have the same target at the start and end of the summoning cast. If people stop clicking, it should take change much.
---
Zandalar Tribe?
---
That's a firm lookin' cat.
---
Private servers could handle bigger battles. Hurray for blizzard modern microserver infrastructure
---
"Yeah, that seems kind of reasonable for younger gamers. Parents should really be setting limits like that for children anyway."
---
Then I saw that "young gamers" is until age 18, not until age 12 or something lol.
---
was this last night?? because i dinged 40 at that spot/near that spot last night.
---
edit: nvm im a hunter, didnt see it was a warrior.
---
You did def not play in vanilla if you say that.
---
Typque /clique or simply open your spellbook. If nothing displays, you didn't install Clique correctly.
---
I'm just speaking from my professional life here, every time we add a check to something on the backend, there's a performance cascade. Something like wow is extremely hard to prallelize for these aspects, so it makes sense that this is where the problem is grounded.
---
Wasn't it always like the third one?
---
Slam didnt have an extra auto attack on any private server. What are you talking about?
---
However, Slam does proc windfury if you have 1/5 or more in imp slam, which it did not do on private servers. This actually makes it better than private servers.  
---
Please don't just make shit up about private servers you didnt play on. None of them had slam doing an extra auto attack.  
---
Slam is the ONLY way to make 2h viable on Alliance.
---
For bosses like Garr/Domo where you're constantly switching targets, managing combo points better can greatly increase your DPS. For onyxia, kill as many whelps as you can without stacking on people too much. If you get hit by a fireball solo, congrats, your threat just got wiped.
---
The operative word there being "giant."  Time dilation doesn't kick in until you have a significant number of ships involved.

Trade Skills Master. If you're interested in using this amazing addon you also need to download the Desktop Suite. Its mainly an auctioning addon but it does revamp the crafting windows too, it all shows a handy profit calculator which lets you show what items you can craft are selling on AH for.

Edited :)
---
Ever stop to consider that maybe English isn't their first language?
---
This is, quite literally the classic experience.
---
Wasn't sure where else I could vent this, but as a druid main from private servers and now in classic, why are druids being shunted so much from a raiding perspective? I am seeing main raids, or people pushing for content, running effectively 2 druids, 1 resto and 1 feral to help tank or dps or heal depending on the situation.
---
Makes me sad to see, but as always, I guess i should have rolled a shaman.
---
You start preparing your consumables for aq
---
Yeah blackrock will be absolutely carnage. 
---
I imagine a lot of pug city raids will go on for a few days too.
---
Kargath and Hillsbrad.
---
I FUCKING LOVE COCAINE!
---
Slam is better for both horde and alliance than hamstring. You just need to actually be good at the game. Hamstring is for brain dead play.
---
There is no way you could limit server sizes to not have this issue.  All other aspects of the server would be nearly unplayable because there'd be no one on the server.
---
what afdom is that when you have your ice barrier up?
---
Do druids have any options if they pull aggro while healing an instance, something like fade? Ran a few instances yesterday and it seemed like if I get a mob on me and no one pulls it off, pretty much just die. Do most druids shift into bear and stun and run or root, or just hope their tanks or someone in their group takes aggro off you, and die otherwise?
---

nevermind...
---
\+5 weapon skill means you have a weapon skill of a level 61, so you do not take additional penalties for being level 60 vs a level 61. Being at 305(level 61) you would still have penalties vs things higher than you(62 &amp; 63) so you would need additional +hit% for each level above you.
---
That's not what he said, so this comment is entirely useless.

Theres no communication. They could be working on it, no one knows. But that's the issue. No one knows!

Thank you /u/flyingWall121, ofc I ment UDP. Corrected above, and sorry.

All games uses P2P in some degree - directly or not. Your client needs to process some amount of requests and based on the complexity and the size of it, you would get the result or no result, if it gets dropped :D

That's...not how networking works at all.

The problem is the number of packets going in and out of the server. The server is a singular chokepoint for *all* traffic. It's not just 160 characters that it has to deal with, it's *every* player that is logged in (1000s).
---
Not only do they have to process all that network traffic, they then have to process all the player interactions. It's easy when players are scattered in the world because they are considered non-interactions (using something like a quad-tree) but it gets *extremely* more complex when players are grouped up because they *have* to check the interactions. That's why they limited logins on release day, because everyone was grouped up. Once the mass of players started spreading, they were able to increase the server limits because their is less localized interactions to process.
---
For healer priests, is Hammer of Grace + Brightly Glowing Stone objectively better than Guiding Stave of Wisdom? Or does the spirit/frost res/slight stam make the stave better? Trying to decide which to enchant/use because I don't think I'll be getting benediction anytime soon
---
Currently skinning/leatherworking, but skinning stuff to make leather is pretty time-consuming, and leatherworking at 120 isn't all that profitable at the moment. I figure I'll probably just pause the leatherworking, sell the skins, and just work on LW after 60. Was really hoping to level it for upgrades during the leveling process, but that isn't working out too well.
---
I use Adobe Premiere Pro but you can do this with Vegas Pro, I actually prefer Vegas but fancied learning Premiere.
---
I think Vegas is easier to navigate around and is just as good tbh, so you could try that :^)
---
You don't need to respect to prot just yet. I tanked BRD full runs fine in arms, but make sure to switch to sword and board for anything Anger onward. Personally, around 58 is when I went prot for end game dungeons, and then you can run as that until you may/may not want to switch to fury when you have enough items to support it.
---
Oh, yeah. Classic is so much easier and casual-friendly, and that's great. It's nice to relax after some stressful high keys, turn my brain off and faceroll through the weekly Molten Core, or really any of the PvE content.
---
Sorry to hear you don't have any friends to run real difficulties with, though. The people you meet in LFD really are the dregs, haha.
---
They probably didn't think you were joking about only hitting rank 13, they probably meant they thought you yourself were in fact, a joke.
---
How have you kept that name?
---
Cat form has cower, but it's not very strong,  best bet is to run towards the tank.
---
If you do multiple /cast instead of just one, you can change stance and use the ability in one button press rather than two. Example:
---
/Cast [nostance:2] defensive stance
---
/Cast [stance:2] shield bash
---
FR helps ofc, but it is far from mandatory if the raid knows what they are doing. UBRS buff plus fire res pot will be sufficient in many cases
---
I‚Äôm not saying your character doesn‚Äôt have a GUID. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs not the GUID that would increment, it‚Äôs an ID within the GUID that would increment
---
Edit: Looking at the documentation, it‚Äôs the UID that is incrementing. Comparing the GUID is currently working since it compares the server ID before the UID, so &lt;&gt; actual provides the correct result for UID &lt;&gt;
---
If you think Blizzard would waste money developing classic to prove a community wrong you're a complete moron. I'm not saying shit's not broken, but seriously use some critical thinking before you spout out nonsense.
---
Damn I thought this issue was with my mouse, it's an in game issue? Saving this post, thank you
---
Thank you. My enchanting is around 265 if I'm not mistaken. I'll drop it and get herb for now. Hope it's not too pain go get it to 300 for DM:E
---
It does require effort to get a mount at 40, but it is fully achieveable. Keep your gathering-skills on par with your leveling areas and avoid buying unnecessary gear and skills. You will gain more gold-momentum the further you level, so don't worry that much when you're only 16. Make sure to use that ah to your advantage and sell as much as possible there instead of defaulting to vendors. Maybe take 30 min of gathering a day once you cross the 30:s, and look up where you can perform optimal gathering.
---
Blizzard shill?
---
This is a great looking build. Couple of last questions then I'll stop bugging you.
---
First, what aura do you generally use? 
---
Second, I'm a little bit tempted by improved hammer of justice, especially with phase 2 coming up, what are your thoughts on that one?
---
Third, how often do you spam GBoK, and who do you spam it on? (Or do you use a different greater blessing to generate threat?)
---
hell no, stop spreading bullshit
---
okay perfect
---
I have zero interest in retail, I just learned there is a new xpac coming out, don't know when or what it is about. I don't care about retail.
---
Quiet, I need my lag excuse for losing pvp battles
---
Jk
---
9% hit cap is for when there's more than 10 difference between your weapon skill and the target's defense level.  It applies to any level 63 mob, not just bosses.  There's a lot of level 63 trash mobs in MC.
---
yep sell the skins, farm and sell you will get gold quick. Once you get forty start working on lw. it is a waste to use lw for upgrades, you'll get plenty from dungeons. I did this on my priest and made a huge chunk of gold wish i had it from day one.
---
Use entangling roots if possible, otherwise throw some hots on your self and shift in to bear while heading to the tank.  
---
You also have Hibernate for dragonkin and beasts.
---
Getting buffs in Mograine alliance is laggy as fuck, I could be clicking a mage portal to IF after the SW buffs for a solid 2 minutes and nothing in my screen will even move. Then interacting with flightmaster in IF is also a terrible experience. Every week is the same.
---
Help doing more damage in raid! Mage
---
This is my first time ever w/ wow and mc, and I‚Äôm getting kind of discouraged.
---
I have half of my bis but I‚Äôm still doing much lower damage than most other mages most times.
---
I re-specced to frost/arcane this week and it was a bit better? But I‚Äôm still about 10000 less in dps.
---
Any suggestions, maybe stuff I can purchase? I just want to be much more helpful. :p
---
We need to know everything they're working on from the get go
---
I don‚Äôt think people understand that the only thing classic has in common with private servers is the client. Private server operators reverse engineered a sever that worked with the client. This server has nothing to do with the server blizzard runs. 
---
This argument bugs me so much because the people parroting it have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about. Building a server for Classic isn‚Äôt just a matter of whether or not it works. There are significantly more concerns Blizzard needs to address to have a working server than a community project where an MVP is also a playable game.
---
Think about all the cheat protection that‚Äôs gone into WOW for the last 15 years. Think about all the support tools that have been written, like automatic item and character restoration feature via a web interface. Think about the fact that running infrastructure costs money and sometimes you have to pick solutions with trade offs. 
---
You‚Äôre talking about 15+ years of engine development that was bastardized to run a version of the game from 12 years ago. They didn‚Äôt spend the last 15 years thinking ‚Äúwe should fix all this shit so we can release vanilla again.‚Äù
---
Classic hasn‚Äôt been perfect but the developers have shown themselves to be be competent. Maybe let‚Äôs give them a chance because they‚Äôre pretty good at responding to problems, they just don‚Äôt make a big hubbub about it.
---
No, it just makes it so that you can start casting pyroblast and in the meantime go watch a couple YouTube videos while you wait.
---
Also, everyone will be walking slower than RP walking.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
I always have my weak auras around my character so I have everything in front of me and don't have to turn my attention away from the fight in order to check my cds and such
---
Blizzard doesn't want classic to survive. 
---
We all know this. 
---
They are spending as little money as possible so we all either buy bfa/shadowlands or leave. 
---
I said from day one these servers would crash and burn once layers were removed because blizz cant handle how many players are on them at once and people all shouted that blizz wouldnt let that happen, if pservers run is basements could do it blizz could do it...
---
Should and will are not synonyms.
---
Well PVE gear is way better for pvp than rank 10 gear anyways, you don‚Äôt miss much. For 99% of players who‚Äôll never reach rank 13+ there nothing to gain by climbing the ladder. Even exalted pieces don‚Äôt require a specific rank
---
I think I'm gonna throw up.
---
There's always gotta be one of you "works on my machine" folks in ever thread I've seen about this. I've seen large scale wpvp raids bring my realm to its knees. But yeah, I'm sure that me and my guild who all live in different states with different ISPs all just happen to have terrible Internet. I'm sure the login servers crashing after an Alliance raid on UC was just because my Internet sucks. It's all making sense now.
---
Wait if you get to rank 14 somhow, do you get to keep title and weapon if you then fall down in the rankings?
---
I think people are forgetting all the times they got stuck in instances because the world server crashed. Hasn't happened to me once in classic though!
---
cant crit if you have so much crit and very little hit you mean.  its not a 2 roll system
---
I did not expect advice when initially commenting, but I'm glad you guys have offered it, however. Thank you. Classic community has been wonderful so far.
---
Flurry axe is overrated...you can't use elemental sharp stone on a 40 wep. Get bone slicing hatchet for the offhand. No way i would pay 400g for that shit.
---
Mages: tag all of the spawns and leave nothing for anyone else
---
Mages: all of the spawns should belong to me at all times if I‚Äôm there AOE grinding because I‚Äôm a mage life isn‚Äôt fair
---
Why are mages always so entitled lmao. I love watching y‚Äôall die when you pull too many mobs thinking you have a big dick knowing full well I could put a heal on you and not doing it.
---
OSRS also has way simple input and data than WoW.
---
One of my alts in vanilla was an enhancement shaman, I found it extremely fun. Not sure if I like the same things as others, but I loved dropping searing totem, other totems (defense,) and using the whole toolkit. Also that's the first character I had that was a good cook, and I had a lot of buffs most of the time.
---
It seems that you're doubting that they're even a good class. You seem to know that they give great support with totems but still feel that the individual numbers are all that matter. I just want to say to make sure you're analyzing it right. Druids get can get upset when they have to innervate a priest and not themselves, but don't forget how powerful it is to innervate a priest, and that is power that the druid provides just as much as the priest. On paper, giving windfury to a group of melee makes those melee look a lot better, but in actually it's the shaman that provided a ton of power. That's not all a shaman is - I think people are pointing that out, maybe detecting that you're not including it as part of their power and the big (dps) value added of a class with that kind of support in the toolkit.
---
Yet
---
[Looks fine to me](https://i.imgur.com/xwEnn8H.jpg)
---
In vanilla my friend tanked MC as an enhance shaman.
---
I mean, we were naxx geared and thought it would be funny to see it but it happened.
---
It's definitely different and I'm not even fully used to it myself. I do still switch back to the WoW one if I need to
---
Sounds like you should be playing on a PvE server.
---
Sounds nice, but would it be useful?
---
I hate to bring this up, but I worry about your methodology.
---
Should you not have compared flight paths going the same direction?  Given the wonky pathing of flights, I would not expect outgoing and return flights to take the same amount of time.
---
Thoughts?
---
Dude.... literally all your gripes would be non-existent on a PvE server and you could still do battlegrounds and such when they release. You suggesting ANOTHER server type that doesn't include dungeons is ridiculous.
---
maybe if we give them more money they will fix it
---
I honestly don't remember AV ever lagging like what we have now. Played a metric fuck ton of it too between classic and tbc.
---
Hell yeah it's blizzard fault. 
---
Never said otherwise the guys before was saying that every blizz employee should be ashamed when only few have the power allocate millions on server / software updates.
---
Ofc they have the means, but if they don't find it profitable I don't see them moving forward with something like this.
---
I'm glad you remember that
---
However this is 2019 they can deliver a playable game üòÇ
---
It has nothing to do with who's the best. Only has to do with who has the most time/least amount of responsibility. You could be the best PvP player on your server, or even the entire game, but if you work a 9-5 with a family you would never see R14. Not even close.
---
It's an achievement to how little life you have, and even then it's usually only because you waited in an organized line.
---
Lmfao that joke of a duel tourney that doesn't even let warlocks healthstone? Who cares
---
Those servers also aren't running on the same rules as classic.
---
One of, if not the, biggest reason people were excited for Classic, and Blizzard is about to completely ruin this for thousands and thousands of people. GG Blizz, GG.
---
Correct. \[nostance:1\] basically is saying if you're not already in Battle Stance, then cast Battle Stance. 2 correlates to Defensive Stance and 3 correlates to Berserker Stance.
---
Big privates had more people than classic ones yes
---
&gt;them telling you that they're working on it will have no affect on you.
---
C'mon man, how can you possibly be this dumb? You seriously think you're in any position to tell the playerbase at large "you will not feel any better to know that a major issue is being addressed"?
---
You legit might be the dumbest person I've talked to here...I'm going to go ahead and disable inbox replies in case whatever you have is contagious. Fucking lol.
---
The bonus applied from +healing is based on the spell being cast‚Äôs cast time. For spells with the same cast time, the spell that costs the least amount of mana will be the most mana efficient because it gets the same amount of bonus healing.
---
Do you also realize that dots begin damaging the target after 3 seconds? Dots dont do instant damage except for immolate. 3 seconds is more than enough time for a tank to consolidate aggro on a mob. 
---
Ideally shit goes like this: tank charges &amp; has 10 rage from TM then the tank get hit by the pack -&gt; gets more rage while lock is dottin 1st mob, lock follows tank targets &amp; dots 2nd mob etc... 
---
if the tank los pulls lock waits for tank to get 1st hit then dots up,... 
---
ive never pulled aggro by dotting up a pack &amp; then focusing down the 1st mob
---
DOT‚ÄôS TAKE TIME TO SET UP! 
---
Pack of 4 mob? Only using corruption &amp; CoA? Thats 8 globals, oh &amp; dont forget to LT inbetween cause 8 dots= oom
---
I highly doubt it can't be fixed. My running theory is that Blizzard actively Wats classic to fail so people will go back to retail. Have you noticed how they consider it a matter of pride that classic is "bad"? They hate it, they hate that people like it, and they want it 5 end. Not to mention the lack of MTX...
---
Obviously player skill needs taken into consideration, but Priests won almost 3/4 of their matches and Shaman/Warrior lost 2/3.
---
Yeah, I'm also calling shenanigans on the guy you replied to. Classic has been a much smoother playing experience than any private server I've played on, but especially Nost when it was pushing 18k players.
---
Just bartender and ZPerl, maybe also weakauras
---
lol no I picked mage

I apologize to everyone who is angry about seeing this ‚Äúagain.‚Äù I have been off of Reddit for a long time and off of WoW for easily 10 years. I didn‚Äôt know this was a reposted phrase. It was the first time I had heard it and this is my actual chat log.

I thought if you get top 1-2 ranks each week for 9 weeks you get rank 14 then.  You sure it will take 16+ resets?
---
Nice. Little carryover from retail
---
Gonna stop here too, you're entitled and it's sad.

I already can tank all 5 man with my tank gear. The problem is not being able to play with my main set outside of raids.

Swap to Arcanite reaper server. There's nobody even there!

I mean, the honor system comes out next week so PvPing will feel more rewarding.. so maybe wait till Tuesday and you will begin to enjoy it/see the things you were expecting? Phase 1 is the "farming" phase.

It's likely he doesnt have his mount money and is just eager to respec for Mortal Strike.

You can also use abolish poisen for blind

To be fair,  lot of dps classes want stuff from live runs and tanks + healers need nothing and we can't grind like dps can.
---
I got a tank buddy and we will sometimes do lf3m dps for live strath, orbs res.
---
Found the Warlock!
---
Finally I meet another player that has a 2nd mouse.  I did that awhile back and people thought I was silly.
---
You should record with 280p and have 2minute intro going through ur talents and inventory
---
Before people come in and start making excuses for Blizzard referencing "increased check sums on player actions" please remember you're talking about a multi-billion dollar organization that has evangelized the "games as a service" model for the last 15+ years.
---
There's more back end processes that are causing these unplayable experiences? Terrific. That's a bottle neck and it should have been addressed and fixed. 
---
They've told us the severs today are much larger than Vanilla. Great! They have not communicated or provided details on difference in infrastructure / resources to support these increases. 
---
The game client is old and the architecture of it all can't effectively support all these increased player loads? Excellent. They should have more aggressively capped server populations to avoid this issue.
---
Don't tell me they were afraid severs would wind up empty if they rolled out too many but then also tell me the game client and servers can't accommodate significantly increased con-current players. It's one or the other.
---
I'm sure they did not imagine Classic would be as popular as it is, but this isn't a start up company, this is the industry leader. 
---
There is no excuse here. Blizzard is not dedicating the appropriate resources, expertise and man power to correct this issue. I personally would love to know why this is the case, but ultimately it's irrelevant and most likely will only piss me. 
---
I'm loving Classic right now and I want it so bad I'm willing to put up with shit like this. I feel like Blizzard knows this and they're taking advantage.
---
Sharding happened
---
Hmmm interesting thought. I'm still not wholely convinced though that shatter is superior to full Arcane investment for Arcane power at 40. I mean, hell, you could even start going back and have shatter in a 31/0/20 build by 60. The raw power of Arcane explosion, particularly with a full Arcane investment, seems like it's hard to beat.
---
I would love something like extended questlog, just a simple widescreen version of the window so you can actually see something :P
---
Or better yet just don't play any games from this evil company
---
hit is by far the best stat for TPS until youre capped so dont worry about other stats lacking, get hit where you can and get capped
---
Waht? How is that a rare bug, surely many did it that way
---
You dont farm black lotus. You farm other things in zones with black lotus, and sometimes the lotus finds you.
---
Im not saying they are, but why not ? It would fall into PR category. Considering how much uproar from "hardcore" diablo, overwatch, HS, and WoW communities they got lately, and considering how small that part of the actual playerbase is, it might actually be viable to trim these players in favor of more positive brand image in the future. Majority of their playerbase/customers have no idea or dont care about fiascos like diablo mobile, OW tournaments rule breaking becauase of gender, HS balance, stale meta, hong-kong, and numerous bugs ( game is currently unplayable ), and the shit about WoW Classic. If you're on reddit reading about one of their games, you're most probably not the average customer
---
I need dramamine to look at that picture.
---
DPS can grind gold easily and strath live has 0 tank or healer drops. Why wouldn't we make some money?

If it's clearly stated before the run, it's not a scum.

This happened a while back in BFA too :(

ofc the size of the realm matters. The more people play the more spots each bracket has. 0,3% of 10.000 players is way more then 0,3% of 1000 players.

I hope OP is gratified by the fact that I read this exactly the same way I read other studies: (1) Read the title; (2) read the abstract; (3) read the subtitles; and (4) read the conclusion. I feel like I‚Äôm ready to go to class and discuss the paper.

Compare the # of frostbolts you are casting vs other mages.  Are others getting more in than you?
---
You can batch your casts meaning hit frostbolt key with about 0.2s left to cast on the previous bolt.

People will still be there, regardless of it working properly or not. If it weren't broken then you'd be able to react to what's going on rather than roll the dice.

Druid feral leveling - would you recommend Wolfshead helm, or a typical +agi/+str/+stam headpiece instead? Curious because Wolfshead is listed as "bis" feral in many guides, but it seems to me that would only be true for power-shifting feral DPS in dungeons. Whereas in open world leveling I would just benefit from straight-up stat increases more.
---
It‚Äôs almost like playing vanilla wow and trying to fly into Ironforge. Your getting the real experience just like the ol days.

Or do you think OP works for blizzard?
---
What grinds me though is that this is a 15 year old game.  Blizz took the previous devs genius creation, and monetized it.  They're a business, I get it, PROFIT.  But man, at least make some good decisions about the implementation if you are going to piggy back off a previous success.  Thye fcked the servers and faction balance right from the start.  This was simple decision making.  Who is the VP of realm management at Blizz????
---
This is what is really scary for me. Literally some fights on battlegrounds (epics) are unplayable and that is 40vs40 (not counting people that don't go to the middle fight).
---
It's just people who feel like they have something to prove to other people who don't give a shit. Typically this type of player is incredibly dogshit, waits for more people to show up, then 4v1s someone, /spit and t-bags them.
---
Or you know.. the sooner you use it, the sooner it's back up.
---
If you think that's annoying you should try reading the nonsensical drivel you're posting. Good God, your parents should be punished for how you turned out.
---
No OP says in his title, in his TLDR, and his last few sentences that he believes this is "here to stay" or "won't change." All up and down this sub you can read comments about how Blizzard chases dollar signs, they'd be idiots to let something like this sink the Classic CashCow

Blizzard please don‚Äôt waste money on the classic server when it‚Äôll be dead in a year. Put that money into live. Thanks!

I don't remember it this way at all.  My guild played 40 v 40 AV in vanilla and I can't recall lag really negatively impacting the experience to anywhere near the degree we see it in any of these videos.
---
I definitely go with stats. You just don't have the Mana to powershift and you need that Mana to heal up every once in a while. I can easily go infinite and never have to eat/drink against most mobs, but cat form uses like 1/4 of my mana so that wouldn't be the case if I powershifted regularly.
---
It's /nolife
---
Because somewhere the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù raid composition became the norm. It became a mindset that you only NEED x am out of a certain class so there for that should also be the maximum you need otherwise you will fail. The despot the fact that raids such as ony have been 10 maned. It is a toxic mindset and a plague on our community. 
---
Just because something is not optimal does not mean it isn‚Äôt viable but too many people don‚Äôt think about that.
---
Hopefully code is a bit more modular than that
---
Without being rude, short of the sheer scales of players, all that combined is not hard. Straight up additions or multiplications is not hard for a computer. A computer can do an incomprehensible amount of them a second. Millions of them. Billions perhaps. Modern servers with massive core counts... mind blowing amounts. Issues occur when the math requires massive amounts of basic math to form complex math such as 100's to 100,000's of instructions to work out if thing A has intersected thing B; a physics enabled crash in a racing sim perhaps. 
---
Just working out if a mage's Frostbolt is not intersecting the objects in front of it for "line of sight" is significantly more work than people realise and even [2D is enough](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SundaramRamaswamy/20161117/285708/Efficient_Field_of_View_and_Line_of_Sight_for_strategy_games.php), let alone 3D. Judging by some areas, WoW has a "reasonable" implementation and when broken down into x86 instructions will be significantly more than a series of basic arithmetic. 
---
Eves movement appears to operate by flight paths calculated between point A and point B. Relative positioning, location, angles and rotations. This would be a simple quarternion applied to their affixed parent/coordinate in space, from static to applied velocities. My brain is hazy after a decade, but we did build a [dog-fighting game](https://i.imgur.com/454gYL8.png) with genuine physics calculated flight system around a small spherical planet that made heavy use of the concept. After all, gravity, lift, thrust, etc all had to apply against a curved/spherical plane else you'd constantly be trying to point your nose down whilst trying to shoot each other.
---
Regardless of all that, the point stands that non of that is truly latency demanding. Some can be rapid, some can be batched, updates can be intermittent or partial and the client can take on so much of the user display without you realising anything is slow or lagging. And beyond all this, Eve is just architecturally different.
---
Hey how did you get your raid frames to look like that? Is it an add-on or a setting in game?
---
That‚Äôs a middle schooler‚Äôs response to losing an argument, wtf?
---
The biggest joke of all........retail
---
In the perfect scenario you want to switch from a slow MH and fast OH to two fast weapons such as Corehound Tooth in mainhand in order to have 10 rage every single GCD (every 1,5seconds) to use execute as often as possible.
---
The base ability is where the damage is parked. The extra rage per damage is rather bad.

So if anything you want to switch from your slow 2hand (OEB, raggi weps) to two dual wield weapons to increase your DPS output in the execute phase.
---
Download an addon like TSM, hit an ah run a scan. Then search light leather and medium leather. But you also want to make sure the ah price is going to cover the ah cut I.E. If an idem vendors for 10s, and AH is only going for 10s 50c, you just vendor it. On my server it wasn't worth me flying back to put up the auctions because the netgain just wasn't substantial, a few silver, factor in with fly time and cost it wasn't much more then even.
---
A man of culture I see

lol because you can't handle using more than one button.

Pretty much everything you said there also applies to wow. But then eve doesn‚Äôt have to account for line or sight either or people jumping up and down behind walls or zig zagging in and out of range. Or dozens of people skirting the edge of a zone and popping in and out. Or random ai mobs and bosses popping in and out either. Or terrain and city/town borders.
---
And that worked perfectly fine didnt it.
---
No they won't. They released instanced pvp and gave people dishonor for taking over low level quest hubs. Wow is a pve game with pvp flagging to open up a new market segment, they have no interest in satisfying that market segment and none of their actions in any way indicate that over 15 years since release they intend to satisfy that market segment. If you want pvp go play tf2, which is fun and free.

If people are looking for challenges in retail I leveled with my own challenge of no heirlooms, no auction house, no mail, and you can only use gear you craft or loot from mobs. Vendor all quest gear. If I‚Äôm RP server, always be in character. I didn‚Äôt make a ruling on dungeons but didn‚Äôt do them. Had a lot of fun and it was pretty challenging while I was at it; could always go right back to my main if I didn‚Äôt feel like doing it that night
---
Why not transfer for another lower population PvP server? Have they implemented anything a long those lines yet?
---
LOOK AT ME HAVE CAT AND VIDEO GAME
---
I think they broke something in Legion (which classic was built from) because ever since then even on retail world pvp is horrendous when there‚Äôs more than 50ish players
---
üòÖ
---
Lol in what universe do you have 20-30k players on one server at a time.
---
That would be 750 people per zone if it was evenly distributed.
---
Pretty sure the min comes from dump stats.
---
Minimize low efficiency stats maximize important ones.
---
It isn't considered a good thing in traditional rpgs as it never results in interesting characters, which is their goal.
---
We still have layers, that is not the issue
---
No because it's not based on how much you play.  It's based on how much you play *compared to how much everyone else on the server plays*.  We'll have to wait and see how the meta shakes out.
---
Out of curiosity, are the servers you and u/Mervin88 on no longer layered? I'm pretty sure the lag has to do with the game attempting to layer, or shard in retail's case, the clusterfuck of players, so that the server does not crash. I remember Blizzard mentioning, when they added sharding, that the game would do this to prevent too many players in one area. I imagine that trying to layer/shard out that many people at one time would cause a massive amount of stress on the server, creating this delay and spell queuing that we see.
---
So, if layering, or sharding, were to be removed, the game would stop attempting to layer people. Thus, not causing the server to shit the bed, due to the amount of players it was trying to layer at one given time.
---
This was very helpful.  Thank you.
---
Just because your given 2 hours to take a test doesn‚Äôt mean a smart person can‚Äôt do it in 30 min. You aren‚Äôt ‚Äúgimping yourself‚Äù you are just utilizing your abilities to the max
---
Not even. Heroics are meant to be casual content ever since Legion. In wod they were gated by proving grounds so had difficulty. 
---
This got replaced by mythic difficulty dungeons like raids replaced by mythic raids. Heroics are meant to be challenging to the bottom 10% of players who weren't able to completely proving grounds. But the scary part is sometimes I think the people who couldn't beat proving grounds were a lot higher than 10%.
---
Thanks again.
---
I'm torn between Nightfall/Conflag &amp; SL...
---
I'm currently at 4200 health without Demonic Embrace, and have 320 Shadow Damage/285 Fire Damage. I'm getting mixed opinions about whether or not MC gear is good enough to start running Nightfall/Conflag.
---
What's wrong with the servers?
---
Northdale peaked at 20k. So no, not even close
---
They aren't making it unplayable on purpose.  To make this type of thing work on that scale you either need a dramatically insane increase in processing power or to offload the processing onto the client side.  Private servers offloaded but that adds different problems like making it much more likely for various forms of cheating to take place.
---
The issue is people are blaming blizzard for a problem which was always going to exist.
---
Low pop servers have smaller brackets since it's based on %, so it's also harder in that way, but overall I'd say most overpopulated servers are full of tryhard people so it should be easier
---
I bought my Deepwoods for 180 and flurry for 210, flurry is Bis till BWL, and Deepwoods gets replaces by The ony axe. 300 seems a bit steep but it‚Äôs a great axe:

Which is why they run dungeons and ask for unneeded greens/blues.

Would like opinions on whats a Good class for Orc that:

- either tanks or heals

- good wpvp

- at least acceptable for raids

- solo levelable

At 30 I switched from Combat Swords to hemo. I haven't had an issue personally with the switch.
---
You lose out a bit on the over-all damage, but gain a decent amount of burst. Especially if you can find a decent dagger and utilize Ambush/backstab.
---
But honestly, what you gain going sub with the improved stealth and such is so much better imo. Especially when looking at phase 2 coming around the corner and World PvP picking up.

Waste money? Their stock jumped 3.7% with the release of Classic. They're maximizing the gains at the expense of the community. 
---
Saying "see we told you" is icing on the cake. The problem is "see we told you" isn't coming to fruition. 2 months later this subreddit continues to grow, severs are jam fucking packed and people are hungry for more. 
---
Shadow Lands is their corporate machine trying to devise go forward strategy derived from releasing a minimum viable product that they can sunset and migrate users to a "similar" product - and they're charging a premium for it. 
---
They're catering to the masses. Their target "masses" are not WoW Classic players but rather the folks they believe they can migrate to Shadow Lands. 
---
Follow the money. Record profits last year immediately followed by 8% workforce reduction. This is becoming status quo for Blizzard coming down from Activision overlords. Invest in the infrastructure. Solve this problem. Won't happen because it kills the Shadow Lands migration strategy.
---
I'm trying to come up with a strategy to farm the second half of Scholo, skipping a lot of the first trash packs, because I'm on a crusade to get the wand from Gandling and it may prove efficient for rep farm groups after the mini bosses. I've developed a plan that I think could work, but if anyone knows any different please let me know.
---
Clear the bridge area of the 4 skeletons as normal. One ranged player then aggros the UD in the are below the bridge as well as the casters in the windowed areas that are visible. As these mobs make their way to the aggroer the rest of the group jumps down to the lower area, opens the gate (not the locked door that you need the key for), and stands where the casters were previously standing. As the mobs reach the aggroer said player leaves instance to reset the mobs (if he leaves it's possible he has time to reach the group before all the mobs reset). The UD should reset fine and the casters will return to their spot and aggro the group but they can be handled without much issue. You can then begin the dungeon half way through having skipped about 8-10 trash pulls saving about 15 mins or so and move straight to Rattlegore.
---
This plan has a few contingencies that I'd let to get cleared up, but I will be able to test some of them tonight. The other group can't enter combat otherwise the whole plan fails as the instance will aggro them after the initial aggroer resets. This may be avoided by having the group stand far away from the aggroer on pull, or enter the instance after the first pull. The UD downstairs may not be able to run through the gate if it's shut, requiring someone to open it first (a rogue or hunter could drop down and open then vanish/fd), however I don't know if the gate can be opened from the "back." These latter two questions can be easily verified, it's avoiding group combat that's an issue, but DM Trib runs on the same principle of avoiding combat with the penultimate boss so it shouldn't be hard.
---
Good luck getting your mount.
---
No?
---
Warrior or Shaman.

As a not so casual player I have the opposite problem with Classic. Retail has somewhere for me to go if I want to do difficult content. Classic is faceroll easy at end game, and thats it. The mechanics are easy and the classes are very simple. Obviously I knew this going in, and didnt plan to play it forever, but I got my pre-bis, then cleared MC twice and I'm pretty much done with the game for the time being.
---
I love the system and rewards structure of Vanilla, an area where retail is a mess. I love the pace and RPG adventure of it all, not to.mention the nostalgia. However the core gameplay just doesnt keep my interest at all. Super basic rotations, extremely simple mechanics which are way undertuned. Gameplay is the most important thing for me, and Vanilla is WoW at its worst in that area for me personally.
---
Only go enchanting if you have access to and plan on getting a few rare enchants. Otherwise the only difference an alt disenchantment and a main disenchantment is access to bop items in high level dungeons. If you‚Äôre ok with the opportunity cost of going enchanting vs another gathering profession or engineering - do it. 
---
I‚Äôm not gonna Raid and won‚Äôt ever see the recipe for +30 spell power for instance - I‚Äôll be sending all my items to a level 5 alt.
---
Check warrior discord, its been heavily researched. You should also post proof..
---
Yes!
---
Lets agree to disagree. Leveling on LH was AWFUL, like super fcking AWFUL. And that was at 15k pop. Just wait for servers like Firemaw with 40-50k people. It is not going to be fun.
---
https://imgur.com/Mgzrp0v
---
Congrats on kill!
---
And it‚Äôs not even the offseason
---
 but you see his point
---
It makes SM leveling so much better as Horde. Especially as a SPriest.
---
So you have sulfuras already?
---
Thanks a lot for the explanation.
---
&gt; Thats the thing. The servers have like 5x the amount of people vs vanilla.
---
I have this suspicion as well. It feels like a lot more people than vanilla. I'm on high pop server and many times in the middle of the night (2-4am server) I'm competing for mobs for almost all quests in low level zones. I feel like they reduced layers but the total pop maybe didn't go down as much as they expected it.
---
Congrats that‚Äôs amazing
---
It doesn't lag at all, Time Dilation works by slowing down the server tick so it can process ALL requests without lag or overloading the server. This doesn't tend to kick in until you have almost 2000 ships in system. 
---
However, you also need to take into account that the way the server communicates with EVE is MUCH different than how it communicates with WoW. EVE actually only talks to the server when you change a ships direction and uses client side calculations to move your ship. 
---
WoW communicates on every single action making it much noisier. Meaning that less people are required to overload a server. They also layer their servers differently, as EVE does multiple servers per system in game and they shift based on load, Blizzard structures servers differently. You can't really compare them.
---
if you wanted to get to R14 and still have a life
---
play on a low pop server.
---
Lol right? Like eve can handle tens of thousands of people engaging in a massive space battle but blizzard, a multi billion dollar company can handle 400 in a small land?
---
Nice video
---
Would be cool but it won't happen. I'm hoping that all the crashing that will inevitably happen will make Blizz realize that their current architecture can't handle wpvp in a 15 year old game. 
---
But we'll likely just have to grin and bear it.
---
Noob question...wheres kargarth lol
---
So he hits 60 in Classic and what content is challenging after that?
---
You hit a ceiling in Classic MUCH faster than retail endgame.
---
Leveling in retail is an absolute joke though
---
PvP is plenty balanced, you don‚Äôt deserve a 50/50 vs every other class
---
Honorable kills allow the purchase of pvp gear from pvp vendors.
---
/u/reachingFI, you will go insane trying to pass this knowledge! Hang in there buddy
---
Yeah. This isn't 'the game I loved 15 years ago' it's 'the game Ive wanted to play for 10 years but wasn't able to.'
---
Layering was a much needed solution to avoid dead servers longer term.  It was a good idea.
---
Allowing unlimited layers and numbers of people to sign up on a handful of servers when they opened, was a complete train wreck of an idea.
---
Thinking they would fix this with server transfers was a horrible reactive idea too.  It screwed faction balance....
---
FFS if someone had just put a cap on the layers during the initial prelaunch sign up, we wouldnt be in this position.  WHY DID THIS NOT HAPPEN?
---
Sounds like firemaw-eu... Us alliance seem to be going into dungeons while horde camp outside in groups of like 20
---
I understand with raids, but with 5 mans I'm not really sure why they do it... It must get pretty boring
---
I think just over 2 months isn't long enough.  But that's my opinion.
---
To add to this I think a big factor is everything is recorded now. Back then it wasn't. 10 guild's on a server could have had bindings and our guild never knew. Different times.
---
It enslaves players to the grind
---
I bet it has something to do with the way they moo-ve.
---
People start getting rank for kills, which leads to gear. Wpvp will be much more alive when this happens.
---
I disagree, but I see your point of view. 
---
The challenging content only exist in hall of fame mythic raiding, very high key pushing, and maybe  high rating arena. These are still debatable to a certain extent for example: raiding 20hours per week can easily guarantee a top 100 spot if you are even trying and not wasting too much time, key pushing is repetitive and relies more on practice than skill, and arena being just trading cooldowns. Regardless, we all can agree these activities require both time dedication and effort (as of character maintenance and study to improve I.e study log / watching VODs). 
---
If your argument was that retail lacks challenging content as you suggested ‚Äù99% of available activity lacks challenge‚Äú, then I cannot agree. 
---
If your argument was that content that are available to casuals, who either do not possess the player skill or lack of time or etc, contains no challenge, then I agree.
---
For a pure raiding spec, there's no reason to put any points into Shatter. It is simply useless in boss fights.
---
Gonna hit you with the, we told you guys to start transfering, warning has been out, and guilds should consider to move away.
---
It is never intended to have as much as you guys have on your servers, its just getting worse cause of the streamer masses
---
People in this sub actually think classic is more challenging. What even are they smoking?
---
This is just pathetic amounts of disinformation.
---
It's ok to dislike design choices in either game.  But straight up being retardedly dishonest to defend your emotional investment is sad.
---
Do you know if that proc scales with spellpower?
---
What do you think it doesn't solve?????
---
also great for pulling trash!
---
Pvp hasn't even kicked off yet dude
---
A free server &gt; a $15 monthly service charge server.
---
Ah, I wasn‚Äôt putting rejuvenation on all of the time, maybe that‚Äôs why I was struggling. Thanks for that.
---
I can't stress enough the grind this took. I spent 3 solid months 16 hrs + a day to achieve Grand Marshal on my Mage. For anyone thinking of taking the plunge you better be able to commit a massive amount of time to literally sleeping and eating at your computer for months on end.
---

---
I'll quote the exact parts for you as well:
---
Hazzikostas:..." I think server capacity was  something like 3,000 concurrent logins by late Classic. "
---
Newman: How big is a single layer? What's the end target you're shooting for, for each server?
---
Hazzikostas: Each layer is effectively going to be what a healthy server was at launch in 2004 in terms of the number of people it holds.
---
Ion gives definitive proof that a layer is fixed at ~3k pop. When a server goes from 2 layers to 1 layer, the final layer will not double in size, it will remain the same. But with only half the number of layers, the **enforced** server cap is half of what it used to be. Be mindful of not mixing up the enforced server cap and the theoretical cap( which is probably like 40k on one server). 
---
QED shutting down layers gives more queues.
---
That's one ugly cat.
---
Incendius is still layered and we don't have lag.
---
There may be more spot available, but there is an equally greater number of players competing for those spots.
---
private server client is very different to modern 'keep costs low' client
---
"Blizzard doesn't want classic to survive"
---
Thats hilarious hyperbole and is a ridiculous thing to suggest.
---
For as long as classic survives blizzard sub counts are higher. What kind of company WITH SHAREHOLDERS THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO would tank their income on purpose? (Spoiler: literally none of them)
---
Some of the stuff you lot come out with is pure nonsense...
---
Water is also wet
---
Grats. I hate you.
---
Happens every Tues/Wed/Thurs night on Stalagg at BRM...multiple horde raids usually trying to block the entrance from 3 to 4 alliance raids
---
&gt;Considering the amount of support they have for all of their games it‚Äôs kind of silly to say they don‚Äôt care.
---
The level of support Blizz provides today compared to 10 years ago is laughable, they have laid off most of their GMs, and most support now is automated, and terrible.
---
&gt;Saying they are only motivated by earnings is fairly laughable 
---
No it's saying they are a publicly traded company, and is something we can essentially prove given their day to day actions.
---
There are a veritable horde of issues in classic that have gone unfixed or answered, and will likely continue to.  The server issue is fixable, just not the way the servers are set up now.
---
Anybody else think there's just gonna be a lot of acct sharing? I remember virtually none of the r14's on Frostwolf back in the day did it solo. They just took shifts on one character at a time. That way you don't have to admitted to a mental asylum once your done.
---
Except for the whole lack of security and anti-botting. If Blizzard took their shortcuts, we wouldn‚Äôt be enjoying or bitching about the game because we wouldn‚Äôt be able to play.
---
I don't know why you people are going back and fourth spewing anecdotes. Tuesday is going to be the test, and my money is on everything imploding.
---
Can't wait.
---
Lol @ the downvotes.
---
Why are you booing me, I'm right.
---
Yeah it's hard to say anything if you weren't in that party. I had 2 runs strat/sholo yesterday with very geared tanks (multiple epics)  that couldn't keep aggro. And it was 100% not dps problem as healer was attacked on every aoe pull. I have arcane mage spec for raids atm so can't do tons of aoe and then save my life with ice block. Ended up slacking on dmge a lot. At least they could keep aggro on single targets, oh wait No they couldn't also lol
---
I definitely do not recall that at all.  I don't ever recall experiencing issues in 40v40 AVs due to having a lot of players other than my trash computer sometimes needing extra time to load polygons.
---
Never had this problem. Your internet might just be subpar.
---
So many blizzard apologists in these threads, yikes.
---
Yes, today, well, last night. I was unaware this was an old joke. I saw it in chat and screen shotted it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That isn't an absurd request, no, which is why I agreed that it's a problem. What is absurd is name-calling, expecting a personalized Blizzard post on your reddit complaint thread within 48 hours of an issue becoming mainstream, people with a background in tech coming onto the forums and proclaiming they know the answer to the problem despite having no idea what is happening behind the scenes at Blizzard, being naive enough to think Blizzard doesn't employ people with 1000x the knowledge of any random on here crying about how it's an easy fix, the list goes on really.
---
No one is forcing you to pay them to play the game. If you aren't happy with it then unsubscribe. You have a right to complain but when it's not constructive it's just whining.
---
Lol Nost was probably more alive than any of these servers in it's heyday. I remember primetime was around 12k on the server at once.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs definitely a factor for sure. But farming a graveyard is typically what will cause an hour long queue when the other faction has had enough. 
---
It really depends on the player holding the flag :p
---
Dude stop.  It is well documented on a number of forums, including reddit, that many of these private servers suffered horrible, server wide latency issues when the numbers got over 1-2k active players.
---
lol no it isn't, you have no clue how little bandwidth (I am sure you are referring to network bandwidth here) is required for this service. Nothing for this game is bottlenecked by that. It is lack of hardware and scalability.
---
Hold on I need to grind another 50g to change my spec for pvp, its worthless to pvp using any other spec besides this one from a discord that uses parts from all three trees in a specific ratio. Perfect for casual father on-the-go. Only 17 more hours today to get my daily honor required for the next rank. Luckily I am on discord with the raid leader who has spent the previous 17 hours LF7M tanks for the raid in three days, so when invites go out i will be able to wake up or leave work as needed; dont want to be late for my shift of world boss lookout duty. Perfect for casuals!!!!!!!
---
r/whoosh
---
I mean, I'm fine with High Warlords and Grand Marshalls being only the very few players who actually has the time and dedication for it. It makes the gear and title actually rare. If 10% of the player base ran around with it, it wouldn't be as prestigious. 
---
And this is how the PvP system was in vanilla. Not sure why anyone would expect it to be different?
---
Yeah, I could see that getting old
---
Got to give this an upvote.   By far this always makes me laugh.  Especially when they go on reddit to bitch and moan.    Furthermore the reply others tell them.  Go back to retail.    Fucking hilarious
---
Not the same game. Nostalrius ran vanilla wow, classic is vanilla wow on modern engine.
---
EDIT: Typo.
---
Trolls blood potions and crusader are nice. You can also add any food buff for the 15min stam/spirit. Elixirs/scrolls help too but only marginally IMO. Buy your warrior lots and lots of heath potions and first aid mats, these make huge difference.
---
"If you disagree with me it's because you're an ignorant doubtful coward."
---
Okay Boomer.
---
Ok, well, then YOU PEOPLE suggesting that Blizzard hasnt put any money in to server updates is ridiculous.. I dont wanna play on a PvE server. Thats not my problem. My problem is this weird thing that people do in these games.. it happened in Dark Souls too... The whole population just DECIDED that certain areas were just designated "hang out meat grinder" areas.. They didnt do ANYTHING except that. Just like these people are doing. Just sitting here. I dont know what you people are complaining about anyway. Im on a high population server theyre trying to move people off of, and I have NEVER experienced any lag at all. If you have a problem with lag, play on a server near your location.
---
Let me ask you something kid, have you ever heard of a car series being recalled because of a faulty part, or your parents taking the car to the shop because it needs a part replaced or fixed? Have you ever heard of that being solved instantly?
---
Why do you think they pull the servers down and notify you in the launcher? What do you think those people are doing? They are presenting the base game and reapplying patches to it. I would think you're crazy if you didn't expect something to go wrong doing that.
---
Does a weapon enchant stack with windfury?
---
I missunderstood your intentions I guess.
---
I love classic WoW's world and approach to content. I don't love its class balance or design in most cases. I'm pretty bored on my holy priest compared to the healing I did as disc in Legion. But I also never really even tried BfA hearing how bad it was.
---
What do bad players and rogues have in common?
---
They both pick locks.
---
Yeah that's also what I meant with there being solutions.
---
You can also let clients connect to multiple servers at once. This has a similar effect and allows you to cross over smoothly.
---
But I seriously doubt Blizzard is willing to put enough resources into WoW to make this work. And if so, it will only be on retail where there is no "#nochanges" crowd. If you rework at this level, there will be fallout. You're going to shift the problem somewhere else. It's very likely in a place where people care much less about that issue, but I can already imagine the shitstorm it would cause on the forum.
---
I'm actually really happy with Classic. I think they hit the right balance. Sure, it's not perfect. But it'll sort itself mostly over time. The only thing I am worried about is the AQ event. I would not mind them introducing sharding in that specific area just to keep servers running.
---
I am arcane frost (31/0/20) and let me tell you, while arcane power sounds awesome in paper and performs really well in short boss fights, it is nothing great for leveling and mana efficiency (big point while lvling). At level 60 you arent lvling anymore, you are into dungeons and raids and the threat reduction of frost channeling is 100% mandatory, so no, you cant really pick up shatter (unless all you plan to do is solo farm in the game) with a deep arcane build.

Not on faerlina, faerlina is exactly the opposite horde is outnumbered by alliance.

Not necessarily bc so much of it is based on percentiles. There's probably a happy medium of a reasonably high pop but not super competitive (or streamer/pro dense) server

I have never once stated that I am "pro" .5 sets going in at phase 3. I am quite the opposite and stating that blizzard wont do this (My first post actually) because .5 sets were released in phase 5 not 3.

Never once said it "doesn't make a difference" either. I think you got side tracked on the wrong comment to respond to and meant to start your argument with someone completely different. Drugs.

Whats dishonest? Im comparing how leveling feels rewarding in one game vs the other. How one game has things that i can do without long continuous time investments that feels challenging and fun. Mythic raiding is a long time investment key pushing is a long time investment. I need 30 minute chunks of gameplay right now. 
---
You‚Äôre incredibly hostile for no reason.
---
That's over 2 months ago, there was an update where they changed how it works buddy.

&gt;The company's Blizzard business, which depends on games like World of Warcraft and Diablo to keep humming, generated $2.24 billion in revenue and $685 million in operating profit.
---
You can easily hold AR for a couple seconds to fish for crusader proc, especially if the fight is lasting 30 seconds.
---
You should woosh yourself, bruh.
---
Sarcastically saying "#nochanges" is stupid because this is not an actual "no changes" situation. It isn't authentic in the first place.
---
That said, looks like you're looking to be an epic memer rather than actual say anything of value.
---
What is most likely is that they calculated that the frequency of something like this becoming a major issue was not worth the additional development time. Think about it, back in 2005 they probably didn't expect players to schedule 500v500 raids with any sort of regularity, and by the time the Legion client/engine upgrades came around the game was a lot more fragmented/layered/sharded. They built systems to handle massive workloads like this, but going back to Classic removed a lot of those systems. So we've got the evolved playerbase and a devolved infrastructure.
---
Basically, yeah it sucks but they had to get it out the door instead of waiting on a few agile teams to spend a year improving the performance of things which realistically only happen a few times a year on a few select servers.
---
To name one? Ragnarok

Cloud hosting is better than dedicated servers for this type of issue though. They just clearly aren't allowing the scalability required for these types of interactions. That would cost a lot of money that they have 0 desire to play. Instead they can just write it off that it works 98% of the time.
---
I think they'll stagger phases with content draughts in retail, so I'd be shocked if they released all the next phases within a year.
---
I don't need a "geared" tank for really any 5-man dungeon. I guess you have a point if you want someone to solo tank UBRS but I usually run UBRS with my guild because it's easier.
---
&gt;A lot of people defending Blizzard in these threads. Seriously, get a grip. 
---
This happens in every criticizing a game, it's intolerable, I know some degree of it is astroturfing, but most of it is gamers who will defend anything these companies do as long as they get their fix.
---
The problem is that most of the technology improvements on scalability are application-level. Actual networking protocols haven't changed at all. They are archaic as fuck.
---
They did improve their servers in the last 15 years...with sharding/phasing/etc. which is entirely incompatible with world PvP. They traded away most of the MMO design for performance. These server improvements are fundamentally part of the networking traffic because they decide input/output. The more the client can do without breaking security, the less the server has to do, including the amount of data to be returned back to the clients.
---
Everyone likes to be an armchair network engineer but networking is *fucking* hard, especially to do well. That's why they are the best paid engineers in software development.
---
That's not quite true to be fair, hybrid classes have a really hard time getting good DPS PvE gear because there's very little of it in Vanilla and all the tier sets are healing based. The Blue PvP sets have a generally different itemization which can be more useful than the PvE gear depending on your spec/needs in PvP (Druid Blue set bonus gives you +15% speed increase in your animal forms, which allows you for example to ignore mage slows completely in Feral spec, and makes it more roughly better for PvP than T2.5 against some classes).
---
A SPriest can do very well in Blue PvP set. Also, on a Fresh Character, it's quite possible you'll gear faster by Ranking than by doing raids. You'll probably already be R4 - R6 upon hitting 60 anyway if you like PvP, so it's a good thing to do.
---
I just cought a lvl 37 Broken Tooth with my 48 Hunter. Im 51 now and the pet is 48. The truth is, there is no shortcut. But as a tip: pets don't get EP from quests, so when you repeatedly go into dungeons the gap between you and your pet closes faster. Good hunt :)
---
Hunter in my guild had Bigpecker pet name for an owl and got suspended for 3 days
---
It's not going to fail tomorrow, that's absurd. One bad year doesn't tank a company. A company that can't handle one bad year is fucking terrible. Especially one that's coming off a record profitable year. The notion that they aren't doing well is absurd.
---
Oh i didn't mention pvp, yeah, its probably competetive and challenging, but just not my cup of tea at all, i never played pvp in wow and never liked it, thus forgot to mention.
---
Mythic dungeons, oh.. its a long question, honestly. Saying it short, i don't find hard but unrewarding content, mm, reliable. And the only mentionable reward from m+ for a mythic raider requires all 15s in time. Which is easy.
---
But that's my opinion, can't be truth for all, of course. I'm in love with mythic raiding though -)
---
Servers are fine
---
Give me BGs
---
All of them? Damn, that sucks.
---
K? what is this, runescape?!
---
when?  I have been doing large scale Wpvp for years.  it got unplayable with Legion.
---
took more than 500 players to get lag in SW.
---
So, Phase 2 being released is what they "HOPE" will reduce raids on major cities as DKs are a concern.
---
I'm not a genius. I just write firmware a lot.
---
Hex ALL the things \o_
---
All items are good for Hunter dps. You can vendor them and buy bullets. Otherwise they can't shoot.
---
First off, on Faerlina, its going to be confirmed that its going to happen, you can say all this shit, making me out to be a complainer but yet im telling the truth here. And on top of that im not even trying to be the victim here, i‚Äôm only stating what will be the hotspots for pvp and what will happen on Faerlina when phase 2 hits.
---
Why are you wrong
---
I'm not saying it's perfect. Backend can have bugs and still do validation that is calculation heavy.
---
I don't think that is reasonable at all. With the drop rate on something like onslaught girdle and the abundance of warriors it would take a stupid long time for even a good group to be done with MC. Let alone bindings for all tanks and other rare items.
---
Damn
---
Yeah, I dont believe this for a second. Just because the game lags during these fringe, 100v100 pvp battles that the majority of players won't experience, doesn't mean they want the game to fail, everything has been working perfectly fine, at least in my experience. They wouldn't commit 2 years of development if they didn't want the game to succeed.
---
Did a guild run the other day and a 56 warrior got sacred charge lol. Gratz
---
To add to your point: If you try to use a gryphon while mounted, you get an error saying *You are already mounted! Dismount first*
---
Clearly gryphons are a mount.
---
Have your entire raid force bound in Kargath.  Meet up in Org for the Ony Head buff, fly to Dustwallow, kill Ony, Hearth to Kargath.  In MC within 20-25 minutes.

I prefer to keep each Stance on a separate keybind so that I can have a full 12-slot ability bar for each Stance so for instance when I am in Battle Stance Shift+E is Overpower, in Berserker Stance it is Berserker Rage, and in Defensive Stance it is Revenge.  Some slots stay the same like Heroic Strike is always R.  W is Charge (Battle), Intercept (Berserker), or Auto Attack (Defensive).  Shift+R is Shield Bash macro (Battle), Pummel (Berserker), Shield Bash macro (Defensive).  Things that have a stance switch macro'ed into them get a separate keybind away from the main ability bar.
---
Oh god yes fuck dm west
---
I never ever want to tank that unless I absolutely have to. It fucking sucks.
---
Hopefully.
---
and warlocks still did well, they would have done better than rogues if one of the better guys didn't try to make duels interesting to watch and to destro.  Even without healthstones they sl was one of the stronger specs. If they had healthstones they don't lose. Snutz literally went 14-0
---
no changes
---
I also work in security. The more things a packet has to go through the longer it will take for it to do that. If it was the case that increasing security had no cost to speed. Why would companies accept any risk?
---
lmao
---
When WoW has a 249x249 WPvP without lagging we can talk about that ballpark
---
If you ever played Nost you would agree that it felt way more populated then any classic realm that blizzard currently has. It's not a ghost town but it also definitely doesn't have 15k concurrent pop. Maybe not even half that amount.
---
You should quit and return when battlegrounds are released, it's the only option that resembles what you are looking for in this game.
---
My opinion is, sure, I think it would have been better. You might have been able to make yourself some gear upgrades along the way had you kept your leatherworking at pace with your leveling. That's how I like to use the professions, but honestly, it's can be very slow way to get to 60, as I'm often sinking money into the profession and making the money back playing the auction house. Had you not done tailoring, you'd have sold your cloth, and not having done leatherworking, you sold your skins instead. My guess would be that they're similar in value and you didn't make a huge blunder. However, I like to use the professions to make gear for myself along the way, which you didn't do, being primarily a leather wearer. I think mistake is too strong of a word for it, all these things are optional. I think the main thing is that you are wanting to do enchanting, and tailoring is enabling that for you better than leatherworking would.

I refuse to believe fudged numbers sold by Russian scam artists.

I'm going to need to see your calibration certificate on your mobile phone's stopwatch.  Sounds like it hadn't gone through metrology yet, therefore, cannot be used as official test data in a Class A study.

What are the most cost efficient buffs/consumables to get for each group/class? Obviously things like flask of titans is amazing but they go for 150g a pop on my server. I'm an officer on a semi casual raiding guild and we just started putting together our roster for MC/Ony. What are the best bang for your buck to start with?
---
I wish the community actually thought about the complexity of running these servers, instead of just complaining. I get that letting Blizzard know of issues is one thing, but I've seen some eyes wide shut comments about how server maintenance actually works, with some really unrealistic expectations.
---
Eh, once it devolves into account sharing, it's no longer really an acheivement, though.
---
retail isnt fun to play but the art is nice
---
Thanks
---
I'm interested to start classic but hearing lots of horror stories about phase 2 pvp. If I start now, will I be completely btfo and not be able to advance in the game?
---
No, I rather get Phase 2 asap
---
Its really easy
---
...and a cup of Mojo?
---
This is purely anecdotal, but does a PvP server drop more greens early on than a PvE server?  Or does Durotar drop more than night elf starting area?  I recently rolled on a PvP server and am finding that I have gotten tons of early greens from 1-20.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply!
---
If you ignore the glaring security flaws and ease of hacking, yeah.
---
Hmm no.
---
Carrot on a stick works for raptors.
---
I do appreciate these explanation threads, but I feel it is a little misleading to use the 200 v 200 number. The serious lag issues take place with much smaller numbers and much more often than that number would imply. The difficulty and seriousness of addressing the issue is important, but we also need to keep in mind how severe the actual issue is.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxcMxcZZxxckeV
---
This is a good pre bis build.
---
&gt; and you could still do battlegrounds and such when they release
---
Unfortunately thats looking like its still months away, unless they change it up and release them before P3 (which im hoping for)
---
That's like saying your car ran fine, despite gutting your brake system.

Okay Doomer
---
A steelseries kana v2.
---
tbh tho, if you rolled on faerlina, you kinda accepted that your server would be a total shitshow, not gehennas level shit show, but pretty bad.
---
If you see a ??? Player from the opposite faction and you don‚Äôt run away you deserve to die. At least make an effort to stay out of range and 99% won‚Äôt bother.
---
SM/Ruin most likely, I like big crits and I like having my pet
---
You‚Äôre speaking as if this is a faerlina only thing...when this has always been the camp spots since vanilla, it will happen on nearly every server
---
Bring back layers ofc.
---
Yep, I've been avidly against retail since I realized how nauseating it was in BFA. I told myself I'd never play retail again unless they made radical changes.
---
While not for everyone, and in no way do I think it's perfect, the fact they're removing the ridiculous RNG from legendaries and the weekly chest,  ridiculous exponential azerite grind, and stated they're reviewing titanforging, I'm hopeful.
---
I think they have psychologists that gave them a business case for treadmilling people into a constant RNG effort grind. It has clearly backfired and they're starting to move backwards with a less is more approach.
---
Wait literally 5 days man.
---
Like LITERALLY tuesday the honour system is released. Anyone who wants PvP gear is going to be engaging hardcore in wpvp.
---
Just wait.
---
It's not dependant on server size. If the server is bigger, more people get ranks, as the room to rank is proportional to the server population. On the biggest servers in Vanilla, you could have 4 people get R14 each week on each faction for example, while on the smaller ones, there was only one spot on each side each week. R14 isn't as rare as people think.
---
Just start blastin. Don't forget to need roll everything.
---
 vanilla servers were regular shitshow. there's a good reason I racked up like 40 free days during vanilla, on an EU account that started 3 months after official EU release and when the worst kinks were already somewhat fixed... and we still had the common things, like being stuck mid-looting and sliding around, kneeeling and not being able to do anything because server just decided not to comply with you...
---
the wpvp problems went away mostly thanks to BGs and didn't really resurface until Winterspring, but they were there the whole time.
---
As a warrior, sounds like you had some very skilled warriors to manage even 1 victory out of 3 duels on average.
---
I dont want to play on a PvE server. Again, I dont CARE that these people do this, I just dont get it.. Its weird to me how thats fun... Sometimes I fuck with em.. Sometimes I go outside and I just watch em... Its like theyre hanging out outside the instances like theyre just chat rooms..
---
My point is if youre complaining about too many people being in one place at one time, check out the Black Rock Meat Grinder.. I couldnt believe the amount of dead bodies when I ran through that place.. It looks like a fuckin plague hit that place
---
Dont worry once the wow token is in classic most people will quit anyway.
---
100% of streamers are attention whores
---
In a similar boat, friend. 56 Warlock with multiple days rested XP right now because I know primetime I can't get a fucking tank for Scholo or LBRS. My guild wants me to hit 57 so I can do MC next week with our second raid group, but when I'm on DURING PRIME TIME nobody wants to tank dungeons. It's insane. Weekends have been much kinder to me, at least, at getting a tank for a dungeon. 
---
Also worth mentioning, as a Warlock I love having a rogue in the group. Reason being is that I'm less likely to pull, and if I do, the rogue is likely to chase that mob down for me. I'll take a rogue over a mage in my groups any day. Mages are good for water. That's it.
---
Me and my bestfriend are about lvl 57. Hes a rogue im a warrior. I wanted to dps until I saw we basically have to compete against eachother for the same gear. Does this ever change or should i just try to tank
---
Worst guild mate ever
---
Screeching about classes being "almost unplayable" due to a few minor bugs is hyperbole.
---
Shoo, troll.
---
Make sure to keep an eye on your pet's health. Most healers ignore pets and a lot of enemies use aoe abilities. Having to rez your pet over and over will slow you down. It's better to have it sitting next to you than dead.
---
There is no way to switch from gnomish to goblin once you've selected one, you will have to start over sadly :(
---
Should be fine, 1-45 will likely be smoother than previous because you wont run into 50+s who are bored and wanna camp people.  Once you get to 45+ it might be a bit trickier with world PVP going on, but likely by the time you get there Phase 2.5 will be released with BGs.
---
I honestly don't see it proc alot. I use bone slicing hachett with an elemental sharpening stone, that's +2.75 crit and more dps over the flurry axe.
---
My dude, the game is 15 years old. No, the issue is not priority.
---
[This is just pathetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTiLaDOYwH0)
---
2 monitors yeah, I haven't tried unplugging one yet. If I get desperate enough I could try that, I rely pretty heavily on 2 though.
---
The Fire Elementals hit like trucks. On horde side we Fire Resist totem and it makes it way easier. 
---
For tank healing on harder pulls I keep Rank 4/5 Regrowth up and Max Rejuvs, then spam r4 healing touch.
---
A lot of groups can‚Äôt even deal with those packs if they pull 2 fire eles so I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it much
---
People mostly say they are less validation on request integrity.

You can find video of people using hacks pretty easily or just go check yourself the most knowed hack forums to see for yourself.

I raise you a post from this very subreddit, about the erection sizes and vaginal depths of the WoW races.

---
I can't see the cat or anything after seing that UI
---
The problem is that servers can't handle large scale world PvP raids. I don't see how a server transfer would solve this issue. The issue will be present across realms.
---
The bloat was too much for me to return in freaking MoP let alone WoD, Legion or BfA.
---
I initially left in 4.0.3 after they ruined classes and speccing on general.
---
My bar, so yousay angerforge can be duod without healer?
---
Depends on how many healers you have.  Probably doable with barely any FR and a couple cheap fire prot pots if you have a ton of heals.
---
Ok then quit
---
Thunderbluff/Undercity
---
Some gear is better than no gear.
---
With those numbers you can probably play whicever specc you want, I am glad to see that you haven't gone for T1 Felheart (I assume) and/or min-maxed shadow sp at the expense of raw stats and sp in other schools.
---
The specc also is highly dependant on your preferred playstyle and goal of how to PvP. Do you wanna... try and fight enemy players fairly if possible? Do you just wanna honor farm at transit points or in towns? Duels?
---
In the past I ran Nightfall/Conflag and even 7/5/39 (aka Firemancer) with what became pre-bis blues and it worked fine, but mana will be an issue no matter what at this stage.
---
\---
---
Personally I will keep playing SM/Ruin for now because I love the big shadowbolt crits but also do not wish to sac my pet's utility with DS/Ruin nor do I wanna go SL just yet, I am fine with 3300 HP.
---
Warlock is a fun class either way.
---
Because of handful of people used an exploit that was fixed, it has permanent consequences. ....I just...okay. Sorry, but I don't endorse taking everything literally.

If it‚Äôs stressing you out this much you should cut ties with the guild and find some new friends.
---
Report and move on
---
Haha spoken like someone who thinks they're waiting 15 years for approval
---
For dungeons and raiding, you mostly ignore the pet.  A few have special abilities you can time or cooldowns that make them better, but for the most part you're just trying to make sure they don't pull adds and are on target for extra DPS.
---
The endgame spec for hunters is Marks, where something like 85-90% of your DPS comes from your bow.  Your pet is really only used for special skills in pvp or grinding/farming solo.
---
All that said, leveling without a pet to hold aggro is going to be a REALLY bad time.  You need that pet when you're questing and grinding.
---
wait until BWL, Naxx and AQ come out though
---
Right wtf
---
As a warrior tank, I can confirm DPS don‚Äôt know how to act. I can‚Äôt imagine doing it without a taunt.
---
Amazing news, thanks !
---
&gt; Look at combat athletes, be it MMA/Boxing/etc. They intentionally punish and damage not only their bodies but their mental faculties (through CTE) to gain a degree of renown.
---
Yeah. Not role models in my opinion. Your point?
---
With those stats you must be pretty geared. That said, go SL. You'll be so hard to kill.
---
For the most part pets are usually only needed for solo-pve and all pvp. 
---
To be honest id say about 50-60% of end-content warlocks utilize the DS/Ruin build. The DS here stands for Demonic Sacrifice where you literally forgo the ability to have a pet in exchange for a large buff - the most utilized being the +15% shadow damage from sacrificing a Succubus.
---
Just hit level 49 and finally got my mount yesterday at 9 days played ... Slow and steady I guess...
---
Make a new alt, play the game slowly, its quite obvious you rushed to 60, and burned out. Maybe try a different class, maybe use different professions, maybe get epic mount money for your new toon, maybe establish a guild and make friends, maybe help out friends, maybe make new friends. You got bored of the game because you exhausted yourself rushing the game, you never stopped to see how it was like to play casually.
---
TBC has flaws, but the art design/zones are not it. Every zone was so unique and stylized. It wasn‚Äôt as earthly as Azeroth, where half the world is forest or swamp, because it‚Äôs supposed to be *otherworldly.*
---
I hated hellfire at first, but it‚Äôs a great brutal intro into the new world. Everything is burnt to a crisp, there are giant Fel Reavers roaming around that will stomp you. It really was a new age of MMOs when you stepped through that portal.
---
Then Zangarmarsh/Terrokar were kind of understated homey zones where you could relax a little more, culminating in Nagrand, which is still the greatest zone in the game (I hated the revamped version where they just shot their WoD all over the zone). 
---
Blades Edge is fuckingn brutal. You walk in and see fucking dragons impaled on massive spikes. Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley weren‚Äôt my favorites, and are definitely the weaker links of the expansion, but still, they have an identity to them that‚Äôs never been redone. 
---
Sorry for the tangent, I just can‚Äôt help but imagine what the modern zones would look like if they had a real concept for them. Every current zone looks like it has a camp and crater every 30 feet to allow for a new quest hub that will last you 43 seconds.
---
I mean I played there and this def never happened.. lmao. Worst was the constant 150+ ping because servers were in Europe
---
Don't be so modest about the difficulty of LK 25 HM.
---
According to the statistics from [WoWProgress.com](https://WoWProgress.com), only 1.85% of all guilds worldwide managed to beat LK25HC before the release of Cataclysm. And that was with the full ICC buff and all. And ICC being out for nearly 12 months.
---
Compare it with other "Endbosses" of expansions. Since WoWProgess stops "counting" kills from any expansion once a new one is released.
---
Alone in the Darkness / Yogg 0 : 2.9%
---
Argus the Unmaker Mythic:  3.8%
---
Archimonde Mythic (Hellfire Citadel): 5.26%
---
Garrosh Mythic: 8.99%
---
Deathwing: 22.05% (what a joke..)
---
LK25HC wasn't just "hard", it was one of the hardest encounters WoW has ever seen.
---
I use nightfin soup so I don't have to life tap as much.  It makes it easier on my healers and ultimately saves money for repairs and additional fire pots.
---
&gt;Nah, it's not like they should wait for every player to reach full t1 before next set of content is released.
---
You and I both know that this statement is waayy hyperbole and not an argument for obvious reasons. 
---
&gt;It's okay for players to be on different levels of character progression.
---
It's besides the point. If they continue this pace. We are on naxx ending next year.
---
People assumed ~4 months for every phase, resulting in ~2 years of classic wow (like the avg expansion).
---
Now first DM was released early? Now phase 2 is pushed ***2.5 months*** after release? And now theres speculations that BG's will be released early?
---
Blizzard is too scared to lose subscribers. They kneejerk and go into panic mode as soon as they start to see the numbers drop.
---
I'd rather have 2 years of somewhat delayed content than a little over 1 year rushed content because blizzard's income not wanting to tank some loss.
---
A trick I use that helps in dungeons and is even more helpful when you're in raids competing with other healers to snipe the heals is to pre-cast a heal BEFORE the tank takes damage and cancelling at the last second if no damage is taken. Beginning the cast doesn't affect your mp5 gain until the cast goes off so you aren't crippling mana regen. 
---
What level are you?
---
That's not a fix. It's an issue anywhere large scale world PvP occurs, which is likely going to happen on all realms in phase 2.
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä Blizzard is powerless against a PVP server ü¶Äü¶Ä

It's a social game after all, and people play at their own pace. *Prepares to proudly post a defeated Kobold Vermin*

Its literally easier to get groups as dps on my server (versus as a healer).

This isn‚Äôt processing lag. The server is capable of moving the day in and out calculations. Even the number of players on screen should scale fine with per tick distribution lists. I am pretty sure it‚Äôs blocking in an attempt to maintain server performance via it‚Äôs dynamic load balancing. 
---
Server says, yo, this region is too crowded, move some dudes out. This is a synchronized action. That means locks, atomics and blocking actions. Eventually this dynamic boundary moves closer and closer to the epicenter. Players are bouncing back and forth. Players on boundaries and causing packets to bounce back and forth between neighboring servers. More locks, more atomics. More blocking. Performance goes down. Eventually crashes. 
---
Private servers ignore this entirely. Instances like AV don‚Äôt have this dynamic stabilization the world has. It‚Äôs a non-trivial fix.
---
&gt; I consider a lot of these people friends and I have played with them for a long time. 
---
Sounds like you are trying to get them banned so you wont be able to play with them much longer. Great friend.
---
Literally unplayable
---
Yep i see that, but the enrage and flurry with the 2h sounds too appealing! single target would be a beast.
---
IIRC, the real problem is that modern WoW servers run on Kubernate-like-tech -- microservers that split individual servers into many components. This is why classic has 0 downtime. Failures/crashes/issues etc kill one microserver leaving the entire server whole. Vanilla WoW would have spurious outages since individual blades ran one server process that could die and take an entire game realm with it.
---
The lag is because what could be one simple process looking at it's own data we now have considerable IPC between microservers that explodes with large scale PVP. 
---
Ultimately, Blizzard decided to trade uptime and stability for world PVP playability. I don't actually think there is a solution that reliable gets both.
---
NO CHANGES
---
Just go grind mobs your level and listen to music. Pick an area with a town nearby that you can unload junk and mail greens quickly and then grind an entire level out. I strictly grind mobs for multiple levels 39 -40 I killed gorillas in stv, 53 - 55 I killed tar lurkers and tar lords in ungoro, 57 - 60 I killed yetis in winterspring. 
---
Very easy to do and extremely brainless. You'll be watching youtube videos or TV and look back at your exp bar..."oh cool I just gained 3 bars of exp during that episode!" Next thing ya know you have shit loads of gold and you didn't run all over the world delivering letters for NPCs.

Finally Dragonfang EU has a use
---
i did rogue/rogue/druid in season 4 as one of the rogues. both of the rogues had 4pc/4pc and 2 glaives. 2 rogues from the same guild wanted a 310 mount but hated pvp. they hit up a mutual friend that was a resto druid &amp; good at pvp, so i got to play on one of their accounts. 
---
i've been playing since classic and that was easily the most fun i've ever had in my wow career and the easiest gold i ever made. also probably the scummiest i have ever felt, and not because of the account sharing.
---
&gt;achieved by the best
---
Sure that would be fine, but being good at PVP is irrelevant to Classic's honor system.
---
&gt;or the absolutely insane
---
Not really insane, just those with close to unlimited free time and the ability to spend it playing WoW.  It's an absurd commitment for  a game to ask, and is one of the many things that was 100% improved in TBC.  I'm fine with rewards based on skill, and I'm even fine with rewards based on reasonable investment of time, raiding is essentially a combination of those two, but R14 it's just an absurd and unhealthy grind.
---
I like the dragons in the south part of Dustwallow Marsh. The little ones can drop a pet, and the big ones can drop vendor loot weapons. They're skinnable, too. There are also two chests that can spawn in the ogre town area with the dragons, and a bunch of ore nodes in and around the cave.
---
In my experience, it's not a very contested area, despite being the destination for \~3 quests in Dustwallow.
---
Been thinking about it. My horde is stuck on Dragonfang and yeah it's very low population. Too much so for even me and I usually have a leniency with numbers for population.
---
Any selling points for Zandalar? I've been looking at a couple of servers.
---
I heard something about the pvp epic mounts being a little cheaper than normal faction epic mounts. Will these be released in phase 2 or later?
---
Oh man I'm so excited for you, your mind is gonna feel like it's expanded once you put 11 pts in arms and feel the freedom of stance dancing.
---
You'll also get to use bloodrage after you've already pulled instead of before!   For a total of 50 initial rage to use after the charge and stance dance.  Bloodrages Rage gain effect are literally threat effects(calculated like you're healing yourself).  Minor, but everything helps.
---
Frankenstein client made by Russian scam artists with serious security flaws and no checks for hacks because they had nearly 0 server side checks.
---
good
---
I dont think anyone wants the server to crash from people simply playing the game (which is what PVP is).
---
How much does leveling engi to 300 cost? I dont have mining. Have about 880g now but really want my epic mount as I think it will be beneficial in PVP. Also I should drop herb right and keep alchy?
---
Nether storm, shadowmoon, blades edge, nagrand üëçüèªüëçüèª
---
we aren‚Äôt at the point where we can just dump warlocks at MC.  Also having more warlocks really makes the Garr fight easier and trash too.  Not bad to have a raid heavy with warlocks
---
Edit: what‚Äôs to downvote here?  I don‚Äôt get it
---
With that argumentation you might as well say it's harder on a high-pop server because more people compete for the same top bracket.
---
In reality though, the average grind is the same. Sure it may vary a bit from server to server (purely depending on the specific players playing there) but doesn't change the competitors-to-bracketspots-ratio, which remains the same.
---
If you played in your early teens it's normal to have "no life" since there is basically nothing to do after school (before you start going out/dating etc)
---
Zero consumables needed if you are geared
---
The trick I've learned is that people want to join someone leading, not add you to their group.
---
Get into channel lookingforgroup and just say "LFM XX Dungeon." You can be the first. Don't even need to say how many people. People see that LFM and you'll get whispers. Gotta be the lead.
---
Just tested your hypothesis. Cat attacked and chased my foot from under the bed, she bit it to kill it, but when it stopped moving she wouldn't eat it.
---
Theory is sound.
---
Or, you know, the fact that there are hundreds of clears across all the servers every week, for several weeks now, so things happen, and the unusual occurrences are the only ones you hear about.
---
&gt;Regardless of which you believe is more taxing, the reality is that Classic WoW handles servers and players in a way now which is worse for World PVP than it was on the original server architecture
---
Wow used to have monolithic/load-balanced servers. WoW's current engine was refined and built for the modern quest/game design and phasing to enable it, which runs on pools of servers.
---
Pros and cons to both, but if there are scenarios that wreck havoc with large groups of world PvP battles then there is an architectural issue there; but there may be massive benefits elsewhere.
---
If there is a time to address/improve this issue, it's likely coming with Phase 2.
---
What kind of keyboard is that??? I want one
---
Our guild in vanilla raided text-only, and it was probably the most fun I've ever had playing a video game. We had channels for all of our various roles, which (in addition to making it so that every class or role lead could update their players on strat or assignment changes at the same time rather than having to wait for a chance to talk) helped to develop real connections between you and other players of your class or role over time.
---
In our class group, we ended up having some group trips, gift exchanges, even an international romance due to the camaraderie that we found while getting our faces rolled repeatedly while learning aq40 and Naxx.
---
Top answer
---
&gt;These types of fights are happening multiple times per week on any healthy pvp server
---
Were they happening weekly 15 years ago? Because that's what we are supposedly trying to work with.
---
Remember when there was unbearable lag just standing around in Ironforge or Orgrimmar? That's much improved in the current state of things, maybe we should bring that back too. Rubberbanding had its charm.
---
Also, saying "the first M in MMO stands for massive" doesn't change the fact that software engineers cost money and time, and if products don't ship the company doesn't get paid. Sometimes "good enough" has to be "good enough", because that's how the real world works.
---
I know the p word isn't allowed on here. But seriously, seriously, large scale battles were way more functional on the p word. Three eastern european scam artists did better than a billion dollar company.
---
In order to hold threat, tanks use way more consumables, and expensive ones too.
---
Major health pots. Elixir of Mongoose, Elxir of Giants, sharpening stones, juju, etc.
---
Then you have to use multiple dapper grenades per run (2 Gold each or sometimes 17 gold for 10). Iron grenades are expensive too. I make them myself but there is opportunity costs.
---
On top of that, plate is more expensive to repair, and tanks meed it repaired more often due to being hit.
---
Tanks need 2-3 sets of fully enchanted gear (mitigation, threat, and fire resistance).
---
Being a tank is expensive, and it just so happens that it's harder to farm gold as a tank especially when your variable costs associated with running dungeons and raids is high.
---
Your argument is built on the premise that the back end of the private servers and the back end of WoW Classic servers are equivalent in requirements, which is entirely flawed.
---
This is the best advice, it shows performance while taking gear out of the equation.
---
Private server link that you play on? PvP was phenomenal in Warhammer.
---
epic set will take 13+ hours a day, cause the brackets get set by whoever no lifes the hardest. All it takes is one guy to raise the bracket 1 cap, so everyone else who wants rank 14 are forced to match that same guys honor cap to not get placed into bracket 2. Its a complete no life situation for r14. you just wake up and sit at the pc for the full entirety of the day for 3 months and only take breaks for getting food and going to the bathroom
---
Its more fun than standing in UC staring at a mailbox while I wait for raidtime/friends to log in.
---
It was really only possible for high schoolers during summer vacation. Or retired.
---
So how many bindings have they got coupled? That's the actual question because if they have 4 of the same there's still a big chance they will never get Thunderfury.
---
Our guild had 3 in Vanilla- left ones.
---
Off topic sorry, but i‚Äôm curious: where does Alliance group up to head into MC?
---
So are they outsourcing blizzard support to India or something? What is this awful English?
---
I'm wondering this too - really want to try and raid heal in this spec if possible
---
ah, gamers and hyperbole, name a more iconic duo
---
Precisely. And I think it should be known from my professional opinion that i do sympathize with their IT department if they still do all their infrastructure in-house. Buying your own servers is REALLY fucking expensive, we‚Äôre talking $500K a pizza box on networking alone. Now with the cloud you pay for what you use so it being playable 98% of the time is good enough for them in this situation. It might, double to cost ten times as much to get the same performance scalability in-house as you would in the cloud. People don‚Äôt understand that carrier class networking companies that have the 8 9‚Äôs of reliability spent 10x as much on that as the company with 99.9 uptime.
---
Kev wtf
---
I doubt you have enough crit at your level to have decent uptime on flurry . I would just stay arms man. I raid as 2 hand fury and love it but arms is just the better spec, unless your doing ST fights. You have more utility with tactical mastery as well
---
TL;DR: Don‚Äôt roll pvp server if you don‚Äôt wanna pvp.
---
The first few days I don't think people will care that much about DHK's. They don't have the time invested yet for a DHK to really fuck over their honor level.
---
Pretty sure you can always buy them.
---
Dude what? It was stopping the city from working at all. No one could use anything, no one knew what their character was doing. How the fuck is that fun?
---
The playerbase is significantly older yes, and you‚Äôd think fifteen years and a wife/kids/professional life would tame them, but shockingly people are MORE hardcore than before.
---
You never used to see engineering reflectors back in vanilla. Now you have people going double engineering.
---
It‚Äôs total insanity.

It's literally not understandable.  The last few things they said made no sense.

---
And you where saying?
---
This research makes the assumption the item known as "Carrot on a Stick" is actually a carrot tied to the end of the stick, and is used to bribe the players mount to go faster.  While on the surface this line of thinking is understandable. The fact the item gives an exact 3% increase to mount speed regardless the species of mount/robot chicken, makes this incredibly unlikely.  Different breeds of mounts should show different affinities to carrots, therefor the speed difference could be drastically different depending the mount.
---
In actuality the item known as a "Carrot on a stick" is an extremely precise electronic modulator that emits a Gahz'rillan electrical force to precisely affect the nervous system/control system of the players currently used mount.  This is how it's able to accurately create the 3% speed augmentation.  Also why you have to retrieve an electrified scale to get the trinket in the first place.
---
As most people are aware, the Azeroth Aviation Administration has strict rules against using electric devices while flying, as electrical devices have been known to cause interference with the griffin's delicate navigation system.  Thus the carrot on a stick does not have programing to affect the flying beasts, and even if it does it's use would not be permitted.
---
Where the hell are your up votes?
---
My uncle owns blizzard and he said servers are fine no need to worry.
---
&gt; They are the only 2 items you can get pre-raid that give spell hit which is a huge stat this early in the game.
---
Clutch of Andros as well, I believe. Ban'Thok is better, just mentioning for the sake of completeness. :)
---
Say it with me now. Confirmation bias.
---
There were often 12-14k people online concurrently. World boss battles were sometimes as big as 300+ on one side and 100-200 on the other. 10 to 15 raid groups in azshara fighting. with another 12,000 people elsewhere doing whatever they were doing. On classic if 150 people are on the screen at once doing anything involving the combat log the entire game stops working.
---
Yes it's fairly common in tryhard guilds. Usually those tanks are flasked and wbuffed though which mitigates the risk a ton.
---
They aren‚Äôt equivalent either, apparently there‚Äôs a lot more enthusiasm and respect for classic and a lot less for retail. 
---
By any measure it seems classic is good, at least compared to retail.
---
Exactly! Tank can farm enough gold with no problem.  You can always go fishing to farm some essence of water, gathering, just go ahead and tank as much as you want, you don't have to wait for the party, you find it instantly. Even with fair roll you'll end up with good money per hour on average. They always tell the same fucking story "I can't aoe farm like you are" . Lol it's like aoe farm is so entertaining and easy, you gotta work hard and efficiently to earn some money. So yes while I'm using one method to farm tank can use other method, but some of them decide to be a jerks and get advantage of the rest of classes for no real reason but greed. It's getting worse and worse to my experience.

Even on a small tiny scale you can be questing in EPL and one of the opposing faction is there and you both are questing without causing issues... the minute two more people show up on one side or the other the person with numbers all of the sudden likes to flex their PVP muscles.
---
Typically the new people aren't even in a party with the attacker but the attacker is making an assumption they will jump into a fight if they see one.  90% of people won't PVP at all unless they perceive they have enough of an advantage to win.  If they perceive to to be a good, equal matchup or they are outnumbers they don't engage.
---
Same here mate, I have almost no time to play but am just enjoying and not feeling the rush to level too much. Everyone will still be running MC  when I eventually get to 60 and other raids too that I'm not bothered. Loving the levelling journey and because I can't play every day I have time to plan what I want to accomplish in the small time slots I can get on. I am on dreadmist and am 45.5 now. Hopefully tonight I can do some tanaris questing and a ZF run haha. We shall see what the wife and kids think!
---
And win trading.
---
In other words, the servers are behaving exactly as they did in classic large scale world PvP?
---
The classic server I came from had hundreds of players in one area and it would get just as bogged down.  Keep in mind that *every* server is much more than high pop was back in the day, so most players have never experienced something like this.
---
They should fix and improve issues, but I'm just saying this is a classic as you can get.
---
Dodge gives warrior a chance to fuck your face with overpower. Rogue is fine.

How does a weapon chain work for dual wielding. Do you need weapon chain on both weapons? Thanks!
---
Stop digging this and hand us all you have. You are warned.

OTOH?
---
&gt; I also work in security. The more things a packet has to go through the longer it will take for it to do that.
---
I find it *extremely* difficult to believe that you work in security yet mistakenly believe that security only consists of "sending packets through more things". It's very clear you're making a ton of assumptions about how security has to work that simply aren't true. There are a ton of different strategies for security, very few of them would add any noticeable lag.
---
&gt; If it was the case that increasing security had no cost to speed. Why would companies accept any risk?
---
That's an extremely broad question, and one that comes with an entirely different host of assumptions. But to put it simply, most companies don't accept much risk. Security can come at a cost, but it isn't always performance. The primary cost for security is development time, not execution time.

Yeah it's like OP learned about threads in class and just assumes that Wow Classic isn't already doing it? Blizz server engineers are going to be top of their field. Far beyond "lol duh just use threads".
---
Classic Wow isn't some 15 year old engine. It's the latest Retail engine retrofitted to give the appearance of the old engine. If anything the most likely culprit is that Retail engine is specialised for lots of little instances.
---
I usually switch between using Wolfshead Helm in dungeons (if I have  mage water) and Embrace of the Lycan. 
---
Powershifting may be a 'meme spec' but when used properly you go form 0 energy to 80 immediately. This allows you to continue doing damage and gaining combo points and in my opinion outweighs the stat increase from other helms.
---
If I have no waters or ways to regen mana, then usually Embrace is gonna allow me to do more damage overall.
---
‚ÄúWe want the old game! We don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs not optimized!‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, wtf Blizzard? Why can‚Äôt you fix these issues?‚Äù

100% fix
---
If you have some other brand like steel series, uninstall it too.
---
Account sharing
---
People are definitely overreacting to phase 2 pvp. It's fine, if you're at all worried about it  just join a PvE server- there's still PvP on PvE servers! Just not the ganking while questing or corpse camping.
---
Even if you're determined to join a PvP server, it still won't be an issue until you're lvl 45 or so and can therefore be an HK for a 60. And that's assuming you could even get to 45 before battlegrounds come out and take all the PvPers there.
---
Why are you calling it bullshit as if they wronged you? They were a free service and they were fun, regardless of minor differences to vanilla
---
&gt; I know nothing about game engines
---
Ftfy
---
You need a solid core of at least 5 people, otherwise you shouldn't make your own guild. Pug some players even when it's not necessary to show what your guild is like to new people. Ads are almost completely useless, but providing a good atmosphere with clean boss kills will get people interested. Keep doing this and there is a bit of a snowball effect when everyone brings their friends.
---
I'm GM of mine and with my friends we made our guild from the ground up and have been doing MC since week 3. If I could do it over though I would have just joined another established guild. It is a pain in the ass to go through everyone's logs, make spreadsheets for how loot will be distributed, diffuse drama, and constantly recruit and evaluate people to fight attrition. I would rather just play the game and worry about myself, but at this point I am in way too deep.
---
Pretty well populated as well as no queue times. The RP is there if you want it. Plenty of good guilds. Not sure what else you want to know.

The context of this thread is purely farming coffer runs, no pick pocketing, mining, killing mobs/bosses, etc.

They literally told us why they would *only* give us Classic if it could be implemented in the modern client... I love how armchair reddit devs know exactly how to design and publish a game. 
---
Why throw away 15 years of security updates and back end infrastructure, you literally would be opening up your systems to decade old exploits.
---
They can fix it and not delay P2. Just do that. P2 can be a little broken and still fun for smaller scale pvp throughout zones. Then one day all of a sudden large scale is viable too.

Well you see blizzard is a small company. They can't possibly provide stable servers for large scale pvp.

I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit that right now I can‚Äôt afford the sub even though I really want to play it, but never I asked for it for free, here I am trying to offer anything that might be relevant to the person in exchange for that. And guess what, I‚Äôm actually proud of myself for doing an engineering course, working and paying for my uni, so you can suck a finger and put your ‚Äúhelp‚Äù in a place we both know.

So because the class balancers sucked in Vanilla and didn't give tanks enough tools to competently hold aggro, you consider that a good form of difficulty? Good thing you're not a game dev.

It‚Äôs an explanation of why private servers ran so much more smoothly than official servers. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true but it sounds reasonable.
---
Switching stances doesn't trigger gcd's, so assuming it's paired with only 1 other ability and you have the rage for it, it will be single press.

---
That's not how software development works, you can just take a pile of money and dump it on a computer in order to fix problems.
---
And "better" depends on the context. You have to balance performance with security, scability, recoverability, maintainability, etc.

It sucks because I don‚Äôt know your exact situation, but I‚Äôm on Grob and the first night we went down to 1 layer on Tuesday raid night we had a like, 200 vs 200 or so, it was hard to tell but we had no lagg. Are there still servers with 2 layers? Maybe it is the layer balancing problem.
---
The only bad lagg I‚Äôve gotten has been Onyxia Head buffing with hundreds of people waiting for it
---
Edit: I‚Äôm also not a server person, so I can only guess why our experience in BRM was fine. Could be anything
---
It was fun! Honestly I don‚Äôt mind getting wrecked, it‚Äôs part of the game. The point is that they also ruin the fun for their own faction and discourage PvP in general.
---
Alledgedly Nostalrius and the private servers that followed in its footsteps could handle this a lot better, supporting 100v100 engagements with relative ease and no more than 150ms average ping across the board, with some users reporting ping as low as 19ms. Server crashes did occur once or twice per day, but that's a small price for getting smooth performance when it matters the vast majority of days
---
Pally buffs are so much better and convenient in a raid environment though.

Not like a Paladin would need mp5 anyways.

Gladiator also requires that same time commitment. Arena ratings get inflated by people who play 14+ hours a day. You won't be able to keep up with the rating inflation unless you play as much or more as those other players. You still have to win games, but all it takes is a few players who can win games *and also play a lot* to make it impossible for a "good" player (who doesn't play that often) to get Gladiator.
---
No changes boooooyz :D

I don't see any noticeable difference with imp soul drain :/
---
lol this is the reason why i've been farming my blue sinew for over 24/hrs played and others stroll into the cave to get their onyxia attuenment done and get it on one kill.  RNG is RNG
---
It really is easy to tell they had someone else in charge for WotLK, that whole expansion had a united art style that was much closer to Vanilla than TBC's random "every zone must be a starkly contrasting color to the next one over".
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people like this ‚Äúmusic‚Äù. Sounds like one guy puking onto the mic, while some other whines about it, while the instruments just pump out so much distortion that no one can tell you are bad. Drummers in bands like these can be good. 
---
This kind of ‚Äúmusic‚Äù, imo, requires the least talent. And I‚Äôm including pop music where it‚Äôs a hot girl that lip syncs.
---
Sit at a known spawn and wait, wait for 10mins up to 6 hours but wait. When it finally spawns you now have the info as to when it will spawn again. Come back to the zone 55mins later and start checking the spawn points and hopefully catch the next one. It‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôve been able to get my hands on them outside of being lucky and stumbling upon one a few times in BS.
---
You can talent to whatever you want, especially if you have fun with it. I suggest changing things up when bored: play the auction house, go fishing, level professions or something.
---
I leveled a paladin to 42 at release and scrapped it for my mage which is now a geared 60. I just logged in to the pally last night after respeccing to ret and it is fun again, trying to heal and dps instead of tank
---
I prefer to play on official servers than private servers because there‚Äôs different anti cheat protection in place. Also I can be assured blizzard won‚Äôt delete my account anytime soon or decide to shut down servers on short notice. And it‚Äôs not pay to win, yet.
---
Just "finished" badlands and hit 40, where should I go next? Horde btw
---
Okay, but classic raid content is way too easy.
---
And trying to convince people to raid with less people to make it more challenging is nearly impossible. 99% of people are just copying bis gear lists, and trying to optimize everything because super elite pro guild told them how to play the game. IT's really a snooze fest end game in classic. The reality is most people playing classic want easy raids because they suck at the ones in retail which offer more mechanical challenges.
---
Does not utilize regression to control for the presented risk variables, only assumptions. Not even mentioned in limitations segment, not even a limitation segment exists.

halloween is over.
---
Thanks for the thorough reply! 
---
I'm assuming you're going to stick with SM/Ruin then. Maybe revisiting deep destro with BWL gear will be more fruitful.
---
Thanks again
---
It was maybe 100-150g when I did it? That was also without mining, I just bought all the materials off the AH. It was also about a week before the Phase 2 announcement, so I'm not sure how much the leveling prices have changed since then. 
---
All that said, I'd recommend getting your mount first, it will make more of a difference in my opinion.
---
If only kids had a nice linear progression. If you charted what they know it'd look more like the stock market than a straight line going from potato to adult.
---
This is where I'm at. Once I get what I want outta MC prob gonna be on hiatus from Classic until BWL comes out. Or possibly until they announce BC/WotLK servers.
---
I mean that's a valid point. I've heard horror stories of players who saw Staff of Jordan or some equal epic world drop drop, looted it, then server crashed with a 3 min rollback and it was gone... I know, late Halloween story, lol
---
My response was to the latter part of his comment.
---
And in response to your comment, you can see that from my own experience, I disagree.
---
Top tier shit posting...but why not just increase the speed of everything in the game by 10%?
---
Intel igpu, or amd/Nvidia graphics?
---
They've had 15 years.
---
Yes, if any guild offers you a core spot, take it and never ever leave that guild. Name your next kid like your GM, and tatoo yiurself the tabard over your arm
---
I am not asking rhetorically. It is a legitimate question as every server I played  on had large amounts of server lag whenever you got large quantities of players together whether or not pvp was the reason. 
---
They did release lots more servers over the course of the vanilla though and latter servers did have better hardware. I thought that might have been the case. 
---
The answer I seem to have received doesn't seem to indicate those servers though. It a bunch of people who aren't remembering vanilla at all and instead are thinking of their time on private servers.
---
None is asking for the reality, it was a hypothetical question which you just ignored.
---
Perfect 5/7
---
yes skinning is great for leveling up but end game, its best to drop skinning because most of the leathers from skinning is near vendor value compared to AH. only good thing is devilsaur leathers and prices are crashing for it. ur raid will likely have a designated skinner and maybe ubrs is the only dungeon thats good for skinning from black dragon scale but u still gotta get finkle skinner and its not worth the effort.
---
yes pickpocketing is the most reliable source of income for rogues imo
---
Does WoW even have an offseason?
---
That's really what this post feels like, a big "Retail bad, classic good, amirite guyz?" circle jerk.
---
Both games have their merits. I missed flying around Azeroth, being able to wear whatever armor designs I want, have massive amounts of gold and feel super powerful. Combat is crazy fast, the animations are awesome, I don't have to worry about managing mana and sitting down to drink every other pull, but when I want a more structured and strategic environment, I play Classic.
---
Without these checks though wouldn't stuff like Lag switching and cheating be possible?
---
Congrats!! :D you should all be very proud of each other!
---
I want this to become the first peer-reviewed shitpost.
---
Mazing
---
As a hunter the tier set appearances made me sad, demonstalker lookes great then it goes way downhill with riftstalker. Gronn stalker shoulders were kinda cool with the eyes but the helm looked like a Halloween costume. Sunwell geared looked a little better but I was jelly that all the other classes had sick armor sets.
---
Warrior t4-t6 was 10/10 tho
---
Have you heard about the word IF? 
---
None is asking what will happen, it was just a question about priorities.
---
yeah, perhaps if you include gathering and such, or we have one oopsie, it takes 2.5 hrs
---
I was done when I hit rank 11 and that was already hard enough for me, but the rest of my group continued (3 locks and druid flag carrier) and eventually all of them got rank 14, crazy guys, one of them was absolute beast, Lumiukko? Lumiokko? something like that. B ut now with having those  ugly things like "job" and "responsibilites" I  can't imagine I'll reach higher than 8 or 9.
---
Okay, thanks a lot! :)
---
Raiding a City that no Horde ever stays - all are in OG!!!
---
I like being on a server with an imbalance against me, feels dangerous!
---
........but
---
Our main tanks both have double bindings and one of our off tanks does now as well
---
While this is true, they are both online video games that achieves the exact same thing. Clearly something pservers did was more efficient and maybe blizzard should fix whatever is causing the rubberbanding
---
Nagrand!  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
They didn't start to stutter until it was like 150v150, and I've seen 1000+v1000+ stress tests but to be fair 'server fps' became like 1 per 1.5 seconds at that point. But still lots better than current Classic
---
&gt; Blizzard knows best
---
hahaha remember that one when blizztard announced 2 pvp servers? xD
---
dont they know best anymore? haha
---
If you're not having fun, then why play?
---
And I'm being totally serious here. Why are you playing something that doesn't bring you enjoyment? You seem like you aren't enjoying the game anymore.

Also it makes the /flex remote so much more enjoyable for me.
---
The only non-casual friendly thing are Dungeons as dps. Be prepared to wait up to hours for a group. At least it's like that on Dragonfang.
---
Depending on the speed of your wep, you probably won‚Äôt be able to use all the Flurry autos before the buff expires. I respec‚Äôd quite a bit during leveling to mix it up and every time is ended up going back to arms.
---
Yeh mate too true. Its going to be interesting how much ganking will affect our levelling. Probably going to alot of corpse running, hopefully 52-60 will just be farming felcloth for robes of the void and running dungeons and not too much ganking. Good luck to you too mate, I hope you gain some levels tonight!
---
BGs kill world pvp. They are just waiting for phase 3 so it becomes a non issue
---
If we know that this solves the issue then we might be able to solve the problem with something else.
---
I asked you this because it reminded me of a problem some people had with CSGO.

---
But you can't go on. You repeat this 20% of checksums line and you don't know shit. Go and look at the mangos codebase and show where they're skipping validity checks then tell us why Blizzard couldn't be running the same checks concurrently to reduce lag.
---
Apparently I have a lot to atone for.
---
It is not a matter of other "pressing issues" or not. They had 15 years to work on that. 15 years. They had every single kind of opportunity to work on that and not have it on Classic.
---
Really not hard to understand.
---
Did you just assume my base? Why not 15 out of 17?
---
I have the coefficient reduction in place for heal rank 1 (you can tell by how far down the line is and how long it takes to catch up).  As far as I can tell from my testing and research heal rank 2 does not have a reduced coefficient.  Test methodology:  Spammed Heal rank 2 on myself and observed the outcomes.  No non-crit heal fell outside of the anticipated range.  If there were a reduced coefficient I would expect many of the numbers to fall below the minimum anticipated value.  If you find something else can you please let me know and we can discuss and make sure we have it right?
---
Well I‚Äôd much rather that than have it the other way around and never have anybody to PvP against.
---
You're fighting a mob, and it looks like you will die before it does, and you dont want to or can't pop your Fear, healing pot, or 30min CDs?

Hamstring --&gt; run away a fair distance --&gt; bandage for 4-5 ticks before they reach you --&gt; kill mob.
---
The laggy servers were part of the OrIgInaL VaNiLlA eXpErIeNcE #nochanges amirite?
---
&gt;What am I doing wrong, or what am I not understanding?
---
The good news is you understand that you are doing something wrong here.
---
The most obvious is that first aid can be used in combat and on other players, while providing vastly more health recovery rate than eating.
---
Read other responses as to how apply a bandage with your warrior toolkit.
---
The rules worked out alright I agree in terms of their intended effects. Lot of close matches and 'upsets'. But I'm not sure why they didn't ban Soul Link instead of HS/SpS, so destro could maybe have a chance.
---
&gt;everything is faceroll
---
But he just pointed out that "everything" isn't. Heroic dungeons are not even a blip on the radar of endgame challenges in retail. You're falling over yourself trying to argue this point and it's kind of sad, man.
---
I hardly had trouble on Nost, K2, K3 or LH. It‚Äôs very manageable. Also there‚Äôs a hard cap to how many people can be logged in; 10k afaik.

orc rogues look awful man you made the right choice

&gt; Health pools are small, so hot's are often not effective healing against big hits.

They are far better in later stages, you require a lot of +healing to make hots efficient.

&gt; Reroll.

No.
---
&gt; No reason to run more than 1-2 druids in a raid, and druids are the worst healers in classic by far.
---
We have 3, our healers are bored out of their minds now clearing current content.
---
Awesome! I managed to level my engineering just in time to miss this post, now i'm stuck (forever?) as well! High five!
---
Exact same situation. I leveled my hunter to 70 in the TBC but never touched it after that.
---
Absolutely no, if it means pushing back phase 3 and other pve content. MC / Ony can't be the only game in town for another 4 months without causing a mass exodus of players.
---
You don't farm it
---
I play games every day, read gaming blogs, follow all the major gaming subs, etc. I've never heard of "Albion Online", if that tells you anything haha. Looks like I'm not missing out.

Aside from the good points everyone else has made, bandages vendor for more than the cloth it takes to make them

The track that starts at 2:07, what is that? I recognize it but can't for the love of god remember from where!

Never.

This is A1....
---
Thanks!
---
Srto?
---
This would be kinda shitty for the smaller servers that dont have this problem.
---
Not when the cheaters were friends with some of the Staff members (or the actual staff members).
---
Yeah I doubt it‚Äôs a hardware issue. Most of these servers are more than likely virtual on a big UCS or Dell chassis. Hardware allocation is probably not the issue with today‚Äôs amount of CPU/RAM per server blade. I would imagine it‚Äôs a server software limitation or something similar.
---
"Better" on its own in software development is a no-no word, because it's not quantifiable and isn't specific enough to be useful. 
---
Blizzard would have changed the engine to make it more suitable for what the game and environment was at the time it was written, most likely to support higher resolution spells and models.
---
my friends guild has cleared mc since week 3 and have not received a single binding.
---
They did, eventually, but it was on a per BG basis iirc.  So if you DR'd them down in WSG, in your next AB they were worth full honor again.
---
Still, it was a dumb strat and just winning was worth more honor.
---

WHO WOULD WIN? A multi-billion dollar international conglomerate video game developer and producer corporation OR 1 underground $200/mo russian server?
---
I had to read it three times to understand what he saying. When you write less complete sentences than full sentences there‚Äôs an issue.
---
The guy who told the player base they won't do classic and that people don't actually want classic, is the head of the company. This makes it seem unlikely that he would divert funds or talent to work on anything to do with classic beyond what he absolutely has to to make it profitable.
---
Best use is for pvp when hiding around a wall without a healer present.
---
Destro lock doesn't stand a chance against a lot of classes. One lock did go destro, like a 12 time glad, really good pvper did it for fun to give viewers something different and won 4 matches. But yeah overall the rules worked really well, I was questioning some of them but they have more experience in duel tourneys than I do and it showed. Production quality could be a little higher but the quals were super fun to watch.
---
I‚Äôve been making 40g+/hour farming lashers and herbing (which is needed to make it worth it imo ).  Tell me a better spot a pally can get better results solo farming. It‚Äôs very mindless and easy to do too.
---
That...is amazing. Thank you!
---
Nothing nothing
---
It was a really entertaining tourney to watch and the standings were more even than I thought they'd be by a long shot. It may be hard to draw too many conclusions from it though since the skill range of players was incredibly wide.
---
I've done small battles and I'm running an ambush/backstab build at 52, my best advice is to be a dickhead. Stay away from AoE and just wait, opportunity will present its self and they cant see you unless there is a severe gap in levels. My personal favorite is waiting in the shadows while the priest breaks combat to run away and rez or drink. They are at their most valuable here. My ambush crits for 1.2K right now at a 70% rate. I've never seen a level 60 drop dead so fast. Dude probably had zero idea what happened and I stealthed immediately after. Pick your fights wisely. Killing cloth users is the easiest thing ever, be careful with mages though.
---
Does calling them kids really accomplish anything? Your point would be valid without that. I guarantee a lot of the people complaining aren't teens.
---
You know that the numbers in Classic are wrong too right?
---
One run through UBRS will show you that.
---
Blizzard is dogshit.
---
Pvp is the main reason most people play online games lol. Who cares about pve, its static. Pvp is fun and dynamic and challenging. Also it's pretty balanced just not in such a way that every class is good vs every other class. It's a true rpg in that sense
---
Auctioneer or auctionator, i forget what it was called but it was one of those two
---
I didn't even think you were allowed to do that. But then again, crafters who advertise their wares and services "plus tip" isn't really that much different I guess.
---
yeah this. You don't need macros. Macros just make it faster/smoother if you want to optimize your gameplay.
---
Nice! :)
---
SL is amazing in 1v1s and 2v1s but in large scale PvP and group battles it falls behind. IF you end up just roaming around looking for people to kill, go SL. If you group up with people to farm and eventually do BG's, SM/Ruin is the shit.
---
Yeah fair enough
---
It's funny talking about bugs in Classic breaking class viability for PvP in vanilla when most class balance in actual vanilla was just a coincidence in the first place. It's not like Vanilla pvp was carefully tuned, it was a random shitshow. You'll just have a different random shitshow this time.
---
Boom, last sentence nails it.
---
Engine was rewritten for a specific purpose, and classic wasn't even on the radar then.
---
Agreed.
---
You shouldn't need to be healing through all those mobs. Your groups should be able to nuke a target out of the pack so that there is just 1 less mob your tank needs to worry about. 
---
If your tank just takes waaay too much damage overall, its a tanking problem.
---
If your DPS can't drop an initial high threat target quickly, its a dps problem. (tank should focus on the other crap in the pull)
---
If you can't keep a tank up between pulls, look for improving gear on your healer set.
---
Most packs in BRD outside the highway are quite managemable and dps should be able to brute force down a high priority elite or the extra non-elites fast before they can overwhelm your tank and ultimately your mana pool.
---
Same applies to other instances like the strath undead packs or the ghost packs in DM:West. If your dps can't drop targets quickly you are going to suffer as a healer as they need to pull their weight and kill mobs before they can kill you.
---
My dog chases laser pointers like a cat would. He also chases things I throw for him. Also, I have a bearded dragon that chases laser pointers too. Now, he stops doing it very quickly and also does not chase things I throw for him, but I have seen bearded dragons exhibit this behavior on YouTube. 
---
Dogs and bearded dragons are not wolves and raptors, but I‚Äôm giving myself the liberty to extrapolate from my one single data point to conclude: Maybe they would???
---
Same setup here, can confirm it works just fine
---
That's called latency my dude. You have a shitty internet. I imagine you are from US, and nost server was based in Europe, hence the ping.

You have to dedicate a lot of time to farm lotus.  I farm it with multiple characters on different accounts so I can camp more of the spawns.  It's rewarding because once you have a timer, you can take a break for the rest of the hour or go look for another lotus.

---
To be fair, I've seen far worse UI's over the years. You've still got some prime real estate to put some addon overlays at.
---
All my food is free -- mob drops or quest rewards. Plus I rarely have to heal up, anyway, so one stack of 20 lasts a loooong time. I haven't bought food in about 10 levels.
---
My bandages are far more expensive -- the cloth that I could have sold, and the training costs (not even counting the lost time traveling to trainers).
---
In addition to what others have said, you could probably hamstring, run away a bit, and get a couple hundred HP back by using First Aid until the mob catches up to you.
---
It did not.
---
Lmao, this i think I can do.  
---
Does this also include turning to my uninterested wife on the couch and saying "I don't know how they expect us to play like this!" while she plays Candy Crush with The Office on in the background?

New Gladiator is different. The flat rating requirement does make it much easier than the current PvP system.
---
Originally, Gladiator was top 0.5% of the PvP population. That leads to the exact same problems as the Vanilla PvP system. (And why it was changed.)
---
I don't understand, this stupid failure is exactly what it was like during the original WoW: Classic. So that means it is better. Why are people complaining? 
---
You signed up on purpose to play a stupid shittier version of Wow on purpose because complainers whined like babies about new features not being perfect. So all of the stupid failures of this old game which were fixed by patching and expansion were removed, so that we could all suffer with stupid bullshit like using a chatroom to recruit for 40 person raids, paying 50g every time to respec, no dungeon maps, AND laggy stupid pointless bullshit world pvp. 
---
This is the WoW: Classic experience that we all signed up for: stupid bullshit for no reason because some idiots think that a game they played when they were children has only gotten worse as a result of the effort of hundreds of developers more intelligent than them. This is what you signed up for.
---
1. Classic is new. Its more of a remaster on the modern engine than the old game. It's not a 15 year old game. The underlying server structure is different. Modern WoW has phasing to sly people in and out of instancing to improve this, eg the world quest bosses. WoW Classic has classic quest design. They didn't want to go through the shit that was the booming growth then a catastrophic shrink which left monolithic servers of yesteryear dead and empty; so they've tried layering.
---
2. If this is such an issue, then there is a good chance it's fix has been carefully coordinated and likely to land with phase 2.
---
Ok
---
So I really should be in engineering then?  Mining/engineering?
---
IF your tank is holding his own, keeping threat the paladin is still going down, look to your DPS.
---
They need to be killing mobs MUCH faster so you aren't spamming heals as long.
---
Ha! Good one. (Blink noise) (nova noise)
---
So you want to call yourself a casual but then complain that casual content is too casual. Have you considered that maybe you're not as casual as you think?
---
Dang I thought it was a dwarf
---
Because private servers didn't care about safety or anti-cheating since most of the processes were ran client-side WoW is by far one of the best MMORPGs around when it comes to anti-cheating. 
---
I mean, I do think something should be done but you guys are dumbing down the whole argument with this whole "BUT MUH PSERVERS WEREN'T LIKE THAT!!!". I mean, are we talking about the same pservers that had insane amounts of client editing + staff corruption? Light's Hope only existed in the first place because Elysium had a huge drama about one of the admins running away with PayPal money. Are we really going to put pservers on a pedestal just because it's easy to hop on the hate bandwagon? 
---
It won't be the same as pservers because even though pservers succeeded in a lot of things, they also didn't care about a bunch of stuff Classic HAS to care. If you want it solved please stop with this dumb argument and let's focus on what should be done in regards to CLASSIC, because that's the only way we'll get a solution.
---
Finally can upvote one of these. Let's be honest cats are dicks
---
You just don't go for it and recognize people who do for what they are...
---
Firemaw isn't a streamer server in the way that faerlina is.... Yet it's a laggy mess with any big fight.
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll check it out.
---
Lol proud cog checking in. 
---
Maybe I could hang by our healers and act as a defense for them if it's a little to dicey in front
---
Yup that might have me convinced to try it out.
---
Trying to fool us all with the orb of deception... I see you.
---
I was never fully read about the mechanics of fear. I read some where you can like steer people some how? No fuckin clue I never played a fear class =/
---
But I wanna make a lock for an alt if I can ever get this guy to 60!
---
I do agree with these two points. It's just staggering that in the QA nobody thought about what happens when the exact same circumstances that had appeared in the past 5 years on private servers occur (large scale PvP for scarce resources out in the world).
---
They already took their time developing the game, then releasing it, knowing full well, that the game will break 3months after release with content progression, was lackluster QA at best.
---
I do agree that they are already carefully coordinating as the world bosses are here to stay. If the AQ opening is a shitshow, nobody cares, because it's only for an evening. The world bosses have relevant loot, inbound PvP and inherent e-peening/ bragging rights forged into the mere positioning as they aren't instanced. The whole purpose is to pit the server and factions against each other.
---
Ohhhhh I definitely was targeting the next person I planned to summon before that summon was finished. Thank you
---
Sure and now instead of going for the cheap solution they can shell out some actual cash for more hardware or cloud scalability
---
Well, at least you found someone to feel superior to.
---
It should work on gryphons but not wyverns
---
Depends on your real goal.  PVE?  Raid?  PVP?  
---
Destro is poor or even completely nonviable for endgame pve/raid.  If you are intending to raid you will want to spec into either SM (affli) or DS in your early/mid 50s and finish with Ruin at 60 to maximize shadowbolt spam DPS.  You could take Ruin at 58-59 if you go the SM route.  You'll be in BRS from ~53-60 anyway for gear if that's your direction. 
---
Destro might be playable from ~43-55 for pve, not entirely sure, but it will probably be a lot slower solo due to downtime and mana inefficiency compared to affliction.  If you want a "change of pace" to "slower" then yeah.  Less an issue in dungeons while you're drinking with the mage and priest, but painful while solo questing.

Destro is viable for wpvp with conflag ability and +fire gear instead of +shadow.

20g sounds about right. Righteous orbs go for about 20g on my server, and numerous tanks are advertising that number.
---
It sounds like a lot of gold, but if you've got a group of 4, that's 5g per person.

Rejuv, regrowth, ht r4. Your healing is mostly hots, keep them up on the tank then cast r4 HT or use the 5 second rule for mana.

Dude, the first time I ever played vanilla I rolled a warrior and wanted to tank.
---
It was abundantly obvious that in order to meet that goal I needed to join a guild with a tank spot. This isnt cryptic or hard to figure out and all mmos are like this.
---
This gane is all about the social aspect. Seriously what were you thinking? What did you expect?
---
@Xenna on Grobbulus(?)
---
Everyone talking fear... it's too unreliable. Hamstring and bandage is where it's at. Bandages are so important for a warrior I can't believe we are even having this conversation.
---
You do have to be more selective when you queue with the arena system. But then again, I'm not talking about "time spent in arena only". I'm talking about overall time spent playing the game.
---
In TBC especially, raid gear was insanely strong. You had to raid full time and get really good at arena to stand a chance at competing at the top. Yeah, you spent less time in arena than someone in Classic will spend in battlegrounds, but you still played the game like it was a full time job.
---
&gt; Server infrastructure and technology has improved in the last 15 years. Actually paying a subscription to use 15 year old infrastructure would be kinda baffling tbh. 
---
People who think like this are genuinely fascinating to me. They actually think the game is choking on purpose as part of some effort by blizzard to make the game bad for "realism" purposes
---
How much of a shill do you have to be to pay $15 a month and then defend literally indefensible amounts of lag
---
Rockbitter for slow weapon speed, Flametounge for fast weapon speed. Windfury is for PvP or if you wanna try your luck while questing.
---
If you don‚Äôt mind respeccing, go Ele until lvl 20. Then you can switch to enhance for 2H weapon. At lvl 40 you can swap between Enhance or Ele. I would suggest Enhance for instance grinding and Ele for solo.
---
Either strength or agility is good. Stamina is also great as enhance as you do take a lot of damage unless you‚Äôre kitting mobs.
---
Don‚Äôt tank dungeons.
---
Yes you can heal at 60 perfectly fine. 30/0/21 Ele/Resto is fine for 5man and even raid healing if you can get away a with it.
---
As I said before, 30/0/21 is a viable spec for healing/PvP. Technically it would be your Ele dps spec as well,  it like you said we have mana issues while dpsing. However Ele/Resto is a lot of fun for PvP.
---
No items I can think of. Of course get your totems, and any general quest items that all classes want. Like free 14/16 slot bags from quests, or pre-BiS items from quests. You can also get some cool items like the Nifty Stopwatch, or really stick glue from an early quest.
---
Got it, thanks!
---
Well sure, vanilla did it by reducing unit view distance. If there were 100 people pvping in vanilla, you would see people maybe 20 yards away from you at most. I don't think it's necessarily a better approach though.
---
Please pay no attention to the Night Elf on the Dreadsteed....
---
wow, where at lol, and after how long
---
Reeeeal. OUR COMPUTERS COULDN‚ÄôT EVEN HANDLE IT. We didn‚Äôt have SSDs! We didn‚Äôt have... shit! We were playing at like 30FPS (60 if you were lucky and had a high end HIGH END machine) and even the top tier fucking RAIDED RAPTOR GOD COMPUTERS lagged to shit every time you‚Äôd go into town. People keep forgetting about all that too.
---
Wtf
---
This post is amazing, my goodness.
---
It‚Äôs because details sucks, get recount
---
No amount of reactions will help you survive going into BRM unless that reaction is logging out when you have the idea of flying to Searing Gorge.
---
the theory goes like this:  retail relies on sharding to handle this many poeple, but we arent sharding in classic so everyone is jammed into one single overloaded shard.
---
however in order to truly understand what is occuring, you would need insider knowledge.  Anything else is mere speculation.
---
ppl joke about this a lot
---
but it seems true when you consider what most guilds see for loot versus what streamers see for loot
---
ive even see sulfron drop vendorstrike, a wand, and ZERO SHOULDER ITEMS
---
like wtf lol
---
That‚Äôs the point, only a certain few are *supposed* to get it.
---
I guess thats true
---
That is the norm for something with a 3% drop rate....which  again is the main point of this post. 
---
to give a little perspective, if they somehow went 4 for 4 and got 4 in a row on bindings on a 3% drop rate, that would be 0.00000081% chance of happening.  Im sure someone else can factor the math for having 2 shots at bindings a night over 8-9 chances total but the number is still astronomically far from even 1% chance of happening.
---
As I understand it, layering is using the same tech as sharding, but it is implemented through the entire server instead of a zone by zone basis.
---
You could do that at a certain point...grind out the gear at least. That you had to put a lot of time in to get the actual rank is completely fine I think..
---
Surely your kids go to bed? Or you have personal time once a week to do what you want? I'm all of those things as well and lvl 48, and I've done plenty of dungeons, they make levelling faster which also gives me more time to do the real life things I need to do.
---
They should take a page out of CCP‚Äôs book. Time dilation. I‚Äôm not settled on whether it should be zone wide or server wide. The gist is that each star or zone is its own instance. When that instance has a ton of people time dilation kicks in and everything slows down so the server can keep up with demand. 
---
Yes, a good portion of PvP is reaction time so that would be something to take into consideration. With Eve reaction time isn‚Äôt nearly as important at coordination with other players during large scale battles. However my counter to that is that time would dilate equally for everyone so *on average* the playing field would still be equal.
---
It's supposed to be unobtainable for 99.9% of players.
---
Is this...is this his thesis? Give this man a doctorate.
---
For real. That‚Äôs how you end up with weird fucking hacked items like Diablo II‚Äôs closed bnet.
---
&gt;not even a blip on the radar of endgame challenges in retail.
---
The OP is talking about casual play, not end game challenges.
---
What's sad is you needing to try and insult me directly to validate your point.
---
How did you get in contact with a gm ingame? Isn't that removed?
---
The argent custodian dropped for me in taranis. I‚Äôm a level 44 feral Druid. Should I keep it? I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs good for tanking which I hope to do. Other people are auctioning it for 20g.  
---
If I keep it what should I get for an off hand?
---
  Im not sure what it should have been, or what is should be.
---
     I think a massive goal that this system achieves is that there is very limited r14 players, which means very limited amounts on some of the strongest items in the game. This creates a sense of prestige for those who can dedicate themselves to no lifing.
---
     Now the no lifing part is up for discussion on whether or not blizz intended it to be this way, and I imagine it was not intended to be this way but it was the system they usedin the past, and should use in the present.
---
&gt;You can batch your casts meaning hit frostbolt key with about 0.2s left to cast on the previous bolt.
---
You have any proof of this working? It doesn't really make sense considering you could just spam your frostbolt button for the same effect.
---
There's an options in settings that resets the overall data after every boss enounter during a raid. Uncheck that. 
---
It's in the PVE or Raid tab, cant remember.
---
yes with stones they would have been dirty. but ban the stone not the spec was the thought, I am willing to bet they brought the top locks and had a chat about it all.
---
Higher rank spells do more damage. You might use a rank one frost bolt to slow an enemy, but you are going to spend a long time killing them with rank 1 spells.
---
No, nor do I need to to make the point I'm making.  I'm not claiming they should do this, only that they can.
---
So you think everyone deserves to be High Warlord or whatever the alliance version is? The system is punishing and only a select few will have the time and will to complete it, I am OK with this.
---
If you want some equivalent playing field regardless of time investment I suggest you take a look at retail wow.
---
I have a Level 22 Shaman Alt I send all my leather to and is currently 225. I want him to have a salt shaker. But I need to get him to 35 to master LW. Is questing the quickest way or is there somewhere I can Farm for XP which would be faster
---

"no changes philosophy"
---
like layering, early patches, higher epic/blue boe drop rates, auto bag replacing...
---
We're playing 2 different games -- we just meet up every once in awhile
---
Did they have consumables or world buffs that you didn't have?
---
Your note on how the fireballs works is incorrect. You state that if someone stacks with the MT, the MT's threat will not be wiped, but that isn't necessarily true. Every time fireball is cast, the target or one of the people by them in range to be hit had their threat wiped. Just because the MT's threat isn't wiped in your raid does not mean that that will be true for other raids. 
---
The most up to date, outrageous and apparently confirmed (by a lot of test runs) theory is that the player who has the lowest GUID value for their character will have their threat wiped, so you need to have your MT paired with someone with a lower GUID value.
---
Edit: changed higher to lower
---
Vanilla Suramar represent!
---
I think you get dishonorable kills for flight masters, so it shouldn't be a big issue.
---
Dude 40% of your screen is ui. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?
---
Essentially any high level caster mob can yield okay-ish gold per hour.
---
Use your max rank spells. As a mage, you'll really only want rank 1 of Polymorph (as effective as all other ranks), rank 1 Frost Nova for rooting, and rank 1 of Arcane Explosion to knock rogues and druids out of stealth. There might be edge cases for a low ranked frostbolt to apply a slow.
---
Downranking is used to save mana, and is primarily a healer thing. Don't save your mana; kill stuff.
---
I got downvoted in another thread for agreeing that this is the most plausible explanation.
---
That‚Äôs fucking ridiculous, stop spewing this kind of bullshit
---
yea, its tragic because the game has the potential for some amazing events truly fitting the title of King of MMo's, but as of now its kinda disheartening to walking BRM and  then just die 3 min later with no indication of what happened. My biggest fear is the issues with world bosses there is just no way they can function as things sit
---
Always use highest rank frostbolt for the most damage. Rank one frostbolt applies the same slow as the higher ranks but it casts faster so it's commonly used in PvP. Rank one nova should always be used cause it just costs less mana. Rank one Blizzard can be useful in a pinch to keep the slow without spending the huge mana of a max rank blizzard. Rank one Arcane Exposion can be used to fish for clearcasting procs once you get the talent Arcane Concentration. So yeah it's kind of a spell by spell basis.
---
Do you know the location or name of the trainer for this in Orgrimmar or undercity so I can look up on wowhead how to find them?
---
I did.
---
You might not have enough spirit, or you're not utilizing it properly. I have about 125 spirit right now which gives me about 43 mana per tick. The ideal way to use imp. Soul drain is to immediately start casting your DoT rotation on the next enemy when the current target dies. In this case, you can look at it as 5 free ticks of spirit regen. That's 215 mana that I get back, minus 55 mana to cast the soul drain, that's a net 160 mana that I get back for every fight. The bonus only keeps getting larger as I improve my spirit as well. 
---
Let's compare that to improved life tap, which is commonly seen as the superior choice. Using the rank 3 life tap values since I'm only level 29, 20% of 140 is 28 mana bonus per life tap. 160 divided by 28 is 5.7 - meaning I'd have to life tap 6 times PER FIGHT for the improved life tap to be more valuable than improved soul drain. But, since I use imp. Soul drain, I almost never have to tap at all.
---
Planetside has terrible lag even with 10 players, not to mention a couple hundred. And the render distance drops to like 3 feet at that point.
---
Classic leveling is easy too but its a far more rewarding experience, and I think that's what OP is getting at.
---
I'd argue that the lower pop servers are going to be easier to rank on because the super hardcore players are concentrated on the original launch servers and sat through 6+ hour queues to be on those servers.
---
People who took characters transfers or rolled on servers that were created a few days after launch are probably more chill.
---
If it didn't delay the release of BWL / BGs etc I would be fine wth it.
---
But adding months more of just MC/ONY would be terrible for the game.
---
Also if Blizzard could easily fix the servers they would have one it already.  I just don't think the current client is designed to have large scale PvP like that without it lagging.  They likely couldn't solve the problem even if you gave them a couple more months to fix it.
---
It‚Äôs not about time taken to do stuff, both are long.. just that in classic when you do stuff you feel like it‚Äôs meaningful cause that‚Äôs permanent progression. Whether you farmed gold or a certain item, once you have it you have it you have it.
---
&gt;then give them to the most deserving   
---
As a soon-to-be lvl 60 warrior i imagine i wont be MTing in our guild anytime soon.  So if i raid should i just not expect any loot for months?
---
I really enjoyed the post but hashtag no changes
---
imagine caring about good gameplay
---
lets just keep posting casual dadgamer shit content instead
---
\#onechange should be respecs only 10g
---
The beauty of classic is that you don't have to PvP to earn PvP itemized gear like Deep Earth Spaulders. By doing both PvP and PvE you get the very best gear for most of the content.
---
By just doing PvE you are off well enough in PvP encounters to not participate in ranking.
---
Go for R6 for R3 cheaper repairs and R6 potions and call it a day.
---
Not everybody needs to have everything and if you acknowledge the PvP grind more akin the gong questline, you will be happier, because only a select few can do it - and this is fine.
---
If you‚Äôre referencing the pre-1.10 godlike ‚Äúfused‚Äù items worth a fortune on d2jsp, yup.
---
Blizzard has gotten really careful at preventing stuff like that as time went on.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an issue on the new ladder resets for D2 these days
---
There hasn't been an announcement at all about anything, I want to give them the benefit of a doubt and say they are looking into the cause before they make an announcement but pessimistically i feel like  the wow classic is the stepchild to them and all they really care about is keeping us Subbed while they develop Shadow-lands.
---
Soul link soul link soul link
---
No.  Not even close.  The go to spec for everything, outside of raids, is shadow. 
---
The thing you have to figure out is how to make a better profit -100g/week from spec dancing for those raids. 
---
Now shadow, from kills, quests, and basically being able to farm elites solo, will most certainly make greater gold flow than that shitty 20-30g/h in dm:e. 
---
That‚Äôs without even talking about farming professions.    That shit covers your weekly cost and then some. 
---
People get this narrow tunnel vision tossed on them by a streamer from pservers and then can‚Äôt seem to think for themselves. 
---
It‚Äôs really sad.  Look at the entire picture for fucks sake.
---
But that's not active players, is it? We got to compare Nost's cap with current active players (concurrence).

My havanese does like to perch like a cat

I've heard of the arcane explosion fishing trick but I read somewhere that it did work due to it only procing once per cast as opposed to once per mob. I could be misunderstanding though
---
You don't keep the title in vanilla.  However, in TBC, my hunter had the achievement for Rank 14 which gives you the title to show thereafter.

Too early IMO unless you're being carried. Final boss is 47.

---
&gt; there is no blocker in sharding the workload other than simply investing the time to do it.
---
You know this because you work as blizzard and have a deep understanding of the code base/infrastructure, right? If you don't then you are talking out your butt, and precursing your comment that you are a developer is meaningless. 
---
-- also a developer
---
Omg, your full , aren‚Äôt you?  Never go full man.
---
99% sure I remember not being able to buy any of the weapons after dropping from Rank 14.
---
Also depends on the mobs you're fighting. For example, humanoids and undead drop cloth, not cooking meat. At least, dear god, I hope not.
---
To a degree with bears anyway. Unlike warriors, whh have tmost of their abilities run off of static high threat amounts, we go based off of our damage for threat. Agility is really great for crits and Dodge if you can get a ton of it, but if you have low strength, your attacks won't do much dmg and that's what your crits and mails would be multiplying off of for threat. So you don't want to be hitting for just 150-200 or 250 mauls every 2.5 while everyone else is pulling 1k crits and more.
---
But yeah I totally get that being hitcapped would do more dmg in the long run
---
I don't think mind numbing poison is the answer as druids have poison dispel. Druids in PvP should be treated as a healer. You want to kick their heals and try and land stuns on them in caster form. Beat them up in bear until they go caster, then get them while they are vulnerable. If they go cat they are just a crap rogue. In general though druids are strongest early game whilst other classes have low dps. They don't scale as well into later phases.
---
I do think the most dangerous PvP druid spec for rogues is a moonglow spec using a lot of caster form. But not many people level with that.
---
which add-ons allow you to see enemy buffs?
---
1. Doesn't matter really. Use 2h rockbiter while leveling always, but rockbiter is only slightly better than other enchants which is why people will often argue for flametongue or windfury. WF for example sometimes adds more DPS than rockbiter, but often overkills mobs so it ends up performing worse.
---
2. Yes enhancement is much better 1-40. Afterwards they have comparable leveling speed but elemental will spend tons of gold on water.
---
3. Str &gt; Agi. Ignore intellect gear. Intellect doesn't boost spell damage in vanilla, it only increases mana pool and provides a negligible boost to spell crit.
---
4. You can tank dungeons before 40 but if you do you can expect a lot of resistance from ignorant and minmaxing players. Frankly I'd expect it to be a bad experience with PUGs purely because of people's mentalities. Even normal tanks like warriors and druids frequently lose aggro to careless trigger happy dps, but as a shaman tanking you'd often have them fingerpointing you as the problem. I wouldn't bother tanking level 40+ dungeons as they are starting to get somewhat challenging at that level.
---
5. You can easily solo heal all dungeons. Just make sure you have intellect gear and you'll be fine.
---
6. You can but expect some resistance and rejection from groups. Your DPS as elemental will be competitive but you will have mana issues that will make your overall damage done throughout the instance low if your group isn't waiting all the time between pulls.
---
Doit
---
Oh ok then its easy mate
---
Usually guilds bank the mats till they are getting close to Nef, mass create them and hand them out before the raid.  The tanks on the other hand will get them earlier.
---
Thank you kind sir, I think my buddy was trying to explain this to me cause hes a priest, was very tired so must have confuzzled me
---
Unlikely. There's gonna be a large segment of the population with the same idea as you, but are already level 60 and geared
---
Quest and grind. Ignore delivery quests/out of zone travel, just pick up the kill/drops quests.  
---
If you have good and willing groups, you could probably get another level or two out of WC and then grind out SFK and RFK.
---
&gt; We need to stop sweeping this issue under the rug   
---
WTF
---
This. Once we get to phase 3 we can wait a while because WSG +AV + 3 raids is a ton of content and if you get bored getting an alt through that content is another time sink. Currently theres just not a ton to do for level capped geared players and the early reasoning of "you rushed" isnt applicable anymore
---
I'm not talking about expansions.  I'm talking about Vanilla, and no where did I assert that my status as a customer has anything to do with me playing in 2005.
---
I did however play a lot in Vanilla,  100+ days before AQ was out so I do have an idea what it was like,  and there wasn't game crippling lag when raids would encounter each other.  Maybe the issue isn't always present,  maybe it only happens on high pop servers.  I don't know all of the specifics but the problem does exist and it doesn't need to, and it shouldn't.
---
But just to be sure, the assertion you are making is that since the servers can't handle Open world  Raid Vs Raid pvp   if we don't like that we should just unsubscribe?   I guess that's the same for the issues that exist with FD, Vanish, Spell Batching etc.   If we don't like that they aren't implemented correctly we should just unsub?
---
You are OK with Blizzard not fixing these things because if you weren't you would Unsub?
---
Where do you people come from that so fervently defend anything and everything Blizzard?   Is it just to be contrarian?  Or do you just have that much of a Hardon for Blizz?    It is actually OK to ask a company that you are paying a monthly subscription to make improvements to their product.  Really, it is.   In fact its actually a good thing to ask them to work on these issues.   Its good for them too...   You just suggested I unsub.   Your attitude towards allowing these issues is only allowing the game to be worse than it can be.  Maybe you'll get your wish and a bunch of people will unsub, wouldn't that be great.  Then you can all circle jerk to blizz together in your dying servers.
---
Yeah because starting with a small amount of servers  and clumping everyone together then having people transfer to dead unbalanced servers is definitely the better scenario right?
---
S1 shadow resist gear (RIP my shadowcleave), glaive rogues, and your second-slot PVE trinket were the only raid gear that was superior. 
---
People that were good probably played a lot - in particular we BG'd a ton, sold 1850 weaps on 3s teams etc ... but the people I played with barely raided, and you're moving the goalposts in this comparison. Certainly Vanilla raid gear was vastly more influential.
---
This is how you kill a good meme. smh
---
Lmao the truth comes out
---
But casual play is however he wants to define it, as the casual player. He chose to do a heroic dungeon instead of something remotely challenging, then complained it wasn't challenging. When pointed out this fallacy, you came in to defend it with an egregiously wrong point. If your point wasn't so hyperbolic, I wouldn't have said anything.
---
Lol you go start a new guild and we'll be waiting on your Rag kill post
---
I would disagree with the above comment about tanking dungeons. I‚Äôm leveling a shaman tank right now and I‚Äôve only just gotten mail now that I‚Äôm at level 41.
---
I‚Äôve tanked every dungeon thus far with the exception of stocks and deadmines and it is absolutely doable.
---
There are a few things though to make both tanking and the whole group‚Äôs experience easier as well if you do decide to tank while leveling
---
1. You really do have to take the talents that lend themselves to tanking. Shield spec is a MUST, as is thundering strikes, flurry, and toughness. That‚Äôs 20 points in enhancement right there and although it‚Äôs probably doable without these, it makes everyone‚Äôs life easier 
---
2. Make sure you‚Äôre towards the top end of the level bracket of the dungeon. Since most of our threat comes from rockbiter auto attacks, we have to be able to hit the mobs. If too much of the dungeon is orange it can make our tanking really difficult really quick. What I‚Äôve done is looked up the dungeon and made sure I was the level of the highest level trash mob. Some of the final bosses are several levels above and that‚Äôs fine to be underleveled for one fight, but to make sure that you‚Äôre either at the level of the rest of the dungeon or above definitely helps
---
3. Prioritize gear with stamina. This probably goes without saying but is especially important because of the lack of damage mitigation from having leather armor. Hit points serve as our de facto armor, as its ok if we get hit for a little more as long as we can take more hits. 
---
4. On that same vein, make sure you upgrade your shield as frequently and as best as you possibly can, as this is the bulk of our armor and thus bulk of our damage mitigation. 
---
5. Finally, know that not everyone is gonna be ok with you tanking as a shaman and that‚Äôs alright (^^^) but definitely start with an easier dungeon like ragefire or wailing caverns or even shadowfang to make sure you know how to tank as a shammy and what your tools are.
---
Feel free to message me or comment with any additional questions or concerns about shaman tanking, more than happy to offer what I know and have learned so far
---
For a casual player the game is about the road to 60, not raiding or pvp ranking. In that logic, you don‚Äôt need to endlessly grind stuff since that‚Äôs not how they their gameplay is not end game focused. 
---
&gt;	it‚Äôs about hardcore grinding if you want to be at the top
---
True, but if you don‚Äôt want to be at the top, it‚Äôs very easy to play causally. In retail even the casuals have to do so much stuff daily and weekly till it feels like a chore
---
Which guild are you in?
---
Someone got bored working on their senior thesis.
---
What about just delaying World bosses, Phase 2 honor system can roll out and phase 3 could even be released on time. IF its just a WpvP issue  i don't see why they couldn't just delay those aspects instead of releasing a system set up to fail from day 1
---
I play neither.
---
Apples and oranges my friend.  Blizzard is dealing with millions of connections, a private realm is not, and the way Classic has an effective "instance" for each zone is totally different to the way private realms generate maps, as is the way location data and spell data is transferred.  
---
All these people saying the "artificial spell batching" was a great idea, I think THIS is the fundamental cause of the lag.  I was just a scrub GM on private realm for a number of years, and I am no networking engineer or code monkey, but I can tell you trying to make comparisons between private realms and classic is simply ridiculous.  The day Nostalrius closed our little private realm went from 400 peaks to 1700 online in about 2 hours, that created a HUGE issue for our server even though we had sufficient RAM allocation and user bandwidth.  The issue could lie in many areas, it could also be a combination of factors, and it could also have been a financial design decision by Blizzard.  
---
Fact is the problem is not a case of spend more money, or turn it up to eleven.

Edit: Actually its just a load of IF and SW portals which is not too unexpected with 100+ players and a lot of mages.
---
I want the drugs you‚Äôre snorting out of Kotick‚Äôs asscheeks please they must be fantastic.
---
Funny, I've played since Vanilla and distinctly remember the server lag getting horrible every time there were large groups of people in one zone. I remember horde raiding IF/SW and crashing our world server and before that it was a rubber banding lag fest.
---
Using PServer's as a reference for how it gets done is silly. Blizzard's official servers have a lot more information to verify from the client to make sure they are not botting/hacking.
---
Also people have been complaining because Classic couldn't handle 200v200(I'd like to see the actual numbers since these things are always hyperbolic to the extreme) while you link a video of something no where near 200v200 from what can be seen and again probably spoken of with fudged numbers.
---
Finally, there are zero games on the market that can handle 200v200 battles lag free. Camelot Unchained is building their engine from the ground up specifically because there is no engine on the market that can do it already.
---
What I mean is this doesn't allow you to cast frostbolts faster than 2.5s, it just helps ensure you are casting them every 2.5s, instead of every 2.55s or 2.6s due to lag, etc.
---
Well you will eventually need tailoring for the bloodvine set but releveling it later shouldn‚Äôt be difficult or expensive.
---
I had an enh shammy refuse to drop wf for me. After asking for the 3rd time and him refusing because "agi is useful for both of us" the rest of the group jumped all over him because they were terrified I was gonna bail.
---
If you're a dps you do what you what the tank asks. Whether it's right that tanks have that much power is debatable but they do so if you want to stay in a group you should probably listen to the tank.
---
This is exactly it! 
---
I'm a newer player. I played FF:O, Black Desert, Tera, and many other MMOs before I touched WoW, and I always felt like there was something missing from them. When I tried out vanilla WoW for the first time on a private server a year ago, I finally found out what is was; Difficulty! 
---
In those MMOs I played, I never came close to dying in a single one of them during the PvE content up until endgame. It was all grind grind grind without the challenge. There was no real sense of accomplishment, because all I put in was time, with no effort. And don't even get me started on the lack of social aspect to modern MMOs. You could do all the content without help from a single other player.
---
I tried retail out when I got my subscription for Classic WoW and it was *exactly* like all those other MMOs I could never fully enjoy.
---
If you simply don't understand the limitations and the difference between pservers/blizzard cloud then don't comment. It's realy not hard.
---
Hell yeah dude. Rust storm and warden helped against that stuff. But I had white rings for days, some swords with runewords that had the runes removed and replaced with 40/15s, and an ETHEREAL BOW (my favourite)
---
It's definitely still worth doing. All that means is you have a 10% chance for clearcasting *per cast* and not a 10% chance for every mob you hit. Some people didn't know how that was going to work going into classic cause I think some private servers had it the other way around which would make mages broken as hell and have near infinite mana.
---
Lmao this is a joke right? xD  
---
Ganking extremely undergeared players, healers in pve cloth, pummeling nothing several times. 1:21 is as far as I got.
---
Easy to obtain you say?
---
If the blue pvp armor is in the game I'll probably swap to that when I hit those ranks. The gloves at the very least for searing pain pushback resistance. That's probably when I'll consider swapping to destro. 
---
I thoroughly like having 1 main ability that has some spell pushback resistance. As affliction its drain life, as destro it will be searing pain. 
---
If/when I can get t2 helm I'll swap out of 8 set t1. But so far the mana reductions from 8 set is extremely useful.
---
Blizzard has never focused on world PVP as a feature and have done everything reasonable to discourage it. When has blizzard every shown actions to support world pvp in any way?
---
Ah yeah, I prefer one experience over another so I'm just sucking up to blizz. Grow up.
---
now this is the kind of r/classicwow content we need. and i fully agree, time to petition blizzard for this change
---
Zygor
---
I always use fear and bandage, it hava save me a ton of times
---
Gnomes should really only have 0.5% more crit or so?
---
You only get to specialize in one of the two. In order to switch, you have to drop the profession, and relevel it from 0. Assuming you don't have the same issue that the OP did, once you get back up to the level to choose, you then can pick up the goblin quest.
---
I don't believe you. Herod had like 7 full layers 2.5k-3k and then a 24k que for weeks. 
---
That's more than any private server even attempted to say they had. And that's just one classic server.
---
There is not.
---
no just going 31 points into arms while leveling is a mistake
---
Gonna copy this for my English 220 class and change a few things so teacher can't google it and see this come up in the first result.
---
1) as enchancement I use rockbitter more than WF, especially if I haven't had WF spell upgrade in awhile. RB is constant damage, where WF can go hot and cold. I personally didn't care if the wep was fast or slow, as long as it was dps upgrade. 
---
2) from what I have read, enhance to 40, switch as long as you have been saving casting gear for ele, otherwise keep leveling as enhance and start saving up casting gear.
---
3) agility is crit, crit is flurry. flurry is more hits. I prioritized ag over str
---
4) yes. 
---
5) you can. imo the best group for a resto shaman would be: druid or warrior tank, then 3 warriors or rogues.
---
6) you can and you will have mana issues. Ele, Oomkins, Enh and Spriest all suffer from lack of mana on longer fights.
---
7) keep your weapons upgraded. check out a leveling guide, they will have a list of wep upgrade for your levels. Corpsemaker at lvl29 is huge, because WF wep is lvl30. staves are your friend, especially the mara princess quest staff. I still use it while mount to help regen.
---
On stormstrike, Frost shock, flame shock, earth shock and lightening bolt, I have made macros that removed me from ghostwolf, dismounts, starts attacking and casts the ability.
---
only buy the relevant spells you use while leveling up to 40 to help save gold for mount.
---
use rank 1 lightening bolt to pull (only lightening bolt I use as enhancement) and use rank 1 earthshock for interrupts.
---
mouse over macros for heals
---
takes 20 secs for mana spring to give you the mana back it costs to cast it.
---
still wonder how much wpvp there will be as soon as the BGs go live.
---
Was he as hard as first time or they nerfed him a lot?
---
You mean base 16.
---
Gryphons are carnivores.
---
Hence I said. There if you want it. It's not something you often come across.
---
I said in other post they will not do anything and just release bgs earlier if too much people complaint
---
Yes faceroll, now telll is all how many times you died to 60.. or the average deaths overall to 60. Levelling is not hard but it‚Äôs 100% hardER.
---
Yeah exactly assuming equal skill though rogues would win everytime. Based on your previous comment I assumed you were beating most rogues cause you're better then them.
---
Our guild got one last night as well and it was our 2nd clear, haven't even down Rag yet,-Kromcrush
---
something i want to mention that i don't think other people have yet regarding aoe fear &amp; bandage:
---
intimidating shout is special in that the main target you use it on will stand still in shock but will instantly break out of it as soon as it takes any damage (even 1 tick of bleed damage is enough to break it) so its more like a gouge effect, but all other additional mobs around it will run around in fear and can take some damage before their fear wears off.
---
this means that if you have the deep wounds talent then you must be very careful with the timing and only fear once the bleed has worn off if you want to use bandage at the same time. 
---
additionally if you're fighting multiple mobs at the same time, it's better to use intimidating shout on the higher-health mob that you aren't focusing so that the main mob which might have bleeds on it won't break as it will get the fear effect on it instead of the gouge effect.
---
My guess is that the spell batching systems are causing most of this, as its trying to send out all the data at intervals, rather than like on a private realm when its based on demand.
---
&gt;everyone else on the server,  
---
No!  The rankings are based on everyone else on your server's faction.  Horde != Alliance.
---
Bags, profession mats, potions (swiftness potion and free action potions can help while leveling, although I dunno how useful they are for a hunter.
---
Which consumables exactly?
---
Under level dungeons like SFK, no competition, a few BOEs worth as well.  Solo dungeons is a different experience. 
---
Not sure there's any particular mob with better greys than others. 
---
Level up fishing and go for deviates, nightfin, squid, etc.
---
Play the AH.
---
&gt; Onyxia phase 2, melee have nothing to do if no whelps spawn,
---
In our guild, melee picks up the whelps and ranged stay on Ony.  A mage might nova them if they get too close or help clean them up while the tanks are still trying to get aggro after she lands, but that's it. It works great‚Äîno wipes, no deaths to whelps, and the fastest kills on the server.
---
You got any proof that the numbers don't match 1.12? Otherwise you're just spewing garbage.
---
&gt;!It gets worse with phase 2!&lt;
---
Changed my life. I watch at 2x for maximum efficiency.
---
Not moving the goalposts, just clarifying. Read my original post and I never said that you have to queue arena for 14 hours a day. I said that you have to *play* 14 hours a day.
---
You agree that you played a lot. That's what I'm getting at. Any competitive system that only allows a fraction of a percentage of players to get the top rewards will have the same issues as the Classic PvP system.
---
Listen man his boomer brain is doing its best okay?
---
I think you should take a break from the game.
---
Yes but the point is is that people can't leave (unless hearth) if FP is dead, that causes only people to come in and more fighting.
---
Daisy still needs her old shorts back. I mean this is a major bug.
---
Someome downvoted because you should pretty much never fear in an instance lol. Bandages have tons of usage in and out of dunegons. You can bandage a warlock while your healer drinks for the next pull. You can bandage yourself to be ready for the next pull faster. You can bandage your healer who sat down immediately to drink after the fight.
---
Honestly, yeah. I'd rather servers start dead than die later on.
---
You wanted No Changes baby you GOT no changes.  We still running these on potato blades!
---
Thank you, never leveled engineering before, I edited my comment.
---
I would never heal it during combat. Just pull it back and let it regenerate. My pet is always on passive in raids. Pet attack is bound to mousewheel up. Recall to mousewheel down.
---
Yeah, fair point. However judging by the sheer amount of people at the graveyard I still think it's the GMs work. Who's gonna take a spirit ress sickness right next to a enemy capital city? That's just suicide
---
It is only unreliable if you run deep wounds.
---
Elixirs of agility. Maybe some mana potions. Mp5 food. A cheap scope for the bow.
---
BRM will be a battleground for sure. I'd like to hope that people will organize in Hillsbrad but there will be far more people at BRM
---
Of course you don't NEED a geared tank, hell you don't even NEED a tank.  A geared tank just makes it easier, faster, less loot competition, and generally better.  If you only go by what you NEED in this game, you are going to have a bad time.
---
I can actually see this happening. But instead of welfare epics we get loot box epics.
---
Why does it still say 2019 even though we traveled back in time with Cromie??
---
Private servers run warden, they also run other custom logs for any number of things.  Private servers are also an "emulator" so are actually probably far LESS efficient than Blizz code and data processing.   
---
Private realms dont run on an "artificial spell batching" system they push data in and out at every available opportunity, and this is why players see noticeable improvements.
---
The servers will not be able to handle the pvp from phase 2.
---
Cant meet the rule of cool of your faction isnt cool to begin with
---
Some people get unlucky but yeah arena runs are super easy to do and find a group for whenever.
---
I play on a 2012 MacBook. Just play on whatever you find for a good price
---
.0009% chance of getting both in 1 run :p
---
Either way gratz to them, games are designed to have fun in, I know I look forward to the chance of having such a cool item, just lowers the prestige a little bit, but whatever its a video game.

For what it‚Äôs worth I totally get it. In the moment though it‚Äôs like the bloodlust is up and you‚Äôre not worried about a fair fight you just wanna punish the enemy for all the wrongs their faction has done to you in the past.

More people i see in org and around are 60 rather than not. When i try to make s group for scholo strath or dm, the likelyhood of a lvl 57-59 messaging me for an invite is very rare compared to a 60.  Now if you are talking about people who only play for 3 hours a week, the game should not revolve release cycles around them.

Hey no lag with 0 pop though. Finally playable /s
---
As far as pre-raid bis goes for melee DPS, yes you'll be competing for items.  If you're going for the actual dps warrior pre-raid bis list then you're looking at helm, shoulders (more on those two later), cape, both rings, Hand of Justice, +hit bow as far as competition goes.  
---
With that said, let's look at what loot is actually an issue. The main trouble here is Hand of Justice.  If you are both willing to help each other get it then that's great.  You will both need it, and everyone has a problem with this piece whether they have competition or not. 
---
Second biggest issue is probably your cape, you have two options, both in Strat. 
---
Everything else isn't bad at all:
---
Blackstone ring can be farmed if you're willing to run a lot of Princess so I'd say that's your next biggest issue (BTW you could grab a healer and go 3 man this) However, you can do tribute runs now and get the Elven Ring.  They're not unique either, so you can have two if you want.  Your ring options aren't bad, there's Blackstone Ring, Painweaver band, and the Elven Rings.  Plenty of rings to go around. 
---
Hit bow.  Pretty easily farmed in DM:E.  I got it 4 out of 5 runs yesterday for example.  Granted drop rates aren't always as good but this WILL drop for you both at some point without too much hastle unless you're *extremely* unlucky, and the plus is running DM:E is pretty good money anyways. 
---
Truestrike shoulders.  You don't NEED them asap, you can both do a quest and get Wyrmhide Spaulders, easy.  Truestrike is just an upgrade.  But neither of you will be hurting for shoulders after doing your quest.
---
Helm.  Getting Mask of the Unforgiven isn't too bad but can take quite a few runs, Eye of Rend is harder (but if your or him is going for dalrend set it will just end up being an inevitable result that this drops during that time most likely).  The good thing is you also have two mail helms that grant you great stats that you can get, which I haven't been able to figure out why they're not on the list.  One gives you +1 crit and +40 attack power while offering you +20 stamina and 301 armor, so it's a great helm (Crown of Tyranny from Strat).  The other gives you +1 crit AND +21 agility, so effectively its over +2 crit, also 301 armor and +13 stamina (Backwood Helm, you get it from a DM quest!).  You have a lot of helm options! 
---
That's it.  Everything else he can't wear.  Mail boots, plate bracers, quest rewards for neck and belt.
---
Next you're going to tell me Activision is run by human-alien hybrids, Mr Jones.
---
Unless you either enjoy it or are doing it for something specific, drop enchanting.  You can make money on a couple of big ticket items perhaps; but both levelling it and looking for said items is really not efficient, because of the amount of time involved.
---
Level herbalism, alchemy, cooking, and fishing, and go into instance and raid consumables.  Health and mana/rage pots, and stat increase pots and food.  Those are things where it doesn't matter how much competition you've got; if you price both frugally and consistently, they will always sell, because people need them.
---
Don't aim either for the lowest or the highest end of the market; on my server at least, both linen and mageweave cloth go to the NPC vendors, because everyone on the AH hugs the vendor price that closely that there's literally no point.  Silk, however, is mid-range, which means I can always sell it, both because people always need it, and because sellers put their margins high enough for it that I can still undercut them.
---
Likewise with the health potions.  On my server, the lowest level health potions sell for literal copper; there is no point selling them at all.  The level 30-40 ones though; there's money there.  The microtransaction sharks aren't interested in pots at that level, because they take enough work to either make or farm that you still want a decent margin for your work.  So you sell above the sharks, and below the flippers, and you make maybe 20-30% over vendor price if you're lucky.
---
Don't mind the flippers, either.  Let them buy you out.  If a flipper wants to buy my stuff and mark it up himself, that's his business.  I don't want that risk, because if I mark things up too high, I will get undercut and lose my deposit money for the auction, while not making any either.
---
heres some footage from their stress test https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1GaLM3ofoM
---
Well damage in raid for melee is uptime and bosses do have snare mechanics / cc. So it does make sense. Plus if you make every rogue in sub cb able to have imo sprint too, it just is op af. Granite you def go imp sprint without cold blood once you have good enough gear that has dependable crit chance.

I think it depends on your role. If you off tank you will most likely get lots of loot. If you're a fury warr like me it might take a little while to get some loot. I've been raiding maybe about a month? And I haven't won anything BUT we have a loot council system set up now so I have priority in certain items like the head of onyxia and Spinal Reaper. As a fury you gotta be patient st the start.
---
There are no bugs in classic wow
---
What I said is correct though.  The main tanks threat will not be wiped if he takes a fireball with someone else.  The point is to not have the main tanks threat dropped to make a transition into phase 3 go smoothly.
---
He should find a guildie orfriend to run with were they split everything. One guy takes everything. Sells and send half to the other.

Oh, I had to take entire day breaks from the game because I had quests that took me into caves and whenever one would run away it would aggro 10 things and I'd insta die. I wouldn't even go into caves for ores to mine because I knew even if I got in i'd never be able to get out without hearthing.

Bunch of miserable cynical asshats around here. Dont worry about them
---
Typical reddit user. Dismissing other people‚Äôs concerns and putting words in their mouth like accusing them of creating problems when they only expressed a concern.
---
Is that really "hard" though? It's not hard, it's just taking your time. It's not like the mechanics require a whole lot of movement or proper interrupts or hiding behind pillars.
---
You didn't mention a stopcasting macro or anything, so I don't see why trying to time it would be any faster than spamming.
---
If you pick up all the kill/drop quests for a zone then go farm them all out for 2-4 turn ints that can be great XP.  
---
Questing for XP is largely trying to optimize travel time.  If you know the quests well you can pick up quests for a zone that are outside the zone, then head in and do a a dozen quests 4 at a time for big turn in cycles. 
---
A detailed guide can help, or you can simply optimize which quests you choose to do in a more haphazard fashion.  Kill/drop quests in the world are good, travel is bad.  If you think "time to go to ABC zone..." you may wish to check online what quests start outside that zone and hoover them all up before heading in, as this may be an extra 2-4 quest pick ups, and its best to get the travel for those over with before heading in then focus inside the zone.

I used to like the Classic trees until I sat down on my warlock in TBC and realized that most of the talent choices that were available to me were just "wrong" for a lack of a better term. I had a cookie-cutter build based on my role of "affliction bitch" in order to buff the mages in our raid group. I did like coordinating with the other warlocks on who was going to take what rank of Improve Healthstone, but aside from that talent there wasn't much customization.
---
My biggest beef with the old talent trees is that some of the talents in them seemed like they should have been baseline. I'll go back to my vanilla/TBC warlock where the first five points you put into any talent tree was to make Corruption have no cast time. In fact, once the talent tree changes rolled out, they wound up just making Corruption always an instant cast. 
---
As far as the new-style talents go, I like the idea of them but hated how we got nothing new in BFA in terms of talent ranks as there was no level 120 talent choice. I feel the level squish in Shadowlands will allow these talent choices to "feel better" as you'll gain a new talent choice every five levels starting at level 10. We'll have to wait to see how it's implemented but I hope that this will provide some sense of character progression that many people seem to miss.
---
And I'm with you on the removal of class flavor. Some class mechanics needed to be cleaned up with my main example being paladins. Seals and then Judgments were a clunky, poorly-executed mess that were confusing to casual players, at least in my opinion.
---
On the other hand, I hate what they did to combat rogues in Legion where, all of a sudden, that tree went away and we had this swashbuckling hero type. And, again, with warlocks and the Demonology tree moving away from having a bad ass demon form and being able to summon the biggest, meanest demons in the Twisting Nether to summoning a bunch of unremarkable imps and a couple of slightly altered felhounds.
---
As an aside, I do want to say I appreciate the great conversation on the topic!
---
&gt;They were trying to say Flash Heal(Rank 4) should be the primary heal to save Mana... I had to take them back to math school
---
Well since we are healing MC and it's rare to have to use anything else than flash heal, they are technically not wrong. Probabloy not for the good reasons tho.
---
Just look at the bebuffs on the boss and it's the same icon as the one for Winter's Chill in the talent tree. Should have a little number on it that shows the stacks. Max is 5.

I should probably clarify how I do this:
---
* MB5: 'tclap' macro
---
* MB4: 'shield block' macro
---
* 'R': 'shutup' macro
---
* NUM9: 'chin' macro
---
* NUM8: [will likely be something using Berserker's Rage]
---
* SHIFT+4: 'ohnoes' macro
---
EDIT: My Num9 and Num8 are actually input commands from the side 'g' keys of my G700s; G6 and G7 specifically.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by "thinking about what stance you want to be in". It's best to get the key layout done early or you're just going to screw yourself later as you get new abilities to use and have to 'reshuffle' abilities.
---
..macros save enormous amounts of button spots.
---
&gt; Gladiator also requires that same time commitment. 
---
It doesn't, the investment is far far less.
---
&gt; Arena ratings get inflated by people who play 14+ hours a day. You won't be able to keep up with the rating inflation unless you play as much or more as those other players. 
---
This is untrue. Arena ratings are not inflated by people playing more, and you don't have to play more than another team to be ranked higher. There is little to no correlation.
---
&gt; You still have to win games, but all it takes is a few players who can win games and also play a lot to make it impossible for a "good" player
---
At this point you've tied 'time invested' directly to arena, not general time spent in game. It's unclear how two teams that both win games, but one team spends more time logged in fishing and picking herbs, leads to the second team getting glad. 
---
&gt; Any competitive system that only allows a fraction of a percentage of players to get the top rewards will have the same issues
---
Not at all. The issue with classic WoW PVP is that it directly rewarded time investment. Spend more time, get ranked higher. Systems that indirectly reward time investment, like if you put in more time you will get better at the game, which then might lead to higher ranking, have this issue to a much smaller extent. Pretty much everything in life has at least an indirect linkage with time investment/effort, so the only question is how direct the correlation is, and classic WoW PVP was horrible on that front.
---
I just... what?!  
---
&gt; Blizzard is dealing with millions of connections
---
Not on one server!  
---
You don't go, 
---
  &gt; "Microsoft deals with millions of connections so obviously that's why my minecraft is slow."
---
Just... no.  That's not a legitimate reason this is happening. 
---
&gt; trying to make comparisons between private realms and classic is simply ridiculous
---
Of course it isn't.  They're doing the same job.  It's like saying comparing one car to another isn't valid because they're built completely differently.  Sure.. but I can still compare them and say one of the two is horribly slow. 
---
&gt; Fact is the problem is not a case of spend more money, or turn it up to eleven.
---
I completely agree with you here.  My point is not that they can fix this quickly or easily, nor is it that they should fix it.  My point is that they *can* fix it, probably through server software optimizations which are not quick or easy.
---
there is nothing they could do other than remove world PvP, it's not a server issue, it's not a programming issue, it is literally too much shit going on in one area to many people.
---
So you are just going to need to suck it up and deal with it until phase 3 and battle grounds killing world PvP.
---
Un goro and Searing Gorge and both good in that way.  A few quest pick ups, go kill a bunch of stuff, then several big turn ins.
---
Wrong https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x
---
according to this 1.1 was released in Europe 6th December 2004 and Dire maul was release 7th of March 2005
---
The only genuine problem with TBC's vibrant art style was when you were leveling and combined pieces with very clashing colors.  That was it.  Some people will argue that it's too outlandish (heh...), but that's both subjective and, as you said, kind of the point.  As you got more end game tier/arena/profession gear the clashing settled down and you got some of the best sets in the game.
---
This subreddit is filled with blizzard shills.  ‚ÄúIn vanilla the game would just crash‚Äù is not a valid excuse for having garbage servers in 2019 that bootleg private servers can out perform
---
no one cares
---
If your tank is getting killed in a global having better healing gear is not going to do much. And that being said max rank HT with the gear you mentions will heal for about 80-90% of most tanks health from a single cast. Despite the tank holding agro just sounds like they are taking way too much damage. Perhaps try using some CC and fire resist auoras.
---
Nice job! That one was hard the first couple times! My favorite part about dungeons is how they become easier as I become more familiar with them. As a healer I can remember certain pulls/areas and know how to work them accordingly.
---
I mean shit as a warrior 3 of my bags are just gear and trinkets
---
Building is what causes a lot of the lag in Fortnite. The server needs to update all of the information for 60 people building, editing, and destroying.
---
WoW probably has even more variables though like what gear a person is wearing, what they look like, all of the spells being casted from each class, slows and other cc, and all of the damage calculations.
---
I'm just trying to say how that if Fortnite is having lag problems for 60 people, people shouldn't be surprised that WoW has lag problems for 200 people.
---
I had enough right when I hit 40 on my warrior so you can't assume that.
---
In order to switch specializations, you will need to unlearn engineering entirely and re-level it from 1. Upon reaching 200 skill again, go to Narain Soothfancy‚Äôs hut just north of Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris. There is an open book on his table. Click the book and select goblin or gnomish. You do not need to do the respective specialization quests again.
---
Many serious pvpers will level gnomish first because there are a handful of BOP gnomish patterns, whereas goblin allows you to craft your own sapper charges. So you could level to 240 gnomish in order to get all the necessary BOP patterns, then drop it and switch to goblin.
---
Don't like it just leave man.
---
Why make a post that's even worse than the ones you're complaining about?

You can tank any dungeon with fury or arms it‚Äôs only raids that main tank should be prot. These guilds letting their main tank be fury spec for MC are gonnna have issues come later raids releases.
---
Working as intended. If you want modern performance, play retail.
---
Awesome intro!
---
brother what laptop? Did you use an mmo mouse? I always have trouble playing in bed.
---
Did you play on Northdale? If not, why are you even talking about stuff you have no idea about? If you did, buy glasses.
---
It counted on the players. Because back then you could literally play 2 weeks and sit on rating as you just stomped everyone with an op comp. I got 2800+ before and just quit for a few months and got my title and mount. Because there was no rating decay.
---
I think the time commitment is really only applicable to those who wanted gladiator for the first time and through slow progression. But generally the average gladiator player did not play as much as the rank 14 player.
---
I got on a flight right behind someone who wasn‚Äôt using a carrot and we went the same speed, so this was actually a really easy thing to test. Thanks for the in depth report.
---
Tanking/offtanking spots always belong to GM and officers. This guy isnt asking for a DPS class
---
Depends on the realm you play on what channels are most active.
---
Type ingame:
---
/join world
---
/join lfg
---
/join lfm
---
/join lookingforgroup
---
Also on low level dungeons, it's good to type in general chat where actual players are with the lvl range you play on. For example if you want to run WC you go to Barrens as horde.
---
So check for your self. And just copy paste the message in all 4 channels.
---
Goodluck on the journey.
---
Could be 5 if you join /world (or something else) first. Though unlikely for OP if he has to ask this.
---
IT support- everyone we support takes off nov/dec so it's generally dead
---
Report that degenerate piece of shi* scumbag.
---
They have a lower damage range so like for a warrior their instance attacks do a lot less damage giving them less rage back and less dps overall.
---
Southshore/Hillsbrad is historically where a lot of PvP happened. When the first PvP patch landed back in Vanilla, it was a slaughter for days and days. 
---
I can only imagine that some of these guys are getting ready for PvP, or just having a bit of fun. 
---
&gt; I spent so much in repairs and never leveled like I should have .
---
You shouldn't take the 10% durability loss if you die in PvP.
---
I remember Planetsidd in 2003.  Battles were so fucking epic and I never lagged once on my shitty computer and shitty internet.
---
I wasnt serious
---
And yet less so than most UIs shown on the sub that don‚Äôt.  My eyes need chemo after seeing some that get shown here.
---
No one is bitching about overpopulation.  You are fundamentally misunderstanding the issue here.
---
What the heck? I have yet to hear about this. Maybe try joining less hardcore guilds
---
I was expecting them to ask for their username and password...  I can't believe blizzard customer support would contact you by whispering you 9+ messages that are riddled with grammar errors. (not sarcasm, this seems really odd to me)  Using the term vanilla may be the most suprising, it's like a University Staff member calling it a dorm instead of a "Residence Hall".
---
will raid groups take me?
---
Awesome, congrats :)
---
Don‚Äôt give a flying fuck what‚Äôs harder, classic is more fun.
---
How can you say with a straight face that a post about casual play is trying to claim one is harder? You just a straight up dumbass.
---
because is not the same engine, they reworked the multithreading part of the engine when cataclysm was released
---
Lol "BLIZZ ARENT LITERALLY POOPING IN UR MOUTH Y GAMERS EXAGGERATE!!"
---
He totally got you man.
---
I don't recall it either at all. What I do remember is my PC shitting its bed whenever a large amount of people were close to me, but that was my potato PC and not the server.
---
&gt; I've been pugging mc and ony in my pvp spec not wanting to pay weekly for the respec if i'm not in a guild and now my logs are completely screwed up
---
Try explaining this
---
Next step would be get your numbers up by respeccing, popping consumes and/or farming world buffs.
---
 That would also be a post where people could reply what they would want to do, but in this case it's something that's well actually related to the game.
---
Respec, enchant your gear, buy the proper consumables and get your numbers up. Or if you don't want to do that just join a casual guild or keep running PuGs.
---
Get gud
---
&gt; Stop trying to make shaman tanking a thing
---
Dwarves are if infinitely more cool Orcs, Trolls and Tauren. Gnomes have more flavor than anyone, with their eccentric tinker thing. 
---
Whereas the Horde have only the Undead for cool races. Just the one.
---
So join a pug (like you said you already have several times) and meter-whore. Problem solved.   
---
Or am I missing something?
---
You‚Äôre too kind. Take an upvote
---
Paladin leveling: I've respec a few times now and I'm only level 30. I bounce back between ret and a holy/prot aoe build. I love ret, but hate the lack of utility and survivability compared to the hybrid spec , particularly in groups. 
---
Can anyone here with experience help me settle on which is most efficient for leveling and grouping without spending all my gold on respecs?
---
Okay that makes sense. I mean I get it, they CAN do it, I guess it was just the WHY that had me confused . I mean this was like an hours long thing so it just seemed so strange lol like it was something personal. Idk I‚Äôm over it but while it was going on it was pretty insane. One ran too far into town and the mob of 30s manage to kill him so that was okay I suppose lol.
---
Honestly unless your trying to play with the best of the best nobody should be asking for logs
---
Fixing the check sum bottle neck isn‚Äôt a day fix. It would be a revolutionary fix for all online gaming solutions. ‚ÄúJust fix it‚Äù isn‚Äôt in the realm of realistic possibility, especially at the scale of wows player base. I‚Äôll gladly take less hacks and cheats in the game if it sacrifices only large pvp encounters. 
---
They don‚Äôt have to share the details of or infrastructure or resources to us. If they did, that‚Äôs cool, but it‚Äôs not something I feel anyone would expect. 
---
Or you could stop wanting your cake and eat it to and take the free server transfer they offer you. Be apart of the solution, not the problem. 
---
That makes no sense. If they expected the servers to die out, why would they also prepare for a larger population on each server?
---
Everyone‚Äôs complaints are entirely based on ‚ÄúI want my cake and I want to eat it too‚Äù. Voicing your opinion is fine and it could hopefully lead to improvement. But people‚Äôs lack of willingness to just flat out stop playing means it‚Äôs a whole lot of bark and no bite. You said it yourself, they probably know how much the players want classic, so they are willing to sit on it.
---
I also wonder what happened to all the #nochanges crowd now. This server lag feels all to familiar to the true vanilla experience. Seems those people wanted #pserverchanges
---
Only ranks 12 to 14 require you to rank at the top (or very close to it) in your battlegroup every single week. Arena seasons last longer than it would take for someone to start at rank 11 and end at rank 14.
---
Honestly don‚Äôt care about timing. Probably still run MC even into Phase 5. I just hope they don‚Äôt release everything so quickly all the people that haven‚Äôt hit 60 year don‚Äôt get to experience it all.
---
wait what? you can reserve gems without any issue as long as you only need a final one.
---
"LFM UBRS, Voone Gem on reserve. PST"
---
you will fill the group without issue as long as you're running 5 man ony attune runs or guaranteeing a fast 10 man run 
---
you can reserve as long as you're reasonable.
---
and always make sure to set it to masterloot right before the gem boss pull you do. honor all rolls for gear people need. 
---
i've done this several times during classic to get both myself and all my friends UBRS keys
---
Killing the same elementals for hours is a chore as well. Everything can be seen as a chore, depending on your outlook of things. I hated grinding for my epic mount in classic and I also hated farming stupid ass mechagon rep for flying. 
---
I personally hate all the grinding stuff that WoW has had to offer since the start of time, but I guess that‚Äôs what make people come back. It‚Äôs there to keep people playing often, especially those who do mythic content or high ranked arena.
---
Hold please, can't find my tinfoil hat.
---
Surfer armor and battle shout, shield bash mobs to interior spells and heals use revenge every time it‚Äôs up. If issues with groups then mark targets and make people follow an order will help with AOE threat and keeping all the mobs in you.
---
The board might be all about the money but J Allen I‚Äôm sure wants to tell us he was right.
---
Yeah blizzard hates us and don't care about the mass flow of money they are getting right now.
---
The quest line is at the race track in Shimmering Flats. The final quest that rewards the item has you go into Zul Farak and kill the optional boss which requires an mallet item to summon. The mallet item is built out in Hinterlands though.
---
I.hope not. The sooner you release content, the faster people will get bored.
---
"I play WoW"

---
When it was over my stuff was like 5/35 durability .. I‚Äôm not sure why . I was questing before so maybe it was from that actually now that I think about it . And I didn‚Äôt know that zone was a super hot zone so that makes a little more sense too. You don‚Äôt lose durability from PvP ?
---
End boss is gonna be a resistapalooza but you'll be otherwise fine.  Volunteer to be on add duty the lil adds are 44 I think
---
My apologies. I should gave taken your pitchfork into consideration!
---
Then you'd be wrong.
---
Oh it can set you back for sure. Actually see the other response to me. It has someone grinding guards for DKs and the only two data points I saw was from rank 11 to rank 8 with 119 DKs. Doesn't exactly like up with -100 RP per kill, but who knows. I think you need to be careful for sure, but it's not going to set you back a week. Maybe if you are on the fence from being 1 rank or the next (thus taking an extra week to gain that rank)
---
What level should I go there to be the most effective?
---
You need to ask for a trial raid night.  Say you want a spot and you intend to spec for raid dps, but you don't want to do it just on speculation that you will have a spot.  If they seriously want someone in raid they should be willing to give you a shot.  Just make sure you are ready to respec and stack consumables to put up good numbers when you get the chance.
---
WHO WOULD WIN? A multi-billion dollar international conglomerate video game developer and producer corporation OR 1 underground $200/mo russian server?  
---
This was a big reason why I wanted them to go with the actual 1.12 engine/client and take longer to build in the back end (Bnet/anti-cheat, etc) rather than take the easy route of using the modern client and resculpting the front end. I'd have rather had classic come out 1-2 years later and have my favorite part of the game actually be playable
---
did it right away
---
Sounds legit, never tried myself
---
To be honest the tank has almost as much to lose as everyone else. Finding a tank can take a little bit of time, but given how long it takes to get out to dungeons I'm just as worried about losing a dps or healer once we're actually in the dungeon. Finding a replacement player is the fast part unless you've got a lock.
---
You're agreeing with me. First time glads need to put in a lot of time to make it. 
---
Sure, multiple time glads probably had an easier path the second and third time around, but once someone reached rank 14 once, they were done. They never needed to grind rank 14 twice. Gladiators needed to do it every single season.
---
How about you quit paying them and quit classic? You seem to really enjoy the shit in your mouth.
---
If you had made a good point, we could have had some kind of discussion.
---
I have been selling them on the reg for around 2g on my server.  They seem common from ZF GY farm.
---
I suspect they'll release BGs before phase 3 like they released dm early.
---
But BWL?  Nah not yet, way too early.
---
no
---
If the issue is that blizzard is doing more anticheat/validity checks, etc then it should be easily solved by adding more hardware.
---
5g is one greater fire pot lol
---
Valid points both.
---
What are some healer perspectives on healing groups with tanks that are not Prot spec in BRD, MC, LBRS, Strat?
---
ETA:  didn‚Äôt mean to include MC.  Was thinking pre-MC.  Thanks for input.
---
If my understanding of percentiles are correct then this isn't the case.  If for example the top 1% had 900k honor and the guys at the 97th percentile had 100k honor they would still be put in the in the 4th best bracket.. regardless of their honor total compared to the highest.
---
I think the answer is fairly obvious.. play wow
---
Sure, there's no rush.
---
Yeah, overpopulated classes like Rogues have it super rough. Find a guild to do runs with. I'm currently the only real tank in my guild, and we run shit all day gearing for raids. I swapped to my Hunter alt to run MC with a friend of mine who is new to WoW. Literally not a soul responded in Barrens for WC, at least a Tank didn't. Spammed World and LFG, not a peep.
---
Wants to raid
---
Doesn't want to be raid spec
---
Sad because raid wants him to be raid spec.
---
Now I have to post a pet pic tonight.
---
...might go with a murloc
---
Funny you say that. /1 was filled with people frothing at the mouth to get to 60 and gank Horde lowbies. Lol. I‚Äôve never participated much in PvP. It doesn‚Äôt scare me, but typically I‚Äôm all about questing dungeons  leveling, etc . But my friend all play on the server so it is what it is I suppose ! I will say I stuck around a really long time to watch. For the brief time we had help there, it was cool to watch actual skilled players do their thing vs me just winging shit
---
 Lol 
---
I realized after and decided it wasn‚Äôt worth reposting
---
I‚Äôm just wildly curious what has led up in their lives for them to comfortably spend their time doing nothing but this
---
Who cares? I ducking gave away conkers bad fur day!!!
---
&gt; You shouldn't take the 10% durability loss if you die in PvP.
---
But you surely lose durability when you get damaged in pvp right?
---
I myself have created my own guild focused on guild/PUG MC and Ony. 2-3 weeks in and its going swell! Just got our first Domo kill and went 9/10 in one night on Tuesday. Downed Ony yesterday and gave head to a random PUG rogue who raided with us on Tues and is attending our Ragnaros kill today. Once I looted him Onyxs head he randomly opened trade and tossed me 100g. Oh and 5min later he gquit his guild and joined mine lol.
---
An entire race breakdown and not one mention of how much ganj Tauren and troll players consume. SMH.
---
not sure what that has to do with my post
---
Did you watch the video?  I can assure you it's not a bug (not sure why you think it's a bug to begin with) and will it get changed? probably not because #nochanges.
---
In 15 years a strategy has been established as there is footage of it for you to see.
---
For months it was longer then 1 hour, around the 1h30m+ region, now it's 45m-1h15m, literally double respawn rate.
---
That joke is older than dirt
---
Yeah, IMO, TBC had amazing sets. There were only 3 or 4 in total that werent awesome.
---
Anyone compare it to PvP in a similar game? ESO‚Äôs large scale PvP has always had lag issues when masses of players are fighting. I‚Äôm curious what similar games avoid this.
---
There was no schedule. It was a vague timeline. They added DM, the sky didn't fall and the world(of warcraft) kept on spinning.
---
Yea its worth. I think everyone else in this thread is also a broke warrior trying to justify not having the axe lol...
---
DB + Flurry actually sims very close to double deathbringer, thats how good it is.
---
k
---
To reach rank 14 then you basically either need to be a committed streamer or be a complete sorry sack of shit with absolutely no life. What a beautiful system.
---
&gt;When it was over my stuff was like 5/35 durability .. I‚Äôm not sure why 
---
You take some durability damage in PvP by getting hit or whatever, but even after hours of PvP in 60 gear it's rarely more than a handful of silver.
---
The big money drain is the 10% durability hit when you die, and that doesn't happen when you are killed by the opposing faction. 
---
&gt;I was questing before so maybe it was from that actually now that I think about it 
---
This is most likely the case, otherwise it's possible that someone got you down really low and a random monster finished you off. All that matters is who landed the last hit, if it was a mob then you get the 10% durability loss. 
---
&gt;You don‚Äôt lose durability from PvP ?
---
Not from dying, there's very minimal durability loss from being hit.
---
I'm not well-versed in the connection between the client and the server side, but the client used by pservers is just the 1.12 client from back in the day. How does "pserver's solution was to hoist the heavy lifting to the client side" make any sense if the client is unmodified?
---
Did you just fail to read the part where I explained that "a couple" of months is very subjective and not a set timeframe as you tried to argue from? Also an interview from back in May.
---
For now P2 release is all dependent on Layering. And as far as it's generally known, it is a bad idea to drop it this early. *As I've said before.* 
---
It's quite silly that you try to seek for ad hominem excuses while reading half my comments.
---
I'm baffled at the responses in this thread. Someone is addressing a serious issue and all people do is say that private servers aren't much better and / or "This is what it was like back then"
---
Yeah cool but how is that relevant to OPs point?   
---
It dawned on me when Blizz first released their first set of Classic Servers (2 entire Servers for the entirety of Germany i.e.), that they weren't planning on spending much resources on Classic, which is proven again by the OP.
---
Disgusting* And how so? My TukUI is clean as fuck. Very customizable.
---
Without rank added does max rank by default.
---
You can put in whatever rank if you want to force it.
---
They're for solo farming and pvp.
---
The old Intimidating Shout Bandage has saved me many times in combat
---
Oh give me a break. Everyone cares about performance. There is no excuse period. The game performs like shit and it needs to be fixed and should have already been. Simple facts.
---
People are complaining about server stability, yes.  Blizzard has the manpower and resources to fix this ‚Äî they even had the nostalrious team (who they ghosted) at their disposal and they took advantage of nothing.

It's too showey. UIs shouldn't be trying to capture your attention. It also looks like it should be for a sci-fi game, not WoW.

Recount is like Linux. Gets the fuck out of your way and gives you the basics.

Yeah. There's a lot to learn. I think I could even do it better now, but especially with a level or two higher :P
---
1) if a mage iceblocks, back up and stealth. Don't stand there like a ninny.

2) if you get dots on you and you're not close to killing them, you need to run away. Most players keep far away from rogues, use this to your advantage. Go the other way, bandage, come back.

3) people don't anticipate vanish between dot ticks. Just cause you have a serpent sting on you doesn't mean you can't vanish. You can do it between dmg ticks and still land an ambush or cheap shot or sap before the dmg ticks.    
---
Bonus: Hunter fd drops your target on them. It will drop your cp's too. Good hunters will count your cp's and fd before that 6s stun or 1.5k evisc. It doesn't hurt to use them early in this situation.
---
This is a valid point. We need more data.
---
Did this sort of system take shape the moment honor was introduced?
---
Also, without account sharing, i think it's gonna be a lot harder to get people to agree on an order in which people will get rank 14. especially across guild borders.
---
"Where do you think we are?"
---
It's pretty ridiculous of you to advocate for a zero-transparency stance when pretty much every other major gaming company in this day and age will give a response that an issue is being looked at.  Hell, there were devs in the Hearthstone Battlegrounds streams assuring everyone that the bugs that people were experiencing were being looked at at that very moment by their engineers.  
---
If the Classic team were really working on fixing the server lag issues, it takes a community manager less than a minute to make a post that it's happening.  Wanting updates on game breaking issues does not result from a lack of patience.  If Blizzard announced that they were working on fixing it and people were complaining that it wasn't happening fast enough -- that would be a lack of patience.  Players not assuming that Blizzard is working on a game breaking issue without an announcement results from a lack of trust, which in itself results from a history of Blizzard not addressing major issues for months over expansion lifecycles.  
---
Your acceptance of a lack of transparency is the exact mentality that allows products like No Man's Sky to burn consumers.
---
Gearing is really easy in this game. You can get prebis in no time if you have friends willing to do this or that dungeon.
---
Also, here is a tip for people trying to do what im doing. Have people hop on a random level 1 alt character and invite them to your guild.  That way they see your weekly raid times in the weekly guild message of the day. Also, you build your guild numbers, and lastly, in their guild note i put their Main Characters name then in the officer note i put their Class/Spec. This helps a ton! Cheers everyone!

Rank 14 weapons HURT.
---
Try some PVP it's honestly a blast when it's a fair fight. You'll run into people who will just be dicks but you seem like the type of dude who won't let them get to you. Have fun with your friends homie and gl leveling!!
---
Cool, that was 15 years ago though. You'd expect Blizz to have a tad more money and technology 15 years down the line.
---
This is an issue they can‚Äôt diagnose and fix while sharding technology is currently active. Everyone fucking relax.
---
&gt; Im sick of the excuses.
---
&gt; Im sick of the lies.
---
&gt; Im sick of the lack of comms on important issues.
---
I'm sick of the whining about PvP lag.  There's a post+/hr about it here, and it's going to do literally nothing. Go bitch on the forums.
---
No mate, you need to learn how to read. They were always level 62, they displayed as ?? because they were similar in status to world bosses at the time, this changed in the big overhaul that was patch 1.3. You could always, for example, skin beast at 310 skinning despite him being a ?? marked mob for 3 patches. Why? Because his actual level was 62.
---
Now with that reply you've made it clear you're not here to have a discussion in good faith, when given proof you tried to misinterpret what was written. You go off and hate Blizzard for shit that isn't even wrong (as per the patch notes) because you got used to something else on private servers. Deliberating with you is a waste of my time :)
---
If classic fails, my account will become de-activated. Nothing from the blizzcon retail reveals even remotely interest me. 
---
The little fury race, for me, is a joke.
---
Nightfin soup for healers
---
Lol oh shit of course my mounting macro was unequipping the orb. Grats on your mount ;)
---
There's a reason other MMO's don't do open world PvP where the entire server can show up to fight if they wanted.
---
Thanks for explaining that , I wasn‚Äôt sure how it worked. It was only 18 silver but that‚Äôs pretty high for me because it‚Äôs usually around 10, and I‚Äôm saving for a mount when I hit 40. I‚Äôm super cheap lol.
---
For me, and our guild at the time, it was Nefarian. I haven't experienced that much excitement and celebration over voice chat since.
---
Companies try to retain their player base by not releasing shoddy products ‚Äî generally.
---
It can‚Äôt be every server though, maybe in certain time zones? I‚Äôm on sulfarus and haven‚Äôt had any lag issues
---
in what way was it a 'major' mistake?
---
As someone who's been leveling an enh shaman here's what I got. Int is my dump stat so i have limited mana but that's ok so far as 50 to 60% of my overall damage comes from my auto attacks. I haven't used flametongue in ages as my rockbiter adds more damage per swing than flametongue so during leveling i use RB but in dungeon i use windfury. WF is fine leveling especially if you have an addictive personality because you will be chasing the dragon of WF procs like a junkie chases hits, few things are as fun as a proc making 75% of an enemies health dissapeared in an instant but in the long run rockbiter edges it out just a bit, I use 2h axes primarily because they swing a little faster so more WF procs in dungeons which puts me near the top or at the top in terms of damage, also focus agility not strength, you NEED to crit as often as you can to keep flurry up and with WF procs critting it's pretty insane damage output. So agility stamps gear (which is easy to get as other classes need it too) is what I've focused.
---
&gt;and can easily fix it.
---
I doubt its easy. In fact, it is much more likely to be fairly complicated.
---
Or do you really think some guy can just browse the code and be like "aha! theres the problem!" in a couple hours?
---
They are also repeatable and dont give much exp. Gtfo of there tbh
---
I think it's as simple as them not wanting to pay for extra hardware needed to support the heavy world pvp loads.
---
/join LFG and /join LookingForGroup
---
Many players couldn't even go to 40 man raids or stand around in big cities in Vanilla without lagging, much less participate in 100+ man world PVP.
---
It's too showey? Are you saying it is too aesthetically pleasing to you? It shows all the information I need it to and works well with the other addons I utilize. You're talking nonsense.
---
I actually had a fair fight a week ago. A mage two levels above fought me and I won because I‚Äôm a Druid so I can basically shift out of all their tricks and heal myself which they can‚Äôt. I was so stoked after that because I had only been ganked before so I thought I was bad or didn‚Äôt stand a chance. Turns out if you don‚Äôt get one hitted from behind by someone 30 levels above you, it is really fun .
---
44 would be rough but doable, 43 and you are still in the really high resist territory to where you won't do much damage. This is just a dungeon that has really high swing from the entrance to the last boss.
---
Lol smoke some weed. You‚Äôll forget about it soon
---
That's actually not true. Alterac Valley on retail lags as hell when there's 40 vs 40 fighting, proof (8 months old vid) :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz1\_DLm3mCk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=87](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz1_DLm3mCk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=87) 
---
And it will be exactly the same on Classic considering the hardware used.
---
Okay cool that‚Äôs really good to know thank you
---
Damn you‚Äôre seething right now, calm down bro Bobby Kotick isn‚Äôt gonna give you a job.
---
My mom is Mankrik's wife... she's dead.
---
This is exactly what we've been doing! So happy for you, that it has worked out. Our pug raids are still happening but we are definitely building towards a full raid team. For us, it's more about getting everyone to 55+ than getting more people into the guild. :)
---
Where can I submit my peer review? Not enough hard data, but definitely warrants a follow up study
---
I always warn my fellow allies
---
What class are you? You should be able to just look at the average ability damage numbers to get a good comparison. You dont have to dumb everything down to 'total DPS'.
---
e.g. Mages can just compare frostbolt DPS to other single target DPS.
---
Also. people that complain about downvotes always end up with more downvotes.
---
Iirc didn't he do this to see if that rumored rank 15 actually existed
---
It's something that should've been addressed YEARS ago. That's it. You can try to spin it as much as you want, this fact won't change.
---
117 members and like 16 60's. More coming each week after every smooth raid. Its the snowball effect like you said. People invite friends and word spreads about how sick and chill certain PUG groups are. Reputation matters and goes along way in classic.
---
I think the Torch Room in BRD is my favorite PUG breaker
---
No private server team is going to help with the stability.  Private servers offloaded most of the information to the client.  This can make things run smoother, but it also has weird shit happen, especially regarding player position/hit detection/timing as well as increasing the ability of players to cheat.  This was never going to happen with Blizzard.
---
One of the main issues this comes down to is the huge vocal population who forced blizzard into focusing on the #nochanges shit instead of making the game as playable as possible.  This vocal group changed the main priority to recreating the game as closely as possible instead of making it the most playable game possible.
---
The public drove the priority and is now mad they were listened to.
---
&gt;Players without fantasy.
---
Well fuck me for wanting to have the best /silly in the game I guess.
---
This is what horde looks like, not pussy alliance lol
---
How is it irrelevant? Thats like saying "my computer can run doom 1, but not crysis, shitty developers that can't do the same on my 486 that other developers can".
---
Well it‚Äôs almost $500 on Amazon, but I found some on eBay for $100 and that‚Äôs not bad considering I spent $60 on a D&amp;D game with maybe half the amount of content. 
---
Yeah, I kind feel like you‚Äôd have to be at least familiar with the Warcraft series to enjoy it. When I saw what it was and the expansions I kinda freaked out because it‚Äôs so deep. The miniature game looks fun, but I know that‚Äôs pvp and shorter rounds.
---
Are people who are shooting for higher than Rank 10 really joining Pug raids? That's stupid as fuck in the first place. Anyone serious about rank won't be joining Pug raids for PvP.
---
Sorry, this is the Classic WoW subreddit.  We only lick Blizzard's taint here, we don't criticize our overlords.
---
Do transformable weapons lose their enchants when you click them?
---
I haven‚Äôt seen that one before what fallout is it based on? Or is it it‚Äôs own world kind of thing
---
Casuals need to come and go more often. Falling behind weekly on your AP grind becomes debilitating in Retail, and it hinders your ability to do content, especially raids. You either have to commit regularly 2-5 hours every other day, or get very lucky on your trait rolls for Azurite Armor and Titanforging armor.
---
In Classic, you may not make much progress in 2-5 hours every other day, but at least the top isn't shifting like it does in Retail.
---
In Classic, you don't fall behind in the same sense. You may not be able to do content with your friends if they level past you, but you are not permanently behind people. You don't miss tiers of progression by not playing frequently enough, MC will still be valuable to run in Phase 6.
---
And yet many including myself are enjoying classic while still having zero interest in retail.  If the idea was to make classic terrible I think they would have done a lot worse.  Also the rush to put out Dire Maul if nothing else points to them caring about it more than intentionally tanking it.  I'm just not putting on the tinfoil hat for this one.
---
Yeah, there's too much to it. I think UIs should be simple and nearly invisible.
---
Is this offensive to you?
---
&gt; they even had the nostalrious team at their disposal
---
I don't know whether to laugh or facepalm.  You're not serious, right?
---
You should double check
---
&gt;Please don't just make shit up about private servers you didnt play on. None of them had slam doing an extra auto attack. 
---
RetroWoW it did. It also appears in Executus Gaming's slam [video](https://youtu.be/wI8FzDYk2ro) which a lot of 2H Slam players used and also confused a lot of people. So shut the fuck up.
---
&gt;Slam is the ONLY way to make 2h viable on Alliance.
---
I never said slam didn't make 2H fury viable? I always run 4/5 imp slam. You really need fucking glasses or something.
---
Honestly I avoid most people who have items on reserve, but last night I ran a strat live with an extremely geared warrior and we blew right threw. He was pulling 600 dps at points and when we finished the run he avg'd 430 dps all said and done. I'd gladly give up the first orb of the run for a painless ez mode run like that. Not worth it to bang your head against the wall for 2 hours just to have a chance at an orb (considering they are going for about 25g per on Rattlegore-US).
---
Pretty much boring. I don't engage because it's so one sided, and even in 1v1 I know someone is around the corner if I need help. I usually just let ally go and at most give a low lvl frost shock to tease.
---
What a wild system this was. At least the modern shift of pvp games to ELO systems makes sense. This system merely shows how much you play with little correlation to skill against other players.
---
I did rank 14 back in the day. GL trying to get everyone to have exactly the same . Never works out that well
---
It's a massive time commitment because *winners are chosen directly on the basis of time commitment*. It's like if the world chess grandmaster was the person who won the most chess games in the last year, or if the Olympic Marathon Champion was the person who ran the most total miles in the month of May.
---
Does the current chess grandmaster spend a lot of time playing chess, do current marathoners run a lot? Yes of course. Would they do it even more if *total volume* was the only thing that mattered, absolutely, by definition they would have to.
---
My point being that the time investment is not solely because it's a competitive system, as you are saying. People can do really serious competitive things without 14-hour-a-day commitment. The incentives/win conditions matter way more than the competitive nature.
---
Nope, they're just incompetent and clueless.
---
They stack. There are various spreadsheets that point to crusader on both MH/OH being the most optimal. There are others that point to +dmg being more optimal on MH.
---
Did you write this thesis on separate monitor while farming herbs or mining?
---
Yup, I've had quite a few GH4s go off, use mana, spell effect appears around the dead corpse of my tank.. niiiiiiiceeee
---
SoC will not help you tank too much.  Sure, getting a proc on single target might help you keep aggro a bit longer, but its not worth.  I‚Äôd personally go holy until Holy Shock and then go prot for survivability after.  You can tank as you level in any spec really, it‚Äôs just gear you need to survive / increase your threat output.   Plus, you can easily solo level as holy by wearing ret gear in the meantime.
---
Edit : Spelling Errors
---
Makes sense
---
Edit: But at the same time classes like rogue get a lot of damage just from auto attacks.
---
As a healer I have to mentally prepare before those AoE ghost packs. I've had 2 dps go from full to dead 3 seconds into the pull before.
---
I just hit 60 last night as a Warrior (plan on tanking). Outside of gathering my pre-raid bis gear, what else should I be doing? I know I need to max my weapon skills, but which should I focus on first? Should I be working on grinding any rep? Should I focus on any specific craft? I'm Mining/Skinning right now. Should I prioritize MC/Onyxia access? Should I complete those quests before I respec from Arms to Prot?
---
I have a feeling I'm being elaborated trolled...in which case: well done, this was an amusing story.  
---
But if not: I'll say that your approach is "kind of" correct for raid tanking.  Your spec isn't good, but raid tanks do kind of just stand in one spot and do threat abilities over and over again.  
---
However, **dungeon** tanking is a whole other ball of wax.  Dungeon tanking is about managing chaos while the rest of the group kills everything.  If you didn't ever leave defensive stance, you can't do things like:  
---
* Quickly get to a mob that's eating your healer several yards away from you. (Berserker Stance -&gt; Intercept)  
---
* Stop a mob from running away (Battle or Berserker -&gt; Hamstring)
---
* Quickly get threat on 4 mobs right after the pull (Berserker Stance -&gt; Whirlwind)
---
* Use Overpower at all (Battle stance -&gt; Overpower)
---
* Become immune to fear when you know you're about to get feared (Berserker Stance -&gt; Berserker Rage)
---
Stance dancing is necessary for managing that chaos correctly.  After you do your special thing, you can always go back to D stance.
---
It's just kinda sad.
---
There are tons of games that sell millions of copies and run like ass. Clearly that isn't the most important thing. Let alone the times when this game runs like ass are few and far between, and completely avoidable.
---
I switched from Arms to 2H Fury at level 53 and it is so much more fun! 10/10 would recommend!
---
Im not sure if this is the meta for swords but, for daggers you want the bonus weapon damage on the mainhand and crusader on the offhand. Mainhand is your bread and butter for damage on abilities, and while +5 damage seems small it actually increases the top end of crits by a lot. Crusader on the offhand makes a lot of sense as the faster speed leads to more procs
---
More modern technology doesn't magically make all of those computations, checks, etc that much easier to do. That's still a lot of shit for servers to process when you have a fuck ton of people all in one place.
---
Retail has the same issue and they've got all the modern bells and whistles, and probably would be even worse without sharding.
---
I think it is fair to say that he has a different idea of what a small guild is. I think we can all find common ground and call it a small raiding guild.
---
You didn't play the first week or two of classic then.   Entire layers crashed every couple hours to remove afks.
---
I've had some success by following that GH4 up immediately with a PW:S which seems to absorb the dmg immediately.  Only do this if my tank's hp spikes low when I was already delaying for a big heal.
---
Yeah those suck; imo, your dps should be running in, interrupting, and bringing them back to you tgrough the door, which takes a bit of attention, but if youre pulling when the pats are a decent ways away it isnt that hard.
---
i see, thank you
---
..but... but I thought it was a fake made up quote? What happened lil bud? Struggling to swallow your own pride and admit that you were wrong about it all? It's ok ‚ô•
---
Yeah, nothing could entice me to go to retail. Ugh. The thought of it makes me gag a bit.
---
He probably thought you were going to try to skin it
---
My bad, I read it wrong. For some reason website I looked at had the first Kelthuzad clear next to when it was released. Thanks for correction
---
We aren't playing on 15 year old servers. It's 2019 and Blizzard makes like $9B revenue a year, charges us $15 a month to play, and the game is still broken.
---
good thing is you won't be camped!  You give less honor than killing a level 60 because you are under 60 and have very low or no rank.  You also give half honor every repeat kill.  You also have your honor split with the enemy's party if they are grouped up in an unfair fight.
---
Certainly not
---
LOL You rolled on Faerlina and got what you deserved.
---
Did you perform an a priori power analysis?
---
It works for you because you pair your MT with your OT and by random chance, your OT has a lower GUID than your MT. By your logic, if you swapped the two, then the new MT would work just as well. However if the theory is correct, if you keep the same pair, the new MT will have this threat wiped by fireball. 
---
You made a nice video, but you also came in here making comments about how you know more than others about how the mechanic works but you clearly haven't done much research.
---
I agree, but instead of replying to your post I'm going to make a new thread to contribute to the 50 other threads talking about this issue.
---
Unless someone mentions retail.
---
Does he want to keep his job though?
---
RetroWoW?! Who the fuck plays that shit server?
---
I dint know who executus gaming is but his video is garbage.
---
Yuup pretty much.  I've found that throwing a PW:S on the tank immediately after gh4 finishes can help prevent this.. Very niche use though.
---
I'm really not sure about that. It would either mean that the private server owners had access to versions of the game codes without all those validation or that they basically rewrote everything.
---
Too much into the resto tree. All you need is 5/5 furor.
---
The rest you need into to balance.
---
The auto entangling roots spell is a nice save against melee.
---
Omens of clarity is very useful for tanking. And power shifting is a must if you want to pvp.
---
There isnt much flexibility on the druid talents if you want to pvp and tank.
---
Its 
---
14 32 5
---
Imagine releasing the game at the same rate when things are already accelerated (i.e. 1.12 stats on items, 1.12 abilities and gameplay) and the game has been optimized to insane levels.
---
8 hour raids to 30 minutes. 15 day expected leveling time to 60 to 6-7, a WR from 4d20h for a hunter to 3d12h, Ragnaros from 154 days to be taken down to 5...
---
Sorry bud, your lack of time management is your fault. And  no, not everyone currently absolutely chilling for months on acquired wealth to date and quick to 60 are unemployed btw. There is so much information out there and prior experience that, while a ton of time is certainly helpful, not necessary. Pretty sure guilds wouldve been clearing BWL no problem 5 weeks ago.
---
There are players with 100k net worth (Fakeqt). You can be 60, epic mounted, with 500 spare gold right now, which is a perfectly great place for a casual to be chilling at with just even an ounce of effort.
---
Lol.
---
Agreed. If you want it to be fixed, everybody get on the same page and I‚Äôm sure blizzard would love to hear our feedback because it makes their job easier.
---
What gear do you have? I have great gear for pure pve shadow damage but am starting to build up a higher stamina pvp set that still has a decent amount of spell power.
---
A good bow and any gear with agility, and new quivers. If youre leveling BM (you should its totally OP) having the bow up to date is really all you need assuming you dont actively seek out pvp
---
So strat Live has the exception where theres is maybe 1 item out of there for Warrior Tanks, there may be some leather dps gear for Fury. Orb is the only thing of value to Prot warrior from live. no reason to run it unless we get atleast one.
---
Regrowth and Rejuv are less mana efficient than healing touch but they provide better hp5. If you're expecting heavy damage, you should stack both of them to buy time between healing touch casts. Since you're pre-60 with no raid gear, this will kill your mana pool so make sure your tanks are giving you time to drink. 
---
Stacking HoTs is also great if your DPS are impatient and keep pulling aggro. Just keep both HoTs ticking on your tank so that you're free to cast healing touches on DPS.
---
The human is the sub
---
Wait, so are you saying it wasn't their intention to make the servers way larger than Vanilla servers and release the game on a new client designed for Retail "sharding" framework?
---
Wrong again.
---
What's your point cause I'm not getting it.
---
Your argument makes no sense no matter how you look at it but I don't expect you to see that
---
Now you're the one changing the argument. I never said whether the system was fair or not. I just said it was about the same time commitment as getting old school Gladiator titles.
---
Nothing better than AP+PoM frostbolting a hunter that's gotten his demon to 5-10% and watching him slowly try cripple away as it chases him down.
---
it is? what should you do? i heard 2 handed weapons are the way to go isnt arms better for that?
---
All the good stuff is BoE, so you can buy it (or sell it).
---
This is what makes world bosses not even worth it on big servers.  Once more than one raid shows up it's just a lag fest.
---
Hahaha, learn something new everyday! Glad my post could indirectly help :)
---
Maybe as a joke?
---
It's been a while since I've played horde but isn't the head a quest reward for the Onyxia chain, and since it's a regular white item anyone can loot it, and it can be looted multiple times.
---
If you go balance you actually stop before boomkin. They're always targeted first in pvp.
---
And you dont need the 3% crit or armor.
---
You should be tanking hits ik bear form anyways.
---
Balance spec is amazing for pvp. You go 11 I to feral for charge 30 into balance and the rest into resto
---
&gt; 8 hour raids to 30 minutes. 15 day expected leveling time to 60 to 6-7, a WR from 4d20h for a hunter to 3d12h, Ragnaros from 154 days to be taken down to 5...
---
Yes, players can accomplish things very quickly when they don't have jobs. No one is denying that.
---
Demo will be more fun but you will rip aggro off your pet a lot faster casting shadowbolts vs draining
---
I play on heartseeker and was lagging out in 20v40 fights at BRM. We had a small group trying to wipe buffs off raids going in and even that was causing large lag spikes for everyone involved.
---
Biggles is not layered anymore but I have certainly had these battles while it was still a thing. I'll try to snap a few recordings next week if this is still a huge issue
---
How do I know I won‚Äôt  have the same issue as OP? I‚Äôm worried because I abandoned the quest. I hope I didn‚Äôt ruin my character because of this.
---
Yeah my PC would take forever to load objects so whta I would get is a bunch of player shadows killing me before I could target them lol.  But no lag.
---
Honestly, the hardest part about Classic raiding is just explaining to my fiance how Onyxia resets. Like, I always raid Tuesdays, but sometimes I need an hour on Monday, or Wednesday, or whatever because a 5-day reset is wacky as hell.
---
I'm very interested in this, if this is actually possible you could save a solid 10m or more.
---
Secondary screen on the left side?!?! How can you live with yourself?
---
Are we talking about african or european gryphons here? And unladen?
---
Pride is a poison.
---
If anyone wants to see our glorious struggles up to the this moment it has all been documented on [fb.gg/YahwehPlays](https://fb.gg/YahwehPlays)
---
Couldn't have done it was a better group of people! Great guild, organized and they know their stuff. We're not clearing content as quickly as others have but we sure are SLIDING down those slopes like CHAMPS!
---
Because private servers used about 1/4 the backend that official servers do. The way they built private servers was by reverse engineering the communication with the client.  So basically the could see the 1 to 1 interactions between the client and server.
---
However on official servers due to security and quality standards as well as regulation a certain level of certifications is required from every interaction between client and server, most of which takes place server side to prevent tampering.
---
A PS would get the input from the client, create an output, output it to client.
---
A Official Server gets the input from the client, verifies input, verifies IP, verifies client certificate, ect. Then and only then does it generate an output to the client.
---
This is happening hundreds of thousands of times a second for a single server process. A lot of this provides more security against cheats/hacks which is good and also helps prevent Ddos. PS could get away with a 1 to 1 input output system because the amount of people on them was a lot smaller and they have zero legal obligation.
---
Imho the best way to alleviate some of this is by removing spellbatching or lowering the artificial tic rate, the server is trying to do this for more spells stacked against it at a 200ms tic rate than it would at 100 or 50ms tic rate. Basically they are bottle-necking their server hardware by imposing limitations in the software.
---
Yea you really showed those level 40s that took 30seconds to kill...
---
Did they ever fix the *MASSIVE* memory leak and other issues that plagued it for months without a fix, which caused it to be abandoned for Details?
---
Maybe they mean [Eye of Rend](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12587/eye-of-rend)? As far as I'm aware the head is lootable by anyone on the quest.
---
I'm not interested in that kind of play either.  I would not want them to delay the phase just so they can ensure that 40v40 world pvp wont have lag.  That is the type of thing I will do once a week if at all.
---
thank you bro i deleted details 3 times trying to figure out wtf was happening
---
yeah I was referencing the need to respec to mortal strike at 40. You should just go down arms since it's better than anything else and then not waste money respeccing at 40.
---
Only skills learned below level 20 have the reduced coefficient. So Heal Rank 2, being a level 22 skill, still gains full benefit from healing power.
---
The game was absolutely not designed around large scale fights.  It‚Äôs part of the concept sure, but it‚Äôs not the central part of the design.
---
I can confirm that my guild's MT and OT has tried the stacking strategy and our MT's threat got wiped after the first fireball. Probably due to GUID as discussed elsewhere or some other mechanic going on.
---
Ok, leave then.
---
Erm, uhm... I own a calculator.
---
Instead of reserving just run it with guild mates that don‚Äôt need it.
---
Considering my last Dire Mail tank was a dual-wielding fury warrior in *nearly full leather,* I'd take that shaman :P
---
Why would he struggle to survive as a dps? If he has a strong group he will be carried, no effort required of him.
---
No mention of leetspeak? That was one of my favorite things about PvPing in Vanilla, you could talk trash if you wasted enough time typing weird characters.
---

Same here! PWS responds almost *instantly*, which sucks because it costs a hell of a lot more mana than the shit I spent all year casting.
---
The base game alone is fine, with Shadow of War feels more complete. You're probably OK without TBC, but it can be fun.
---
Base game with Shadow of War will be expensive, though.
---
Band of Accuria is one of the best tanking rings. Tanks need to generate a lot of threat, + hit is the best stat for threat. Come BWL tanks also need to get to the def cap. Band of Accuria allows tanks to wear their Might/Wrath set while still getting to the hitcap.

Article TLDR:
---
**How to obtain honor:** PvP
---
**PvP for low-level players:** PvP with people your level
---
**The PvP Honor System:** PvP, get ranks, don't get DHk's
---
**PvP for high-level players:** Make friends, go to BRM
---
**Conclusion:** This article is 110% useless
---
An African or European Gryphon?
---
I'd prefer it tbh. Give me time to level an alt, make some gold and finish rounding out my PVP gear on my main.
---
&gt;  There is no challenge at all in 99% of the available activities  
---
And the 1% is so challenging that it just drives me away. Mythic Azshara looks so unfun as an encounter. I don't care if people say Classic is easier. Give me "This boss fears and does fire damage" over a goddamn encyclopedia of mechanics any day.
---
If you can level with a warrior buddy, much easier.
---
Crusader stacks. MH + OH for swords. OH for daggers with +5 weapon damage MH.
---
Also pick your spec before you start raiding, if you want to be daggers go to raid with daggers. Vice versa.
---
&gt; what else should I be doing?
---
It really depends on what you want to do, PvP, PvE or anything in between. 
---
&gt;I know I need to max my weapon skills, but which should I focus on first?
---
Whatever your primary weapon(s) are, that's what you should max first.
---
Two easy tricks for leveling weapon skills:
---
- Go to Blasted Lands and find the "Servant of &lt;Demon&gt;" enemies, when you get them to 1% they become immune to all damage and you can keep wailing on them for a while  
---
- Finish a DM North run and attack the ogre ghosts at the end, they don't fight back and don't take any damage  
---
&gt;Should I be working on grinding any rep? 
---
Argent Dawn, Hydraxxian Waterlords and a few others are nice to have, but not essential at this stage of the game.
---
&gt;Should I focus on any specific craft?  I'm Mining/Skinning right now.
---
You've got two gathering skills, just keep mining/skinning and selling the stuff on the AH since that will give you a good profit. 
---
&gt;Should I prioritize MC/Onyxia access? 
---
Absolutely. Ony is a lengthy quest chain and starting sooner rather than later is preferred. MC is basically a 20-30 minute BRD run. 
---
&gt;Should I complete those quests before I respec from Arms to Prot?
---
I'd say only respec to Prot if you are asked to MT for raids, otherwise you can tank just fine with Arms as long as you have decent gear.
---
you are saying bfa is easier because you did a heroic dungeon??? if you want a challenge play high m+ or mythic raiding. 
---
i just did my first full molten core and onyxia run and it was a fucking joke. we killed bosses that i thought was a trash mob. i hope classic raid difficulty goes up substantially because its wayyyyy too easy right now.
---
What people don't realise is that this isn't an easy fix. It may be impossible to fix the problem.
---
The game used to run on dedicated hardware, one blade per server. Around MoP (?) they moved away from that model to cloud hosting. Cloud hosting is great for things like being able to quickly spool up a BUNCH of new servers, layers, instances, etc - but it is HORRIBLE for handling massive stress/activity on one server/layer.
---
They are absolutely not going back to the old model (hell, half the old blades have been auctioned off) and you can't exactly tell AWS to completely change their cloud structure just for you.
---
Should be able to record the speed at a given point along the flight path. Ideally find a path where the speed is constant for at least a few seconds to give some decent margin of error.
---
Recording the screen while on the flight path would allow for very careful analysis.
---
On the one hand at least he's out in the world ganking and not sitting next to a flight point murdering everyone and then graveyard camping them. On the other hand a lot of those were him killing lowbies that were zero threat.
---
Game was designed around large scale fights in 2004, when a server hosted 3000 players and a large scale fight was 40 vs 40.  
---
Today's servers are hosting 10,000+ players and we think of large scale as 100 vs 100.  
---
The code/engine just isn't equipped to handle today's scale.
---
Why would anyone do that
---
First time playing wow and I didn't know what add-ons were. I was questing through Dun Morogh when I was at a point where I couldn't find another quest to do, but I wasn't a high enough level to quest in Loch Modan yet. Turns out I had missed the two quests by the quarry, the lost pilot quest, and both elite quests. There's two options here I can get outside help or I can wander aimlessly. I don't like wasting time wandering like an idiot so easy choice for me.
---
&gt; Or do you really think some guy can just browse the code and be like "aha! theres the problem!" in a couple hours?
---
I think a team of developers can debug the code and solve problems in a couple weeks, yeah. This issue is probably not even code related - it's probably in operations. These servers are probably running on VMs. There's a number of things they could do to approach an issue like this, but what they appear to be doing instead is ignoring it.
---
All of this is irrelevant, of course, because what I was responding to was the idea that there was a "server software limitation" that for some reason was just out of Blizzard's hands entirely. Software limitation is a common excuse used by private servers who actually don't have access to all of the code, but it's total nonsense coming from the producing company itself. It's like if Coke stopped putting bottle caps on bottles, and tried telling buyers "Sorry it's a machine limitation." Fix the machine.
---
Bcus private servers did it better
---
A couple months=two months in standard English usage
---
And sorry apparently the build I am using is 19/32 I leveled with 18/33 Riposte build.
---
I do however take 3/3 ruthlessness over imp poisons because Rocks and Fire are not immune to Eviscerate and Slice and Dice.

This is as close as I can get you.  From here you will possible need to look up conditions beyond this.  Change the x to corresponding stance digit.
---
&gt; will likely have MUCH higher bandwidth per user than Blizzard will ever entertain.
---
Because Blizzard can't afford bandwidth?  Blizzard is likely co-located at a high-end datacenter somewhere with more than enough bandwidth available.   I doubt they are saturated on any of their network even at peak times.  If locating at a cloud provider would be faster, they could just do that.  It wouldn't be.  Cloud providers are good at being cheap, not fast. 
---
&gt; I will simply say "artificial spell batching" is causing data log jams as its holding some data until a release time then trying to send it all out at once
---
Batching should be beneficial to both processing and bandwidth.  I completely disagree with you here.   I won't venture a guess as to the details other than that it's probably some part of their server code that doesn't scale well.  It's been said that private servers started scaling a lot better once someone dug into the code and optimized things.  This is the type of thing that companies like to avoid doing if possible.  It would not surprise me to find out that private server code is far more efficient than blizzard's code. 
---
&gt; I am not a coder or engineer
---
Not that it makes me right, but I am both.
---
Dig out a potato and it will probably run wow fine. It's not exactly a hardware demanding game.
---
Start your attunements. MC is quick but Ony will take you awhile. You can do before or after you respec, but since you're 60 already you might as well respec to Prot to do the dungeons.
---
One guild on my server got eye and both bindings in the first 3 weeks. My guild is 8-9 weeks in without them. RNG
---
Most of my guild isn‚Äôt 60 yet :c
---
Good thing we're in the World of Warcraft, not the World of Lets be Friendscraft
---
They met, sure.  I dunno about offering jobs though.  The Nost guys had literally nothing of value to offer Blizz in terms of helping server stability.
---
I'm pretty sure that's how it was in true vanilla. You could float by modifying your client side texture of a campfire to the texture for the Dark Portal, and climb over obstacles on your deployable stairwell.
---
You only need like 80 people to start seeing some lag, 120 to 160 is when shit really goes down. That isn't that many people to come out for a world boss if it's not 4am on a weekday
---
Maybe I was just lucky then, because I started around the end of week 1.
---
I learned gnome engineering. I never did the goblin quest show your work. I only wanted gnomish the first time. 
---
I dropped engineering long ago. Now my plan is to learn goblin. I don't know much but there seems to be a book in Tanaris that I need to read at a certain time. Why do we use the book? Can't we just level up engineering to the dividing point and chose to do the Goblin one this time?
---
Yesh the level spike in there is pretty crazy, gj
---
Who cares? Seriously, who really cares? It's a 15 year old game that people are playing for fun. I love world PvP, but if I get killed by some Shadow Priest I'm not going to blame 30,000 ms delay I'm just going to rezz and keep going.
---
You guys need some other fucking hobbies.
---
The gear level matters more than the spec I find.  Fresh 60 in prot will probs be harder to heal than a DPS warrior wearing MC gear.
---
This is WoW.... trying to insult other players for having no life is thick irony.

That's completely fair - people play for different reasons.

However your way of playing and enjoying the game isn't dimished by introducing new updates, while for others the game can become stale without updates.

Can confirm that on multiple occasions I've started to cast a 2.5 second heal as a dual-wielding warrior charges a pack only to have them die before the cast completes. Put on a shield, people.

---
Once guilds are progressing in Naxx, MC/Ony/BWL/AQ will be doable in a single raid night. Assuming they don't weigh it down with deadweight/alts.
---
Can you link me to these pads? Ones i got with the keyboard are not any near as nice.
---
What are we measuring to compare them?
---
Like, total time /played over a 6 month period? 
---
Are we measuring total time required between the honor system release to getting rank 14 vs. total time spent in arenas from unranked to the top 0.5%?
---
Hmmmm I'll have to try that, people don't seem too fluent in frost shock
---
I believe it only generates threat when health is actually healed, so if you haven't taken damage from mobs, you're not generating threat from your pre-HoTs. I believe pre-hotting also helps in that it keeps you alive a little longer before the actual healer has to start healing you, keeping their threat lower for a tiny bit longer.
---
I'm not sure if that's what you're asking, but figured I'd try...
---
This.  2 fire elementals plus other elites can melt your tank.   Having warlock plus mage cc makes this dungeon lot easier.
---
Kinesis.
---
I never said it was an excuse.. I just said it‚Äôs probably a software limitation... I‚Äôm not defending Blizzard if you read again you might catch that.
---
Just give us BG‚Äôs until then and I‚Äôm fine with it.
---
The amount of priests on discord that claim flash heal is the best heal is what‚Äôs causing this. Cheese guilds who kill bosses in 20-30 seconds can get away with 2-3 priests spamming flash because not only is the boss dying incredibly fast but they‚Äôre getting fed innervate. My guild tends to kill most bosses in mc within 40-60 seconds and I‚Äôve been able to parse 99% on more than a few fights by using rank 2/4 heal. Flash is a niche situational spell that far too many priests abuse in a bad way.
---
Do you have proof of this? And is there a way in-game to check GUID?
---
My guild recommends bringing 1 Greater Arcane Protection Potion and 2 Greater Fire Protection Potions during each raid. I'm curious when I should use these. It dissapeared on death. I was also curious as to if the buff expires when all damage is absorbed.
---
I give you an A
---
"A couple" can literallt mean "two or *a few* (of something)".
---
In quantity terminology "few" means two *or more*.
---
All in all I'm just saying that the quote is very subjective (a piece from 6 months ago as well) and the person I was talking to shouldn't be making arguments based on subjective views of what someone else meant by it, since it's not clear.
---
Which brings us back to a more recent statement made by Blizzard where they said Phase releases are based on a few factors, of which layers is one of those factors.
---
Yeah i guess my question was, when leveling solo is SoC really THAT much better at killing mobs.
---
Rolls on a pvp server.
---
Cries about PVP.
---
Show up at 2am or bring some friends like everyone else.
---
Saying it is done to make the other faction weak is short sighted. The hunter quest maybe not as bad, but especially for benediction where its a 2 hour + respawn. This means your faction is delayed even longer getting theirs.
---
Its a guid.  global unique identifier.
---
They sort by that, yes.  The whole point of the video and the testing involved proves this.
---
You aren't adding anything to the conversation.
---
They could math.random it and randomly pick a person from the list but that takes more time/cycles.  So they just take the first element in the array of players.
---
LOL
---
As I said my post never said anything about it being an excuse or that it was out of Blizzards hands. LOL. It‚Äôs their software they should fix it. Not like they don‚Äôt have developers on hand for this kind of stuff. You pulled that out of no where about me defending or making an excuse for them.
---
Possibly. You'd be taking a healer role.
---
My guild which I feel is one of the larger ones on our server has a solid 20 man group and pug the rest. We're just getting a raid schedule and what not. They are 100% helping the try hards. But imo that makes sense cause in 6 months that's all that'll be left.
---
Maybe that's what is meant then
---
A shadow priest would also be a good combo, you can do decent damage and heal him when fighting big groups or hard mobs.
---
Otherwise rogue would be perfect, brings more utility than another druid and you can stealth through places together, plus you have useful skills like lockpick and sap.
---
If your dad wants to tank go for priest, if he wants to heal then go rogue or feral druid.
---
I'll downvote myself just to get the party started.
---
... They rewrote everything. This is well known.
---
&gt; Nope. 
---
They def had. Fast WS wins were always more lucrative compared to farming players there over and over.
---
Arcane for Shazzrah. 
---
Fire Protection for Ragnaros, and optionally Baron Geddon if you want to mitigate some fireball damage.
---
Pre-battlegrounds Hillsbrad was a constant lagfest due to all the PvP.  I haven‚Äôt seen anything even close to it in Classic.
---
Im surprised the waters work, is that for all bosses?
---
they do it for free because they need things out of the dungeon. if I'm going to tank a dungeon I don't need, I'm not going to rely on the generosity of the group to tip me. I'm going to be up front and say half now, half before final boss.
---
Why do we always have to talk like we know everything as a fact?  I assume you don't work at blizzard, but you seem to know their motive? You say they don't care, but if that were true, they never would've released classic in the first place.  It's a profit driven business, not a highschool teen holding grudges.
---
Also make sure to do the goblin and gnomish quests before dropping it. It's a bug if you don't then you can't choose the other spec.
---
Gryphons arent a mount. They're a taxi
---
Cool thanks. Makes sense.
---
Go play on a PVE server
---
r/titlegore
---
People with practical boots on the ground experience running a successful large pop classic server has nothing to offer...? Uhhhhhhhh
---
Well sure, but you can just deal with her the normal way then. Get reset and build threat again.
---
I'm desperately trying to get the staff skill on my Warlock leveled from 299 to 300, because, .......... reasons.
---
It's been days since I hit 299, smacking everything in sight, and still I can't get that last point.  Mainly I've been hitting mobs level 55-57.
---
My question is, how important is the mob level for leveling weapon skill?  Will I have considerably more luck if I only hit level 60+ monsters, or is it all just random at this point?
---
That's true, it will mostly work anyway if you use your MT and OT, however it's not ideal to have your P1 OT be the P3 MT because they should have less threat built up (mainly due to the MT getting more rage from taking damage). 
---
Also, while your raid is using the MT and OT to soak, some may have a healer or DPS act as the soaker and have the OT picking up whelps. If one of them comes in and soaks and the MTs aggro gets wiped because of the GUID configuration and then Ony goes down the list and wipes the OT's (who may not be expecting it) threat as well, you're going to have an ugly P3 transition.
---
If you're a Night Elf than shadow form.  Else go bear and run to the tank - pop the Rage to Health skill on the way as well.
---
really missed me on the dwarves... no mention of all the alcoholics that roll dwarves to mask addicition with roleplaying
---
Spamming flash is not only bad practice but also slows down your raid clear. If you end a boss with 0 mana you can‚Äôt set up for the next trash pull immediately. Not only that but you absolutely can‚Äôt spam full rank flash for more than 30ish seconds and rank 4 flash is just shitty healing. Face it dude, you‚Äôre using a 1.5 sec cast as a crutch. Anticipate damage, spot heal accordingly.
---
Ya...I can't comprehend someone being that stupid.
---
*Thinks back to the 20yr olds in college with him*
---
*Thinks about coworkers*
---
Wait. Yes I can.
---
Trust me, they aren't asking about macros. They barely know how to run the devices that would get them to Reddit. xD
---
Seriously, why would anyone to play like that? The key word is "play". The game is supposed to be fun, not a job where you get a performance review. I just rolled a tank, joined an amazing casual guild and the people have been running me through WC and RFC helping me learn the class. They don't care, they just want to chill and play.
---
We had a PvP battle on Kromcrush with multiple 40-man Alliance raids trying to kill 2 Horde MC raids (both from the same guild) and it was definitely playable. Laggy, sure. But playable and a lot of fun.
---
this sounds really interesting, anywhere i can learn more about this?
---
This works, dude.
---
And you don't just post proven shit.  You post theories and let other scientists run tests, too.  Its called the scientific method.
---
Those are two different goals.  Every season was a new title and new gear.  The comparison is between getting rank 14 and getting gladiator, not getting gladiator every season.
---
Check out the pinned messages in the Ony channel on the Classic Warrior discord server.
---
Im almost lvl 50 and I keep an armor and weapon set for dungeons and another set for questing. All of my dungeon gear is +healing and all my questing gear is str, int, and stam
---
Misinformation like this isn't bad or harmful.  Its called science.
---
And this works.  Teh macros work.  It all works.
---
You‚Äôre going to have to bite the bullet and go pve spec to get into a pve team. If I were a guild leader I wouldn‚Äôt want to carry a pvp spec thru a raid when 39 others are doing everything they can to progress the guild. If your logs are still bad after that research your class BiS and grind out getting the gear you need and read up on how to maximize your class effectiveness in raids.
---
Oh no you‚Äôre very wrong. I do solo east runs  on my mage where I jump down the middle and clear all lasher packs. A run takes 15-20 min depending on how focused I am and I get 5-8 dreamfoil and grom each run. That‚Äôs a stack of each roughly every hour. Dreamfoil is 14g and grom is 6 so I‚Äôm making 20g/hr or more just from the picked herbs during the solo runs. Then a lot more from loot.
---
Arms is better, but listen:
---
You aren‚Äôt doing arenas.  You‚Äôre just smashing mofos.  Just get a pocket healer and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
And we are in agreement that getting gladiator for the first time is just as time consuming as getting rank 14...
---
On a related note, how do I learn Blink as a Warrior?  I'm really jealous of the ones in your vid
---
That doesn't work unless you have 200ms ping... you'll just end up canceling frostbolts.
---
You can also use r1 Frostbolt to stack Winter's Chill faster, IDK if it's worth it.
---
Should I wear Shadowcraft Tunic or Mixologist's Tunic as chest armor? I feel shadowcraft is better because it has more crit, eventhough mixologist's has 3 extra AP and better stamina.
---
Also, what is the best preraid BiS list for rogues? I'm using one on wowhead but I feel a few good options aren't listed while worse options are.
---
I think the problem is when you attach at least some importance to the subjective opinion of an anonymous individual in a 15-year-old MMORPG. Such questions need to be discussed with a certified psychiatrist, if we are talking about adult ofc.

Rude Buster (Battle) - Deltarune
---
It means two, however there‚Äôs an implicit error bar imbedded in the phrasing. So when he said a couple months that means closer to 2 than to 3 which we have exceeded.
---
&gt;Thanks. I'm only interested in PVE. I've already started Ony access, I'm on the 3rd quest in the series iirc. I have some Argent Dawn rep from questing in E. plague, I could get them up to Friendly pretty easily. How far do I need to go?
---
At Revered you get the +5 resist shoulder enchants which are handy. Other than that, not too much since you're a warrior.
---
&gt;I do think I'm going to switch Skinning to Engineering eventually, but I may do that after I've got solid gear and an epic mount.
---
Leveling engineering isn't too bad, especially if you do the mining yourself. But yeah, an epic mount will make the gathering process a whole lot easier and a lot faster.
---
&gt;Skinning really hasn't been that profitable, though. Is it worth going out of my way to get the +15 skinning items?
---
If you plan to raid MC/Ony, then it's worth it. But the raid will only need one skinner at the level, so you may not even need to.
---
I uh, oneshot one of those arcane frost mages with my reflector last night in BRM.
---
Poor guy thought he was pressing the "delete warrior" button and didn't expect the "no u"
---
Yeah I shouldn't have put the stuff about the gear in the post lol I understand if I wanna do different things I need 2 gear sets
---
That's not how DM:E healer/tank jump runs go. Often you don't have very good class setups to farm those lasher packs. They're almost always skipped.
---
Yes but mages will sheep you until the debuff wears off.
---
I‚Äôm not seeing the no changes = poorly optimized servers connection. The nostalrious people successfully did what Activision can‚Äôt. Surely a group who backwards engineered vanilla have more knowhow than a group of new devs working in retail?  Not having direct access to source code or whatever your suggesting doesn‚Äôt mean those people wouldn‚Äôt be assets to the classic team.
---
Lul
---
Nope, swifty did well with it
---
I did. I‚Äôm not delusional enough to believe a pirate server attracted a fraction of a AAA marketed official release.
---
If the point is honor then dhk will stop town fights.
---
Me and Vincent woulda been satisfied with some freeze dried Major Frothy's
---
I‚Äôm not really sure why people keep bringing this back to entitled private server players, wanting to change the classic Wow experience.  They are simply comparing a private servers stability that is more or less free, and ran by volunteers VS those of a cooperation charging 15/mo to play.
---
It is not unfair to have standards and expectations from a service that you are paying for. When you go out to eat, you expect your dinner to be warm, and cooked all the way through right? That‚Äôs the experience you pay for, and that‚Äôs the experience you deserve. 
---
I‚Äôm happy to be playing classic, and yes I continue to play despite any downfalls, this is my decision, and I can pull my money anytime I feel like. This being said,  it isn‚Äôt too much to expect that some of these issues are actively being worked on, and my to mention a little customer service. 
---
There are issues all over the forums about about handfuls of players randomly losing connection with blizzard servers, outside of mass world pvp, dungeons/raids. Simply questing and doing normal activities, they can‚Äôt play the game. Stable internet connection, other playable games, only problem with being disconnected from classic servers.
---
You can also use the fire potions during Onyxia to help with the fireballs.
---
Bro find a smaller guild that runs PUGS still and is trying to build their core, join them. You're always going to have a raid spot over a pug even if you're a shit spec and nobody cares. If you regularly join PUGS why not message the guild leaders that put them together? They definitely need people.
---
edit to add: My guild clears MC and Ony weekly with like 5-7 people under 58 so it's not a problem to have one guy that does sub par DPS especially if they bring the utility a paladin can. We have fucking feral druids in the raid on onyxia.
---
I asked this literally every time i saw that lol
---
&gt; not wanting anything to do with Classic.
---
That's because they knew they couldn't get away with a cash shop in it. :P
---
Also, I'm pretty sure Classic is on Administration Mode; minimal staff, minimal system resources. ...again, because the only money it's making is through subs.
---
Threat is a player object attribute same as guid.
---
Checking a value takes the same amount of time, doesn't matter what the value is.
---
It would take extra step, maybe, to sort based on threat and not guid but meh, not really.
---
Your scientific method format made my cream in my jeans.
---
Sounds like you are trying to join try hard guilds. People have been posting for months about how their offspeced guild is having no issue running MC, anyone asking for logs is taking MC way more seriously then they need too.
---
bruh... BRUH...  It took me a full week, as a melee char with 100+ int, to get from 299-300 2h Maces.  This included a full MC clear, multiple UBRS runs and multiple DM:W/E runs.  Shit was ridiculous.
---
So, I don't think mob level effects it, just the chance of getting that last skill if very low.
---
"So we downloaded the mangos source and paid a few guys to make this, this, and this multithreaded, then slapped it on the biggest hunk of metal we could afford."
---
"Oh, damn.  Why didn't we think of that?"
---
Nice thanks for the suggestions will try them all out!
---
I played from launch until right before MOP came out.
---
I was burned out, the classes I liked had been gutted and reworked so many times I just didn't care.  
---
PvP wasn't fun, it was just a boring slog of "try to kill the healer" for 5 min while occasionally catching someone in a fight.
---
My hunter was the bane of casters and rogues once upon a time, then it seemed like I could kill nothing solo even with great gear.
---
Resilience and all the casting buffs made PvP so boring  to me.
---
Dungeons were boring, I don't know if I actually wiped a single time in Cataclysm.
---
I rolled a DK in WotLK to try tanking, and while it was fun, it wasn't that challenging.
---
The game just turned into a lot of rep grinds and boring PvP.
---
Now classic is back.
---
I haven't played in years but thought I would check it out to see if I was tired of WoW or just tired of what WoW had become.
---
A month later and I am still in classic, rolling alts, saving mount money, murdering any rogue who I catch out there who doesn't want to burn a Vanish.
---
Marking targets in dungeons, camping rare spawns to tame, trying to make some gold.
---
It's just way better.  
---
There are some things I like in retail, some conveniences I miss, and some classes I think  are better (frost mage for example) but it's just a bunch of EZ mode overinflated bonkers shit and I still would have to grind rep to get Trolls that can stand up.
---
You know how many reps I am going to grind in Classic?  Probably none, unless I really want a different racial mount.
---
No thanks.
---
Right I dont agree with that. They changed nothing client side. Private servers had the full client with a skeleton backend. Just enough to make the game functional, but nothing else.
---
I leveled dw fury 1-60 and honestly it was great. Definitely did way more dps than 2h of either spec, I don't know why it gets such a bad rap
---
Especially works well with the 1h quest rewards from SM and RFD
---
I mean, not that it's relevant to 2019, but anyone who thinks vanilla servers were able to handle large scale player events is high off their own nostalgia farts.
---
[40 paladins vs 40 shamans killed vanilla servers](https://youtu.be/ZDZzrikYqTM?t=221)
---
[Here's an Ironforge raid. Notice how many people are running into walls and teleporting, and that the rogue can't actually use any abilities, until it all eventually comes to a total standstill.](https://youtu.be/8w4ozCUJ0aM?t=249)
---
Anyone who remembers the AQ40 opening knows it was a legendary clusterfuck of server crashes, bugged boats, and lagged out combat. [This video captures some of the latter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0kDqUlgM5c)
---
Just FYI these private servers paid like a thousand or so dollars a month to get a big french company to host for them, it's not like they did it on their moms internet.
---
But it's still pathetic that blizzard can't fix this.
---
Just think about the scope of your pvp in phase 2- If you‚Äôre rolling around with a group of friends, optimal pvp spec may not make or break your fights 95% of the time.
---
I‚Äôll probably go arms for the first week of phase 2 just to make the most of the experience, but after that just roll around in raid spec - at least until bgs come out
---
You have a video with a confirmed 100v100 that doesnt lag as hard as some of the  clips posted here?
---
That sounds miserable
---
I always thought
---
Aesthetics over all
---
Tauren best ele
---
Troll best resto
---
Orc best pvp
---
Ya... big oof. Also just because you are their guild leader, doesn‚Äôt make them your friend. If you can get some guild mates to come help you being the GM, I question your leadership now
---
Are people going to be moving to Shadowlands when the expansion releases or do you plan on staying with Classic?
---
Asking because I'm curious about what will happen to server populations in Classic.
---
I see you are a man of essence farming as well
---
I disagree, for the reason that in general other forms of PvP don't set back the entire server for both factions back hours
---
Sooooooo...it just happened.  I decided to switch to level 60 mobs and see if it made any difference.  The first one I killed gave me the last point. 
---
It might just be a coincidence, it might not.  I had thousands of hits on the level 55-57 mobs, and just one mobs worth to get it on the level 60.
---
n of 1, but it's conspicuous.
---
I attack everyone, yeah
---
Not enough floating crystals and clown costumes.
---
This honor system does test skill. The skill is efficient farming of honor. Non-skilled players will not be able to continually get invites to  (or make) premade groups that win battlegrounds in the quickest possible time. If it is truly 100% grind as you say, then you would be able to just pay the chinese farmers to grind you to rank 14. Not sure what skill means to you, but rank 14 players will be very skilled players. Might not be the best, let‚Äôs say, duelists but they will know how to win WSG/AV better than 90% of players, thats for sure.
---
You really don't look at logs do you? Those fast guilds are still bringing 8-10 healers, no one bothers doing 5 healer MC, wtf are you talking about. 
---
And for real, use consums (no flasks ofc) and you'll see that you can heal easily fight that last in the 1min to 2min30 sec using flash heal.
---
I attack everyone, some of them haven't hit 60 yet
---
I propose you get a group of friends to protect you on an off peak hour
---
Do you.. play the game?
---
It's mostly just bored level 60s, but funnily enough there was something similar that happened the other week on Sulfuras with alliance 60s camping tarren mill. Definitely goes both ways on Sulfuras.
---
You can have dps warriors throw a sword and board on for when whelps come and tank the adds.  It's what we do for the whelps.
---
But how to we get enough people to quit before January??
---
I half expected this shitpost to be behind a paywall.
---
Same stream, good eye though
---
Yeah I'm quite sure I have the right post. You said "not the point" so I'm trying to figure out what your point is.
---
Seems you have absolutely no clue lol
---
Few travelers know the eternal hell that retribution paladins have condoned in secrecy. For the book of light is strict, binding the readers to a life of perpetual servitude. Unable to quench the ever growing sense of Justice, in this increasingly cruel world, the silver hands surmised a fate worse than hell itself, while maintaining the boundaries of their invisible code.
---
While incapacitated within the tomb of repentance the heathens seem entranced likened to a moth and her light.  In reality, the soul leaves the vessel, rematerialized in a pitch dark void, whereas every inch of surface is enshrouded by a thin viel of Legos. For every second that passes is a year in this newly crafted purgatory.  As the world looks towards the light of the paladins for hope and salvation, the retribution arm has worked in secrecy to exact it's more just form of retribution.
---
You.. just referred to me..?
---
I'm not saying it to be a show off or anything, just a small defense against a personal attack. You don't know anything about me, yet your throwing shade directly against my person. Saying "Get some friends" is pretty rude, as is "I question your leadership"  
---
In general, be kinder to people.
---
Wait. Yeah, I had this idea that defensive stance was useless with a 2h because of shield skills. Now I definitely feel stupid not realising I could still use my *other* non shield skills...
---
These pads came with the keyboard (Kinesis Freestyle Edge RGB), the tenting standard is a separate kit. You can view all their products on the Kinesis website.
---
retail can recover. legion was awesome, bfa sucks ass but not for the reason op talked about. he literally did a heroic dungeon then complained it was too easy. he should do high mythic + if he wants a challenge.
---
u say facts but you have not said anything specific. your comment also proves the circle jerk because you cant explain why it sucks
---
&gt; TBC has flaws, but the art design/zones are not it.
---
I'm calling horse manure.
---
Floating Crystals, ENERGY BEAMZ, and glowing color soup neon pallets everywhere is absolutely a garbage design decision.
---
Yet none of you will guard you from Horde. Hmm
---
&gt; Once we get to phase 3
---
phase 3 is going to kill wpvp just like it did in the original. And the people who still complain about lag will be told to "just do battlegrounds if you want to pvp" just like the original.
---
Phase 3 is the "fix", it just doesn't fix the technical problems with the game.
---
WoW Classic is using the retail engine, which is why original vanilla addons do not work in classic, but properly coded retail addons will
---
It is also why it took so long to roll out, having to update all the vanilla code as many instructions and rules that were in vanilla no longer exist, and many that do have been changed
---
Though, even with all the pre-relaunch work, there are still many things/abilities that are not functioning properly, most notable object definition (getting stuck on walkways with wooden planks because the edges stick up too far) and collision (attacks and mobs going thru 'solid' objects).
---
Even as they 'fix' things, or are working on them, they have made no/minimal effort to communicate what is supposed to be happening, which itself is also a throwback to vanilla when most of our reliable info came from sites that were data mining updates.  
---
Bottom line, if it is regular and reliable info you want, don't expect it from blizzard any time soon.
---
I‚Äôm about to farm BT too! Not looking forward to it :( happy camping!
---
Don't get butt hurt when someone calls it how it is lol...it's okay if WoW is your entire life, for some people it's just a game.
---
Lots of community minded folks left due to the Hong Kong incident
---
low skill coward spec imo
---
Lol dude hate to say it but this is a useless post. Those on pvp servers are not going to change what they are doing because the mentality seems to be keep them from getting more powerful so they can't threaten me and those on pve servers don't do this anyways. Yea it sucks but that's pvp my dude. I'm surprised you got that close...I'd recommend getting it done before phase 2 though because im pretty sure there will be people camping that shit afterwards.
---
You scout. That‚Äôs about it.
---
You didn't get Gladiator for the first time playing one hour a day. You had to play a LOT.
---
Rank 14 might be brutal and inflexible. You can't take a break halfway through rank 12 and come back to it 2 weeks later because you will lose your ranking. (You could take a break with arena.) But at the end of the day, the two had a very similar time commitment.
---
Ret with 2h and alchemy has been my way to get the difficult quests done. Pops lots of elixirs and potions +  well timed HOJ and heal and you can get a lot done.
---
That helps, and is often done, but when you can do any instant ability to tap the demon and despawn it, its not fool proof in any way.
---
People in various discords said it!?!? Well well golly gee wiz.
---
The only things remotely difficult in Classic right now are
---
A) Hunter bow quest for Rhok and Lhok.  
---
B) DM:N with no CC  
---
C) Finding 40 people. 2-3 of whom can hold a reasonable amount of threat, 8-9 of which can heal reasonable well and 2X of whom can all target roughly the same mob at roughly the same time and push buttons while not standing in ground candy or pulling aggro.
---
You should ask 10 months from now
---
I specced 2h fury around level 48 and it was a great choice for me.  I preferred single-target playstyle and it was extremely effective.  
---
I bought a Taran icebreaker (relatively cheap epic level 47 mace) which is cheap because it's a very fast weap, usually people want the slow weaps for big overpowers or whirlwinds.  But I thought Taran would be great especially with a +7 damage enchant (relatively cheap).  I had around 20 crit%, and flurry was up A LOT.   With flurry up my attack speed was under 2.0, so you always had a ton of rage generation for various abilities. 
---
Usually I bloodthirst almost on cooldown even in single-target fights, leading to a ton of self-healing plus blood crazy healed if I was crit.  I was an extremely rugged fighter 1v1 in PVE as monsters sometimes couldn't quite finish me off because I would passively gain hundreds of hp during combat. 
---
It's not great to be missing out on sweeping strikes, but the obvious solution there is to NOT PULL MULTIPLE MOBS!  
---
It's not for everyone but I loved the playstyle and it was extremely easy to kill same level or 1-2 levels below mobs.
---
No one has any answers? Sick. 
---
Has anyone made a ticket recently?!
---
Blindly blame spell batching
---
It's not bad manners
---
* Stormwind to Westfall: 434% With and without carrot. 
---
* Westfall to Stormwind: 435% With and without carrot. 
---
It made no difference, as the above study suggested.
---
Propably some sort of quick workaround they implemented in vanilla and never went back to fix it.
---
yes?
---
Rogue
---
0 chance I ever play retail, so you know my answer.
---
as alliance, yes. but on horde you have windfury, thus making hs spam way better.
---
You can solo level fine without any points in Ret at all, but Seal of Command is the most impactful Ret talent.
---
However the key talents for tanking are Consecration and Improved Righteous Fury; if you don't have those you're a fake tank who won't be able to hold threat in either single- or multi-target situations. Even with those it's hard without Blessing of Sanctuary.
---
You can't get the key talents for tanking + SoC until level 44.
---
That's what my take was, too.
---
"Watch me, an overgeared warrior, ambush undergeared clothies in PvE armor."
---
The only skill I saw here was proper timing of reflectors.
---
I'm doing the world a favor by stopping these hunters that abuse their pets by making them fight. 
---
They are the real sociopaths.
---
Thank you!
---
Private does it better. Plus our money doesn't go to fund J Allen Brack's sex change.
---
There is a reason TBC private servers had massive dropoff, and vanilla servers had staying power.
---
World of you rolled the wrong faction losercraft.
---
If asking about priest staff, no they keep them.
---
Okay, but what metric are we using to measure the grind? Is it real-time or is it in-game time, and from what periods of time?
---
Lmao
---
I'm not elaborately trolling my dude, I'm absolutely fucking crushed that I've spent two months playing this game wrong and nobody told me until I hit almost level cap. Everything was going, at least from my perspective, pretty smoothly until I got here and it's just been a brick wall since. 
---
&gt; Quickly get to a mob that's eating your healer several yards away from you. (Berserker Stance -&gt; Intercept) 
---
Yeah that's a thing that happens that makes it so frustrating because pretty much every time I've tried Scholo the healer was dead before I can even walk over to where the mob killed them with all the slows on me. 
---
&gt; Stop a mob from running away (Battle or Berserker -&gt; Hamstring) 
---
Yeah that's correct, and it has made me put the game down for the rest of the day like I mentioned. 
---
&gt; Quickly get threat on 4 mobs right after the pull (Berserker Stance -&gt; Whirlwind) 
---
Yeah well that's kinda why I posted in the thread was to find ways to generate AoE threat, I legitimately didn't know that constantly hopping between stances was a thing you did as a warrior. 
---
&gt; Use Overpower at all (Battle stance -&gt; Overpower) 
---
I just spent all my money on getting and upgrading a bunch of shit and that wasn't even one of them so yeah that's one I guess I'll have to get too. 
---
&gt; Become immune to fear when you know you're about to get feared (Berserker Stance -&gt; Berserker Rage) 
---
The only fear immunity I've been using has been my armorsmithing trinket and I figured it was pretty much a pvp only trinket
---
Game breaking bug, lololololololololololololol,
---
I think a small part of the population will temporarily move and the come back.
---
My 2015 MacBook Air runs it well enough, and the graphics are kind of charming in a low Rez high FPS way.
---
I agree that sc is better, although tbh both are pretty underwhelming in pve. The wowhead list is pretty good imo...it underrates sc -- leaving chest boots and helm off the optional list is silly given whats on there now -- but overall the top slots seem right to me.
---
Pretty sure we got the factions mixed up on this one.
---
I don‚Äôt find leatherworking rewarding at all. It‚Äôs only useful to help the guild by providing free crafting.
---
technically, you can get the quest at lvl45. So if you know some higher levels that can carry you, its worth it (that is what I did). Also Tinkerer Gizlock, drops a awesome shaman shield (int/stam/mp5)
---
Are you comparing server requirements of an FPS to an MMO...?
---
I think you just need #showtooltip and it is smart enough to show the tooltip of the ability that meets its conditions. Otherwise this is absolutely correct.
---
I got warrior's embrace last night in ST  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10845/warriors-embrace](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10845/warriors-embrace) 
---
I currently wear Carapace of Tuten'kash  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10775/carapace-of-tutenkash](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10775/carapace-of-tutenkash) 
---
I know that the new chest has 2% dodge and more raw armor but i lose strength and stamina. As a warrior tank is it still worth it to use the new chest? How good is 2% dodge basically
---
What does it matter if it was said 3 or 6 months ago? It's the latest official statement made about phase lengths, and it has never been changed. And it turned out to be correct; the first phase lasted 2.5 months.
---
Yet you're acting as if Blizzard are going into panic mode. 2 words: Grow up.
---
Hashtag no changes
---
Idk, I think his point of " your way of playing and enjoying the game isn't dimished by introducing new updates, while for others the game can become stale without updates" is still incredibly valid.
---
Economy might change, goals might change, but what content you do will not. Even the "small minority" that people like to claim exists will still be doing MC/Ony for the entirety of Classic. More content is a benefit for everyone, while less content only benefits those who have yet to experience current content.
---
I personally don't think the argument of "Well what I sell/buy might change, and some other people might want to do BWL, so we shouldn't release more content" holds up.
---
They would, and often do, but that isn't the point. Especially considering any instant ability can despawn the demons, no amount of friends protecting you can solve the issue.
---
*‚Äùwhen it stopped moving‚Äù*
---
How was the Gagh?
---
Wish you weren't so fuckin awkward, bud.
---
&gt;where theres is maybe 1 item out of there for Warrior Tanks
---
Tanks dont have a monopoly on no gear from strat live
---
Macros don‚Äôt take into consideration any procs all they can do is cast abilities, if the ability is not able to be cast then it will skip it.
---
All the macro is doing is
---
Push button
---
Casting ability 1
---
Casting ability 2 
---
Casting ability 3
---
Repeat
---
So the consequence of no checks in WPVP would be something like what?
---
Someone just drops dead and never sees a spell fire? Or someone sees their spell miss but it hits anyway?
---
Start farming gold for respecs. It's not just you that respec, for pvp or pve
---
Umm.. I have tanked as a druid almost til 60 and I see myself losing threat all the time if a healer heals me with a hot very early in the pull. 
---
Are you saying that the HOT has to be applied before "entering combat" appears, and then the heals don't generate threat?
---
Wait, so If I attack the mob it de-spawns and they don't complete the quest?
---
Where do people go to do this fight?  I need to know for ... reasons.
---
This macro works fine for me. Whenever Mongoose Bite or Counterattack proc they get used immediately when I'm spamming this macro. I typically don't watch for procs and opt for spamming the hell out of the button it's on when I'm melee weaving however. Can you provide any more details? You're specced into survival for counterattack, and you've got a counterattack proc, and it's not working?
---
I couldn't make it past the first three seconds if such a shit song. Heavy metal can be so good yet that was so bad
---
Yeah, they did.
---
I didn't know Ahn'Qiraj has a bobsled team?
---
couple things you could try:
---
1) take him into dungeons and help farm him gear and quests (some amazing guides on the wowhead classic site for dungeons and dungeon quests). There will be a xp penalty. so spamming dungeons with you and him wont be as quick as you would think.
---
Having better gear will allow him to solo quicker. Find quests that he can't do at his level to get gear ( warriors whirlwind axe @30 or the beast mastery quests in stv @27). help run him through elites quests. Make sure he prioritizes green quests before yellow quest when he solos. You will nerf his xp if you are in his group, being outside his group and letting him tag the mob &amp; you kill it, will also nerf the xp.
---
2) take him and three other similar leveled people into dungeons and grind them xp. The xp penalty will be much less because it will average the groups lvl for xp.
---
&gt; When the player experience impacts the flow of money you try to keep the player experience good
---
But it hasn't. Sure a bunch of people have complained and whined, but from what I've seen the numbers are very good.
---
&gt; I doubt anyone‚Äôs unsubbing yet because Wpvp is broken, but they might.
---
And Blizzard *might* do something then.
---
This is good content, but what we *really* need to know is what OP carved into his pumpkin and I‚Äôm not leaving till I get to the bottom of it.
---
well there are a lot of factors and you aren't giving enough info to recommend properly here. What is important to you?   
---
faction balance? best east coast pvp balance as far as I know is on blaumeux  
---
server pop? blaumeux is high pop but I left for that reason and I'm now on arcanite reaper where I can actually farm mats I need without too much trouble however this means getting groups to do things is more time consuming and takes more effort. 
---
raiding? pretty much any server you go to will have some guilds raiding content so really what you want to do is make a character a few servers and talk to some of the top raiding guilds on that server to see if there are spots for what you want to play, that the times/days match up with when you are available. Do you want to help a guild grow into raiding or do you want one that is already farming everything?
---
In some streak of illogic, it could also be hex over dec, meaning it's 16/10, and therefore 160%.
---
holy shit someone who knows what they're talking about in a reddit thread? Color me surprised.
---
Fuck the torch room. Finally got through it at lvl 60 with two mages. Never again.
---
Bought an Acer nitro 5 with 1050ti online for 200 bucks.
---
This is actually wrong. It's not the hardware that is the bottleneck, it's the core. Unfortunately, the developers can't fix that because it would mean rewriting the whole thing because it's not suitable for this style of gameplay.
---
2 hours is very easily achieved. Have someone do dm trib buff and have guildies fly in for it. Port/hearth back to org or sw, get ony buff. Get to close to mc and log out. Scout brm for other guilds and go in when it's clear. Dps is crucial for speed clears. Even without gear, the buffs will be enough to pull most raids below 2 hours. My MC/ony nights end with 10-15mins left on my flask and we are pretty casual aside from consumable requirements (most people do some farming and raid log).
---
Just gotta update adobe, right?
---
&gt;but pservers were better handled
---
Because everything was handled client side. Don't get me wrong, P2 is gonna massively fuck up, but saying that private servers handled it better is being willfully ignorant.
---
You can shop for scrolls and gear on the AH. Agi seems to be the potion you would want.  Leatherworkers make nice quivers and bullet bags. Engineers make nice bullets.
---
That's not what they said at all. This is an incredibly detailed response where it's obvious they looked into the issue. They are escalating it to the top of their department to work with the dev team to figure out options on how it could be handled.  
---
This is exactly why IT people hate end-users. You get a real, genuine response that is completely in line with how other companies deal with these problems and you still aren't satisfied. You don't even know what has come of their discussions and you're already bitching. Unbelievable.
---
Maybe you play horde and it's different, but every raid I join has at least 5-6 night elf hunters in it. They were also the most played class in vanilla going by stats weren't they (although i'm sure some of those were gold farmers)
---
There's a bunch of rogues and warriors too (more than hunters) but hunters are far from rare.
---
Is there an addon that will  highlight the enemy portrait or my action buttons (not just the keybind) when not in range? Or a hunter specific add on that I can stick a graphic near the center of my screen to keep track of my range?
---
Any healing or buffs done while fighting, any auras that come off/on during the fight, and any damage done to the mob from any source other than the person fighting it (they can't even use their pets) will despawn it.  
---
As far as where, you'll have to look that up for yourself.
---
Try more guilds.  We tend to look for the right people more so than the right logs.  It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect to kill stuff at this point.
---
I am on the horde side of that server
---
That almost happened to me in vanilla. I wasn't intentionally doing it, but I was no-lifing hard and solo pvping and climbing ranks. When I got r12 and kept pushing, the pvp coordinators took notice. 
---
They explained the deal and absorbed me into the BG group and put me in line for ranking. If I ignored them and kept pushing, I'm sure I would've been 'marked' and blacklisted(the PVP guys had roots in most raid guilds).
---
Eventually, anyone pushing ranks outside the organized PVPers will be noticed and dealt with.
---
Better than lag for sure, and I'm sure there's a way to prevent security holes without the game dying when more than 100 people are in the same area.
---
Yeah I guess those are important points. I would prefer faction balance, and I think I would like to help a guild grow but obviously that won‚Äôt be for a minute because I‚Äôd be starting over on that server.
---
Got my first devil skin by taking it from my own faction lol. Who doesn't use auto loot ?
---
Unfortunately there are already lots of those in IRL pseudo academic publishing
---
Imagine having a 30 second justice hammer stun as a healer
---
I'm proposing all data for the data center goes through the same pipe lines and each server only gets so many bytes until the transfer limit is reached.  They need to pay more to separate the data transfer and expand the limits imposed on each classic server so that world bosses with well over 1,000 players competing for it can occur.
---
Remember the two weeks that UKhackers brought down the classic servers?  Multiple servers would get shut down at the same time, so it proves share a lot of the same data center resources.  It is very likely a limit so that other servers, not all even have to be wow servers or blizzard servers, do not get downgraded.
---
This is probably EU players playing on NA servers that complain.
---
I'm east coast on an east coast server, Faerlina. Never any lag issues
---
There is some old info somewhere about mob targeting and threat, as the early implementations had bugs with overflowing target lists and other stuff like 'alphabetical sorting' and stuff.  
---
I forget offhand what they moved too after discovering issues with the name based sorting.
---
You used your college education to make a really fancy shitpost about a 15 year-old video game?  Bravo.  Bravo indeed.
---
10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60.
---
Yet here we are...people bitching...
---
So do whatever the tank wants or he will rage quit like a little bitch? 
---
I never met a tank like that and hope I never will.
---
If ur game, msg me on here ur too name. Ill add u. Plz be lol 55 or higher. I'm 57. I wanna farm devils and quest in EPL or BS. Can be swayed to do other crap if ut helps ur too or can make us fun/gold.
---
That's some bad leetspeek
---
Not sure about cruel barb being better than assasins for OH havnt seen any evidence to support this other than your commment
---
All this is useless unless we compare the scale of the "tons of world pvp"
---
It's a pretty unique scenario, having upwards of 100+ players in the same exact game in the same exact location all at once.   Even the new BR craze has 100 players but very rarely ever in the same location.
---
For a second there I thought I was going to find a chest or quest with epic gear... It would be cool if exploration like this was somehow rewarded to get people to truly explore the game, rather than be corralled into quest lines and sandboxed into regions. I would have been reeeeally cool to find something useful here and a great game design
---
How does a post get wasted? Is there some hard limit on how many posts can be made in the sub? Does your scroll wheel work properly?
---
Not that I mind too much, but does Alliance only get it in that one part of SW? I remember fishing while waiting for my guild to drop the head, and I think everyone else got it, but not me. But maybe we messed up the buff as well, I'm not sure.
---
I played Horde in Vanilla and I seem to remember the buff hitting *all* of Org.
---
I want P2 delayed anyways
---
To my understanding spells in WoW don't have scripts. They're database entries that apply predetermined effects. The Onyxia fireball applies the damaging fireball effect, and on top of that the threat reset effect. Here's the catch though: AoE abilities in WoW can evidently have a limit to the maximum amount of targets they affect. See the Priest's Psychic Scream ability for an example of this.
---
Presumably the way Onyxia's Fireballs are implemented is then a spell that in a 10 yard radius around the target applies fire damage to all targets in the area, and also applies the threat reset effect but only to a sinlge target in this area. These effects are then thrown into some processing queue. This processing queue then iterates through affected players by order of their GUID, because that's just what happens to be most convenient internally. Because the amount of targets is limited to 1, this means that it only targets the player with the lowest GUID.
---
One can test this theory with Psychic Scream. The rank 1 version of it only affects 2 targets, so if you get 3 players together and have them all stand in range of a priest who uses Psychic Scream, the player with the highest GUID should never be affected by it. An easy way to test this would be one of the free-for-all PvP areas like Gurubashi Arena and the pit in the middle of Dire Maul.
---
The spriest is herb/alch, lock tailor/ench
---
Heheh you're actually being serious..
---
Ignorance is a scary thing, but carry on.
---
I'm not the only one with a desk doggo!
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
In my two screen set up, I play the game on the left screen and this is tripping me out way harder than it should
---
Damage wise it's going to be about the same.  The spec can do more damage, but arms can load it into a small window.  Fury would be fine from a pure damage point of view.
---
The main reason arms is better is for the mortal strike debuff.  Reducing healing done to a target makes them much easier to kill.
---
If you are fine with losing MS, then the difference in total damage will be negligible if any.
---
Fewer*
---
I'm just going off the information given by OP, where he says that his low performance is due to his refusal to respec rather than other circumstances like fight length.
---
Yes of course. There's no point in releasing a pvp patch if you can't pvp
---
Feline and Goat footprints o.O
---
setting back an entire enemy faction on a pvp server is better than any other activity you could do so yeah....
---
Looking at your video list I'm assuming this is actually part 1?
---
Bye boo.
---
I'm not sure about bosses but it kills the skeletons in the priest quest with one shot. I happened to have run strat 7-8 times right before and asked to keep them for the benediction questline.
---
You don't need to tell anyone you're quitting, because nobody cares even a little bit.
---
Just quit and move on.
---
I don't think you can even define "hyperbolic" if that's what you think this is.
---
Guess the classic experience isn't for you
---
Cultivate some ovaries.
---
It had the bio spheres with dinosaur and a bunch of cool blood elf facilities.
---
Lmao what??
---
Acceptable!
---
This small little indy company can't afford new servers!  They'll have to crowd source all their funding just like they do with their Esports prize pools.
---
If you didn't want that to happen you could have rolled on a PVE server instead of complaining about pvp on a PVP server
---
Cya
---
That was 15 fucking years ago... Are you a fucking moron?
---
&gt; faction balance? best east coast pvp balance as far as I know is on blaumeux
---
blowme is a west coast server
---
Try it out.  We used the GUID method last night and decreased our kill time by a full minute because we didn't have to wait to re-start DPS in Phase 3.
---
Never assume that something is too stupid to actually have been implemented.
---
Name is Tincup.  Lvl56 tank.
---
Legend has it OP was born in the ocean and the water wasn't salty until after his conception
---
I was considering going mining/eng for the bombs/dynamite range pulls as I hear Paladins have difficulty with range pulls. Plus the pvp aspect. Do you feel you have issues with that going alch (assuming you don't have engi as well)?
---
Good riddance dude
---
-___-
---
It's ridiculous that in 2019 people don't know that there are limitation to hardware and software.
---
Did this go over my head
---
Only grilled. None of that tartare for me.
---
Trib buffs and Ony Buff?  How long does it take to set up those
---
It additionally sets back your own faction, which is not ideal.
---
well if you dont mind low pop arcanite reaper is eastern time and balance seems even but pvp doesn't seem to happen a lot. If you want high pop then blaumeux is pretty balanced. Those would be my suggestions. If you do come over to arcanite reaper look up &lt;Denied&gt;, they are really early in their raiding and still learning so it might be a good fit. Blaumeux has a bunch of really good guilds also. &lt;kick their darnassus&gt; is pretty early in their raiding it seemed when I was there.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
I do Incednius Horde Pvp server and I love it... East Coast. Lvl 60 priest.
---
I also lost shadowcraft tunic to a hunter.
---
He was a crappy hunter, too - wiped us twice on the drakk pull. So I was super salty.
---
Scrub Mentality.
---
All of those can be learned as a goblin engineer
---
No such thing. All leetspeak is leet.
---
Yes. The threat from the heal doesn't apply until the healer enters combat / the threat list, himself.  
---
In case someone wants to call bullshit, just put a renew or rejuv on someone and let them head into combat by themselves without applying threat outside of body pulling.  
---
The hot ticks won't generate aggro onto you, but it will accumulate and be applied when you do enter combat.
---
Phase 3: You need Onyxia Scale Cloaks.
---
Phase 4: No specific resistances
---
Phase 5: The raid should have workable Nature Resistance for Princess Huhuran and Viscideous. I remember it was possible to 'overgear and overpower' Huhuran as a DPS, at least in the past - requiring less raid-wide NR.
---
Phase 6: Frost Resistance for Sapphiron
---
all I am trying to say is the drop rate is most likely no longer 3%, your experience in Vanilla was the norm for sure, they are raining from the sky now however...
---
I‚Äôm not in a guild, but I know and raid with a lot of guilds. I mostly do stuff with Nightshift, and they are amazing.
---
BWL requires fire resist too and shadow. ZG and AQ require nature resist with some shadow. Naxx is shadow damage.
---
This if off topic but I recently learned that on many Naxx fights warlocks are required to chain cast shadow ward to mitigate shadow damage.
---
which you can easily right-click report
---
That has nothing to do with any streams, and everything to do with what i've tested in game rofl. 
---
But yeah idm if you continue to pay 100 gold a week to unlock an average farm spot. Go fucking on rofl and call me back when you are sick of using a gold sink for no reasons.
---
Yeah i was worried my realm would die out a bit because LFG was not super active, joined a good guild and also the realm discord and now it's pretty easy to set things up.
---
Does the [reset=x] function work in Classic? IIRC you could have a macro reset the sequence after a certain amount of time, but it hasn't worked when I've tried it.
---
No, obviously you don't. I'm using it as supporting evidence to show how people reading this agree with me and think you are an asshat.
---
I like your style
---
\-- a degenerate
---
It‚Äôs more than two raids mate
---
Cool thanks
---
&gt;Yes, I get to craft sappers...but as a mage, will I really be using them that much? 
---
In my experience, not a whole lot. They're a lot more useful on melee characters.
---
The sappers are also BoE, so all you really need to do is to find a friend with Goblin Engineering and work out a deal where you send them the mats and they send you the sappers.
---
&gt;And I'm not sure if the Everlook teleport is better than Gadgetzan, as an Alliance mage.
---
Yeah, since Darnasuss is so close it kind of makes an Everlook teleporter pointless, you save about 5~ minutes or so in travel time realistically. 
---
Meanwhile Gadget is incredibly useful because it will give you a faster way to get to Silithus/Onyxia/DM.
---
Yeah, I forgot that the barber wasn't in the game til much later. The good news for me is that as a gnome, no one can see me anyway.
---
No it doesnt, you're just being a baby and trying to use any excuse you can think of to justify your QQ
---
Oh!  Well, you can grind out whatever gear you want. I don't think they'll implement an xmog system any time soon.
---
Fellow Bigglechad. Just laugh at these peasants rolling on hyperpopulated streamer servers.
---
You are assuming that hardware isn't scalable.  A 1,000 2005 chips will perform better than 1 2019 chip.
---
Sure, the chips today are more powerful.  But if you don't have the hardware to support the anticipated players, you'll struggle to have enough resources to manage it.
---
You compared a car from 1940 to 2019.  But a fleet of cars from 1940 will move more people than 2 cars from 2019.  The problem is of resources for the demand.  2005 had the proper amount.  2019 is woefully behind and saying Blizzard is incompetent is wholly missing the point.
---
&gt; Damage wise it‚Äôs the same. The spec can do more damage, but arms can load it into a small window
---
Lol.  This sentence contradicts itself completely
---
&gt; Arms is better mainly because of mortal strike
---
Disagree. MS is huge, but the main reason is arms is more bursty overall and front ends the damage. MS is *part* of that but not the be all and end all
---
Try putting the conditional abilities first
---
    #showtooltip Raptor Strike
---
    /cast Counterattack
---
    /cast Mongoose Bite
---
    /cast Raptor Strike
---
    /startattack
---
you're trying to use a non-conditional ability first, so it will always stop there. If you put counterattack first it will use it when it can, skip it when it cant.
---
Bigglesworth is not layered. Hasn't been for a couple of weeks now.
---
yeah so respec arms for your EPIC pvp video and respec back.
---
You haven‚Äôt fought in wpvp with 100+ people then
---
I pity you when you experience that for the first time during p2
---
I don't know you now, in a few minutes from now you'll be irrelevant in my life. You seem to be NEEDING some attention.
---
When players battle for world bosses and raid cities the servers are going to crash and burn. What was blizzard thinking releasing phase 2 before these issues are fixed
---
Not as lazy as this repost
---
They were talking about efficiency. Raid is 30 people and fights are dragging for 2+ minutes and healers are going OOM. The conversation on heal efficiency started and of course they looked at top 1% of logs to see what those healers are doing. Of course you'll flash heal if a boss dies in 50 seconds... but that is not the same situation we're in. In blue gear with low raid dps, spamming flash heal is a recipe for disaster.
---
Honestly warrior tank gear is plentiful, dps wars dont even need the tier gear. The only contested piece are weapons.
---
Sample size too small, the hypothesis has not been systematically falsified; possible type 2 error.
---
People are complaining about the lag because it kills world PvP. 
---
The complaint about introducing BGs early is that it would kill world PvP.
---
Uh I don't think people knew how everything worked back then, it's mostly a pserver thing (hell, on some servers R14s were still trying to push just in case there was another rank).
---
It's gona be very server dependent, I know on mine there's going to be a discord set up for this and people will quickly figure out who the hard pushers are. We don't even know how many slots there will be yet.
---
I'm also on sulfuras 
---
I feel it's really RNG related and where the curve of the server is. For right now I feel like most active player are 60 so alot of people will be alts.
---
when I was leveling I would consider myself a tier 3 leveler. let me explain. tier 1 is the speedy boy. hsrdcore players hit 60 during week 1.
---
tier 2 is hardcore players but they aren't giving their all. so no mage or cleave dungeon group (well not from 40 to 60 like alot of tier 1 people) they might have other responsabilites that takes time (job kids) they hit 60 before week 2.
---
tier 3 is me. I got a full time job and I do quite alot of additional hours. I played alot on weekend. I did some dungeons groups with guild some with pugs but never super quickly cleave group or anything. this is still significantly over the '' average player '' I hit 60 right at the end of week 3.
---
even for tier 3 I was definetly over the server curves. Stv every 1 was peaceful questing but some tier 1 guy were already 60 so there's was the occasional gank.
---
but if let's say you're hit stv around week 4-5-6 that was right where the curve of the server was around 35 to 45. at that time stv was a giant battle ground LOL
---
Thanks! It‚Äôs hard sometimes to figure out which content is active at the moment
---
Most of the cost leveling engineering is from levels 240-300 anyway so I say just get Goblin but that's just me. The advantages aren't huge but with my mindset I really like to "finish" the profession.
---
????  
---
I want my buttons to swap when I switch stances. Its not a problem.
---
Ben Hogan now who's he?
---
All right I see :D
---
It wasn't. Sometime down the line the network code got rewritten and when it did it was inefficiently done.
---
I've got questie and auctioneer but I'll check that one out now too, thank you!
---
Please, let's cruise to TBC
---
Yes, you can definitely do it without being fully bis geared. 
---
Priest was not geared at all - 2 or 3 pre-raid bis items, and the rest was a mix between leveling gear and lvl 55+ dungeon gear. He was full holy/disc specced. I (being the warrior) was a bit better geared - maybe 60/40 between bis and 55+ dungeon gear, and standard fury specced.
---
Brd arena is not hard at all. What I learned (maybe I said this before, I don't remember) is that the mobs come in 2 waves, and you can fight them 1 wave at a time while the other group just wanders around the arena. And the bosses are pretty easy too, however, some of them (especially Gorosh) hits quite hard. While doing this I was in tank gear (which is worse than my damage gear) but wearing 2 one-handers to do some damage. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it's definitely doable. I got my savage gladiator chain the other day farming it like this :)
---
And General Angerforge is doable with the same gear. To do him we used 2 "mechanics": 1. When I had 5 sunders on me (and the boss being on 50%), I would start kiting him up and down the stairs to avoid getting sunder armor refreshed, and 2. When the sunders wear off, place him below the stairs next to the wall facing towards the window (no need to kill the pack of 3 mobs standing next to the window). This way, when the mobs spawn at 40% they won't be able to see him and they will sorta "give up" then - they will not join the fight. And then you can take your time to burn down the last 40% to kill him. Btw, you can see videos of how this works on youtube. Search for something like "General angerforge 2 man druid and rogue".
---
Hopefully we'll find more encounters to duo, but for now I'm busy irl so there's not much time to do so.
---
Hope this helps :)
---
So you don't play then LOL
---
Comments like this make this sub frustrating sometime.
---
This is a legitimate issue but trolls and fanboys are downplaying it and jumping to blizzards defense because, why? because years ago they gave us some great games so that absolves them of terrible decisions today?
---
There‚Äôs straight up no excuse for small private servers having better wpvp than *a fucking billion dollar company*.
---
Still does
---
It's still easy to just have people run in and talk to the spirit though
---
*lessener‚Äôd
---
dude give up, reading your comment literally proves you have not played legion or bfa and you have no idea what you are talking about. if you want difficulty you can play mythic dungeons + and mythic raiding. high end retail is wayyyy more difficult than classic. 
---
especially the raids. i just completed my first molten core and onyxia run and we streamed rolled through that shit. it was so easy it was an absolute joke. you are delusional if you think classic is harder than retail. you are proving yourself to be a nostalgic boomer.
---
and this is coming from someone that thinks bfa sucks and is currently enjoying classic.
---
And the current wind
---
Because we don't need to be efficient, in this tier our goal is to keep everyone topped off at all time, and we have the luxury of using the spell that does that the fastest: flash heal. It's really that simple ^^
---
On the other hand, Gadget being more important might mean that you should keep your hearthstone there, due to the one hour cooldown.
---
I play enough to respec twice a week /shrug
---
Yeah but I mean if I'm already paying $15 a month I might as well pay $60 and be able to play both. Even if it's a terrible expansion should still be fun for a month or two.
---
My level 40 hunter can farm SFK.
---
Hey, that's a neat little video.
---
Yeah, so someone who's actually making an effort to do damage will do way more than 350.
---
Yeah but they (aside from Nost) had a small fraction of the population and let‚Äôs be honest the community wasn‚Äôt usually as unified due to language barriers.
---
I quit playing, according to my blizzard account payments, the month after BC released. I remember this being a thing from then and I remember that they did add XP from PvP things just before BC came out as leveling in BG's was something you could do in BC. Maybe my memory is foggy, but I dropped WoW when BC released and didn't come back until classic launch and yet somehow I remember this being a thing even though you all are saying it was a WotLK and beyond thing?
---
If you want to have an awful experience take blacksmithing and herbalism with no gathering skills
---
I remember crippling lag with huge battles back in vanilla, I thought people wanted ‚Äúno changes‚Äù. I think some lag can def make the battle more interesting, it is a skill to be able to fight and survive with heavy lag
---
I definitely NEED it, it's kind of a requirement for content creators. I'm sorry that interactions between humans are irrelevant to your life, I am one btw, but I hope its a good rest of your life even though you're trying to be mean to me :)
---
Consecrate cannot crit and should only be buffed by spell power.
---
I'm leveling a mage as my first alt to have something for farming gold, my main is a prot specced warrior. Currently level 24 and really struggling with the AoE grinding that I've been hearing so much about. I've tried pulling 4-5 mobs at the farm in eastern hillsbrad foothills, but seem to only rarely be able to take down a pack, when not having evocation available. Can anyone point me towards a guide explaining how it works in lower levels, preferably written with or without images, but video is also appreciated. Also I currently have the choice between +14 Frost damage or 4 int 4 stam on my staff, which is better?
---
10 days to 60 seems a little high. even with profession and casual dungeons I'd say mkre like 8 days played.
---
'Limitation' in this context wouldn't mean lack of access to the code, it would simply mean it is working as designed, however the way it has been designed/engineered means there are some inherent constraints.
---
It does, something like this.
---
 # show Hurricane
---
/stopmacro [channeling:Hurricane]
---
/castsequence reset=60/combat Barkskin, Hurricane
---
Not 60 just yet, hit 50 this morning. But life is good if you can stick it out. I have very little concerns for other players in PvP situations being specced into Sub/assassin. And those that do decide to get froggy while I'm questing I can easily enough reset the fight if needed. Once that is done, the game is pretty much over for them haha.
---
Of course, I've got probably one of the best daggers to have while leveling, Gut Ripper, so mileage can vary.
---
Well, it‚Äôs a game. Think of it like drumming like he said. 
---
1 stick drums once every 2 seconds. 
---
1 stick drums once every 1.8 seconds. 
---
And thats bad drumsticks. 
---
Now image two 1.8 speed daggers, or faster. That‚Äôs alot of drumbeats Per second. 
---
All generating more rage = more threat = higher aggro ceiling = more damage output from DPS = shorter fight.
---
Do you know on a simple workaround for that? Someone here replied he had this macro working for him.
---
Kromcrush is dank
---
as the dps officer, I always take the best enh shaman for my own group. then he says im dropping GoA because we're moving too fast for windfury to be worth it. HMPH.
---
Multiple potential locations but only 1 is up per zone per hour
---
So you're saying that the servers don't have enough bandwidth?
---
That's a lot of words just for that
---
Eh, I wouldn't mind separate TBC servers but I still prefer Vanilla. I'd just rather be playing with everything in the game already.
---
No thanks
---
Lol, yeah really ‚Äúgame breaking‚Äù.  Better not log on till its fixed!
---
Move counterattack to the first on the list instead of the 3rd
---
Get you a shaman who can do both.
---
This has happened to me at Least 4 times today,  
---
‚ÄúHey. A priest! Come heal Scholo with us‚Äù 
---
I mean.. I went.  So it must work...
---
This is copypasta right? I refuse to believe that a human being can be this pathetic.
---
It isn't necessarily an  easy fix, but you don't have to protect blizzard and pretend you have some inside  knowledge or better understanding of the situation than other people just because you work in dev, of course you probably do to some extent, but you're basically just wildly speculating, just as much as others; if not more. 
---
Like: 
---
&gt;a retail server likely does extra steps on every single action to accomplish hundreds of extra things in the background for operations (server) monitoring, backing up snapshots for account security, logging systems, monitoring dodgy accounts, anti-cheat, location validation, battle.net interaction and so on.
---
Okay it's likely the performance of this game is affected by this, but do you know this is the issue? How do you know if it's a physical hardware capacity  issue, the code, or both? Do you know how  Blizzard handles their workflow? Like you and the whole "we're progrAmrz" crew below here making jokes about other people RIGHTLY calling Blizzard out on their BS, just because they don't work in the business.
---
I swear to God programmers /people who work in software w/e are so elitist, can't we all just agree that this fucking sucks and Blizzard needs to fix it.
---
Honestly mining and engi is probably your best bet if you want something useful
---
yes, I understand everything in this thread. thanks
---
Man you alliance get much better dungeons lol
---
Do everyone a favor and don't create content. It's cringe and sad, like you!
---
Nah, it‚Äôs the RNG with taunt resists (taunt is based on spell hit). Basically a badly time taunt resist is a wipe. IIRC it‚Äôs 4pc dreadnaught, ZG spell hit on use and 1% spellhit from another slot to cap spell hit.
---
tried but it doesn't work.
---
Seems to be linked to the GCD, if i put mongoose bite first in the macro, counterattack is ignored. And if i put Counterattack first in the macro, then Mongoose Bit is ignored. In both case, Raptor strike still work as intended. That's Mongoose Bite and Counterattack that seem mutually exclusive :/
---
I just dinged 50 and I have a newborn daughter who severely limits my play time.  Hell yes I want to delay p2
---
Ok, but at the end of the day I‚Äôm like: fix the fucking lag... we can‚Äôt play like this - the game is from 2004, make it work... What can possibly be more pressing than the pathetic performance of the servers?
---
Lame. Makes the reporting feel worthless.
---
Warlock
---
11,000 players is not equivalent to millions.  Please stop saying that a private server latency experience is equivalent to a distributed network hosting more than 100 times the playerbase.
---
That sounds very likely. In that case, the intended behavior would probably be that only the target‚Äôs threat gets reset, just like on privates. If they patch it without adding the phase 3 threat reset (which I can‚Äôt find a consensus on whether it was in vanilla) then we‚Äôll have to fall back on the less reliable ‚Äúofftank gets to xth place on the aggro table‚Äù strat again :/
---
45 Lock here. I'm geared almost exclusively with green and blue shadow damage gear. +187 total shadow damage and I kill mobs fast, but I'm squishy as hell (1.4k health unbuffed üò¨). How should I prioritize stamina over +dmg when I get into PvP at 60? 
---
Would it be best to focus on stamina and the spell damage is only if it comes with stam, or mix it up a bit?
---
yeah and with a helm, half your body is covered anyways.
---
I'm trying to post ammo onto the AH.  It's a 40c deposit.  Is it only arrows that are free to post?  If so, that's lame.
---
It is networking, but not the traditional layers 1-4 that most people think of when they think of networking.
---
Layers 5-7 are becoming more important and MMO's have a lot of layer 5-7 stuff going on.
---
Layer 5 is the initial logon and eating that hour-long queue.
---
Layers 6 and 7 are blurry and deal with how the data gets handled.

Yeah I totally agree. Of course they're going to avoid fully rewriting the engine for it. The issue is that there's not necessarily a guarantee that a rewrite from the ground up would fix the issue. Even if it did there's other bugs etc you get from it. 
---
What I was saying is that any solution regarding server performance with the amount of players they're dealing with will take a significant amount of time.
---
So gladiator is significantly less of a grind. 
---
The gladiator grind is a few hundred arena matches. Let's say it's 300 matches for a skilled player. 
---
Let's say 15 minutes/arena including queues and stuff. That's 75 hours.
---
So you want to bang it out towards end of season? That's 2.5 hours/day for 30 days. 
---
Or spread it out, whatever. Still 75 hours.
---
But okay, let's double it. 600 matches! 
---
150 hours. 
---
Let's double the time. 600 matches and matches take 30 minutes!
---
300 hours. This is beyond charitable. For a good player, it was likely closer to 50 hours because 200 matches is plenty for a good player, but let's say 300 hours for argument's sake.
---
The rank 14 grind from 0 honor is absolutely obscene and I don't think that you truly appreciate how long it is. 
---
First off, getting rank 10 isn't trivial. It's not just a little bit of time. It's still a huge time investment measured in hours per day. It's 10 weeks in the top 6% of players. It's not just a few hours a week, it's a few hours a day. The rank 10 grind is probably measured in the hundreds of hours, but again for argument's sake let's ignore it. 
---
Starting at rank 10, and as per OP's spreadsheet, you need either 7 weeks at the top 0.3%, or 10 weeks at the top 0.8% followed by 3 weeks at the top 0.3%.
---
If a 0.3% week is 18 hours/day, and a 0.8% week is 12 hours/day, we're talking 126 hours/week for a 0.3% week, or 84 hours/week for a 0.8% week. 
---
So rank 14 from rank 10 is 882 hours over 7 weeks, or 1218 hours over 13 weeks. 
---
There's a reason that the top players were able to maintain multiple gladiator-ranked characters. The gladiator grind is nothing compared to the R14 grind.
---
Honestly, AoE grinding at level 24 is tough, you have very little mana/HP and don't have access to all your spells and talents.
---
My suggestion would be to wait for a few more levels, you get CoC at 26 which is a good slow/dmg spell and helps manage things better at times. 
---
&gt;Also I currently have the choice between +14 Frost damage or 4 int 4 stam on my staff, which is better?
---
+14 frost damage will do close to nothing if you're planning on AoE leveling to 60, but it's very useful for Frostbolt spam.
---
+4int/+4stam is nice if you are lacking int/stamina though.
---
Hilarious that you think you can have vanilla as it was while also having modern server tech. You can't get both when it's one or the other. They could fix it but it wouldn't play like the classic museum piece #NoChanges it's supposed to be. Tough luck. Ask for a modified server of vanilla with modern server tech/code and you'll be able to have the large battles you want.
---
I have 450 heal power from gear. Before buffs I have 208 spirit. I have the +25% spell power from spirit which gives me +52 heal power.
---
And I have the +10% healing talent.
---
I don't know the correct order for applying the bonuses.
---
I feel the pain. He had 400HP left when we lost the first time. That was brutal. It's the part with the two stone golems (or whatever they're called) that makes it so difficult. The next try we just decided to ignore those adds while I taunted them off DPS while everyone focused damage on the boss. The result was me dying very quickly, but it gave enough time for DPS to finish him off.
---
&gt;We lost, but everyone said they had fun. Like even though we lost the challenge was there, a goal for later.
---
That's a great group to be able to take it on the chin. Sometimes working together in those tooth-and-nail situations is more rewarding than the victory itself. I'm sure you'll work with those people again for that exact reason.
---
I was planning to tank this on my warrior this weekend at level 43. Some dungeon quests are green already, so I figured it shouldn't be too hard...
---
Can't find pads that differ from my. Maybe it's photo perspective making them look different. Thanks anyway!
---
Its really tempting to bite this bait... but thats what a dumb fish would do. I am not a dumb fish.
---
Literally a non-issue in most servers. You only see this lag shit in meme-streamer servers.
---
Where my fellow Bigglechads at?
---
Classic IS dying due to the lack of content, this is literally the reason Blizzard is pushing stuff out extremely fast.
---
Whether you want to agree with what I said or not, and there's rumors floating around that WSG will be released before P3 even.. So if this says anything.. Yeah. They NEED to release P2 before 2020.
---
Blizzard didn't expect for people to just speed run content like we have.. And that was the biggest issue.
---
So even if people on this subreddit wanted this, it would still never happen.. Because Blizzard will end up losing too much money.
---
its actually sad that their severs aren't better for classic despite what classic is as a game lmao
---
why the fuck would they use the same cheap servers for classic as they do for BfA? It literally makes no sense
---
If you use the book, you don't have to do the quests again. You just insta-learn the other.
---
It's worth it because if I wasn't misled, you can use the Tanaris book thing to drop your specialization without resetting.
---
Sub money used to be enough back in the day. Did they get greedy or is just a classic case of shareholders pushing for more more more?
---
This, I wasn't having mana issues in a lot of MC so I started throwing regrowths on locks, 1 wouldn't tap through it and just kept wanding, cmon man
---
I tried with the castsequence, it's better but still not what i want. Counterattack proc on parry, and mongoose bite proc on dodge. Meaning the order i want to activate them vary for each fight.
---
If i put /castsequence Mongoose Bite,Counterattack, then i fight and counterattack proc first, it will not cast even if i spam the key. Whereas is Mongoose Bite proc first, then mongoose bite is cast and if after that counterattack is proced, it will cast, but mongoose bite will not cast until counterattack is cast :/
---
Anything you‚Äôd recommend for a new rogue for raiding ? I‚Äôve never mained a rogue
---
redditors and betamale-tier passive aggressiveness
---
I actually did some tests and sadly you do have to be nearby. I don't know the actual limit but we tried with me just in one of the tunnels (which is closer than the entrance but not by a ton) and I did not get a loot option.
---
you could use a mod macro. something like no mod for ability 1, ctrl for ability 2, and shift for ability 3
---
just add [nomod] to line 1, [mod:ctrl] to line 2, and [mod:shift] to line 3
---
Thanks a lot, I was running with the +14 Frost damage not knowing the exact turnover rate in damage added to blizzard. I'll do a couple sfk/bfd runs to get to 26 then.
---
You don't seriously think vote counts are supporting evidence for ANYTHING on this website, do you?
---
But we will have old school av
---
Or just use sunders, revenge, and taunt. No need to spend that much rage. You generate significantly more threat in defensive stance than you do in fury
---
Thanks!   Also just for clarity it should also be boosted by anything that boosts holy damage like sanctity aura right?
---
I can say from the last couple of months of Northdale leading up to Classic launch the population of Northdale was around 11,000 people during prime time. I was not experiencing massive lag like I do in classic. PVP was constant on Northdale as well.
---
The problem is a lot of tanks are probably fury warriors looking to gear up and are trying to eliminate competition for drops.
---
good to know, thanks
---
I don't wanna :D
---
Blizzard already has a fix: Phase 3. It will kill wpvp just like it did in the orginal. And when people complain, they will be told to "just do BGs if you want to pvp".
---
I see that makes sense, thanks
---
Heart Seeker?
---
What's wrong with infernals?
---
You gotts be fairly close. Staying at entrance won't work.
---
Or you could play on a non maxed out server and not have to deal with it?  Seriously ashkandi is medium-high and Rock solid stable, I feel so bad for all you guys
---
You are obviously horde...
---
I sell paladin services at 15g/run.  Tanks, heals, or faux DPS, you'll get the authentic paladin experience.
---
\-Lightshield - Grobbulus
---
It could just as easily be an ascii value. So, 70/10.
---
Would this apply to BGs too, or is this just world PVP?
---
Right into my veins.
---
This is why I love Vanilla/Classic Hunters.
---
PvP got so boring later on.
---
that's only 40 people. he said 80.
---
Crap. As a 45 warrior its gonna be hard then... Even with invis potions, they have a 10min CD right?
---
Always is a strong word. 
---
So far as a lock I have only had 1 tank who i was pulling threat from and I still pulled threat while wanding on a single target pull after giving the tank 20-30 seconds head start. I don't see how that could be my fault unless i just /danced with the enemy. That group also had a mage who kept having threat issues and the tank kept dying to trash.
---
Usually though yeah I agree, watch your threat. If you do find you pull threat usually you can just switch to dots (not instantly) and wanding.
---
Sounds like you applying to the wrong guilds.  Speak to yourself more honestly next time
---
No?  Wtf are we doing with Classic?  This isn't a stepping stone to the next expansion then the next and the next.  The moment Blizzard announces TBC, is the moment that we are all locked into a track to match up with Retail in 5 years.
---
Fuck.
---
That.
---
If we wanted to play TBC, we would have TBC.  The demand was for vanilla.  Not flying mounts and dailies.
---
But it's not working as designed. It's not even working as it was 15 years ago.
---
&gt;	You aren‚Äôt very good at this.
---
Hilarious that you didn‚Äôt see the irony immediately when you wrote that. Try not insulting somebody right off the bat next time. Maybe they‚Äôll listen.
---
Only the people who share accounts will get r14 on high pop servers. Full stop. 
---
It would have been nice if they developed a skill based system instead of the time based one.
---
eh, most of time when fearing, you want to run the hell away because you are likely to get extra pulls. 
---
Bandages go best with hamstring. Hamstring, run away a good distance, heal 4-5 ticks, finish the fight.
---
Yeah exactlty, you get rekt in fury BiS
---
I'm fully aware what you can do on a pve server when to comes to the opposite faction. The OP has a problem with PVP on a PVP server so I feel he should roll PVE. It wouldn't prevent all of his problems, but it cuts out 50%(PVP). That is a work around to the issue.
---
# #NoChanges
---
Except as I said, slam uses rage far more efficiently.
---
100% yes. Blizzard. Do it.
---
Don‚Äôt screw up your last chance at Classic WoW perfection.
---
I doubt they're going to change anything. If it works as I'm guessing, then it's going to be a very fundamental system of the game that has probably always worked like this -- in other words, it would have worked the same way in vanilla, and is thus working as intended.
---
What they *might* do is disable the ability to see unit GUIDs through the addon API, because that wasn't added until version 2.4. However, even that is probably more trouble than it's worth, because you can still figure out which player has the lower GUID by their character creation date, and hiding unit GUIDs from the API would break a lot of addons.
---
Oh yeah in that case they are morons, I guess you are in a particular situation trying to do mc splits. Not a lot of people bothers :P
---
warhammer online "solved" the problem. In 2008.
---
I was at level 58 when BC came out, so I missed this, Nax, AQ40. This is why I came back. Grats!
---
Thanks mate. Do you have also some good talents tree skill to follow?
---
Ehhhh, I remember some pretty big world pvp events surrounding world bosses. They *were* laggy.
---
You are going to have stacks and stacks and stacks of arrows or bullets in your inventory. It makes no sense to have them in a regular bag instead of a quiver or ammo pouch that gives you attack speed bonus. Quickdraw quiver gives you 13% attack speed bonus. Epic quiver gives you 15% bonus.
---
What are the most wanted DPS classes/specs in raid groups?
---
Watch your back bro üíØ
---
Thanks for the nice info mate! Do you have some talent guide aswell? :)
---
I'm not trying to be disparaging but you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
doesn't work either... Mongoose bite doesn't cast in that case
---
level a hunter or mage alt to do your farming
---
Gottem
---
Preach. To me, TBC was the most visually interesting expansion by far. But it has to be said that the artists have always been on point, even when the game went to shit. Except for whoever did the new models and run animations. Those were stupid as fuck.
---
Id say stamina is the #2 priority stat for any class, but for warlocks it could very well be your #1 since it can also convert into mana. Staying alive and healthy as a warlock will translate to kills, as a hunter fighting a warlock is a total nightmare, even if I almost always need a potion to survive the remaining dot timers. Also having your voidwalker out at all times is a huge "dont fuck with me" because the shield from sacrifice gives you time to throw dots and a fear on your attacker
---
Blizzard isn't going to just leave the servers in a poor state.  The more issues the servers have, the more players they will see leave.  It is a simply financial decision for them.  Will upgrading hardware make the game better and keep more players paying for longer?  If yes, upgrade servers.
---
Blizzard isn't malicious nor stupid.  If it makes more financial sense, they will follow that line of reasoning.
---
never said we did lol. Im saying that Warrior tanks have no reason to run strat outside of getting orbs for crusader. You can get 5 orb drops in a run, your just giving the tnak the first orb drop.
---
Re-engineer massive parts of the code just to perform at the same level they did 15 years ago? I don't think so. If they're running these on VMs / Docker, which is fairly likely, there may have been some significant changes to the networking side to get it to operate. But I can't imagine there is some major, underlying code change beyond what they've already done that's required to get the game to finally achieve 2004 levels of performance.
---
&gt; The code/engine just isn't equipped to handle today's scale.
---
To be fair, the engine is well equipped to handle this, it's because of the sharding tech that's being used for layering as well, there were no issues with large scale pvp from Wotlk-Cata.
---
Do people not know that Classic is running on a modified version of the Legion engine, or do people think this is the original, without the tweaks/upgrades, from '04?
---
If youre a good warrior, youll be able to plow people 98% as easily as fury as arms can do.
---
Well you can dual wield if you are prot fury and have the gear. Otherwise a shield is probably best.
---
THANK YOU for not pretending to understand an engineering problem enough to critique its handling. Wish there were more people like you.
---
Meh. I love spell batching. Goes a little like this:
---
Priest: out of combat, drinking, is at 50% mana, the tank drops to 50% health
---
Priest: oh shit boyes, I gotta heal!
---
Priest: casts highest rank MOST expensive heal on the tank. The instant the casting time of the heal finishes, priest instantly sits to drink (and is spamming their drink macro a few seconds before the cast finishes). They weren‚Äôt in combat before they casted their heal as they were at a far enough range from the melee/tank doing damage.
---
The heal on the tank: puts priest into combat because the tank is in combat
---
Spell batching: allows the healer to heal the tank and IMMEDIATELY start drinking the tick the heal finishes casting/the tick the heal would put them in combat. 
---
Priest: was at 35% mana after their heal on the tank but is now able to drink water to recover mana while the tank is now sitting at 90% health.
---
Mind you, you can only do this ONCE at the START of each pull, if you aren‚Äôt automatically put into combat from being close to the tank/melee doing damage. I fucking love it! And, spell batching is also useful because you can cast an instant heal or spell the same tick you finish casting a heal/spell and both will go off at the same exact time. 
---
It has its niche uses, ‚Äòcombat drinking‚Äô being one of my favorites.
---
The ability lag is happening in raids too.
---
sounds like 3 of them are level 60 if you have this issue
---
Oh, they can fix it.   There were posts warning you how bad it'd become in 2004/2005 about South Shore.
---
You had the opportunity to know what you were getting into.
---
Classic is mostly there for PvE questing players, you can get PvP in a bar up the street.
---
20 v 20 is not 40 v 40.
---
&gt;herbalism
---
&gt;no gathering skills
---
Pick one
---
I just want arena, if they can work that into classic+ then I'm all for it
---
I think they mean something more along the lines of a 'Barber Shop' where you can change hair style, color, and facial features.
---
You're not understanding what he's asking.  
---
He's not happy with the way his base character looks(hair color, features, etc)
---
Can you do me a favor and check whether Mongoose Bite triggers the Counterattack CD? Both seem to be at 5 seconds. Or does it simply trigger their shared GCD, similar to how foods and drinks share a GCD?
---
Asscandy tho
---
If you‚Äôre making 20g an hour in dme you‚Äôre just bad at this game. I make 20g just from the picked herbs.
---
I was just looking for an independent addon for this, but this is fantastic, thanks dude
---
I agree completely. And that's why I have an alt, because I'm not going to go run a dungeon for little to no reason. But that also doesn't mean I'm willing to charge people for the privilege of having me grace their dungeon with my tanking. Not only that, but as a healer or a DPS, I would very much not be willing to pay someone to come tank a dungeon. You're basically charging someone for them to be able to play the game, and I simply don't agree with that.
---
You may want to mess around with multiple castsequences for 2 or 3 of them, rearranging the order.
---
The problem is you're trying to use 2 abilities that both have a GCD. Raptor Strike is not on the GCD so it will always function but obviously you cant use Mongoose and Counterattack at the same time.
---
Not sure why people aren't just saying, ANY mob near your level is best (58-60). So my first thought is the plaguelands, along with the people grinding to 60. Maybe the highest elite you can solo would be better. I would think going to SFK at 60 would be a bit too much walking since the mobs would die so fast. I've heard people mention Felwood Satyrs but that is probably high pop. If you're going for super chill, why not just explore and see what you find, and not worry too much about making \~%90 the gold you would make in an optimal spot. So I'm also thinking Winterspring, but not the demons which are quite hard to solo I think. Also Silithus.
---
I think a counter argument to this is, a lot of people are still leveling because they can‚Äôt play for 4+ hours a day. We get it that you don‚Äôt want the game to be built for casuals but like this is pretty fast...
---
As a mage thats exactly what I do. Best place to minimize travel time
---
I meant to say alchemy!
---
/spit
---
Warlocks.
---
how did he fully heal while in sheep form?
---
It's an Kinesis Freestyle Edge RGB. One of the few ergonomic / split mechanical keyboards out there.
---
FOMO. There aren‚Äôt dead servers dummy.
---
Thanks Mage üòÇ
---
Play a warrior
---
sheeping someone does that... haha
---
\*smacks lips\* yea this tastes pretty salty. Might wanna dial it back.
---
Coincidentally, amdahls law also applies explaining technical concepts to idiots.
---
Haha noice man noice
---
Try this:
---
Get a soulstone on low lvl player and try to run with some swift pot there with the help of the lvl 60
---
join the lookingforgroup channel
---
also check if your realm has a discord, usually they do and usually there's a sub there for looking for groups which can be handy to pre arrange, throw out a "hey i want to run such and such at 4PM today if anyone is keen let me know" and you can start pre booking it.
---
Maybe if you would of Shown Your Work this wouldn't of been a problem but that's what happens when you skip gnomish mathematics
---
I bought a new pc during vanilla so I had good fps even in raids.
---
I know an uber nerd that paid for 6 accounts for 1 month just to reserve names... on servers he no longer plays on! 
---
What a noob.
---
Wowhead classic usually shows when what phase things will be added in. However these class quests aren't planned for a specific phase, so they aren't shown.
---
Princess in Maraudon is the point at which everyone looks hard at paladin tanks and goes "maybe not, huh?"
---
Not having a taunt is the biggest crippling issue with the spec.
---
Skeram horde here. 6g+ almost always
---
Dummy. Striking is more damage so it's better. It's more damage because backstab is calculated using weapon damage. AP is also in that calculation but much much less significant. Most people can read and got it right away.
---
Thanks, that's useful.
---
DW is more dps
---
youre gonna do a lot more dmg than an arms warrior
---
downside is no debuff for healing (not a big deal really) and maybe slightly less bursty (but can easily be more burst w/ cooldowns).
---
its honestly not bad, but warriors in general sort of suck in PVP until they are so geared they can start 2 shotting ppl. They have next to 0 utility while other classes get boatloads
---
I bet many of the 200+ people who participated in this fight did so as a test or learning experience for P2. Seeing what kind of strategies did/didn't work. I certainly learned a lot so I am much better prepared for next time.
---
If these fights are pure lag fest on the server side this kind of awesome action will be rare or non-existent.
---
Just pretend it's a survival game while leveling
---
I think it's more a case of they don't know where classic is going to go yet.
---
Part of it will probably depend on how shadowlands does, from what I see they are trying to make shadowlands appeal more to the classic player base.
---
If shadowlands wins back a bunch of classic players and subs rise then they will probably just leave classic as it is now with no xpacs or addons.
---
If shadowlands is a decline again they will probably put some more effort into classic and it's future and accept that they are now supporting 2 different playerbases that they cannot merge.

"I wont transfer to a 'dead server'" - you when you had the chance to save yourself from this shit
---
Bracket stacking wasn't really a thing though was it? I didn't tryhard climb but I don't recall hearing that stuff from people that did.
---
That's with BGs btw, where solo climbing is actually somewhat possible and the organized group needs to keep an eye out for them. Until then, it's extremely unlikely that somebody will be get into the first brackets unnoticed (though it's also very likely that we'll get BGs long before anyone approaches rank 14).
---
DM Jump Runs are easy for Spriest solo, so you and your lock should blow through them very quickly. 
---
One of you needs to level up mining though, as the arcane crystals from thorium veins are a big part of the GPH.
---
Hey hey now alliance got realm first rag/ony and crafted the server first legendary. Ally have some good guilds too ;) see you in phase 2 from &lt;Bronzebeard&gt;
---
I am very curious to know if you have any actual idea what you are talking about.
---
you are absolutely incorrect
---
the popular, blizzard-like private servers used _unmodified_ 1.12.1 clients
---
[exact version: 1.12.1 (5875) (Release) Sep 19 2006]
---
the only thing you change to connect to them is the realmlist data
---
Its just nice having a realm community again instead of a revolving door of strangers youd never see again. Sure theres guild drama, ninjas, and all the other interpersonal stuff that creates friction but it is also because of this that makes the experience interesting. I go into a town of nobodies in retail, forming a connection feels impossible.
---
I hopped on retail for the anniversary mount and my god everything looked bright, a million different effects and procs. Did the new naga island and felt like it was claustrophobic. I could run in and pull 10 different mobs and still be at max hp, ready to pull 10 more. 
---
Everyone was had their own different transmogs and mounts but none of it mattered because there was no meaning attached to it. You see a guy on the winterspring mount? You know that guy dedicated a ton of time to achieve it.
---
This is absolutely the correct distinction.  The azerite in retail is probably one of the worst ideas I've seen in a video game.  I'm a hardcore casual--though I'm playing up a storm in classic--and retail burned me out in less than two months.  Even though I enjoy M+ five mans, the way loot is distributed is terrible even with that.  All of it designed to make you play the game constantly, and relentlessly.
---
In classic, I experience zero pressure.  No rush.  No need to hurry.  I do what I want at the pace I want, and that actually has caused me to play more.
---
Vanilla definitely had some issues with tons of players on one spot. But a lot of that was on the player end, either hardware or internet connection. The main reason we know it's doable with the Vanilla client is private servers.
---
East, you can definitely do. The others, I'd wait until 60.
---
My bis mainhand drops from a world boss. You bet I will be trying to get into groups for it as much as possible. And it won't just be a single raid, it will be 2+ on each side most likely as was the case in this clip.
---
If Blizz didn't want this why would they put these bosses out in the world instead of contained in an instance?
---
Ran both, but I not trying to draw up princess lol
---
well the servers aren't dead, I transferred to arcanite reaper myself and there are at least 4 guilds raiding MC alliance side (don't know whats happening horde side) and the best part is I can actually farm mats as the game intended! Whats the worst case scenario? In a few months they decide the server doesn't have enough people and they either merge it with another low pop server or offer transfers again. Either way I got some months of farming with low competition and raiding without all the hassle of non-stop pvp. Seems like an all around win
---
How could your judgement (such a short time ago) be so bad that you can't live with what your toon looks like already. 
---
Some people dude
---
How can you stand to play games where your characters image is selected for you?
---
Yeah I'm entering the leveling range of mara now and I'm pretty nervous about tanking princess. It's been smooth sailing until this point, but tanking princess in a pub group has me pretty shook
---
Now give me a post like this about hunters and world buffs.
---
How about I dial your mom back.
---
You need 5% to not miss special attacks.
---
Grats man!  I had a similar experience and got Rockpounder on my first run.  I just recently replaced it at lvl 59.  From 32 to 59 I only ever had two weapons:  Whirlwind Ax and Rockpounder lol
---
I thought I'd never return to Retail, but after seeing the changes I plan making new characters for Shadowlands.  I'll probably stay active in Classic, or at least return when TBC launches.
---
My cat is always cuddling me when I‚Äôm gaming, that‚Äôs so confy haha! Mine is laying down on the desk and put her head on my forearm (keyboard hand) so it doesn‚Äôt affect my gaming and she can stay there the whole day ü§£
---
Respect shadow and do the DM jump runs. You‚Äôll pay for your respect in an hour, and it‚Äôs much more fun. 
---
For mindless YT video farming, lashers work.
---
Why would they be looking for honourable targets in lowbie zones?
---
PlanetSide 2 can generally run a fight that size though it depends on your graphics settings
---
Ya those are my current professions, I have like 150~ herbalism and about the same in alchemy. I can‚Äôt really make too many useful things yet
---
You say "no idea what to do now"
---
Then you say you want to raid
---
Then you say you are in PVP spec
---
Surely you can put 2 and 2 together and see what to do here?
---
Respec to a raid spec, go to some pugs with consumables and you'll have some good logs to show.
---
Or hell even ask this current raid if you can join one week as a trial and let them know you will respec/bring consumes and show them you can raid?
---
They sound pretty hardcore so you can't expect them to carry you just because you don't feel like respecing to be useful?
---
There are no dead servers.
---
if speed=fastest: do nothing
---
else: go faster
---
you went in the wrong direction with that salt bro...try the other way maybe?
---
you know what else will cause a mass exodus of players? 
---
having shit unplayable servers where each action takes a minute and a half to go through, *if at all*
---
If you're alliance maybe. SS + MS + WW +  WFT = 300-400 dps in dungeons while leveling. Without Rav procs.
---
And yet they still aren‚Äôt really supporting it or providing the groundwork for classic+.

These corporate tards keep this mindset that classic is a meme that‚Äôll go away if they rush the phases and make it end when they release shadowshit for retail, because we will all just go play that...right?
---
Screw em. I‚Äôll ride this out and just go back to my other games if they ride this into the ground like it seems they want to.
---
Same as /u/Leggolem I've had no problems with prat.  The only "problem" is if I forget to check the box to remember font changes the first few times.  Does it happen on all characters or just one?

I didn't think it was a bad idea, myself. I always see and hear a lot of competitive FPS guys running light mice paired with a lower DPS, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I just didn't want to go to a small mouse for every day use, especially when the G502 is a little more larger and ergonomic to hold.
---
imo it's not worth the respec. I know it's cheap the first time but avoiding as many as possible is ideal for me.
---
Is there an add-on that will equip/unequip when you mount. I never remember to equip that shit.
---
I tried tanking ulda as a level 41/42 pally.  Most of the run went fine, though we had to actually use cc on the gear-check packs leading to the 4xGolem room.
---
The last boss though.. it was right out.  I couldn't hit him for shit, and absolutely couldn't keep threat away from the lvl 45 shadow priest.
---
We got him down to &lt;20%, but everyone was out of mana, cooldowns blown, pots on cooldown, and then the two golems showed up to finish us off.  I went back at level 44 and it was MUCH easier.
---
Imagine allowing your infrastructure to be overloaded by people trying to have fun
---
My friend is actually a 60 warlock. I was thinking about that already, running with swift pot as much as i can and then SS and invisibility pot the last ones. But its still hard as i have to choose carefully where do die xD
---
Because you were a warrior and had pink hair.
---
Imagine now a gnome mage with a white beard.
---
WoW is actually a lot more basic than fortnite. 
---
It‚Äôs spreadsheet calculation. A ti-82 could do the math for a single raid boss fight. 
---
There‚Äôs no collision detection, hitscan, or any high-frequency multi-dimensional real-time demands in WoW especially considering how spell-batching works.
---
Compensating for latency when all that matters is whether someone was within some radius of some other person or some 2d angle away is a lot easier than compensating for latency when you have not only position but first-person view angles etc to consider
---
The experiences are worlds apart. I want full brawl every raid night in BRM - something this company apparently is completely incapable of delivering. I won‚Äôt get that with 3 guilds walking in every night.
---
You need to stand on upper lip as he kills below you.
---
It's a PVP server, it'll happen.
---
Do what everyone else does and bring some guildies to help keep it clear or run it at night.
---
A "Dead" server now is more than a high pop server was in original vanilla, there isn't a single server below high during its timezone at this point, at least not in either US timezone.
---
Or you could just make your own group?
---
IMO as a horde player Dwarves are the coolest
---
Overall horde is cooler (basically goes Dwarves, then all the horde, then alliance in coolness to me) but dwarves are just wonderful
---
You literally can't imagine the concept of competitive spirit? Alright.
---
That's what your mom told me to do when her front door was out of order.
---
You forgot Shamans never carrying Ankhs. I have literally never met a Shaman that carries Ankhs. I've even had a 60 Shaman tell me, "yeah we can't do that you're thinking of something else" to "i need that epic mount brah" I've never looked at the price of Ankhs, but I assume it's gotta be like 10g per each. Can someone explain to me why shamans HATE this spell? I actually can't think of another class/spell hate more than Shamans hate using Ankhs and resurrecting.  To me it seems like its an OP, wipe insurance, awesome spell to have but Shamans hate using it and avoid it at all costs? Is there an avtual reason why?
---
Dal'rend's are a measure of devotion. Like most organized religion, it is also full of shit
---
Go for it. You can cheese the last boss, getting less adds by having three people begin the summoning, and as soon as it begins you haul ass back up the ramp to the above room. Everyone has to get out before the doors close and get up there before the boss catches you (it's not hard to pull off, as long people don't stop).
---
Yea my server has 50 guilds raiding MC, maybe more. So it‚Äôs kinda dead dude. Material prices are just a product of supply and demand. If you can‚Äôt afford shit, all you need to know is that the general price level is reflected in everything you farm. In isolation, it‚Äôs a lot easier to farm for epic mount on the inflated megaservers simply because everything you loot has a much, much higher value.
---
Not sure, try a macro like:
---
/equip Carrot on a Stick  
---
/mount   
---
then to dismount try:  
---
/dismount  
---
/equip &lt;Other trinket&gt;
---
Yeah, that other guy pointed that out. Wasn't even thinking about the barber.
---
Never talked about any raid damages, since i have enough brain to know the poeple i'm mostly healing are tanks, sometimes melee and some wlocks on top of that.  
---
Tbh i'm kind of bored talking to a wall, if you can't see the point of the flash heal meta fine. But just know that there are reasons why it's widely used, even if you have a hard time processing them it seems.
---
Bags man, so much less running back to base to empty bags.
---
Nostalrius made a server without layering that 15k people could play on at once.
---
Cloud based servers dont cut it with this type of game, Activision is just being cheap as usual
---
Hard no bud.
---
My cat is obviously better than yours.
---

---
Yeh easily. First rogue tanks with evasion then vanish, second rogue tanks with evasion then all should be dead before it ends. 
---
Take another rogue if you need the damage
---
Most people do, and that is a partial work around. However since any ability done to the demon despawn it, this isn‚Äôt foolproof. All they have to do is sneeze on it and game over for 20+ minutes
---
What sim you using?
---
Orcish said kil gorm. player's name is gromek. Orcish didn't actually say "kil grom" because direct translations do not exist. odds of it happening are low. zug zug.
---
&gt; I'm giving you my perspective and you're ignoring it entirely.
---
Do you really think you are saying anything that other twinkers have not said hundreds of times before? Your "perspective" is not new or interesting, it is just the same dishonest talking points anyone who has ever talked about the issue has heard already.
---
&gt; If you hate twinks, then why PvP at a low level at all? 
---
This is such a stupid question that even you have to walk it back immediately. People PvP at low level for the same reason they PvP at any level, for the fun of a reasonably balanced game.
---
&gt; WOAH there cowboy...That's harsh, right? And why did you say it? because you're getting stomped by twinks in low level BGs...
---
Obviously you aren't so good at reading. I have been on both sides of the twink fence. Speaking as someone who had a 19 twink, twinks are bad for the game and bad for the people who play them. I'm not saying that "because I'm mad", but because I know it is true.
---
&gt; You realize how aggressive that sounds coming from you, right? Imagine calling someone a shitty human FOR PARTICIPATING IN AN ASPECT OF A VIDEOGAME THAT WAS PUT THERE BY THE DEVELOPERS
---
You are confusing "I *can* do X" with "I am entitled to have the whole world be my safe space where I am protected from any possible criticism for *actually* doing X". This is something normal people learn before pre-school - just because you can doesn't mean you should.
---
&gt; Also: magic the gathering FORCES you to pay for new cards. You can't go grind dungeons, quests, etc. for a better deck. Just because a twink puts more time into gearing at a low level, you call them bad?
---
Now you are just getting incoherent. Probably because you know the M:tG example exposes how pathetic twinking is. There's no difference whether you sunk dozens of hours into farming the arena chest on your twink or sunk $600 on your M:TG meta deck to play against school kids, either way you put all that effort in just so you could feel good by bullying beginners who have no reasonable way of fighting back.
---
&gt; Lastly, about bullying: WELCOME TO PVP IN AN MMORPG.
---
We're not all pathetic like you. Some people enjoy reasonably balanced PvP in a MMORPG.
---
&gt; If twinking is hurting you so emotionally,
---
Projection, baby. You're so deeply offended by your trash behaviour getting called out that you can't stop getting emotional. Like I said, I've been the twink. (Well, in my defence, I had xp turned on and levelled out of the bracket after a handful of games, but for those few games I was a twink.)
---
&gt; ruining it for people who want to enjoy themselves.
---
The irony of the poor, sad, defenceless twinker whining that someone is ruining a game for people who "just want to enjoy themselves".
---
You put dozens of hours of effort specifically into building a broken toon so you can ruin the game for people who really do just want to enjoy themselves. Now you're crying because someone called you out for it on an internet forum. Suck it up, snowflake.
---
Im just here to give a +1 to that GM. He did the extra hard work and when presented with an unpalatable resolution to the customer he elevated it as high as he could for a satisfactory resolution. Blizzard GM's dont get enough credit when they do good things IMO.
---
They both  pick lock
---
Don't be put off. I have tanked everything up to MTing Drakki in Classic.
---
With RF up a judged righteousness on a target with JOC up should be enough to draw initial aggro. It definitely helps to not have people over-dpsing, but even with pugs I've had more good groups than bad.
---
Can you master loot and assign the loot to the low level player?
---
\* Wash yer back!
---
My wife and I tested the differences with and without carrot by running on our mounts side by side on one of those long, flat, straight pathways in Darn.  I was still almost side by side with her at the end (on both our screens) despite her using the trinket.
---
3% is even worse than it sounds.
---
Shocking.
---
I farmed Relic Coffers for about a week (probably 300-400 keys, wasn't keeping track) until I hit 100 sack of gems to make this quick video.  
---
26 gold total if you vendored it all, but could make more on the AH.  
---
Thanks for watching :)
---
gross
---
So true man! Thought I was covered by death wish but had a few sec left on the cd \^\^
---
You‚Äôre going to be so mad when they release classic TBC
---
For sure. Let the phases come slowly so people could enjoy them individually and have the servers ready to handle everything. It‚Äôs a win-win.
---
If you flash heal in classic you‚Äôll be oom in 20 seconds too lol
---
So essentially:
---
they thought they did, but they didn‚Äôt.
---
A group of volunteers (operating on only donations) accomplished what a well staffed game development company couldnt. Nice gaslighting though.
---
Mr. Gambini, that is a lucid, well thought-out, intelligent objection. Overruled.
---
Right. AV was about the limits of vanilla PvP in my experience. When the entirety of both teams clashed performance would get messy. Open world was similarly limited by performance and when it went any higher things just stopped working.
---
Negative
---
Interesting. How many runs was that? 
---
Ever seen more valuable gems drop (blue sapphires, golden pearls?)
---
Yeah someone not wanting to min max everything definitely makes them lazy. :P
---
DPS in a lot of MC fights is dumb because people can kill the bosses in like 20-30 seconds.  More powerful CDs can get massively over repped while classes that has sustainability issues do as well.  What you end up seeing is who can spike the highest.  The frightening thing is how dominant fury warriors already are.
---
These things are one-offs. You wont get quite the same thing once people resort to just running battlegrounds day in and day out. 
---
Do it once. Do it right. There's no rush, we'll be doing raids forever.
---
I stopped playing cs after high school tbh long time ago. I do miss red alert 2 though
---
"some randoms"
---
You mean highly skilled programmers. Who worked on WoW server emulators over the course of 10+ years. It's easy to look at private servers from 2019 and see how well they work and question why Blizzard can't do that, but you're forgetting that private servers have been in constant development over the past 13 years. It wasn't just one, or two, or three, or even ten people, but hundreds/thousands of different developers working on private server emulators over the past decade.
---
To claim that private servers are "just some randoms reverse engineering" shows a complete lack of understanding of how private servers were developed and how they run.
---
I think for the SM hellfire to work you would need a fair amount of +fire damage gear and to use your voidwalker to sacrifice (voidwalker ability) to get a shield and even then I doubt you would survive long enough.
---
Mara isn‚Äôt too bad with the sceptre! I usually watch a video while I do it of another warlock running it and follow along. Currently learning right now
---
To my knowledge it never worked in combat.
---
I feel like P2 was rushed to begin with. I‚Äôd be fine with it not coming out until February, but we‚Äôll probably be into P3 by then at the speed they‚Äôre releasing content.
---
A lot of runs, not sure how many, but hundreds of keys. Never seen anything more valuable drop out of them either.
---
I'd rather spend 2 hours in MC and have fun than do it in 30 minutes and deal with obnoxious tryhards. 
---
It's 15 year old, easy content. Chill and have fun.
---
Asscandy represent!
---
Sorry man, im Alliance.
---
With a friend? or did you use your own second account?
---
In a DKP system where everyone wants only a handful of items you run into the issue of no one wanting  to buy off pieces or shitty pieces of tier. It turns into a massive headache where you have to punish people for hoarding for the few items they want, and in my experience it just pisses everyone off. I have tested this and it really upsets people when you force them to spend their DKP. 
---
With LC you can give the few big items to people  who perform the best and put the most work in, and you can give constructive reasons WHY loot was give to specific people.
---
The issue won't be your class as druids are more than capable,  but whether the raid already has enough tanks,  which varies by guild and server.  It's the double edged sword of needing tons of tanks to run tons of dungeons,  but when it comes to raiding you only need a couple.
---
You are the one who is set in your ways. I already stated that it works, but again, it only works for groups that kill bosses incredibly fast and dedicate innervates to their priests. If your guild is not a top 1%(or maybe higher) then it makes next to no sense. You still haven‚Äôt addressed the incredibly simple and straight forward math because numbers don‚Äôt apply to you I guess? Enjoy ooming for fun.
---
ive done 8 mc, 8 ony 10 epics..  not using 7 of them..
---
get fed it... 4mcs and Onys in, 1 piece of gear. and I've only seen 2 or 3 drops in those raids. never seen the t2 helm.
---
druid gear is not as common as people make it out to be. mage and pally gear otoh...
---
What a guy. Horde at heart
---
You could be right and I'm sure it depends on playstyle, I'm just saying what most leveling guides recommend
---
How does it know if the second account is yours or not? You cannot use the same email can you?
---
Ok I'm just going off the numbers you originally stated, but it doesnt matter when you compare it to Blizzard's numbers.  Each server doesnt have its own blade, so it has to process not only its own data, but other servers' as well.
---
&gt;40 people
---
You still bring 40 to Ony? My guild has been splitting it into 2 20 mans for a while now. More loot.
---
Even with that you should never beat a good rogue.
---
The slash four addon is really nice. It scans the lfg and general channels and compiles by keywork into a nice menu where you can easily find others looking for a specific dungeon.
---
What level are you guys? It seems a lot of people here think if you are in your 30s-40s it's impossible to have reached level 60 unless you have no life at all.
---
With way lower player base
---
I mean... that's still far less than classic servers but uhh... good work?
---
&gt; rarely crash
---
LOL, no. I played vanilla pservers from 2015 - 2019 and they would crash all the time. Even pservers in 2018/2019 would still crash like 3-5 times per day, every single day.
---
&gt;You blizzard apologists
---
Oh, so you don't actually have a point, you're just here to screech at me. Reported :)
---
Also no, pservers weren't run "in basements". Just FYI.
---
&gt; lol you are such an egotistical moron its great.
---
Once again, projection.
---
&gt; Why did I bother talking to someone who refutes physical evidence and is unwilling to change their outlook even then?
---
Are you talking to such a person?
---
bad
---
Or you know just do Arena+Angerforge+Golem so people may also join for SGC/Second Wind/the other caster loot
---
This. Second toon now and I‚Äôm like flying through the lower levels
---
Dueling contests,  in-game guild parties somewhere,  guild hunts for opposite faction groups or players.
---
Lvl55 mage here, is there a nice overview where to get (pre)bis items? I know their are guides but I would like a table or something similair. Otherwise I just make it myself
---
My cat does this exact same thing. She tries to burrow into my arm while playing. No beard though..
---
Imagine thinking you are more entitled to a piece of loot than anyone else in the group that needs that same piece of loot.
---
edit: Am I missing something? Do these people really ONLY run Angerforge without Arena/ Golemlord? :O
---
Why do you assume others are joining for HoJ? You can do easily do the runs with 4 people:
---
\- 1x is going for SGC
---
\- 1x is going for Ban'thok Sash
---
\- 1x is going for HoJ
---
\- 1x is going for 2nd Wind
---
There, no loot competition and everybody is interested in the run. Why would I invite somebody who wants to roll on an item that I have seen two people now run a hundred times (!) without it dropping.
---
You too
---
Gear in retail is utterly forgettable. Can anyone even name an item?
---
DO ZF
---
Because ppl woukd anyways stack on the same servers to avoid playing in a dead one in the future
---
Ok thanks.
---
You are underestimating Spy addon+ perception in rogue v rogue
---
I haven't seen many of them
---
Ok zoomer, I suggest you go download an Arctium distro and look under the fucking hood yourself moron
---
If you can clear MC in greens and blues with the top dps having the same dps that you have, being carried is irrelevant
---
Its very good, especially when paired with riding skill on gloves (2%) and mithril spurs (4%). Maybe 9% total doesn't sound like that much, but if you're doing something where the bulk of your time is spent traveling like farming Rich Thorium its a big boost.
---
Has in live since at least Legion, but yeah in Vanilla it's just a lame OOC stealth.  Pretty sure N-elf hunters can FD-&gt; Meld though, which is still hilarious.
---
Bad luck I'm at 4/8 by accident after 4 mcs
---
With a resto druid in the raid
---
I know the feeling but i usually reroll about level 10 not almost 60 lol.
---
I had this with a druid, considered making him my alt but then realized at level 11 i hate how he looks but now I can't be bothered rerolling and losing the rested too. I know it's minor but eh.
---
Mage AoE really doesn't get good until the 30s. Around low 40s it ramps up again. You just don't have the talents to make it viable at 24.
---
We kept pulling him farther and farther, hoping to kill him before those 2 Elite golums could run up to us. We were close. 
---
Yeah, the journey is sometimes more rewarding than the reward.
---
This one has a truth behind it. Don't play in full servers if you can't handle some open world lag. Blizz gave us a solution
---
It's such a powerful crowd control that they gave it that draw back.
---
Please share with me your luck sir. My rolling skills es no bueno :(
---
I appreciate the touhou ost.
---
my 35 alt alch is capped at 300. My duo runs together full time, and like i said, the spriest is mining/herb. the only thing we're missing is skinning, but having capped tailoring along with ench has been useful. I'm making more money with all my cloth bc i turn it into items to DE.
---
An albion player? Hi there. 
---
That game definitely had high and lows in terms of server performance, from slight frame drops to complete blackscreen. The whole draw of the game was the large scale combat, which is a hard thing to deliver on apparently. Still, the game holds a special place in my heart.
---
TC#1
---
Lots of great info and great advice in this thread, which I'm sure you will take on board.
---
However I'm going with occams razor on this one. It sounds like the tank needs to round out his choice of gear, with HS and BoSanc up he should never be dropping as quickly as you've described in BRD.
---
Oh gee, I dunno, perhaps trying to compare a private server with 10k max players to public servers with millions seems to be missing a lot of what makes the game function to begin with.
---
Where is your data to back that up?  Blizzard has it and you don't.
---
Ah ok thanks. We'll try the jump runs. Yeah, the spriest is capped herb/mining.
---
in vanilla 40v40 in the open world would basically crash the server. not sure what you mean by "2004 levels of performance"
---
Good luck making a group reserving items especially on boss that has no caster loot or other useful loot for that matter.
---
&gt;*Undead have zero chill.*
---
You clearly underestimate the number of Undead frost mages...
---
show me a bird of prey that eats a carrot and I will agree.
---
*Taurtaure
---
Necro-ing an old thread but just stumbled on this. Completely agree with you
---
Horde heading to BRM from Kargath have one entry into Searing Gorge, and it‚Äôs a decent choke point to fight. The ‚Äútown‚Äù (it‚Äôs one inn and a watchtower) has very few NPCs, so chances are low to get a civilian caught up for DHKs.
---
I wasn't really referring to the "truth" so much as this has already been posted 10,000 times since classic launched and this one doesn't even get the terminologies correct.
---
Yeah, they need to fix this - I was in a large conflict in BRM last week and it was unplayable.
---
But I'm not as concerned with WPvP as I am with Alterac Valley in P3, TBH.
---
Yeah I don't have time to play except around midnight or later server time, I've never struggled finding a group as DPS. If no ones looking for a DPS in their group, start your own. I scan "who" for warriors and druids, then for priests and shamans. It takes a max of 15 minutes to build a group from the ground up and that's at lowest pop time of day.
---
Definately report
---
Gryphon not eat carrot.
---
Your problem is trying to kill people in a battle scenario, just kill questers like a normal person
---
Nah, every week someone else gets something, you are a week closer to getting that item because there is less competition.
---
Be active as possible, help guildies, socially integrate and do your best to become friends with everyone in discord. Just hopping in when you‚Äôre playing other games just to chat is still great. 
---
Along with that get you‚Äôre pre-raid bis, engineering, FR crafted items if you want to tank, and bring every consumable possible along with world buffs to raid (you can put together your own DM+song flower groups, and this initiative will make you look great).
---
Do all of this and you will get loot. There is no way all the other warriors in your guild are putting 110% in, so if you do people will notice and you will be rewarded. 
---
Basically just give a shit, be focused, and do your actual best and you will be rewarded. I guarantee outside of the top guilds at least half of every raid team is half assing a lot of stuff.
---
P.S.: Loot council guilds should still be spreading loot out among all members. You just give the people who are putting less work in off pieces or stopgap items while the MVPs get Onslaught Girdle, Mageblade, BRE, Etc.
---
Huh interesting the last guide I read had you doing 2h fury and respeccing at 40 for MS
---
These two what?
---
These two yutes.
---
Mr Gambini, what is a yute?
---
I‚Äôm sorry, these two yoooouuutthhhs your honor, these two youths.
---
Me and a few (8ish) of my homies play daily for a few hours on rattlegore and always enjoy having more WoW friends. 
---
Come through, we shoot the shit, quest, dungeon. Some of us used to play classic some of us are new to the game. PM if ya want
---
Edit: we rolled horde
---
Minotaurs &gt; Hairy Midgets
---
Bannable yes, detectable yes, will you get banned? No
---
And the stock still tanks ...
---
Getting random greens from 5-29, minor speed to boots, WW Axe at 30, and Executioner's at 43 has made leveling my Warrior alt a lot easier
---
Grief has it on Grobbulus
---
Imagine thinking I'm wasting someone else's time when **THEY VOLUNTEERED TO JOIN THE GROUP**.
---
Enhancement shaman are kind of like, why go this melee shaman, when a healer or caster shaman has everything, but more?  Shaman are always needed for raids, I would take up to 9 in a given raid for every group to get full totem buffs and the MT group gets two.  
---
Locks are very good, but start out a little underpowered on the charts and ramp up to beasts a year or two down the line.  Most raids want 3-5 of them I'd say.
---
And also, i've changed my ways as i was like everyone, trying to be efficient while raid heal on farm status isn't about that.
---
I do
---
Not at all. Tbh Im very skeptic of the statements in this thread that classic has 1000x (or whatever) the load of pservers. 
---
What I was getting at is the guy I replied to said load was shifted to the client on pservers, which is 200% wrong imo. Pservers use the 1.12 client unmodified.
---
So much this
---
People just enjoy whining. You can tell by the amount of upvotea the first post had in this thread compared to the downvotes deeper in...only new players who expect Classic to be retail made it this deep.
---
There were no cross server BGs back in the day, and severs were much smaller than now.  I do know in the PvE raiding guilds there were a few hardcores who would always work together and help each other get rank 14, but let's be real.  There weren't 100's of those people on a given server like today, not during early classic anyway.  There were a handful on most servers at best, if that.
---
What I find irritating is that these people come barging in as total strangers and demand stuff from guilds.
---
How about applying in the proper spec to make a good first impression?   
---
I am in my guild from the getgo and now that P2 is on the horizon, I approached my class lead if I can stay arms to push PvP ranks. I already showed my worth, I'm contributing outside of raids in helping newcomer to gear. Leniency in specs is a reward earned by commitment. I'd wager most guilds would let you raid once in a while in PvP spec like currently with only MC.
---
Then why are you getting butthurt over what other people do of it doesnt effect you?
---
Nah....at this point people focused on leveling but only playing 1-3 hours a day should be 60 or getting really close.  
---
Difference is some people that love to explore, chat in cities, profession leveling, zone completionists, altoholics, etc...they won't be 60 yet.  Hopefully they are having fun playing the way they want to play, and enjoying the game at their own pace.
---
40+, level 60 for a few weeks, have a job, have a significant other, play ~3 hours a day.  Some days I don't play...a couple super sweaty marathon days when partner was traveling.
---
Me too
---
Then why can private servers do it ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1GaLM3ofoM
---
Classic is the only reason I subscribed again.
---
Is that you esfand?
---
What? please tell me what I don't understand. Ain't the best way to test your theory to change as little as possible?
---
Honestly today is the first I‚Äôve heard of this. My guild locks down BRM every week and it takes around 200 horde to clear us out. I haven‚Äôt lagged once. One of my hunters said he was still getting 200 frames.
---
This is the classic experience.
---
I know you run out of mana lmao
---
Seriously, please, level with me. Show me the math that allows you to cast a rank 7 flash heal throughout an entire fight? You can literally only cast rank 7 18 times with 7k mana before you‚Äôre oom. Even if you‚Äôre not chain casting it(which again, brings in to question why you need to cast flash in the first place if you don‚Äôt need to chain cast it) how do you expect to last more than 30-40 seconds without consumables/innervate?  If you‚Äôre not casting flash heal back to back what are you filling your extra gcds with? If your raid is flash heal meta renews are pointless, and it‚Äôs seemingly apparent that you don‚Äôt cast heal/gheal, so are you running around doing nothing?
---
And if it‚Äôs carrying a coconut
---
Hell yeah
---
Mainly just cause I got more time to do some fun alt leveling

There are a lot of spelling mistakes in his replies. He was probably tired.

How does Ony head drop work? Was always confused by it
---
Multiple parses at 99% over multiple weeks prove to me that healing efficiently doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm behind on throughput haha
---
As a ret (ish) paladin, or a prot(ish) paladin, I would want both second wind and HoJ, probably the chest piece too.  And as a paladin with Second Wind already...
---
They are just hoping to ninja that shit from you, or you're carrying 53s who want axes or other Angerforge trash.
---
Really though, what kind of player would join an Angerforge only/ HOJ reserved run?  Maybe people chasing xp? Mostly idiots that don't know better?  Either way, I'm not sure who is joining your groups but I bet it takes awhile to fill.
---
I don‚Äôt believe they passed that- and I would guess that‚Äôs unlikely- but the documentation provided says that this is the largest subscription growth in a single quarter.
---
Still a really important metric, but not nearly as significant as what the OP posted.
---
I never really got world pvp unless its specific targets to do in wpvp. Its just a bunch of people oneshotting each other and people who would rather not are caught up in it.
---
Im not butt hurt. Presenting the other side of an argument = / = being butt hurt. As to the delivery method,  i only mirrored the same method he did.
---
They dont attack your friends.
---
Blasted lands and azshara as all the big guilds fight for world bosses.
---
Golemlord also drops Omnicast boots, BiS for mage and alternative for locks and spriests.
---
Yes as long as they give us raiders bwl
---
Not when it comes to human psychology. 
---
Mooching off others effort is something people do not take kindly. Yes, everybody could just not come in GFPPs and have the healers shell out more mana pots and dark runes. 
---
The same way the PvP specced player is mooching of the players speccing back and forth. 
---
Sure, when everybody is allowed to come in whatever spec, that's fine. 
---
But apparently he's applying to good raiding guilds, else they wouldn't ask for parses. Why isn't he applying to casual guilds who let raid whatever class and spec? Because he wants proper clear times and commitment.

LITERATELY UNPLAYABLE*
---
The engine is still largely the same. Why do you think sharding exists in retail? To alleviate server load by reducing the amount of players whose data the server has to sync. Now take sharding out and you have a problem. It's not necessarily so easy as just throw more money at it. Ten players in close vicinity means 10^2 position calculations and data transfers between player clients. When this grows to 100 players, we're now talking 100^2. And this is only the player positions. Now take into account equipment, abilities, health, mana and resources.
---
Ah yes just join a server where there aren't 200 people in an area aka 5 guilds horde or alliance. They made servers larger than they were back then and didn't open enough at start.
---
Let me just leave all my friends, guild, and everything just so I can play on a dead server where I wouldn't even get to raid or raid as well and even experience pvp. That's such a great solution!
---
I'm not one of the people who are bitching about servers though, literally no game besides Planetside 2 right now can handle mass amounts of players. The games that really push it with great graphics and everything else do it MAYBE 70 vs 70.
---
There are just severe limitations on the amount of players you can stuff in an area and anyone with half a brain understands that. Parroting "but muh private servers!" Is stupid as fuck. Of course a bootleg with no care in the world about tracking, cheating, and other things that go into an official game.
---
Blizzard could stuff way more people in an area if they broke it that much more but then every other posts would be bitching about all the things they toss out to do it.
---
Oh I get what you mean.
---
For example, the growth in subscribers with the release of Classic surpassed the amount of new subscribers any previous expansion provided?
---
It‚Äôs almost like they get a what they want and I get what I want.
---
BUT IM WASTING THEIR TIME I FORGOT
---
I don't understand what the GM is trying to say. How does he provide his own external assistance?
---
That‚Äôs just a rehash if broken shit. 
---
Nobodies staying for that
---
Sorry, there's no realm type that is 'PVP - but only within 3 levels and equal #'d fights'. You should have known what you were getting when you rolled. Not like you had 15 years to know beforehand or anything.
---
Great Idea!
---
blizzard: lets start with 2 pvp servers
---
Slow MH, fast OH.
---
You want big crits with SS/Ambush on your MH, and your OH to be constantly interrupting/applying poison.
---
&gt;Always fastest one in oh? 
---
I think anything around 1.3 is good.
---
&gt;And what are some somewhat easily obtainable daggers I can get before MC?
---
Distracting Dagger from MC is almost essential as OH because it gives +6 to daggers.
---
Heartseeker/Shanker are good MH
---
I'm a better ret paly then that dude lol.
---
Wow you can start posts without the word "Imagine"
---
Thats the one I meant, but for crafting :)
---
I don't hate jobless people, I just don't think they should dictate a game's release schedule. The vast majority of players haven't completed the existing content.
---
Its easy if you just tell people how to go about it. Dont worry about agro, just kill with aoe, move on to the first torch you can rest there.
---
Correct.
---
Ambush and backstab dmg have a percentage modifier.  +5 dmg on a dagger adds 12.5 dmg on a 100 weap dmg normal backstab and 25 dmg on a 100 weap dmg crit backstab.  Also 17.5 normal and 35 crit on ambush.  That's on top of 5 additional dmg on every auto attack. 
---
100 str Crusader proc adds 7.14 dmg  on a proc.  I rather the consistent dmg over a proc.
---
Thanks for the advice. I actually did suggest an atunement night for getting ppl attuned
---
That's a lot of Riot Points.
---
We're like 2 months in. Chill dude. 2 Months is nothing. See how it looks in P4 or 5 and then make plans.
---
Of course.  They are never going to release new content for this game, so might as well make the old content last longer.
---
wat 
---
there were 2 pvp servers at launch, do you really think people would stack less if there were more servers? xD
---
Time to grind it on out!!!

Yeah, I want speed clears with MS &gt; OS. No retardins or prots allowed, sorry. :(

I didn't say anything about games, and I don't need to apply to places, large scale systems SRE is my livelyhood, and this is one of those "i forgot how to count that low" levels of concurrent load for a real time system.
---
Haha I bet he can't because everyone in his guild hates him.
---
+1 for the vid, +20 for the Tohou track.
---
You can 3 man arena/anger/golem runs at 60
---
I mean, that applies equally to ES so I didn't think it was worth mentioning.
---
Who in the hell is asking for logs in classic? Oh boy I got one more frost bolt in than the other guy!!!! Are you serious right now
---
In-game guild parties sound fun. Thank you
---
Yet you'll still see "Classic is dying" threads every day...
---
Is it? Having 8 days played to 60 is a decent time, maybe add 12 hours for inefficient levelling. That's 204 hours, stretch that over the time since release and you get a little less than three hours played *every single day*. That's not realistic for many players.
---
Dont forget the 40 man muliboxer.
---
Majority of people playing are people who are level 60. Google the classic population and you‚Äôll see. You are the minority and the content should not revolve around you.
---
It's installed correctly now. But I can't find a way, like you described it, to right-click shoot mobs as hunter :/
---
&amp; exact same situation here aswell lol
---
Why you think that can only happen in Classic?
---
So Im wondering if anyone knows the name of this addon im looking for.  It's on my PC at home,  and need to put it on my laptop since im traveling for work. 
---
It's a minimap addon that adds a dropdown menu when you click on it to choose what you want to track.   Im a hunter and don't want my bars filled up or have to open my spellbook everyone I want to change what I'm tracking.
---
Time waste

---
Seconded. It looked fantastic but man questing there was brutal. Still better than thousand needles, but that's the world's lowest bar.
---
So many new parents.
---
I feel that Classic WoW is more casual friendly because I'm not forced to log on every single day of Retail lest you feel hopelessly behind. 8.2.5 patch was just horrendous. Having to grind Mechagon and Nazjatar rep simultaneously was not fun at all. Oh, and not to mention the Azerite neck grind to L65.
---
But... There's no orbs in strat UD where the Baron cloak drops...
---
You sell yourself short. You are at least 300% better at making videos than playing hunter.
---

---
It's definitely not an issue of gear. I was expecting to see a hybrid build to be honest, but it seems like you also have an optimal talent build for healing, so the only thing left to improve is your gameplay I guess. BRD is fairly hard the first times you try to run it, so I'd say it's a very good time to experiment and try to improve your playstyle.
---
As you don't have a lot of +healing yet, don't downrank a lot. At your levels I was mostly using HT ranks 6,7 and 9, always aiming to fill up the tank with my heal. I used rejuvenation on any medium+ difficulty pull and regrowth was just a panic button (sadly it's not that good without the +crit talent, but it's a strong heal on it's own as it doesn't scale well with bonus healing). If I knew there was a hard pull ahead of us I'd use both of my hots (max rank) and ask my party for CC beforehand while praying that my mana pool is big enough (always carry a few pots). Also, never idle; keep casting and stop your cast if it turns out it's not needed. What I've done is bind a convenient key to a macro that just does /stopcasting, but I guess that's not necessary.
---
 As others said, don't sweat it, you're underleveled and the dungeon isn't easy. But always keep trying to find ways to improve your playstyle, as putting in extra effort is required for us druids if we want to produce the same results as the non-hybrid classes. Best of luck!
---
It is by far the easiest, IIRC.  You get a ton of rep from all the quests.  WSG and AB take many hundreds if not thousands of games to get to exalted.  But AV is like 50-60 I think.  I leveled an alt from 52-60 in the harpy cave and I was exalted before I hit 60.
---
Calling out everything I loved about the design as the problem this is why retail could never win.  Not saying either opinion is better only that our reactions to the same content are polar opposites.
---
As someone going for high warlord releasing it before Christmas was always gonna be a mistske
---
I farmed that on my warlock with just a hunter and a mage- no tank or healer required.
---
Yeah Winderspents and Cats are very good all round leveling pets they excel in dungeons (highest dps), pvp and solo grinding/questing can't go wrong with either.
---
So just pointing out after 3 months there are still server Ques sometimes, many serves still need layering, and WoW classic is still immensely popular and going strong while retail is more dead than ever. 
---
Classic - 3 pts, Retail - 0.
---
"Oh, you hit the boss once (or attempted and missed)? Time to blow every cool down and AOE everything!" -DPS
---
Off hand in 19s is all about dps since no poison or weapon traits.  Cruel Barb (15.54) beats out Assassin's Blade (15.53) but .01 dps.   Assassin's blade is best if you're playing a dagger rogue and will backstab.
---
That is factually wrong.
---
on ony just keep up slice and dice(well literally always keep up snd) once you are allowed to start dpsing, feint on cd.
---
just pop bladefurry once you are sufficiently behind on agro during p1.  unless ony dies where it won't be up for p3. 
---
during p2 use yellow attacks while shes in the air by standing below her.  vanish near end of p2.
---
once p3 is set and she's back in position you can go back to dps again. 
---
snd&gt;evis unless you can 5pnt evis without dropping snd. as swords i usually snd at 2 maybe 3 cp
---
If you think this logic fixes the p2 issue then you are chronically stupid. There is no nice way to say it. 150 players will surely even battle on low pop / medium pop and you will still lag. This is a shit meme and a shit post overall. I thought this sub had fucking rules? Bet my post gets moderated though, maybe it will bring attention to this joke of an opinion.
---
Lol this happens to me as well and I'm glad I saw this post. Sometimes I would think a rogue was messing with me...
---
coordinate with the tank/healer;  throw hots, healer immediately start drinking, tank goes in and starts combat
---
Felwood is worse for me by far...
---
You think medium pop servers won't have this issue? Enjoy lagging on every single server.
---
Congrats, to both your guild and your hard work! :) This is always a good feeling.
---
As my guild's #3 tank, we can't tank every single run that everyone of the 100 rogues wants us to run. I have no gold on account of living in dungeons. I have no alts over lvl 25. This is why tanks burn out.
---
Oh fuck Pagle really has 100k+?
---
Not sure about that addon either. do you remember the name?
---
Its definitely possible depending on your server. Typically what happens is the good pvpers will win literally every wsg game in 2 minutes due to the other team afking out, and they set up an agreement with other pvpers to limit the amount they grind. Outgroup people will have to spend 2-3x as much time grinding, so there's usually not much competition that can't be bargained with, and all the serious groups aiming for rank 14 are usually willing to work something out, barring maybe 1 or 2 weeks or dickwaving where one group feels their people should get to r14 first.
---
It's going to die if they don't release new content (phase 6 and beyond) or improve on server stability.
---
Does lifestealing enchant proc the mana return from a judgement of wisdom?
---
It seems to but I can't really tell.
---
No, I didn't mention druids.
---
Big yikes to this post . Maybe try playing some more games or doing some different hobbies
---
I did Fury until I got SS. I mean, theres nothing remarkable in Arms until SS (for leveling)
---
I see me! Having so much fun raiding. If this is contender you're a fantastic raid lead and cant wait to continue raiding with you guys!
---
Blood Fury is a 50 healing debuff.  No thanks...
---
warlock? they summon a healthstone then spam shadow bolt constantly, because there are not enough debuff slots for them to put out anything else besides imp shadow bolt and maybe if you are lucky 2-3 corruption slots.  The only dps class with a "rotation" in classic is rogue, because they build up points and pop slice and dice, with vanish to reset aggro.  I don't think timing aim shots between auto attacks as a hunter counts as a rotation either.
---
Same here, although I was subbed for a long time but quite inactive (out of boredom)
---
Non necessarily calling out the set pieces as much as the individual.  Terrestrian stranglestaff, Blazefury, Aldori Defender, Bulwark of Azzinoth.  even some of the green sets were so crazy looking I got asked to tank a 70 instance at 62 because my gear made me look at cap.
---
I am level 60, and you're bad at reading. Go back and try again.
---
There are differing opinions about this so it‚Äôs not like there is just one absolute best way pre-40.
---
he said "full strat"
---
Thank you. Yeah, it's definitely just a case of me having to improve. I didn't know what to expect in BRD and I definitely didn't realize how hard and how fast some of the mobs would be hitting. Lots of great advice in this thread and here so I appreciate it! Just hoping my guild will give me a shot to run again despite the tank dying a bunch ... at least there were no full team wipes, I guess. :p
---
And everyone below me in levels is a complete noob who needs to l2p.
---
Which is completely fine for pve. But pvp? Nahhhh I prefer my UD
---
How good is the [Charstone Dirk](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17710/charstone-dirk) for a caster? Specifically the equip effect. At first glance, it seems very neglible. But I might be missing something. How does this weapon combined with a decent offhand ([Cloud Stone](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17737/cloud-stone) or [Celestial Orb](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7515/celestial-orb)) compare to the [Illusionary Rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7713/illusionary-rod) for a level 49 Mage?
---
I'm 36, full time job, live in GF, and officer in a guild that we are on our 5th week of full MC clears.  Also have been out of town for two of the weekends since it went live, and are a few nights of the week I can't play.
---
If you've been there done that before it's really not all that hard.... People that have never played vanilla and aren't playing with people that did I can see them taking a lot longer to chunk through it as it's not as intuitive as expansions like Wotlk and later.

---
timing ss with your swing timer is not worth doing until you have everything else down. 
---
what's more important is maximizing slice.  dont ever refresh slice if you have time life on it and aren't energy capped.  wait until its about to expire, or you are about to energy cap.  this helps you be able to get more eviserates off by not wasting any energy. 
---
get a big fat weakaura with your slice and dice icon in the middle of the screen so you don't have to watch your buff bar.
---
The problem seems like it would be exponential, at least from a networking perspective. I'm sure computing the result on the server is less intensive than sending the results of those computations to the players (or an updated game state, however they do it). If every 2 seconds (and each player having some sort of splay between actions), a player does an action in that window of time, the server needs to compute and update everyone's game state. Even the players themselves need to get an updated game state of their own actions, or else hacking would be more prevalent. Let's take a look at some rough math, for *n* players in an area, and how many people would need to receive those game state updates (super simplified, assuming no batching).
---
* 1 player: 1 player receives their own updates (1*1)
---
* 2 players: 2 players receive each other's updates and their own, so 4 updates total (2*2)
---
* 3 players: 3 players receive each other's updates and their own, so 9 updates total (3*3)
---
* 4 players: 4 players receive each other's updates and their own, so 16 updates total (4*4)
---
and so on. Its exponential, which is one of the worse cases - [O( n^2 )](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Orders_of_common_functions). The computation on the result needs to happen once on the server (which probably needs to be transactional and may be a bottleneck), but sending that result to everyone's client gets more and more expensive for each person in the area (who would need to receive that updated game state). You get a lot of information about others that you don't see if you were to turn your combat logging settings to 11. Did you really NEED to know that an enemy player 20 yards away and out of sight conjured some muffins or bandaged their pet? Doesn't matter if you did. You'll still get that game state update for your local client because everyone needs to have the same game state for this game to work.
---
And even if they batch game state updates (which they probably do at some level), you still have the issue of sending out larger and larger payloads to each player. So, for 4 people, instead of it being 16 update small updates, its 4 updates each that are 4 times bigger in payload size. At best, this just eliminates some overhead but it just moves the problem elsewhere. I'm sure there's a whole boatload of issues with having to use UDP and ensuring everyone has the same state as well. As someone who works in IT infrastructure for a big company, I try to empathize at least a little bit with Blizzard's issues with their infrastructure. It's never as easy as hiring more people to solve the problem, or throwing more money at more/larger servers (and even then, you'll have more to maintain and fix, and depending on the level of redundancy needed, it can get REALLY expensive really fast).
---

Please show me where in the comments that I have replied to, say that you are 60.
---
Literally had the same experience, remember the day very vividly!
---
Yup, in 4 hours you can do a full MC clear and onyxia with less than 40 people. My guild does this without any wipes and we've only been raiding for about a month now (but only 2 total rag kills) so much we're not very geared but it's still very easy.
---
Find a group or grow up? In a roll system people have equal opportunity on gear - and you presumably knew that going in.  If you want your epeen number to factor into your gear getting chances,  find a guild that distributes that way.
---
As soon as I saw the poly I knew they were done.
---
For PvP the 25% stun resist is pretty f'n good.    But looks and animations are mos def in the UD favor...
---
...and emotes and cannibalize.
---
Wow you are so cool, please post more!
---
Oof that rogue is definitely rage whispering the mage
---
BRD is massive and most folks won't do it in one full clear. 
---
The jailbreak chain for alliance involves turn-ins outside of the dungeon and then a subsequent RNG drop inside of the dungeon. After that, there is a scripted event that can easily cause a wipe if you don't preclear the path. And all of that takes a ton of time just for the jailbreak. And you want to kill the emperor and save the princess all in one run?
---
It's not going to happen in one run.
---
Apparently....70k+ alliance which is what a lot of high population US servers have total.
---
Hope do you define "many players" at this point? Is that your personal perception or is it rooted in actual numbers?
---

Undead Mage what more could you want. Best AoE, strong and then eventually best single target. Tons of unique utility. No need to ever buy water, get paid by others to make it. Port around the world, get paid to port others. Best solo farm. Wanted in every dungeon and raid. Monster in small and large scale PvP.
---
You only need 35min-3h for mc depending on the skill/gear/setup of your guild. We are at 1h 15min currently and are not even speed running.
---
You can sell anything you want for gold in-game. Lockpicking services, blacksmithing services, Wetlands escort services. Tanking is no different in that regard.
---
It‚Äôs when you start asking for RMT or start harassing people that it becomes actionable.

No, what you're describing is xenophobia - which this still isn't. If you're dumb enough to think this is racist, at least take the time to understand the difference between racism and xenophobia.
---
THE PRIVATE SERVERS HAD NO CHEAT PROTECTION YOU STUPID IDIOTS YOU MORONS YOU ARENT SMART YOU ARE DUMB
---
Good news. They are introducing a new feature that will bump your level by multiplying itself by itself. You will soon be able to jump straight to level 6! Congratulations!
---
There is no meaningful increase in network throughput when there are large scale PVP battles. Go look at task manager and watch for yourself. It's possible there is a somewhat significant percentage jump, but that would only be because of just how little bandwidth WoW uses in the first place.
---
Best guild name on Gandling EU!
---
I play classic because it's the game I liked playing. I quit retail in Cataclysm.  I don't really have to justify not playing retail anymore than I have to justify not playing Age of Conan because from what I've seen it's a completely different game.
---
Except tanks. There‚Äôs a shitton of Warriors, Paladins, and Druids, but a small minority of them are willing to tank.
---
[Booty Bay Gazette](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/booty-bay-gazette)
---
Those are some wild assumptions rofl. I do the same thing as you and every priest does regarless of what spell they primarily use, i precast and cancel all the god damn time. The play style doesnt change much apart from the keybind you are using. 
---
Also even if the meta is flash heal no one has unbound other spells, it's just heavily (65-80% from what i remember) flash heal centric.
---
what are you saying if not that? that is exactly what it looks like you're saying.
---
You realize that this game is one day going to reach a point where no new updates are released?
---
I never got that crippling server lag in city invasions back in vanilla, only low fps.
---
It's better for healers, as a mage you want to prioritize +spelldmg, +int and +stam.
---
"I'm helping!" - mage probably.
---
I am actually alliance so take this with a grain of salt, but I think it's worth transferring. The horde guilds are certainly outnumbered and small groups do get ganked outside BRD/LBRS, but they are also more cohesive than the alliance and I fear their coordination come P2. Currently the alliance guilds do not coordinate/share ony buffs at all. It's basically sniped as soon as possible by one of the dozens of head holders. Horde guilds are currently popping them at scheduled times and running into BRM either together or one after another. I've seen more alliance guilds fully wiped by horde raids than vice versa.
---
I got my ww axe at 32 shortly after launch but I really wish I‚Äôd leveled my rogue first

Yes, you're wrong.

I don't know what the quarter results were in WotLK when they hit 12 million subs, but if this is a record for WoW then I'd obviously imagine that it has, and they even said in the call that it has doubled, so wouldn't that mean 24million MAU's for WoW across retail and Classic? or am I missing something here.
---
&gt;Yeah but they (aside from Nost) had a small fraction of the population
---
Not true.  Lightbringer and Northdale both had regular peaks of 12-15k
---
On private servers I maintained a faster 1-60 total /played time when using a 1h and shield compared to 2h. Always tried to keep both the 1h and shield upgraded as early as possible. 
---
Auto attack with rockbiter, keep lightning shield up. Rockbiter is king.
---
Also, if you know you're gonna kill multiple mobs in relatively the same spot then put your totems right in the middle and pull the mobs towards them so you benefit from their whole duration. This made the mana regen totem really good and always a big net positive in terms of mana. Small heal if needed after the mob is dead and go on to the next.
---
You might kill mobs slower this way but you almost never have to drink, and if you play on a PvP server this lets you keep relatively high hp and mana so you never seem like an easy kill. Enhancement shamans are really, really easy to kill if you range them and have the initiative, even more so when they're below 50% hp and mana which you will almost always be if you keep spamming your shocks.
---
Oh yeah, vastly. And Whipvine Cord has 9 Int, 6 MP5 and 31 Healing Power
---
Isn't this an issue that can be solved by more hardware? If they are making more checks, then more servers to handle the load should do the trick. So it sounds like they just don't want to spend the time/money to fix the problem.
---
&gt; balances like infernal not murdering bankers
---
Really needed.
---
&gt; fixing network backend/etc
---
**ThAtS nOt VaNiLlA!!!10101 #nochanges**
---
Alrighty then.
---
This argument needs to just die already. Classic is well known to NOT be 1:1 original ‚Äúnochanges‚Äù and this bullshit only comes up when something SHOULD be fixed BUT ISNT.
---
You have other tools in your toolkit to smooth out the first few seconds of a fight. Prehotting, fairy fire swipe and growl. If you have 0 hit you're still going to get healed in the first hit unless you Dodge, have 3 sec of guaranteed aggro (if it lands) and swipe for snap aggro. Pulling with ff also causes some decent threat. I main druid MT and have 0 hit for my mitigation and people never pull off me, why? Because I use a pummler on bosses or have taunt for trash if I need it. Hit isn't nearly as important as getting a crit on maul. Also no, it's not like heroic strike as our threat for maul is multiplicative for threat generated, not additive like heroic strike is.
---
Not to mention that because FF is on global and maul isn't you get a lot of snap aggro. Then you can roar for even more if FF misses.
---
Ok, not butthurt, I'll give you that. But it still largely an irrelevant counterpoint because for the following in character examples: I'm the tank, the healer is my guildie, I have the key, also I've run this place about 200 times in the last week so the level 59 Hunter can fuck off, he's not getting SGC over me.
---
It‚Äôs not 2005 anymore. The video game landscape is completely different.
---
This is great, thanks mate. Literally made a large slice and dice cool down bar today, funny you'd suggest it. Thanks for the notes.
---
They said phase 2 would come quick and it should. Its literally not catering to anyone.
---
Like i said, never again.
---
If someone makes a group with a reserved item, and nobody joins, that's their own free time to waste, so why do you give a fuck?
---
Alternatively, if people *do* choose to join, in spite of the reserved item, that's clearly their own free time to waste, so why do you give a fuck?
---
How is any of this harming your ability to form your own group with your own rules, which should in theory be *more* attractive to potential joiners by comparison?
---
This is super helpful, thanks mate!
---
what's a good NA pvp server? Looking for fun guilds, faction raids on towns, dueling outside of ironforge, the occasional raid etc all the fun stuff
---
Don‚Äôt mix up concurrent with total player numbers. Nost had 15k concurrent but 800k total
---
As a Druid main im wondering what gamebreaking class bugs im unaware of. Would somebody mind explaiming?
---
&gt;Moore's Law is fake news.
---
Yea. Sure.
---
Says the guy presumably playing Classic. There's lots of people who will play each of the expansions regardless of how broken you think it is, and its certain that rehashing TBC and WOTLK will be much less work than classic+
---
Well definitely give me a wave if you actually see me :) I don't initiate fighting
---
Hunters can solo it so you could always buy runs for the HoJ or 2 rogues can kill him if you play one.
---
Imagine thinking that running a small private server is even remotely comparable to what Classic runs on. And I'm not just talking about the amount of players using it.
---
The stupidity I've seen on this sub/subject today is off the charts, but entertaining at least.
---
You turn in the head quest, everybody is Org or Stormwind gets the buff.
---
A problem with locks that a lot of people overlook is that you can't stop generating threat if you have dots up, and you kind of need to be preemptive on applying your dots to actually do damage. 
---
So its a mix of " do I wait and let the tank get aggro and not do good damage?" or "do I apply dots and do damage but probably pull threat and have no way to stop generating additional threat"
---
The majority of classic players I‚Äôve met only came back for classic and would be gone again for good if it didn‚Äôt continue haha
---
Hey at least it works, using vanish as a rogue is a coinflip if it will do anything.
---
False
---
I had fun.
---
as someone currently writing a review article and having to turn through hundreds of primary articles, this post made my day hahah thank u
---
And yet speedhacks **in pservers** (the popular ones at least) will automatically boot you from the server for exceeding a threshold, as well as teleport hacks and the likes.
---
WTF Blizz...
---
this lag is for ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù and it isn‚Äôt even secure???
---
Well then you aren't the person they should be catering towards. Phase 2 is about ranking and the pvp system. Joe Schmoe running around getting in 1v1 or 5v5 skirmishes isn't ranking very high. You are a blip on the radar to the ranking system in classic. As much as you don't care about large scale pvp that is the meta lag-fest or not. It would better for literally everyone on the server, including you, for blizzard to do whatever it takes to make sure there is as little lag as possible. I don't know where you plan to have your small skirmishes but have fun getting lagged out by raids of people that want to get as much honor as possible.
---
Do you wait to use adren rush until phase 3? Phase 2 I'm not confident I could maintain range and fear I'd waste it.
---
I guess. But that's like saying NS is 16 points of talents that are worthlessness for bear just for a 4.5k heal when it crits every 3 min while exposing you to caster form for 1.5 seconds.
---
Did it that way this morning, kited the pet and she de-agged, killed precious and went back for her.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs correct. Sorry for poor wording on my part.
---
Personally, I crafted all relevant recipes before switching to goblin myself. Just so I wouldn‚Äôt have to buy it from someone else. So that was the idea in my head. But yeah you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs only those 2 that are BOP.
---
#hate
---
I have never been in a group that wiped in that room :D Its always in the bar where people just go talk to everyone and manage to pull the whole room.
---
Players: This game is gonna be huge
---
Blizzard: Launches with 4 servers
---
Phase 2 Shitshow: \*surprised pikachu\*
---
Oh someone about to get GKicked
---
I want to start on my quest to get benediction. I see I'll need to raid to do this and likely it'll be a few weeks as I'm just hitting 58 now and I can't see my guild letting the newcomer have the eye of divinity. 
---
 But I read you can farm the eye of shadow which I plan to do tonight if I can get a guildie or two to help. 
---
 But the guides I read say it drops of Lord kazaak. Which is a world boss?  And they ain't here yet.  
---
 Other than that it drops off the demons in southern winter spring correct ?
---
At least the coin flip is not all the time a death sentence in dungeons.
---
Tbh there was only one zone in tbc i liked visually - nagrand.
---
But there are only a handful in classic, too.
---
Very odd, no one I‚Äôve been watching so it the last few days (I‚Äôve been trying and taking turns with a bu munch of different hunters) has been able to get them to deaggro
---
Please show me where in the comments that you have replied to, say that I was talking about people who weren't 60.
---
Also, re-read your sentence and tell me it makes grammatical sense.
---
Where‚Äôs the math dude? You‚Äôve literally provided nothing but anecdotes. This is super simple basic shit, so why can‚Äôt you just show me the math that makes flash heal work? 
---
On a side note, if you are cancelling your flash casts why wouldn‚Äôt you just cast heal?!? I know you‚Äôre following the discord motto, but please explain why you‚Äôd bother casting flash if you‚Äôre cancelling? That takes away the only upside of flash spam, the throughput(assuming rank 7)
---
What do you play in retail?
---
&gt;Other than that it drops off the demons in southern winter spring correct ?
---
Yup, quite easy to farm from the Slayers and Initiates.
---
I've farmed up 5 from there to sell and to give to various priests in my guild, the drop is around 1/100.
---
But he's right
---
Any previous quarter.. Not expansion
---
Found the tank that can't hold aggro
---
What addon can I use so that I can track slice and dice and/or sap or stuns as a rogue more easily? I've seen some that make them appear as a larger bar that has a bar in the middle of the screen as these things time out.
---
This is a record in a quarter. There‚Äôs definitely much less than 12 million subscribed. Probably 6-7 million tops.
---
Refresh me again as to how many weeks from release the AQ40 patch was? Because it most certainly wasn‚Äôt 2 months after vanilla first came out. 
---
So like I said, the reason you think the drop rate was bumped was because 2 months into vanilla, guilds weren‚Äôt doing 3-4 MC clears a week. 2 months into classic, they are.
---
Notice how if you cram in dozens of Rag kills a week across your server, it can seem like there are more bindings on your server than back in vanilla when only 1% of the game population had even reached 60 2 months in, let alone get attuned and formed raid groups?
---
Most of these warrior quests you get at one level, and are meant to complete it by 10 levels from then.  Brutal armor has items that come from easy mobs in stone talon, ore, and finally the RFK boss.  The idea is that you can probably finish everything by level 30 and get a blue that's good for that level.
---
If you're lucky and have a guild or higher level friends that can help, you can get those items at a much lower level (as low as 20).  Same with Whirlwind axe.  One item is created by combining 8 of 3 different item drops from level 38-39 mobs, along with some other easier to obtain items.  Once you have all this stuff you summon a level 40 elite and once you kill it you get the WW axe.  Obviously you're not going to solo a 40 elite at 30, but again, with help you can get all this stuff done way ahead of time and have your WW axe in the low 30's.  It's especially worth it because it's still a great weapon past level 40 if you can't get ravager axe to drop.
---
Enjoy the lag, then.
---
found the idiot dps who doesn‚Äôt know how tanking works in classic
---
Southern winter spring yep. They hit very hard but can be kited easily enough
---
You might need to pull a second blanket over your eyes there boi
---
Refreshing stuff, isn't it? after all the naysayers doubted Classic from the beginning.
---
‚ÄúI made a video ...‚Äù
---
Aaand you lost me.
---
Were you boasting about your gear in chat?
---
great fix the servers then
---
You can't apologize for their servers in 2019 not being able to handle shit just cause the vanilla experience sucked. What kind of excuse is that. I remember engaging in large scale, 40v40 and 80v80 wpvp fights in MoP and WoD and never experiencing lag. Then Legion and BFA released and they changed the client and fun stuff like that seemed to no longer be possible. Classic is based on the Legion client, so your guess is as good as mine...
---
They‚Äôre a cheap knockoff of Plains Indians. They can‚Äôt hold a candle to the hard-drinking immovable objects clad in armor and bristling with guns.
---
Should just be able to click buffs, go to SnD, then see uptime by player. Not checked for classic but if its the same it'll work. I'll go check.
---
E: yeah works exactly the same, example (randomly picked first guild on the front page)
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/f8wjGmPY2J1CrWKz#fight=6&amp;type=auras&amp;ability=6774
---
might be biased because i play on the server, but faerlina is not bad for alliance east coast pvp
---
there are queue times during the peak hours but if you don't mind that the server is always very active which i like cause i can always find groups for stuff
---
downside would be all the farming spots are usually taken but i don't spend a lot of my time out in the world farming so it doesn't affect me a ton
---
&gt; Wow however, is running on a god knows how old revamped version of the wc3 engine (not even shitting you) 
---
Sick of seeing this, this was debunked in The WoW Diary. Pages 36 - 45 explain how the WC3 engine  would not be suitable for an MMO (World of Warcraft) and they opted to create their own engine for it. Please stop pushing this misleading information.
---
&gt;blizz can't fix the lag because it's a problem with the engine not being able to spread the workload and not the servers/hardware's capabilities.
---
Private servers handle this just fine, and so did the original game client. Engine is an issue, but it's the modern engine - not the original one - that has the problem.
---
Idk it just seems like everyone complaining has been 60 for a while. My group of 6 or so all hit 60 in the last week. We‚Äôve done MC once and ony zero. I‚Äôm not in a rush but I‚Äôm also not mostly tier 1 and bored of the end game already..
---
Ahh that's good news. I'll check the AH first lol.
---
Doesnt really seem like someone who is just walking by would say that lol...
---
Ty
---
it happens, can't do anything about it
---
only time i saw viskag drop was in a pug and the dps warrior doing less dmg than the tank won it over me
---
human warrior or nelf hunter?
---
also is Stacked a good name for a human warrior?
---
And Nets the name for the nelf hunter
---
opinions?
---
The game can easily handle 40v40 i literally just had such a fight before my raid.. stop exagerating.
---
... yes there is. Every zone is on a shard that's being virtualized somewhere in the cloud, whether that shard belongs to a high pop realm or a low one is irrelevant. You get 400 people in a zone, you're going to lag.
---
Yeah that's weakauras
---
we have no lag with 500+. come to think of it. please stay on yours
---
I believe Invis pots and Lesser Invis pots dont share cooldowns, would help to get closer.
---
Yup 39min mc a few nights ago. Getting world buffed took longer than the raid.
---
Id try to get Herblore too cuz Ghostshrooms sell for fat profit rn to max your gph but it's not required
---
No it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs never a bannable offense to kill someone on a PvP server. I promise your whiny ass that
---
It seems like a simple solution is to just give those items away. DKP can even be made to take some cues from loot council. Sounds like the way you did DKP was too inflexible to accommodate for a changing guild and loot environment.
---
People gave me the ultimate shit after I won this as a druid
---
What server are you on? I‚Äôm looking for a guild
---
No content means people quit.
---
Right now people have something to look forward to. World PvP, BWL, BG's, AQ, Naxx. I would assume most people would quit 1-2 years after Naxx if there isn't 'Classic+'.
---
I would not want to see that whisper log.
---
*^(I kinda do want to see that whisper log.)*
---
Level 61-69 greens were a right of passage. If you didn't look like you fell into a prop store discount bin then you weren't playing right! My warlock had a hat that looked straight out of the good, the bad, and the ugly and I liked it! Hunters even got a legit pimp hat. How is that not awesome?
---
Just here for crab rave memes
---
"Sept. 12th"
---
It seems to yes, but at the time of him posting this we didn't have enough data. We still don't really. 
---
We have a theorycrafting channel specifically dedicated to Onyxia and people have been testing this GUID method since Tuesday night after I ran the first test to show I might be on to something. It's not like I'm running tests behind closed doors. 
---
I'd rather wait until I had sufficient data to make an announcement outside of the discord, but my hand has pretty much been forced now.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten there yet, I believe it
---
Since most people can play less, it will be comparatively easier.
---
Counterspell when the use Blizzard
---
Bigglesworth represent!  I giggle every time I see anyone from your guild run by!
---
Execute is our fast pass to the front of the dps charts.
---
i think he's always played retail too
---
Well that's just straight up wrong bro
---
That's literally my point. If there's a noticeable spike on 128 slot battlefield servers for ping, how do people expect a mmo to have flawless connection and performance with a substantially higher population all in one place. That's really stressful even with modern hardware.
---
O yeah my bad
---
He‚Äôs obviously a warrior
---
There's a spot by the entrance you can get loot. Try to stand as close as possible to the princess as possible, and have your friend kill the princess as close as possible to you.
---
So I'm a totally new player. I want to go play shadowlands for the sole reason you can play through any expansion after the new starting zone.  I mean if that's me I would assume there's at least a few out there like me,
---
 I love everything about classic except everyone blindly follows guides and add-ons thus killing some of the content. When I roll my alt will I still be able to find groups like I did with my main or will it be a empty zone ?? I'm not sure lol but the whole 1-60 and being able to play through any expansion really draws my attention. 
---
 I plan to play a different char through each expansion then pick a main and play thru shadowlands!  I'll have to wait and see which I like better. I think it's silly there's even such thing as character boosting though but I mean to each there own
---
I had a shaman solo tank a full ubrs run a couple weeks ago. It went just fine and I didn't even pretend to take it easy on him threat wise.
---
whats the better name for a nelf priest?
---
'Thank'   or   'Whitewizard'   ?
---
You're absolutely right. Blizzard has the money and resources to easily outperform private servers in every regard
---
No. Why do ppl insist on needing to be max level with bis for p2? I love levelling while pvping and getting honor on the way. Yea ur gunna get ganked but so what
---
I wish. I have yet to start using any macros, per noob fashion. I told myself once I hit 40 and got my mount I would start making/using some, and here I am at 53 with 0 macros.
---
Don't be discouraged though. Druid healing is tough. I've heard people complain that we don't need to "keep everyone topped off", but I find that since our HT has such a long cast time that it's much easier (and safer) for me to just swallow the mana inefficiency and cast Rejuv on someone if they fall below about 80-90%.
---
You really want a mage though to deal with the adds that spawn for anger.
---
Ok buddy it‚Äôs just I never knew hunters could equip it. It says jagermeister in the items tooltip
---
Sure I haven‚Äôt reached 60yet
---
you think you do.....
---
Some like that, but a sweeping strikes whirlwind on 2 mobs is so satisfying!
---
You missed his point, people are acting like this is a new unheard thing, i cant remember a time when blizzard servers were able to handle a large scale battle. Hell in vanilla you would lag out for just entering orgrimmar on a high pop server
---
Yeah, but usually what they do is gather information on them to create a profile and then do mega-bans instead of playing wack-a-mole. Also lets them auto-ban the behavior in the future.
---
Same here. I would occasionally buy a month time for retail to scratch that itch again or see the newly released content, but never ended up playing for more than a few days. Classic is what has me keeping my sub active, I really couldn't care less about retail now; I keep up with story developments but that's it, the gameplay doesn't interest me at all
---
Except it didn't
---
Going to say yes but don't bother as it will be an unplayable experience especially with the resolution played these days.
---
And remain Classicriel
---
It's running on the modern engine, which obviously is optimized for modern hardware configurations. That said Classic isn't particularly demanding, especially if you forego the modern shader options like improved shadows/lighting/water and stick to lower presets (1-3 I believe are within "classic" bounds). I mean it can't hurt to try it I guess if you already have a subscription. The minimum system requirements lists 2006 hardware, for what it's worth.
---
I'd say the old version of windows on that rig is more likely to cause you problems.
---
&gt; 1) as enchancement I use rockbitter more than WF, especially if I haven't had WF spell upgrade in awhile. RB is constant damage, where WF can go hot and cold. I personally didn't care if the wep was fast or slow, as long as it was dps upgrade. 
---
Windfury 2nd and 3rd attacks can crit, and those crits give you 30% attack speed
---
Beer caption to try justify a phone pic. Pffff
---
cheers to you for doing the lords work in wrangling all these souls
---
But people want to blame blizzard tho, for not having a 15 year old game working like a 2019 game.
---
Can confirm would come to an agreement and split pulls with horde mages until I was leaving. 
---
Then enjoy the walk bro
---
No not at all. I made a bunch of accounts to see what I could get away with and did a bunch of hacking. Got banned every time automatically
---
Hell like 20 years ago Ultima Online would have insane day-long faction wars with multiple guilds and factions raiding/defending. Their servers managed it.
---
I mean it's sort of understandable, I got kinda lucky with my groups that I was in able to roll on both tank and dps gear. Though that shouldnt really stop those warriors from repeating content to get their tank sets up.  
---
It's really up to people's preference, some people just don't have the gear or the willingness to tank. Most of the time they msg me they're understanding if I put DPS gear on res as a tank. Also I feel like a lot of people do stuff while they wait for group so even waiting 3 hrs to do a dungeon isn't so bad if you spent 3 hours doing other stuff you need.
---
Just like how classic originally played in 2006. There's a reason why blizzard stopped encouraging super heavy scale world PvP in future iterations of the game.
---
It's also the streamer server which OP might not like.  If so, Whitemane is a decent alternative.
---
The whole poing of the post was things to do without gathering profs :P
---
Org *alone* lags tremendously during peak hours on stalagg. Its really fucking atrocious and theres no excuse for it.

Good guy mage bahahah. Probably has some beef with the rogue

Even if they just release fresh servers I think people would stick around

Came here to say this.

Leatrix Plus has an option for that - [" Enhance professions - Make the professions frame double wide. "](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic)

&gt;Seriously I don't know why some people shit on RP servers

Because many people think RPers are cringey. It's not really a mystery.

These arent the forums dude, this is just a subreddit, spam the forums theyre actually responsible for
---
He could easily sell rare names for 10 bucks each and make a profit, who‚Äôs the noob now?
---
They're both pretty bad
---
Yeah this.It really isn't problem in 5 man because focus target will die quick and hell even bosses will die quick and won't be able to kill you.Huge problem is in raids tho,especially Onyxia. Even with wanding so much i get aggro :&lt;
---
&gt; Windfury 2nd and 3rd attacks can crit, and those crits give you 30% attack speed
---
It is known.
---
Something like weapon swaps need to be done manually while in combat. Blizzard has several protected functions that addons can only use while out of combat. They don't want addons making decisions for you. With the functionality you want, someone could setup an addon that waits for a certain buff, then swaps to another weapon/weapons instantly, without any action by the player. Blizzard tried to get rid of many auto-play addons, and made it so the player has to actually do the action.
---
Thats awesome to hear! Ill be able to handle that amount of time before too long
---
Of course, but i'm also the kind of guy who thinks The Hobbit should have been one movie instead of three. There is a difference between taking your time to enjoy something and just dragging your feet.
---
It's a waste of mana to shift out of form constantly. Stay in form, kill a mob, then only shift out when you need to heal up, and repeat. This is the best way to kill quest mobs even if you put all of your points in the Balance tree.
---
The Balance talents might help you solo elites etc with roots and casting. But you won't use them much on normal quests.
---
Inspired by != cheap knockoff.
---
If that were the case then your dwarves would just be cheap knockoff tiny Celts!
---
All that matters truly
---
The latest retail engine, so the same engine? They never changed engines, modified it, updated it, but never changed it.
---
A friend of mine played like 18 hours a day during summer break (12 weeks) back in Vanilla. He only managed to get rank 13. It's fucking hard to hit 14, and will probably be harder now.
---
He's saying holding threat as moonglow spec is fine in 5 man's. I'm not
---
For single target, yes. For 3+ targets, not so much.
---
The combo i gave will let you get solid threat on a group in 3 gcds. You wont even have a single sunder on each target in the same time frame.
---
Yeah but SC hasn't had a major update in years lol. I would love for anything. Even 1 single campaign mission lol.
---
Delay Phase 2
---
&gt;still trying to get their first epic drop.

Right in the feels with your average 10+mages raid.

I might be in the minority here, but I think this looks completely fake and photoshopped. The most glaring thing is that the GM says his name (Klastionn) and that is different than what is listed in the whisper window (Klastiom). While I could excuse a couple of spelling and grammar mistakes from someone in customer support, this is riddled with errors, is super informal (which hasn‚Äôt been my experience with GMs), and is incredibly difficult to understand.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt put a lot of credence in this post if I was someone being impacted by this bug.
---
It was epic fun about 50% of the time, and a brutal grind to achieve a goal the other 50%. We had about 20 highly dedicated players that all got along and bought into our strategies, clear shot calling, creating a well oiled machine. WSG groups were always perfect, and AB rarely needed a sub from our PvE guild. When you pull something off that coordinated and grind that hard you make friends for life. Most of us quit wow shortly after and 15 years later ill be traveling to another continent to attend my buddies wedding and we regularly talk/try to find games to spend an hour or two playing together once a month.
---
Everyone has their own idea of fun. Back then it was awesome, but Id never even consider doing it again.
---
Greater heal ‚Äútakes over‚Äù when you get the T2 set bonus iirc
---
Not having battlegrounds in phase 2 would be the most recent example of them encouraging wpvp...
---
Please Blizzard, this would complete the game. 
---
Planetside 2 can do it. Nostalrius did it. 100v100 battles. Please.
---
&gt; without causing a mass exodus of players.
---
Most people aren't even close to 60. I'd be completely fine with a delay. Who cares if nolifers are impatient.
---
bad latency is LITERALLY lag, what are you on about
---
Came here to downvote op and upvote you
---
That's how a Druid plays, period. Sitting there and casting spells to kill things is the equivalent of trying to kill things with your bow as a Warrior. It's just going to cause a lot of headache.

Sadly....came here.
---
I'm going to pass that message along to Tristram and let the Hell Bovines decide your fate...
---
But what would the prey eat?
---
great video, but you missed rogue swirly ball, i miss it so much
---
My guide is starved for holy priests. So I'm hoping that A) since I'm skipping this week but raiding next week I'll get lucky if we roll on it? 
---
Or b) like you say 
---
 But expecting C and maybe have to wait it out a few times which is fine by me.  I understand healing doesn't get too difficult yet but I was lots of +healing for wpvp
---
I‚Äôve always disagreed with this completely. DPS and tanks should have UIs that give them just as much information about the party as healers. It makes me think people are n00bs when they can‚Äôt tell who died, who has buffs, or sometimes even what classes are in the party without asking.
---
And I'm going to eat a juicy steak.
---
I‚Äôm gonna call bullshit on this. I‚Äôve been in MC since week 3, and I‚Äôve seen one BRE, no onslaught girdles, one QSR. There‚Äôs no way a guild funneled all their warrior gear to one guy just so he could PvP.
---
You didn't mentioned private servers at all..how were they able to run things so smoothly then ?
---
So you think that blizzard not willing to spend more money than a free independed group of people is a logical assumption?
---
I‚Äôm not on the no changes train. Also, source for 3x?
---
I feel like you pulled random numbers and are trying to prove a point with it.
---
Healing parses are largely based on the assignment you have and shouldnt be looked at with any real merit.
---
&gt; ... yes there is.
---
Haven't experienced it once even in large battles....
---
Planetside 2
---
&gt; Org alone lags tremendously during peak hours on stalagg. 
---
Never lags for me...
---
theres still stats to calculate the chance of not getting it in x tries which is what he is talking about
---
Imp Blizzard and a lot of stam/int is all you actually need.
---
Private servers don't log every single movement and action.
---
Everyone else responding to this is wrong.
---
It has to do with the modern server architectural paradigm. Back in vanilla wow, Blizzard had a dedicated server (hardware) for each "realm". This is generally how private servers operate as well.
---
The modern era of server architecture leans heavily on virtualization technology. In short and very simple terms, this allowed Blizzard to run MANY realms concurrently on the same hardware. This is extremely advantageous for hardware costs, but unfortunately not for the players. Sharing and layering are software derivatives of hardware virtualization.  These "features" were not possible until Blizzard made the server architecture switch. 
---
With lower player concentration, this isn't really an issue. With higher player concentration, the virtualized servers run into many classical computing issues such as i/o thrashing, cache thrashing, and thread core utilization fighting. 
---
Even though modern hardware is much better than in 2005, Blizzard has outscaled the increase in compute and memory performance with the number of players (and thus computations) per unit of compute power. Simply put, a 2005 server with 2000 players will be more responsive than a 2019 server with 120,000 players (many realms on one servers hardware). 
---
The solution is less virtualization (more physical servers with less virtual servers on each). That is very unlikely for Blizzard to do at this point.
---
It increased flight path speed for me like two months ago, I overtook another player on the flightpath traveling from UC to like Grom'gol
---
Whitemane? Think I saw this guild recruiting the other day
---
When you try to argue against someone and instead you argue for them.

Ouch.

Ah I misunderstood your previous comment then. My condolences. But yea I think stinky hunters can equip it for whatever reason
---
I am basically next in line for the Eye in my guild... or at least I hope I am.
---
I don't even have the gold for the other part, so I wasn't too bent out of shape about it.

---
Because I'm not delusional and worked in investor relations in a fortune company. This was your statement:
---
&gt;they literally do not. Clearly you've never been involved with a company that has shareholders.
---
Which is total bullshit. Shareholders in MANY companies (like mine) can have huge says in the directions/strategy of the company. They'll get rid of a CEO like that if the CEO doesn't play ball. It's not like they are running the company, but they want certain things that a CEO who values his job will get done.
---
All I said was you're making a broad statement. Some major investors are notoriously hands off (Warren Buffett) but many others are activist investors who use the rights and privileges of being a shareholder to the fullest in affecting change within the company.
---
You in your limited experience and knowledge of the financial world don't know what you're talking about. I'm glad your company can run its own thing, but stop making broad statements about all companies ith shareholders, holy shit.
---
I'll post my healing macros when I get home from work buddy. I got you.
---
If you're not using mouse over to heal you are a couple steps behind. Maybe that's the issue.
---
The ZF advocates are absolutely right. That xp bar moves quickly in there.
---
Got two from one node yesterday :X sorry about your luck mate
---
Judging how someone carry on his life is the miserable thing IMO. R14 rewards aren't mandatory to enjoy pvp. So if you're not interested just don't go for it.
---
Yeah.. I have no idea what that is, so that's a negative haha.
---
Is it possible with kui nameplates to show the level in the nameplate? I can't seem to find that option...
---
The only fix is people transferring to lower pop.
---
P2 should be encouragement.
---
Healing- I will do all I can, provided damage isn't so high that I have to cast immediately, to wait till the tank has aggro to start dropping heals.  If the tank cannot hold aggro on a three pull given a generous amount of time....I will still continue to heal until it kills me/the party a couple of times.  But after that I will leave.  I also try not to be mean while still communicating that the reason is their inability to keep aggro.
---
As the tank its rarely if ever a healer that's the issue, its the DPS.  They pull while the healer is still drinking.  They pull extra mobs .5 seconds before the healer drops a heal on me meaning they are now in imminent danger.  They pull extra mobs that, even when I hold aggro in very reasonable gear for the level, it would be unreasonable to expect the healer to keep me alive so we wipe.  Basically if you want to pull roll a tank, otherwise just kill skull then x after they get to me please.  I don't want to sound overly negative or condescending because its a very low percentage of DPS players that are like this.  It just extremely frustrating when the instance is going just fine and then someone decides to "help" or "speed up the run" by wiping the whole party doing something no one asked them to do.
---
This isn't to say I dislike pulling/tanking for high burst AOE spellcleave runs.  The understanding for those is that its on the damage to know when to damage and how to kite.  As the tank I still corral taunt and DPS the mobs to best assist the damage as they do it.  The understanding is that they know I can't hold aggro on all of it all the time and that we have to work together.

I actually know someone who got r14 while fully employed. He played a shit ton, though, and totally neglected his wife and kids. His family never seemed to respect him at all after that and it took a monumental toll on their home life. All told, pretty sad. 
---
He was a great guy, and his kids are friends of mine to this day.
---
I guess my point is that you should try to get r14 even if you work full time!
---
lovely
---
Have two people stay upstairs in the top room where you fight the 4 golems that explode and have three people summon Archaedas - once you see the whirlwinds and he starts waking up - run upstairs. He will follow without adds. Boom!
---
I'm getting one of those anyway, but I MUST TAME THE RARE.
---
I'm pretty sure AT LEAST 50% of classic players would rather want the original route (classic &gt; TBC) than classic+ and keep in mind that a vast majority of people wanting classic+ would play on classic TBC if that's the way Blizzard goes, so.. it's a no-brainer for Blizzard.
---
Also, just to add another thing. TBC was more popular than classic which means there's probably even more players that would return for it than what we saw in classic. Arena, the extremely popular raids a majority of us did back then(a lot of people never raided in classic), heroic instances, gems, better class balance/every class more reliable, etc etc.
---
Again, it's just a no-brainer for Blizzard to go with TBC.
---
I think you need to be more honest when trying to promote your youtube channel.
---
how about Xtraducksauce
---
Pally tanking from level 40-50 suuuucked, there's a lack of upgrades to threat generating skills I think. That was coupled with the fact that my dps friends all outleveled me for those levels.
---
Imo, what you're looking for is a hybrid. 
---
Build into holy for consecrate, that allows you to tank and dps fairly well. 
---
Once you have consecrate you can pretty much dump the rest wherever you want and you can hit 60 without much struggle.
---
Yes! I'm in no rush at all and I've been farming mc since week 2 so I don't say that because I couldn't pvp anyway. I want to enjoy this game properly, not broken meaning we miss out on a good world pvp experience.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm not going to listen to someone who writes at an 8th grade level dude.
---
I was actually just shopping for a Mazda. I went and test drove one a few weeks ago. Are deals good right now due to the lull?
---
Yeah man, I ended up waffling on a bit so I flared it as a discussion. Hope you're not offended.
---
The UD can't be pulled from upstairs, they evade. However the casters in the window CAN be pulled, and it will pull the whole instance as predicted. The gate can also be opened from jumping down and opening it, but even with the gate open the UD still evade.
---
3 months to hit 60 is casual though, i have no idea how you can say it's "not casual at all". 
---
Realm stats are silly because everyone has alts.
---
A ticket is your best bet. I'm 100% certain that you'll be allowed to keep that money. And on the off chance that something happens after that, you'll be able to refer to the ticket and appeal your ban.
---
My guy you are FoS. I have been on a nonlayered realm with no ques for months now and big battles cause lag. Hell 3 guilds getting a ony buff at the same time causes lag lol.
---
It will stay in your mail for 30 days. Ask a GM what to do. Hopefully those 30 days are enough to get a response back. I opened a ticket like a week ago and it said 7 days estimated wait time which was unusual and absurd. 4 days later it changed to 9 days so i just deleted the ticket and moved on with my life
---
Last I checked the Celts didn‚Äôt pilot steampunk tanks and have freeloding tiny mad scientists crashing in their backroom because they‚Äôve irradiated their own home; and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre especially known for their archeological chops compared to anyone else. Dwarves are more than a Celtic stereotype.  Tauren are not more than their Plain indian stereotype. They‚Äôre flat.
---
It‚Äôs like this and like that and like this  and uh
---
I have 600g but don't have a epic yet so really I'm -200g lmao 
---
 But I plan to purchase mats to get to 300 enchant, other than that I have no idea how much it is. 
---
 Buuut I have basically nothing for my true faith vestments and God dam are those mats expensive. I almost have enough felcloth but since I'm new I had nooo idea there was a FOUR DAY CD to make it :/ so I made my first one two days ago and yeah... I have some time lol
---
That's what i said though, they need to just not care if some rando on the internet calls them soft for playing pve.
---
Healing somebody who is in combat will also put you (the healer) in combat. This is true whether the heal is a regular heal or a heal-over-time. More specifically, you will only be put in combat with the mobs that the person you healed is already in combat with. 
---
If you cast a HoT on somebody out of combat, and then they enter combat with a mob, you will not automatically enter combat with that mob, even if the HoT is ticking and actually healing missing health on that person while they are in combat. If you do not enter combat with a mob, then you will not be on their aggro table, meaning they can not target and subsequently attack you.
---
So now the question is, how do you enter combat with a mob (as a healer)? One way is to cast a heal (regular or HoT) on a player already in combat with that mob. You can also obviously attack that mob. Another way (and most important to consider when pre-casting HoT spells) is by getting in close proximity of that mob. The physical distance at which you would enter combat with a mob is much greater in dungeons than it is in the open world, but it is possible to enter combat with a mob using this method in both areas. 
---
The final key to understanding why pre-cast HoT‚Äôs sometimes seem like a bad idea is to understand the aggro table. I said previously that if you do not enter combat with a mob, then you are not in that mob‚Äôs aggro table, and that is true, but, if you pre-cast a HoT on a player, who thereafter does enter combat with a mob, and does receive actual healing from that HoT because they lost some health fighting the mob, then that healing generates aggro under the healer‚Äôs name even though the healer isn‚Äôt on the aggro table/entered combat. However, as soon as the healer does enter combat with the mob (by casting another heal or getting too close to the mob), then that aggro (from the HoT) is immediately given to them (the healer), possibly causing the mobs to immediately switch target to the healer. 
---
So, as a healer, it can be advantageous to pre-cast HoT‚Äôs on your tank because it can allow you to regenerate to full mana before you‚Äôd have to heal again. However, you should make sure that when you do enter combat with any mobs, that you will not have the most aggro on those mobs at that time. You can make sure that this is the case by waiting long enough before casting another heal or walking close to those mobs such that when you do enter combat with those mobs, the tank will have more aggro than you at that time.
---
Yeah that would be nice, wouldn‚Äôt it. :/
---
Retail wow is only ever difficult in two places. When the game first comes out, and Mythic raids. 
---
Those heroic dungeons were difficult when everyone was at 310 ilvl, but you're getting grouped with people that have 40,50,60+ ilvls over the minimum requirement. That's why mythic+ dungeons were introduced. If you want a dungeon challenge start pushing to +15 and above. 
---
The challenge is there, if you want it.
---
One thing I will agree with you on is the "mush" comment. It doesnt feel awfully homogeneous and all mushed together. The game doesnt feel unique or special in anyway and each class feels the same to play as any other class. Specialization and customization is gone.
---
As a priest all I do is spam rank 4 heal. Inneer focus greater heal if for some reason someone needs a big heal. Healing is no harder than spamming Frostbolt or Shadowbolt.
---
And if its African or European

---
"Judging how someone judges someone elses decision to carry on with his life is ACTUALLY the miserable thing IMO." See how dumb that sounds
---
Eh, I can voice my opinion about how miserable and unhealthy that sounds all I want, it truly is. I mean if you have no other commitments in life than grinding THAT much, its miserable to me and the vast majority of people in the world. But hey, to each their own, I'm passing judgement...sue me lol
---
Lol, healers and tanks think they're so important sometimes. What they don't know is sometimes we run instances without them just fine.
---
Idk in classic you can literally farm the gold for the epic mount in a few days depending on your class.  In retail it takes forever to unlock flying because of the reputations
---
It can. Thoug I wouldnt trust him unless he's restoration
---
Hah really so i shouldn't be running with much hit at all ? Is there a math done that can tell how much spell damage is crit/hit worth  and what should i be prioritizing ? For example is 1 % crit = 15 spell damage as i saw somewhere?
---
Is Dark Advisor Pendant  better than Star of mystaria?
---
i love the way you right shit my man, feels good to read. smash some mofos

#"THEN WE DOUBLED IT."

2012 Blizzard
---
I have about half the mats for hide of the wild and a guildy got the pattern last night which he was then stuck in IF making it for everyone lol 
---
 Yeah once I seen the orb price I was like yeahhhhh jma grind that a bit lol I havnt even made it there yet. I've been working in my ony attunement and on Sunday jumped ship to this new and much larger guild since they are very short on holy priests.
---
Right.. so they grew more this quarter than they ever have before. Say they were at 3 million in Q2 and grew 3 million more in Q3. If 3 million was the highest rate of growth of any quarter to date, they‚Äôd still be a far cry from the 12 mill + they were in WotLK.
---
15 year old game, with that level of growth in a quarter is absurd, but there is no way more people are playing this game now than in ~2010.
---
Note: numbers I provided are just examples. Would love to know how many subscribers there are but Blizz would be foolish to release that
---
No it is not a translation error speedrun strays use it to make more room, and allow I'm stuck shortcuts
---
Cats chase stuff they dint want to eat all the time like lasers
---
In most situations Dark Advisor Pendant is better dps. You can use [Zephan's warlock simulation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aKD1SXeQWfoZKHO7zZUnQk3iixzfYF_BqkzQ-V_Pj6U/edit#gid=877497239) to check what is better with the gear you have. :) 
---
The sp to crit/hit values depend a bit on how much sp/crit/hit you already have.
---
Common sense
---
There were just less players on servers back then. There for sure was lag on higher pop servers.
---
I mean I was thinking about the city raids I did back in vanilla with 2 raids groups.
---
Most I got was 2 from one node twice!
---
But.. but... death ray.
---

---
Is that auctioneer telling you the vendor price/auction price/disenchant price? If so, do you have to set it up? I have auctioneer and mine is super scuffed.
---
I would just use sixtyupgrades. It tells you where they come from in a handy table underneath after you've built a set out.
---
If you have no room, hearthstone is ok to toss. Also auto sell grey items addons are great for keeping bags clean.
---
There's Green Leather Armor from lvl 155 leatherworking at lvl 26, but aside from that the quest rewards are horde and rest are random green drops.
---
The next one is STV's Raptor Mastery giving Raptor Hunter Tunic at lvl 28
---
Ya I played on. West coast server so i mine at like 7-9am EST when it is 4-7am for them lol. EPL is empty at those hours
---
I dont know where the source is but 3k is the amount usually said for vanilla server caps and they incrased it to 10k or more for classic ( i dont think they have actuallly said the real amount)
---
So where are these relic coffers? I ran BRD for first time ever last night and got like 4 keys I think and my group had no idea what to do with them or didn't care to elaborate lol
---
&gt; It's not "making excuses" just because you don't like it.
---
no they didnt
---
&gt; "Ignoring performance problems, the performance was way better that blizz's servers."
---
Clearly crashing is not the same as this rubberbanding lagfest.  If you can't see the difference then I can't help you.
---
&gt; Haven't seen it and we raid on tuesday at primetime on herod
---
Then you haven't been engaged in any large scale pvp, simple as that.
---
Because you know how both work behind the scenes. Thank you for your IT knaaawledge.
---
You have evidence of this rampant un-caught cheating, yes?
---
Almost everything you said is wrong.
---
Backstab is a 150% dmg multiplier, so +5 dmg becomes 7.5dmg per backstab, not 12.5.  Ambush is 250%, not 350%.
---
Now, 100 strength = 100ap with equals 7.14 DPS not damage.  To find the damage you multiple the dps increase by the speed of the weapon.  Most daggers a rogue is going to main hand is 1.8 speed, so 7.14 x 1.8 = ~13 dmg.
---
Apparently 5 &gt; 13!
---
also back then when big fights actually happend once in a blue moon, it did lag the servers out and not just in one zone, it could potentially crash the whole server and every zone at once
---
Additionally, no statistical analysis is done. What is our level of significance? If we collect a larger sample size, the p-value must be collected to find if the observed mean of flight times with and without the stick are likely to be within so many standard deviations of the population mean.
---
it's not the hardware though, the hardware is not potato, it's 2019
---
it's the server architecture
---
missing precision and weapon expertise is going to hurt your dps significantly.  you will still do ok damage im sure...but you are going to miss a ton
---
You can't just post hours without context. 2.5 hours average a day over 90 days is casual for an online game. I don't know what more to tell you. 
---
Sorry that you fell behind? 
---
I only hit 60 recently myself, I'm in my 30s with a family and 2 jobs and would consider myself pretty casual. I'm in a casual guild that hasn't cleared MC yet and everyone else is around the same timeline as me and the same life situation.
---
If you are in the 30s-40s right now you are behind the casuals in my opinion and i imagine in blizzards opinion, you can see it in game the groups for lower level stuff have dropped off considerably since a month ago and LFG is always full of pug raids and level 60 content vs a month ago when it was full of leveling dungeons.
---
I'm not going to keep replying because clearly you do not see it the same as I do but i don't understand why you are basing your entire view on hours without context and then data counting alts and name reserves.
---
Do you have evidence that they didn't?
---
Get that Ony attune, the [priest helm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16921/halo-of-transcendence) she drops is insane.
---
If you start the first part of the quest where you have to dress up as a dragon, I would honestly just wait for other people doing the same thing in that cave and then try to group up with them.  That way you will all be on the same step at the same time.
---
I managed to get lucky and join a group doing it and we banged the whole thing out in like an hour.
---
How is it more risky than a guarantee worst game, that TBC is, let alone WOTLK
---
Meh doubt.
---
To fix the servers first you have to fix the players, having them migrate from high pop servers to low pop ones. As it looks the main issue about server lag is how monolithic the structure is, and merely having more players in a single server ( either kalimdor or EK of one specific realm ) can caus eproblems in said server regardless on the place you are in, unless you are in a city ( that looks like it is handled like a server of its own ) or an instance.
---
Most probably they will release P2 in time regardless and let the burned out people transfer realm.
---
I remember seeing an article mentioning how bad laser pointers are for dogs and cats.
---
It has something to do with the sudden appearance of the laser, then its just gone. It would lead to the animals staring at spots on the wall for hours waiting for it to come back.
---
In some extreme cases, they would stop eating and sleeping, in anticipation of the laser.
---
People noticed the dog, or cat, would only eat in the darkness.
---
If i find the article i'll link it.

---
ooh that warlock simulation looks interesting haha and really in details ! Thanks alot for the tip
---
i love this thread reads like something from r/conspiracy lmao
---
Thanks a lot! If you're prioritization for PvP do you ever go Cold blood or Prep? Or do you take both for daggers?
---
Show what? If you're talking about DPS on trash people don't actually log those. There is one for full raid DPS, but there isn't exactly a good indication of how those raids went or how they pulled trash. However, if you want that;
---
Full Raid DPS:
---
Hunter- 650 DPS
---
Feral- 664 DPS
---
The other reason why it's not very accurate is because if they used World Buffs at one point in the raid and no World Buffs at other points in the raid, it would be very skewed based upon how efficient the group cleared and when their World Buffs went away. At that point it would be less about how the class performs and more about how the raid performs.
---
Except 200v200 pvp is still going to happen even if on non-full servers so this is kinda stupid to suggest.
---
U.N. Owen was her? Great music choice
---
He should do solo runs not jump runs.
---
blizzard: use common sense and listen to us on server balancing, since you don't know shit about our architecture.
---
This is all true, HOWEVER, it does seem like the proliferation of reserve runs MAY be reducing the total number of non-reserve runs across the board. SO a player might feel that in vanilla they used to be able to find rend runs (for example) where they were able to roll off on loot and now they feel like there are far fewer of those runs available because the only people who aren‚Äôt joining those reserve runs are the ones who need the same loot which leads to an unbalanced party.

Floating crystals, energy beams, and neon soup is what you might expect from a fel exploded world. I like it for the style and that it fits with how it *should* look, according to lore.

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a better smart person way to do it, but I use an addon that‚Äôs called something like ‚ÄúinFlight Taxi Timer‚Äù that gives me a time for my flights. Don‚Äôt know if it can be set to milliseconds, so maybe best used on long flight times. Seems like it would be better than relying on an outside timer with human error.
---
not layered &lt;&gt; medium pop. I know the neckbeard narrative is layering but that's really not it.
---
Yeah, yeah they seem to.  Almost as if people in technical jobs are more likely to play mmorpgs.... weird huh.  Just because *you* don't understand modern server architecture doesn't mean other people here are as ignorant.
---
I wouldn't mind 1 week of misery for the rank considering what it meant back then. But the 11 weeks before that makes it really fucking miserable.
---
Pushing r12+ made me hate pvp so much I avoided BGs and arenas for 10 years. Gotta appreciate the dedication of people who got it without account sharing and were actually good at pvp. Even if it is a little crazy/stupid to spend that much time on a game in 2005-2006 when there's no real world gain and no Twitch to stream your insanity on. 
---
Now with so much theorycrafting and wintrading etc, combined with #nochanges, it's prolly just a race of who can stay online the most while watching Netflix.
---
This is a problem we ran into.
---
Bob and Jim both want mageblade.
---
Bob's class has tier that is pretty decent
---
Jim's class has tier that is bad
---
If we give bad tier away for free then Jim get's an advantage on mageblade over Bob. If we force Jim's class to pay for their tier then we have to choose who is going to get fucked.

How the fuck are you going to start a fight with a crusader proc already?

I was wrong on my modifiers but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that 5 dmg 100% is greater than 7.14 dmg rarely...
---
Again. Pointing to parses literally means nothing as a healer. Both heals have their proper uses and pointing to your 99 parses is nothing more than bragging over something irrelevant.
---
Also their implementation of SpellQueueWindow on Retail kinda ruined it during Cataclysm, I get so much input lag on Legion/ BfA in 30 man pug raid groups I can‚Äôt even use spells, I don‚Äôt know what they did wrong honestly, but I felt it the most during Legion and BfA... They should have just let Nostalrius people deal with development and they would have had a lot better servers running.
---
Just the fact that they used BfA downgraded client for Classic is a minus, they just should have cooporated with pserver developers I guess.
