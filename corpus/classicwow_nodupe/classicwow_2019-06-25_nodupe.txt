To quote the good book:
---
&gt;Remember, Arthas. We are paladins. Vengeance cannot be a part of what we must do. If we allow our passions to turn to bloodlust, then we will become as vile as the orcs.

---
Wtf is with this pic. Huge white border, an already cropped image where "made with" is cut away. This cropped image has a black border. 
---
Also, the image should be reversed. Meeting 7 units now is the norm, and you survive it.
---
Looks pretty cool, but to be honest it looks more like a blood elf than it does a night elf.
---
So much this. It pays to pull mobs under a tree or in a house so they pile up and are tougher to spot to protect myself for this reason. It's also a nice trail to follow to potentially give me an hk.
---
Those are also the ones that have said multiple times that they'll shut down once classic is out. I don't see why Blizzard would waste time/money if they'll shut down in \~2 months anyway.

You're thinking you'll be able to wrangle up 60+ mongrels that have nothing better to do than target a streamer for a few hours?
---
pserv but backed up with videos from Vanilla footage to make sure what was blizzlike, so to sum it up, the left video is kind of an illustration more than a source
---
Undead Spriest. I had my heart set in shaman because of their utility and I enjoy melee dps. What I found is their mana costs really hamper their utility and they spend most of their time just white hitting. So I went Spriest so I can have some utility and the ability to use it.
---
&gt; The number of videos I have seen with people innocently being put in another realm makes it impossible to police
---
Dude, we have AI that self drives a car.  Do you really have so little faith in the developers at Blizzard, that they can't even put together some pattern recognition software that can identify the difference between someone innocently swapping layers and someone *deliberately* swapping layers to farm black lotus?
---
&gt; If layering is implemented as is, then layer hopping for resources is 100% a non-bannable offense.
---
Obviously they wouldn't ban layer swapping.  They would ban people abusing layer swapping to hold monopolies on items such as black lotus.  Also, they are blizzard, they can ban whoever, for whatever reason they want.
---
Benediction
---
Right now, but they could've have asked them to shut down litteraly a year ago and they would have to shut down since it's France.
---
Very true. 
---
So what is the true goal and where do we draw the line is the main question.
---
A paladin is by design made for a defensive playstyle with juggling buffs and whatnot. Crusader strike was removed because of this philosophy. Some say that was a mistake, and some don't.
---
Is it okay to add more offensive tools to a class that is not meant to have them in the first place? Is one of the question that needs answering, for example. 
---
If it, say, in 3 years it turns out to be so, then your suggestion would certainly fit :)
---
Mob density is greater, respawns are faster. Also speculation xp rates on mob kills are slightly off. I think so but didn’t do any side by side comparison on the test. Have heard otherwise but also heard it is. That’s just direct xp affects. 
---
This also isn’t considering rep gains being off meaning money will be scarcer on classic since you’ll be dumping more on training for longer (not much but every little bit helps).
---
Nothing to say you don’t do more damage on pservers either. It is a reverse engineered code. Every number in there is an estimated guess.
---
Ringing the gong at 50,000 subs!

Anyone know why beta is currently down?

There isn’t any
---
My Talisman of Binding Shard.
---
Classic graphics because it's the first time I'll play Classic, and I want to have the EXPERIENCE
---
This'll purge out the weak with no loyalty to their class. Hunter still remains my fav and I'm okay playing the class on Hard Mode. Playing a buggy class is pretty standard for Hunter anyway. If not patched before launch, it'll be done a few weeks in for the big stuff and by then all the traitors won't want to give up their progress on whatever other class they picked.
---
It isnt just reporting the differences, dude goes as far as saying this minor crap needs to be fixed "right now"
---
Not sure what you’re talking about mop had some of the best class design
---
No because they don’t give keys. It’s assigned by accounts.
---
there are no beta keys, they're tied to your account
---
if you buy or sell an account there's a very high probability that it'd get banned
---
Honestly nobody fucking knows. It's all just speculation.
---
Its true that private servers have always seen decline in pop as time goes on, but its also true that there's several variables now that didn't apply to private servers.
---
We know for example it's either true blizzlike or as close to it as possible, we know a whole server can't be shut down, and we know people progressive realms are a possibility.
---
Bottom line is, nobody knows shit. It's all guesswork. Maybe it's good guesswork, but the point remains it's entirely possible the population won't decline at all and it will steadily grow as it did originally.
---
It's also entirely possible it will crash and burn phrase one. Anyone telling you they know, is talking shit. There's only going to be one certain way to discover the answer.
---
I'd imagine that Classic WoW, like any game launched through the [battle.net](https://battle.net) app, does a mpq check before launch, rendering any mods useless.
---
Demons in winterspring drop the eye too not just kazzak, but still agreed amazing quest
---
Well, we could still see you, so you're wrong
---
I remember a documentary about Columbus using that same tech to sail the seas.
---
I’ve done it once w/o a guild on a priest, it’s pretty expensive but do-able. I don’t think you’ll get to 300 by 60 without help but maybe low 200s. The real, no bullshit currency of WoW is time. Enchanting delays the mount which delays leveling, so the cost is just that.
---
If you have help it’s easier though
---
Is Classic WoW only on YouTube?
---
I gotchu, message me for my Venmo

If we can still see you, we can reapply it

Thank you! Once again, “nothing beats a classic”
---
Looking forward to actually down totems again.
---
That's true. I think because those servers are a huge part why "you think you do, but you don't" changed to "vanilla is a great flavor as well", it would have been very bad PR for Blizzard to shut them down (I mean we are 2 months from classic and there are still \~8k people on those servers on a monday). Them shutting down themselves looks so much better for Blizzard.
---
interesting option, tbh the reason I more want to roll the rogue is the stealth (can farm mara, gank, avoid ganks, and I'm solo reliable compared to war)    
---
    
---
meanwhile war is a god when in grp, first prio for rank14 wpns and ofc can tank = easy gearing up
---
Watching your teammates die as 5 rogues roll up and stunlock u.
---
I didn't notice the title as I watched the embedded version. Yeah I agree, there are more pressing bugs to solve right now. The title comes off as ignorant but the content of the video is good.
---
I have been playing with swedish, Russian, French, Turkish, German, English. Probabaly a handful of others and everyone speaking English. So they can communicate with each other. It doesnt seen to have any impact on how we running.
---
The end of the Warlock mount quest where you get to kill El Pollo Grande. So unexpected. So freaking hilarious. Looking forward to do it again!

Warrior. Did pally orginally but sense I want to raid and wont have the awesome guild that I did back in the day I would have to play holy and not ret. So doing a warrior to tank instead
---
I think the point was he inspired a bunch of people who never thought about the gym into trying it.
---
Was the daggsr blue? Because if not, then no, you didnt speed up your time. That staff is insane at lvl 20. I actively searched for a dagger all the way up until 30 and found nothing that even came close to crescent staff dps.
---
Any green dagger pre 33 is gonna be trash compared to crescent.
---
he said that, while smashing undeads with his huge ass mace... let's be honest here, he know what he had to do and JUST healing was not it. being said that, I fcking love TBC style of ret being dps/support, esp in arenas. but in classic, duh bro, I think I'll go swing my wpns again but this time, using rage or energy instead of mana : )
---
union something
---
Grinding that feels meaningful to me.  I stopped playing when mounts where handed out.
---
You have had this experience? I dont see how since classic is not released till Aug
---
Tauren&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Orcs
---
Just sayin...
---
Is there an FP in felwood in vanilla? That's cool I thought there wasnt
---
*Backporting from Legion was a good decision guys!*
---
Ok?? You make a post just to make fun of people? You’re cool.
---
Either a Orc rogue....or Tauren druid....or both.
---
Maybe they could just use unique names for Warsong 1-5 and obfuscate realm population numbers for the first week? Once the initial surge settles in they won't really move around that much. Hell they may not even need the first week of obfuscation since a lot of people may settle in the 2 week window where character creation is allowed before Aug 27.
---
Reminder that even client-side data can't be trusted from private server clients. See: "Gnomes are too big" fiasco.
---
The bugs just keep piling up. I really doubt they'll get even a quarter of them fixed considering they are so close to the release date.
---
It still amazes me that a couple of unpaid devs could produce a more blizz-like product that Blizz can.
---
Lesser Magic Wand
---
But its green that means its mouldy.
---
No, Rogue with Dark Paradigm. Was hoping to find screenshots I posted years ago.

---
I disagree. But regardless, it doesn't matter. The current animation is objectively wrong.
---
The new animation looks horrendously awful in my opinion. When sprinting in stealth, it just looks like you're holding in a shit.
---
1. Your pet gets consistently killed in BGs, losing happiness and ultimately money as you have to feed him or he leaves you.
---
2. Feign Death wouldn't reliably drop me from combat because somewhere someone is AoEing my pet.
---
3. Pets don't desummon when you mount and wound up training aggro and dying and if I remember correctly dismissing pet reduces happiness which again costs me more money.
---
That's just off the top of my head but pets just were not useful to me in BGs and even World PvP as I've actually tricked multiple players with Feign Death and just not moving till they fuck off. I never understood why Blizz never had them instantly dismiss upon feign as it was pretty fucking obvious I was feigning when my pet was standing next to me like, "Hey bro, get up we still got guys to fight."
---
So no, they were not crucial to me and I was pretty fucking good at stomping face. Now when they started patching hunter pets I began to use him more but he was never the deciding factor in a fight as Marksman.
---
Side questions on OP's how fast would a warrior need to hit level 60 to get a raid spot as the tank?
---
I did tailoring/enchanting on my priest in Vanilla. I remember it taking forever as I was saving money for my epic mount. Although guides didn't really exist back then so you just kinda fumbled through it.
---
I'd recommend going Skinning/Enchanting on your main with a Tailoring/Leatherworking alt that you level to 35. Funnel all the linen and skinning mats to the alt and make greens to send back to your enchanter. And then, assuming you don't want to keep it, you drop skinning after you've leveled your enchanting.
---
Incredible. Keep up the good work!
---
Im nervous about it this go around. World bosses are going to be hyper competitive given how few servers they seem to be planning
---
Ya but they have made a few changes to things that were in vanilla. Not to mention the many graphical differences. Just allowing the new shaders change the look massively.
---
I'm only worried about gameplay anywho.
---
BFA is beautiful in some areas and all that but it sucks. Doesn't matter in the end.
---
The fight club quest for Berserker stance is one of my favorite class quests, it really stood out and made an impression on me.
---
You replied just to insult someone directly. You're cool.
---
I believe Wrath of the Lich King finally delivered on a lot of the class fantasy aspects. TBC was getting there, but had quirks that prevented some stuff from still working properly. Vanilla was obviously a broken mess, but it had its charms.
---
People always remember Wrath in a bad light because of LFD, but I remember Wrath as the true pinnacle of the original class designs, where every class was still a class and talents enhanced them, rather than every class was a spec and the class enhanced them in Cataclysm onwards. 
---
There were no inherently useless specs, every spec was usable in their own intended way, and at this point most specs had gotten over the "spam shadowbolt" type of gameplay style and had actual rotations.
---
I feel like Vanilla, while it is great fun with the slow pace of gameplay and sense of accomplishment with every step, it just falls kind of flat on its nose on the gameplay complexity combined with class fantasy. Eg. if you are a druid, shaman, priest or paladin, you are a healer, nothing else. Or Mages and Warlocks literally spamming 1 button 24/7 for their DPS rotation.
---
My very first character found the hidden path and I decided to jump off the cliff into the water to explore. Got killed by one of those killer ?? Crayfish. Didn’t know how to get back so I deleted my char and rolled a Tauren Hunter who’d be my main for the next 10 years.
---
Blizzard really shot themselves in the foot by deciding to downport Legion instead of properly supporting their 1.12 code.
---
Right now, private servers have actually done a better job at recreating an authentic blizz-like experience than Blizzard. And once classic comes out, they can datamine the shit out of it to fill in the remaining gaps. Then private servers will be effectively perfect, while classic remains a huge mess.
---
It is! :)
---
ToEP or ZHC for me
---
Most won't. The bugs with hunter pet AI exist in the modern game too, and Blizzard has not fixed it there for years. It's extremely unlikely they will fix it for classic.
---
Are you able to try layer hopping?
---
looks like they increased the damage number size to how it was in vanilla (just higher resolution)
---
Bruh. How old are you.
---
Retail feels like 1 giant realm.
---
And that version is called "Production", and calling it "working" might be a stretch.

\----------------
---
**Prologue; the origins**
---
Inspired by the heroic actions of [**Fuel Rats**](https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Rats) group in [**Elite: Dangerous**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Dangerous), &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; exists with the sole purpose of helping others in World of Warcraft: Classic.
---
&gt;Well, what is **Fuel Rats** and what is **Elite: Dangerous**?
---
Elite Dangerous is a space-flight simulation game in which the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy (yes, literally 1:1 scale). Since the Milky Way is mind-bogglingly huge, it is not unusual for space explorers to get carried away and end up stranded somewhere in the void with no fuel. When this happens to you, your only way of getting back is if someone manages to find and reach you to transfer fuel.
---
This is where Fuel Rats come in. These are a group of volunteers who literally go above and beyond to help out their fellow players. There is no in-game system for this, mind you. So each and every member of this selfless organisation help out others through their own means. Their longest rescue mission consisted of five Fuel Rats members finding Commander "Deluvian", a stranded pilot who is 65,788 lightyears from Sol. [**The combined journey took 600 (actual) hours.**](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/18/elite-dangerous-rescue-mission-commander-deluvian/)
---
It would be an understatement to say how devoted these players are just to help out someone else.
---
Our goal is to provide a similar helpful environment in WoW: Classic. With the help of some [**Goblin Rocket Fuel**](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9061/goblin-rocket-fuel), anything is possible.
---
**Our guild ideology**
---
We have one goal; helping out any adventurers we come across. Some will come to us for help, but we should always be open to seeking out others who may be in need. Your level, equipment or the amount of wealth matters not. What matters is a healthy and friendly attitude. We do not have set roles for our members (PvE helper, PvP helper, crafter etc.) because we want you to be exemplary members of the Horde; no matter the activity. We only expect you to be kind to others, guild members and non-guildies alike.
---
As long as you wear the &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; guild tag, you should always remember that you are representing this guild with your actions. Treat others the way you'd want them to treat you; don't ninja loot, don't spam the chat, help out low level players in quests and dungeons, give them food and potions and buffs, and perhaps some 6-8 slotted bags etc.
---
**Guild Events; it's not just helping but also having fun!**
---
Helping out others is not the only reason for our existance; obviously we should be able to enjoy the game on our own as well.Such as;
---
* 5 man dungeon runs (leveling dungeons, max level dungeons)
---
* World PvP
---
* Molten Core / ZG / AQ20 / BWL / Onyxia runs should be doable with enough people. AQ40/Naxx is not on our scope.
---
* Attunement/key runs
---
* Some light Battlegrounds (when they are released)
---
* "Fuel Runs" where we go out to the wild and help random players
---
**Epilogue; closing thoughts**
---
A little background on myself; I've played WoW almost religiously starting from final stages of Vanilla all throughout Wotlk and beginning of MoP. I did almost everything aside from AQ40/Naxx and PvP ranking. Much like many returning players, this time around I'm too old/busy to have a similar playstyle. Instead I just want to kick back with some friends, and enjoy mainly the social aspect of WoW. I will most likely be tanking 5-mans and offering free food/portals/enchant services on a mage alt as well.
---
The reason I wanted to start this guild is to provide a friendly environment. If I can make one person happy, that's a good day for me. I'm also starting this guild on (Oceanic) PvP server so with some luck I can take revenge on that level 55 gnome rogue who is harrassing those poor level 30's.
---
Finally, I'm writing a blog [**here**](http://goblinrocketfuelrats.wordpress.com) about the adventures of our guild written from my perspective. It's story-driven, somewhat RP-ish, but doesn't take itself too seriously. I already have few stories from the open Stress Test, and once Classic launches the stories there will be not just mine but all guild members. If you like the idea of having a little wow-diary of your leveling (mis)adventures and enjoy looking back on them, join us now :-)
---

---
Thanks for your time.
---
I leveled in the 1.0-1.2 range and leveling dungeons were always really easy when you had a competent group. The only thing "hard" about them were the bugs that cause you to aggro groups through walls.
---
They will be even easier with 1.12 talents on everyone, but they were always easy.
---
Pack it up folks, we can just chill! This dude anticipates it won't be a problem!
---
I would agree. Unfortunately.
---
“I can’t wait for all those people to quit this video game”
---
Don’t act like you’re not saying that when you are. 
---
But hey, you think the community that trashed classic is also going to play it for some reason so I shouldn’t think you would use logic.
---
Trisifal Glades -&gt; Silverpine Forest -&gt; Hillsbrad Foothills -&gt; Arathi High Lands -&gt; Hinterlands + Searing Gorge -&gt; Western Plaguelands + Eastern Plaguelands + Burning Steppes
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The above is what I'm going through, along with dungeons for a change of pace every now and then. Out of those I'd say I'm most excited for Searing Gorge the most tbh.
---
Did they announce anything? Seems like a reach if you just saw some people.
---
Alliance probably have bigger numbers simply because horde races are all ugly.
---
It wasn't until blood elves in BC that the numbers evened out.
---
You'll be fine. Maybe your play schedule will look different than it did (OK, it will), but your playtime will still be yours. 
---
I have known lots of new parents in WoW-- they have to keep their head together too.
---
Detheroc just kept giving. Some of the best drama. Some of the best players in the world. Some of the best guilds at the time. So happy to have started back in Vanilla on Detheroc.
---
&gt;Rogue it doesn't matter. Vanish early and you never worry about catching up in threat. I'd take a shaman over paladin. 
---
Oh everyone wants their personal numbers to be high, WF was awesome after all.  
---
Its just that over a whole 40 person raid group the numbers add up very differently.  3 resto shaman gives you a tank shaman, a healer shaman, and a melee group shaman.  Its 15 people getting the buffs (at most! totems have range and don't stick around when the shaman dies).  3 pallies give the whole raid Kings/Salv/Might-or-Wisdom, the whole raid has a huge amount of breathing room when it comes to threat and all the healers and dps get more stats and stuff that doesn't depend on any one person being alive and in range.  You get all of this while also having better individual group comp:  melee groups work much better as 5 pure dps buffing each other with True Shot Aura/Battle Shout/blessings than a using just 4 pure dps with a shaman healer

---
I had given elitistjerks up for gone, I’m probably going to get lost in that archive until 08/13. I’ll be looking like Khadgar in a candy store.
---
The new graphics options are at least optional, and I think most people would rather use the original style anyway. In regards to rogue stealth, I significantly prefer the original animation, and I never even played a rogue in vanilla. It's enough of a problem to ruin the game when you spend so much time in stealth.
---
H y p e
---
Lets hope. I dont understand why last 3 people in orgrimmar had to be separeted into 3 layers.
---
What type of cookie?
---
he was NOT smashing undead when he said that. People always forget the second part of the quote:
---
* Now, if you're feeling up to it. I want you to lead the attack. I'll remain here and ensure that none of the loathsome beasts threaten the camp.
---
He was mindlessly slaughtering orcs. Hypocrite
---
There were approx. 30 people. The layers have been as small as 3 and 4 people apiece up until now. Also we tested it with invites a bunch and no one got layered out. 
---
Although they just queued another restart so...
---
Oh no let's scrap the whole thing!
---
Haha cheers.
---
The average time to 60 in Vanilla was around 240 hours.
---
Yes we did...didn't work with like 10 different people inviting me. They just queued another reboot though
---
ppl don't even have to abuse it for it to screw up economy, if theres 5 layers 5 times as many lotus etc will spawn, doesn't matter who picks it. 
---
That said, I still think people are overreacting, economy for certain things might be rough for a month or two, but the game will last for over a year so it's not that big of a deal.
---

---
Skeletons need to be fixed asap.
---
\-Karma = brain cells. I love how the system works here.
---
you forgot the second half of that quote. Totally takes the nobleness out of it
---
Nice! I don't know how many times I tried for the Deathcharger.
---
meme sin for the ragecomic hair
---
&gt; at any point you can get grouped with someone from realms that aren’t native English speakers
---
I agree with all points but this. I get that the language barrier can be difficult, but no one talks in dungeons anyway, so...
---
For anyone wondering this person is absolutely not exaggerating in the tiniest bit. It was really that aggressive
---
IO would never have been able to pull this off on Sargeras. Smart of them to take the free transfer to an unpopulated realm. They were p good at zerging azuregos with three raids though
---
Happens to the best of us sometimes man, we're all gunna make it
---
It could have been a bug or they were testing it.
---
Pretty awesome that you had one!
---
My guild had enough druids in it that we called it the "warriors vanish" when we would inevitably pull agro and died.
---
\-Has a few minor visual bugs
---
\-Declares that private servers are (or will be) perfect and better than official classic
---
Never change, reddit.
---
I wonder where Fatphil (Phatphil) from Gul’dan US is these days.
---
Sounds promising, keep trying in case something changes with the server restart!
---
Then you die because you're receiving 50% less healing for 25 seconds as a Warrior since you used blood fury.
---
There are no real downsides to playing warrior. 
---
Your 'slow' leveling allows you to spend more time flexing in front of other pleb classes who weren't willing to go through a good struggle. 
---
Warriors unite.
---
If you want to be a top tier DPS character... yeah, roll a dedicated DPS class instead of a Hybrid.
---
Personally, I enjoy being able to play and fill multiple rolls and the versatility that comes with that, so I stick to the hybrid classes.
---
My ashbringer
---
&gt; if theres 5 layers 5 times as many lotus etc will spawn, doesn't matter who picks it.
---
More layers means more people too, supply goes up, but so does demand. And yea, probably not at the same rate, but enough to *devastate* the economy like you an others say?  As long as it's gone ASAP then everything will be fine.  People are definitely overreacting.
---
I love the class specific bluffs you can give out to people. It's a tragedy that how a retail paladin 
---
has basically none of the  buffs they had in classic
---
Yeah when I got it was pure rng that my faction much less my raid got the tag
---
A dev buys it 1 minute later, making you the richest player in classic for several days
---
Warstomp an execute before a heal, also can take someone out of vanish with ws.
---
Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal, obviously.
---
You are going to be tanking whether you want to or not.
---
Shadow priests don’t do much better in the mana efficiency category.
---
This is exactly why I made this thread:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3y1f4/backporting_from_legion_was_a_bad_decision_heres/
---
Interesting, curious if they are testing different solutions out.
---
Yea definitely true. I did it on pservers but don't think I'll risk it in classic.
---
It's a lot more than just a few visual bugs. This is literally one post.
---
Wow!
---
Handy. There is only one person on that list I don’t mind being on the same server as.
---
&gt; &lt;Rapid Evolution&gt; OCE - Horde - PvP - Committed Casual 
---
**Rapid Evolution** was an original hardcore vanilla PvP and raiding guild on Frostmourne(A) that is making a comeback for Classic WoW, though this time as **Horde**.
---
The core of the guild are all vanilla veterans and would love to find some old vanilla friends, though we welcome all that wish to join us.  As 14 years has passed since RE first grinded through the PvP ranks and raid content, we expect Classic to be a little bit more casual and relaxed. We harbour no dreams of server domination but we will be pushing through all that classic has to offer and reliving the vanilla experience.
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
We will be raiding 2 nights per week,   Monday and Thursday evening 8pm - 11pm AEST.   As we will only be raiding 2 nights a week we plan to pack as much action with a little downtime as possible so we will expect those that wish to raid to be well prepared and reliable. Note: we will be using EPGP loot distribution.
---
**Recruitment**
---
We currently have no class restrictions or any strict requirements, welcoming everyone - We will continue to build our numbers once classic has launched to ensure that everyone has a fun and rewarding leveling experience with plenty of guildies to call upon for grouping and dungeons. If you have goals of raiding you will get your opportunity with us, as preparation and reliability will be rewarded.  
---
While we don't expect to participate in the Grand Marshall grind this time around we all love it and will be PvPing regularly, particularly large scale world PvP!
---
Come, Join our discord and introduce yourself!  [https://discord.gg/wk4Tzrk](https://discord.gg/wk4Tzrk)
---
I already explained elsewhere precisely why that path does not work unless folks want to grind.  If all you have to offer is reiterating that your path works without any explanation as to why, then I thank you for your minimal contribution.
---
The reality is I've tested the route you said.  That's how I know it doesn't work.  I also had the patience to look up and catalog every single Alliance quest available for leveling to evaluate what I think will be the optimal pathing for when Classic is released.  I've been testing it ever since beta dropped and I was lucky enough to get access.  Folks who have been doing this for far longer than I have agree that you'll cover more in-game content (via questing) and level faster if you jump between zones.  If you want to do it your way, you will need to either spend a lot of time outside the game building up rested xp, or you will need to grind, or both.  There's nothing wrong with playing the game that way, but that's what it will take.  And doing the same thing Horde side would similarly relieve the need to move between zones.  
---
As for your complaint that you can't finish a zone at the level bracket you start it (without grinding), Duskwood begins at L20 and it ends at 35.  If you think you can complete Duskwood at the level bracket it starts without grinding, you're gonna have a bad time.  
---
As for needing patience to level, that's both true and not true.  I'll be leveling pretty quickly on release (shooting for 60 before the weekend hits).  That will require a lot of things over the first few days of release, but not really patience.  What does require patience is spending about 10 times the amount of time researching, planning, and practicing how to level as I spend doing it.  It's how I've hit server first before.  
---
In my experience, what requires the most patience is leveling at a pace that leaves you behind your friends and guild mates, waiting to catch up before you can play this social game in the manner you most enjoy.  
---
Oh, and fishing.  That requires a lot of patience too.  I like fishing.
---
I had this experience twelve years ago and then I stopped playing (for other reasons).
---
Do you have any idea why things would be different this time around?
---
Rhok'Delar for sure.
---
Human side steps and pokes Tauren in the face.
---
I remembet Obamallama
---
Theyre probably testing the layer collapsing system when phase 2 comes out like they said they would do when they want to bring the entire server onto the same layer
---
I am sure layering will remain even into phase 2.  I am sure they have ideas on how to handle the world boss situation and are just playing it off. 
---
Forcing that many people to server transfer would just be the death of the game.
---
I agree that the utility many classes have in classic is refreshing, but the amount of time spent auto attacking as a Paladin... Leaves something to be desired.
---
I remember there being a way to skip the bridge that they ended up "fixing" halfway through vanilla?  Or maybe we are talking about different back doors?
---
Dude, Everytime a wow upgrade comes out people are on it like stink on shit. Jump to max level within 2 weeks. Don't even enjoy it.
---
Oh he definitely smashed in heads, he smashed in a lot of heads. But he found a balance and if Arthas was able to find the balance like he told him we wouldn't have to visit a tomb in the Eastern Plaguelands.
---
And it's free
---
&gt;More pvpers tend to pick horde in general due to racials.
---
Wouldn't more PvPers pick the side with the better class if they plan on doing any type of organized pvp? Classes have a way bigger impact than racials.
---
&gt;Maybe 1 out of 50 pallies in a pug will heal, with most being ret, one of the worst specs in the game. 
---
Recent poll said [66%](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4wz4u/distribution_of_race_and_class_according_to/ej9scq9/) of the Paladins were going Holy. Holy Paladin and Holy Priest are the two best healers in the game.
---
As a hunter I found it pretty easy, but I leveled it after I had tier 2 gear and could quickly solo instances for greens/blues.
---
It's simply masochistic to do it while leveling.
---
       Hello everyone. I would like to introduce "Bourbon Raiders." We are a casual family-oriented guild recruiting for classic. 
---
       Our Goal: Provide a community for families to play classic. Our target audience are adults who work 50+ hours a week, have kids, or are too busy with real life responsibilities to join a hardcore guild.
---
         We will complete all end game content, both PvP and PvE, but at our own pace. So, whatever your goals are in Classic, we would be happy to help you achieve those goals.
---
       Faction: Horde
---
       Server: PvP, CST or EST.
---
       Raid times: Friday and Saturday, 8pm to 12am  CST
---
      Thank you for considering us.
---
What class levels slower than warrior?
---
Well, will see what you say when layering shitshow goes live.
---
On *beta*? GTFO!
---
Also, potions should no longer be once per fight, so you can pot however many times in the fight based on the cooldown (2 minutes I think? It's been a while, could be wrong).
---
Thankfully the most broken exploits (dupes, teleports, etc.) should be avoided by the fact that it's the modern engine. Might end up with some things like the invincible priests (thanks to Spirit of Redemption), though.
---
im gonna talk about pvp and keep it simple
---
Worst part about mage is youre always either running away or spamming poly 
---
Worst part about rogue is determining who to blow your CDs on without wasting them and getting caught without CDs. also very gear dependant and EVERYONE wants a 1h
---
Making one with group of IRL friends and people we've met over the years playing private servers and other various games. Already have a core of 20-25 people on board. Figure we fill in the rest along the way while meeting other cool people in dungeons and such. Can't wait!
---
That’s longer than I remember ha
---
Sent you a message. Look forward to hearing from you.
---
I was a hunter in vanilla but im going paladin this time, i dont know if i should go dwarf or human tho.
---
Amazing vid, ty
---
Being an actual hybrid.  Druids haven't been a hybrid class in nearly a decade.  I rolled a druid on the BfA servers and felt so neutered. I'd agree with another poster on MoP being some of the best class design, but even then druids were spec specific.  The split of Feral Combat into cat and bear specific specs irked me.
---
Vanilla private servers have never fixed the players teleporting/rubberbanding or the chain pull/aggro linked mechanics and I don't  think they'll ever fix this.
---
More pvpers tend to pick the side with pvp racials. It is also worth considering how you will be in pug pvp or caught on your own.
---
And how many of those pallies will be joining bgs as holy to heal random people? In pugs people tend to think more about themselves so are more likely to pick a fun spec. This is only from personal experience, but most pug pallies I ever saw were ret. The pallies I knew would only want to heal in organized groups
---
Well if you were doing it post 2.3 tbc it was less exp required by ~20%
---
Takes most people a few months
---
Technically the *old* animation was the bug. Animations back in vanilla didn't properly have their speed adjusted to match your character's movement speed. In the new engine they do. This same effect applies (under certain conditions) to mobs that get slowed by effects like Frost Bolt.
---
Whether or not they should replicate the old behaviour is a different matter though. I think they should, but it's purely graphical so I don't really care either way.
---
I'm hoping to find a high pop pvp server that doesn't have a streamer on it. Twitch is kind of cancer
---
I believe he was talking about player skeletons, and not NPC corpse despawn time.
---
Blizz is going to tweak it till it's practically invisible. That means you will occasionally run into light crowding but not overcrowding.
---
Go skinning/enchanting, you can build up both while leveling, without having to go out of your way for or wait on nodes. Plus you can make good money later on from all you have collected. Also when you get rich, you can keep enchanting and drop skinning for something like engineering.
---
Holy strike and Crusader strike... what the Paladin could have been.
---
Well, it was at least 110,000 hours ago, so that makes sense.
---
Nice fake video
---
A bunch of spell effects are different too and this is not optional. They had to recreate them from scratch because the old spell effects were incompatible with the new client iirc.
---
its just that feral and balance have to put way too much effort into consumables for raids. i dont want to do that so i let off of the feral dream.
---
I'm talking about wall jumping to enter from behind the stables
---
What advantage?
---
lol such a douchey comment but i admit i laughed
---
“Advantage”
---
Not saying private servers will be the same but it's a mix match of everyone and everyone speaks English just fine with each other. And they play the game together and stick around. So it must be just fine
---
Warrior T3 honestly rivals it IMO.
---
Skeletons is a HUGE deal. Some of the most fun I had in vanilla was wandering into areas of intense PvP and seeing the ground covered in bones. The mind reels at the amount of corpse runs involved. Especially going in to Blackrock mountain for the first time, it made the world feel real and dangerous.
---
Seconded
---
All things considered the animation data is virtually guaranteed to be accurate.
---
What makes them better at farming gold?
---
it's not mine, just sharing to get it fixed!
---
Her monitor will be a couple inches higher, obviously.
---
can anyone share guides for Holy Paladin PvP (twinking and/or 60)?
---
Ready for my tinfoil hat here.
---
Beta for classic doesn’t have layering implemented. They have only had it on stress tests. Beta has sharding/crz. It would explain alpha characters popping up on the pvp beta realm, and also explain the seemingly small layers compared to the stress tests (minus test realm 3).
---
Yea, I try to take certain games slower, I did my hardcore raiding, now it's time to smell the roses and grief lowbies
---
Im going to level a Pally alt because I love Prot spec. Even if its just to farm 5-mans like Strat.
---
Lol here we go
---
I played a Hunter during Vanilla, then played a druid in TBC - Wrath, I played a Rogue on a few private servers over the last few years and I won't ever look back. 
---
There is something so great about being able to stealth and move around knowing nobody can see you unless you really mess up. You can go sap people for fun to mess with them, distract them while they are trying to quest, literally stand right next to them while they are killing a mob and just 1/4 hp gank them, start a fight and when the tides turn the opposite way just blind them and vanish into thin air. Making sure you decide the rules of engagement is so much fun in open world PvP.
---
They did do that on the last test at the end...
---
I am pretty sure alliance is gonna have a hard time down the line as majority of people will be horde. The alliance population will decline going forward.
---
I love playing druid so much, but unfortunately I'm rerolling for classic. Too much sad info coming out about them.
---
GL to all you guys still going strong!
---
You are probably looking at about 10 days played at a reasonable pace for an average leveling class.  
---
The fastest guys in the world on Hunters can do it in like 4 but that isn't typical.
---
Most of your mount gold will be gone. I'm waiting until 60 to level enchanting.
---
If I get the chance to snake a R14 title from a collusion-crew I am going to do it. No premades after R14 cause i’m blacklisted? dealio.
---
I can't wait to play in late August!
---
Just chiming in to say the QuestHelper addon used to have an option to display Flight Times and it was actually accurate, not like the current addons that calculate ETA by using distance from destination and movement speed (which varies as you twist and turn on FPs).
---
"Uhhh... Hello?" - Jesus
---
Raiding is the bomb but getting raid gear drops with groups is a pain in the ass.
---
In all seriousness tho, keep up the good work Omar. Thanks for all your hard work and godly trolls.
---
Night Elf Warrior. I healed all through vanilla on an Undead Priest, gonna switch it up this time.
---
My character is an Orc Tank named Tankybooty.
---
stay the hell away from me.
---
Stop being delusional. Private servers have several orders of magnitude more bugs than even the current Classic beta does. Honestly this is such a tired topic and the list is so long that I'm not even going to bother writing out the usual list of examples I do for this. Pservers can't even get reputation rewards correct (they're literally 250% what they should be). Hell, half the "bugs" in Classic are just private server fanboys such as yourself who started playing the game on Nostalrius and think that Nostcore is even close to being authentic.
---
Not to even mention the fact that to actually make the server technology authentic and comparably functional the emulators would basically have to be rewritten from scratch because of the fundamentally poor design that currently ails them.

*cries in Anathema* oh wait...

WotlK tho?
---
Fastest way to an ignore is to be a Paladin who refuses to switch from Ret or a Warrior that won’t tank IMO.
---
I remember mass pulling with a Prot paladin and also a demon warlock in wotlk. I think I also did something similar in cata with a warrior, revenge+victory rush was op and actually forced you to pull more if you wanted to play without downtime.
---
DEoI.
---
I recently watched a hunter kite tank Princess Theradras at level 40. Hunters are awful in the hands of a poor player, but borderline overpowered in the hands of a skilled player.
---
Max with an increased UI scale. I've got a 4k monitor and classic looked so nice in the test with the graphics cranked up.
---
LOL - i’d actually put one in the raid but the rule is he can’t attack the boss. He can only /dance and emote in the back. 
---
He will be the raids mascot.

The enormous 23-quest 4-chain series in the Blasted Lands from the Fallen Hero of the Horde, culminating in  [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3628](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3628) where you (and your party) face down the demon lord.  The quest chains led you all over the world - Blasted Lands, Swamp of Sorrows, Azshara and Stranglethorn Vale, rewarding *several* (admittedly bad) trinkets, as well as a 16-slot bag.
---
One of the best roleplaying quests in the game.
---
jeg så på telefon, så fikk ikke helt med meg hvor stor den var. ja er nok en 1,5 ja :)
---
If you're playing casually (not speedleveling with optimal pathings, avoiding bad quest chains, not gathering etc) with the goal to reach level 60 quickly, it will probably take most people 7-10 days to reach level 60. 
---
This is if this isn't your first rodeo and you have experience with the game. If you account for players who are brand new and also not rushing to 60, the average is probably much longer.
---
he's beautiful
---
That’s hilarious!, are you gonna roll what you originally planned?
---
Epic quest. Never got around to it on my hunter alt.
---
Every horde 40 man wants 5-6 shamans. All of which are healing. Elemental dps and enhancement dps is ducking garbage.
---
Me too brother
---
there was a reason people legit feared murlocs and their warcry.
---
Are these only on humans or all races?
---
a quest where a loving husband called mankrik is looking for his wife in the barrens, who's missing in action. you must find her.
---
all races!
---
Don't forget the others that are part of the team
---
Thinking everyone is able/should be able to speak english is bigoted.
---
Repeating again until these threads stop:
---
Implement a top-layer that contains the ~1000 highest level players. They cannot switch to a different layer.
---
I did a baaad thing last week during the stress test. I had my race and class all picked out. Human paladin and a side of nelf rogue. I had originally rolled a tauren shaman (in TBC) and raided with him through Wrath.
---
But I really wanted to see Duskwood, Lakeshire and Wetlands as they used to be pre-Cataclysm. Something I never really got to experience back then. Switching to Alliance for Classic seemed the logical thing to do. I created my proto-characters and got them to level 10. Figured out where the pain points were and some alternative approaches.
---
With some time left in the testI figured I would try a troll shaman, to see if the magic was still there.
---
And that's why I'll be rolling troll shaman for Classic.
---
I’ve been playing the beta nonstop and have noticed very, very few differences or bugs. Tiny blips like these will in no way affect your classic experience. Trust me, Blizzard has recreated the game you want. You have nothing to worry about.
---
Whats the point of a brand new account. Then you have to pay 2 subs
---
And this is just the level up process.
---
Lets talk about raiding and gear up your character.  Once you do finally hit 60 you have all this worthless gear, because if you want to tank a raid you need to get to the +Defense min to negate crits, and if you want to DPS then you need +Hit to transition to (much higher) fury dps.   
---
The thing is though, that everybody needs a tank for their 5 man, but no raid wants you to tank for their raid.  To be a raid tank, you are almost the core of your guild, 39 people depend on you to show up every week and ready to go.  
---
So now you're either protection spec and shitty at grinding fast or PVP and not wanted for raids, or you are DPS and no one wants you in their 5man (least of all the tank they already have, who is a warrior, and definitely wants all the same gear  as you).
---
And then you do eventually get geared up, and land a raid spot as a dps, but now you are competing with the infinite numbers of rogues and hunters for gear as your set gear is essentially tank only, but then one day the main tank cant make it so now you are expected to fill in, but you aren't specced right and your gear isn't nearly as good and you get gibbed when the main tank wouldn't have and healers notice and gossip like they do and now people are upset at you and its just a lot of hassle when you could just roll a mage and keep the same frost spec for a couple years...
---
Nah everyone starts as a novice at level one but retail wow players are like internet kids, they learn everything faster and do everything better.
---
&gt;It wont take long for them to figure out that this 60+ person group is there solely for them, and they'll call in their fanboy army over stream to help them.
---
They'll just leave and go do something else, its what they do on beta. There was one big skirmish in Arathi Basin between Asmongold and the Horde army. 
---
After that he just started leaving. Eventually people stop caring about getting a raid together to go annoy some guy, because that guy is going to go do something else. A BG or a dungeon where you can't mess with him.
---
Some quests were added. Mudsprocket as well. That's all I remember.
---
Is it just me or is the camera fov wider in Classic compared to vanilla?
---
Yup all the new animations looks so dumb and no moonwalk is just sad af
---
Unless they don’t plan on playing their old account?
---
I am bilingual, I just don’t speak Portuguese... it also wouldn’t be a problem if half the time the people weren’t completely oblivious to what was going on. They end up getting carried through and gearing up a long side everyone else, it’s such a bad design. Also when I rank dungeons I am very talkative with my group, especially if it seems like they’re not good/ new.
---
You know that there is no connection between your retail and classic account, right?
---
I don't think that they're linked in any practical way.
---
I cant see a reason to play current wow anymore with classic, so I would just gift my $300 balance to my new account.
---
My biggest fear is that blizzard might have created a bigger issue than the one they were trying to solve and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if that was the case , they've been punching their own faces for years.
---
I'm not worried about the economy or what not, that problem can be easily resolves by limiting the amount of times a person can hop within a set duration of time ( for example 2-3 times every 10 mins tops ).
---
The real issue is far worse than people realize though, on a regular server you have a specific amount of players, regardless of whether the server is overpopulated or not you can always tell who plays on the server because it's always the same people.
---
But that's not the case with layering, I'm not sure why people don't realize it but blizzard is condensing all the servers it should've opened into as few as they can.
---
If let's say 100k players are funneled into a single super server with layering, said server ends up with dozens of layers, it's not unrealistic to assume that ,even if you do not change layers at all from the moment you log on until you log off , you might never see the same players again for weeks or months depending on the super server size.
---
You could end up meeting some players again, but the overall population of a layer will always be jumbled up, you will never find the exact same layer combination of players ever, as everyday you are placed in a random layer and so is everyone else.
---
So you see, I'm worried this will shatter the community aspect of vanilla.
---
What kind of sad info? Am planning druid myself
---
Repeating again until it becomes popular:
---
Implement a top-layer that contains the ~1000 highest level characters. They cannot move to a different layer.
---
Am I missing something? The 2nd one looks way better. The first one looks like he’s gliding along the ground
---
It was very similar but some class balancing was brought in, + additional spells which made more specs viable e.g paladins could taunt which made them a viable tank. 
---
There were some quests added, but a lot of quests were brought in throughout vanilla as it was, since we're getting patch 1.12 there will be plenty of quests.  If you've ever played on a private server which starts out from patch 1.1 there are few quests once you get into the higher levels.
---
I downloaded QuestHelper and found the data but it's serialized and I don't lua. If someone can be bothered, have a look in "QHData-base\static_1.lua:14"
---
I recovered my account with my first 60 on it... gonna be using that one for my main.
---
walking into BRM with piles of skeletons everywhere you knew if sh!t was going down
---
Flurry axe for my fury warrior
---
Depends what you want to do. Bear is maaaaaybe viable tank, but you are most likely a heal bot with no Rez other than battle Rez. Moonkin is not really viable at all.
---
It's pretty rough, I leveled it in TBC, which I'm sure was a bit easier but overall a similar experience and it took a ton of mats. 
---
I want to enchant in vanilla on my first toon but I think I'm going to level tailoring and herbalism.  Once I've got my epic mount and a bank full of herbs and I'll likely switch to enchanting.
---
True, I'm not suggesting OP is all wrong. For the shuffle animation it should be extremely easy to find some vanilla-era footage.
---
You will easily have to disenchant over 80g worth of greens (vendor price) just to get to 275 enchanting. It's all gambling. It doesn't feel like a big deal until you start disenchanting greens that vendor for 50s but only get one dream dust from it. Then you start to question your life choices.
---
Yeah. You just wear whatever has the best stats. Druids wear cloth sometimes, too. Hunters and dps warriors might wear leather. If you're not tanking or offtanking, stats are more important than some armor.
---
But it does get silly when 90% of PvE paladins are wearing that same damn teal dress.
---
My thought is:
---
* Any friendly or sanctuary zone (don't think the latter exists in classic)
---
* On a gryphon
---
* When summoned by a meeting stone
---
Trying to avoid things like:
---
* Ducking into a nearby inn to skip layers
---
* Getting summoned 3 feet away to skip layers
---
It needs to have some sort of a tradeoff, be it time, distance, convenience, so it's not something you can do at the drop of a hat.
---
If you think of it as a downside, competition. It will likely be one of the most populated classes.
---
Slow leveling, swap specs constantly, lose most 1v1s unless you have every cooldown or opponent sucks or you have way more gear, not taken in premade bgs, decent at best in big group world pvp.
---
Ummm... your pretty bad from range... about it
---
Yep, I remember leveling a little with a warrior in Cata, and just pulling like 8 mobs, killing them 1 at a time and healing myself a ton with Victory Rush.
---
WOTLK definitely nerfed world content a good deal, but Cata was the expac where everything just went to shit and outdoor solo content became a complete joke.
---
You have no utility for other players, that is really the biggest downside. You have things that affect the outcome of a battle, sure; poisons, kicking, sap.
---
But nothing that makes anyone thrilled to have you around. No portals, no food/water, no buffs, etc. You bring death.
---
Did it ever occur to you that it was retail fans burying threads like the shield slam buff? I do not recall any gatekeeping about who could become a member of this sub.
---
Not really, warriors, mages, shamans, pally and probably lock will be more popular.
---
I played the hell out of Vanilla, have played on private servers, and I’m currently playing the beta. I’ve encountered very, very few beta bugs, and none have impeded my gaming experience in the slightest. Classic feels exactly like Vanilla with a stable frame rate, even during large scale PvP. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised, and feel at home in no time.
---
Nothing major changed between 1.12 and tbc release. You can find the exact changes in the patch notes on wowwiki. 
---
The difference between the factions will be significant, but it's still the same game you are going to be playing. The biggest things are probably shaman instead of paladin, which is quite significant, as well as different cities and quests I guess.
---
Talents are the biggest difference if you played at tbc launch.
---
If you played after 2.3 there were a lot more changes. Dungeon loot revamp, xp reduction, and no more elite mobs in the open world just to name a few.
---
Boss fights are also much easier in classic pretty much across the board because most of the difficulty came from the shortcomings of class design.
---
Honestly, the same can be said of levelling and dungeons in general. So much of the difficulty comes from the fact that you just have less tools at your disposal. Hunters are a good example. You have mana, a minimum range, auto shot being interrupted by abilities/movement, skills not scaling with your best stats, traps being out-of-combat only, etc. On live you get a ranged attack right from level 1, Concussive Shot at level 4, Disengage at level 8, and Kill Command at level 10. That's less abilities than the same level of Classic, but it's more *capability*. It's also fully mobile with no melee restriction. It's hard to replicate vanilla-level difficulty with classes that are more well-rounded and I'm not sure if gutting the classes to achieve that is something many players would want to see.
---
Yes. That way I don't have to delete all my bnet contacts.
---
&gt;noticed very, very few differences or bugs
---
Then you have not played Vanilla, because I played the stress test only to level 10 and I've noticed ~15 inconsistencies 
---
&gt;Tiny blips like these will in no way affect your classic experience.
---
Yes it will, I wanna play an authentic Vanilla experience and not some Vanilla/retail hybrid. Every little detail matters because it all adds up in the big picture.
---
&gt;Reason is hamstring kiting doesn't work with melee leeway. You can't avoid mob damage in the same way by strafing in and out of reach.
---
Why not? It doesn't matter what the effective melee range is as long you are staying at the edge of it and strafing constantly.
---
Tauren Shaman. Played Hunter in vanilla and I was successful as Paladin from TBC to MoP. I still want to heal but I dont want to play Alliance.
---
I'm either going mage or priest.
---
If I'm going to be a healer, it would be nice to have a full toolbox of healing spells. If I'm going to be dps, it would be nice to actually get invited to raids.
---
Mages and warriors, probably. Lock, very unlikely. Shamans and paladins will be the least popular seeing as they are faction locked.
---
Eh, that's not the best evidence that the clients themselves are unreliable sources. Your character size can be determined by spells or other 'server-side' things, which are imperfectly emulated on private servers. This means that the discrepancy in size can be explained by poor server emulation, not client errors.
---
Troll hunters. Those racial passives are extremely good for leveling.
---
Rogues have always been a popular class, especially on PvP servers. Warriors and Mages are super popular too, but Shaman and Paladin aren't up there with them.
---
I'd take whatever census or beta data you have with a grain of salt.
---
In TBC:
---
* Almost every class saw major talent revamps, spell changes, and spell additions. There's just too many to list but they were significant across the board.
---
* A crude LFG tool was implemented by Blizzard.
---
* Pets now scaled with their masters.
---
* HoTs, DoTs, and channeled spells were severely buffed.
---
* Disenchanting items with a level 5 alt was no longer possible.
---
* The amount of experience needed to hit 60 was nerfed by about 18% across the board.
---
* All percentage based stats (crit, hit, etc) became numbered ratings and gave different percentages based on your level.
---
* Racial bonuses were changed/balanced.
---
* New graveyards were added to Vanilla zones.
---
* Many Vanilla quests were changed to be soloed and gave more XP.
---
* Reputation discounts were added for all levels of reputation.
---
* Mount costs were decreased and obtainable at level 30.
---
And that's just what I can remember.
---
Yay! 30's! Isn't it grand.
---
But there are also French and German and Polish and Russian private servers.
---
The fact that you played with some Germans and everything was fine is maybe because so many Germans played on the German servers.
---
The question is what will happen when you force everyone onto English servers. My guess is the same that originally happened back in vanilla.
---
Based off numbers that is false.
---
200-250 hours without guides, 120-150 if you are super fast with addons etc.
---
You are VERY replaceable.
---
It's an extremely expensive class. You need to spend a good chunk of your time acquiring income so that you can afford your required gear upgrades. Your gear dependence is a curse for 90% of people - most people never break past the point where it's a blessing because of the difficultly involved in getting the good gear. But once you get that gear, man does it feel good. You're also pretty bad at making money compared to other classes.
---
Downtime is your worst enemy because you NEED downtime due to a lack of heals, but every second of downtime means the next fight will take longer because of your rage going away.
---
For most of the game you've got a hard time competing with other DPS for damage, and you pull threat very easily. You have no threat mitigation tools either, unless you roll night elf.  When it comes to tanking, you need to constantly have a sword and shield up to date, which also eats into your money. Also, with alot of other classes you can get by with being average, but because there's so many other warriors being average just doesnt cut it.
---
Soloing is basically hell for you. Dueling is very difficult. If you're not geared you won't do well in PvP because you won't be able to attract pocket healers. While you're an allstar in group content, you need to have the chops to back it up, and getting to that point is hard. You also have lots of competition for gear. Everyone except priests, warlocks, and mages want items you want. Even then, there's some staffs you'll want when leveling. You'll need a group to do pretty much anything, and you're better off learning how to tank if you want the good stuff - dps is a dime a dozen and there's very little a dps warrior brings to a five man compared to any other class because you've probably already got another warrior tanking. The lack of CC is also really annoying.
---
The grind to 60 is long and tiresome, trust me, I got 3 warriors to 60 during vanilla. I don't recommend anyone do that, I was a stubborn kid who didn't want to respec. One of the worst bits is you have absolutely zero movement speed bonuses and it's very hard for you to get out of shitty situations. You're basically required to level first aid and engineering to PvP, and they make leveling alot easier. But that's more money you need to spend.
---
Don't get me wrong, the class is loads of fun, but I'm telling you all the worst bits, not the best bits.
---
They're squishy and rely heavily on cooldowns in 1v1. In group pvp they are the absolute worst class, if you're planning on doing premades then finding one is going to be much more difficult as a rogue. In PvE you have to deal with the fury warriors taking some of your gear and the overpopulation of rogues in general.
---
Spending several minutes sneaking around AV in stealth so that you can get the perfect position and opportunity to wipe out an enemy priest who is OOM and drinking, only to be pulled out of stealth at the most inopportune time by a random AoE and then getting zerged.
---
I hope you still need a torch to explore the dark areas at night. Who else remembers that?
---
Yeah, cause unlocking chests with valuable items and unlocking doors allowing you to enter instances or skip content, is "nothing".
---
#[NA] [A] [PVP] &lt;Hurricane&gt; is recruiting! Hardcore WPvP, Semi-casual raiding
---
Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you new to Classic, and want a supportive, organized guild to provide you with the friendship, advice and backup you’ll need to survive on a PVP server?
---
**Consider &lt;Hurricane&gt;! Here’s what we do:**
---
* Highly disciplined, scheduled weekly city raids; plus the drills and tiresome lectures necessary to bring newbies up to speed on the do’s-and-don’t’s of zerg vs zerg pvp
---
* Support leveling members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP - Don’t want to rank? No problem. Once was enough for me, too.  3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE, 1 City, from 7-10pm CST. Days TBD, but will fall between sundays and thursdays. Modified DKP loot system with class-specific sanity checks. (Sorry, Hunters. You can’t roll on the bindings.) DKP is awarded for city raid attendance.
---
**Who is Hurricane?**
---
Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit. We know what we like, and what we like is a tightly controlled raid, ripping through horde towns. Our culture is strictly old-school - we don’t stand for pettiness, harassment, or the mindless regurgitation of tired memes.
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you, and teach you: how to assist train Horde raids into the dirt, when to spread out and when to tighten up, what actually constitutes “flanking” in a game without collision detection, and how to fight through crowds of Civilian NPC landmines without detonating your weekly ranking on Dishonorable Kills.
---
**Interested? Here’s what we’re looking for in a member:**
---
* Friendly, non-toxic, patient
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Loves world PvP
---
* Communicative Discord voice chat user
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
&lt;Hurricane&gt; wants to have you - if you’re a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, you’ll be right at home with us. If you’re a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla - you’re welcome, and you’re wanted, regardless of where your journey takes you.

Max aside from ground clutter (mid feels plenty to me) and maybe view distance in zones where fog plays a major role in aesthetics.
---
I sent some gold to an alt character I made during the stress test and it took about an hour for it to arrive. I feel like that is wrong, from what I remember it should definitely be instant when on same account. Just was not my experience on stress test.
---
By what?
---
Back then it was.
---
Vanilla warrior mains unite!
---
Usually people will advertise their guild and say some stuff about what they're looking for, leveling and fun, pvp, racing to end game content only looking for the best and so on. On private servers if I don't have a guild I usually say looking for a fun casual guild and get some invites. If I don't like the guild due to personalities, toxicity, or people not being on much I'll leave and keep looking. On the last p server I played on I asked while in the barrens, got an invite and stayed with them all the way till I stopped playing. Honestly though there's no reason to not join a guild as you're leveling up. Fun conversations, people willing to help you out. Don't be afraid to pick and choose though.
---
Demand will disappear though, all of the resources that people have stocked up doesn't disappear. There's less available to harvest, but everything that's already been harvested stays while tons of people disappear.
---
I haven't played since WoTLK ended, so I can't speak to retail wow. All I know is I'm having a lot of fun with all the classes. I've been trying them all out and I still can't decide on my main. Which is a good thing, I suppose it means I'll have fun no matter what class I roll.
---
Currently having a blast Earthbind kiting. Its ridiculously broken, and I like that some things in the game are just kind of like that.
---
Thanks for all the replies everyone!
---
Has to be either the full battle of darrowshire quest chain, or Tirion Fordring's quests. Coin toss.
---
Yep! WoW literally invented the 3-role system.
---
Not looking forward to totems being left on the ground and then pulling aggro. Lots of wasted mana just to re-position a totem after combat has ended.
---
They do great with it. Shaman are hamstrung with the cost and range of totems while spriests just need to be in range of their target themselves. They are the most mana efficient class to level and keep a lot of that efficiency in things like pvp. Just more fun then afk white hitting because dps spells are so inefficient.
---
Its nothing I'm thrilled about. I've never gone out of my way to find a Rogue to group with for that. Its especially a poor example I could just as easily bring a blacksmith or an engineer if I really cared about opening chests and doors.
---
PvP spec (arms) is terrible in PvE
---
PvE specs (fury, prot) are terrible in PvP
---
All the old notes from [vanillawowdb](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=17182#comments) say it's just Blacksmithing.
---
Faction locked is irrelevant
---
This is absolutely true. Plus, it depends a lot on the class. In BFA levelling I could handle 10 mobs at a time but that's because I was a BM Hunter decked out in BiS Argus gear with a pocket tank. When I levelled through on my frost mage which was created after BFA launched it was nowhere near as capable.
---
People also don't seem to realise that levelling without heirlooms is an option. If you don't like the speed/ease of levelling, try it without heirlooms. It's still not Classic-level but that's mostly because the classes are just more well-rounded in modern WoW. I don't want to hear another "but muh competitive advantage" response to that because it's *levelling* and inherently not competitive content.
---
Reminds me of a "comparison" video I saw by Heelvsbabyface the other day between BFA 1-10 and Classic 1-10. He literally loaded every heirloom and XP boost he could into the BFA 1-10 experience and did it in like 10 minutes, compared it to a fresh toon on classic which took like 4 hours, and he and everyone in the comments were pretending it was a perfectly fair and accurate comparison.
---
Most people will tell you no. Some people will still insist it is doable.

Any Blacksmith with 300 skill can learn to make the Sulfuron Hammer. It's BOE, so you don't need to be a Blacksmith to make Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros.

I definitely agree they’re the slowest, but I’d also say they probably tie with paladin.
---
So... The sad info is just confirming what everybody believed about druids back in vanilla?
---
No.
---
Just play a rogue. Good in all phase and Druids aren't
---
I figured as much.  I'm not about to insist on playing a spec that is a waste of time.  Thanks!
---
Hell, the bad decisions began in vanilla: CRBGs, MoHs, AV nerfed to oblivion, nerfed scholo and strath, nerfing of threat management, and the list goes on.
---
Banning people because they are using their native language? When Blizzard doesn't give them their own server as it used to be in Vanilla ?
---
It won't happen.
---
There's also info about feral damage being even lower than on private servers. Which is pretty sad because it was pretty bad already. Unless you abused bugged weapons and enchants, which aren't going to work (cobalt crusher/torchering poker etc)
---
Hammer smith is not required.
---
[Sulfuron](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18592/plans-sulfuron-hammer) is required which doesn’t require it.

---
Yeah between the lack of players in the beta footage and the name of the goblin he's targeting being "Unknown", I suspect his "beta" footage is actually the beta client connected to a local sandbox. These can behave incorrectly and are missing all server-spawned game objects.
---
That said, the tree thing appears to be correct based on some beta footage I found. Not sure about the missing clock tower in Stormwind, but I think that's correct too. The demo client (the latest and only version of Classic I've poked around in) was missing some models in the world, so it's possible some of these still haven't been fixed for Classic. If only I had beta access so I could confirm this...
---
&gt;Also if you think that upgrading the 1.12 client would have been in any way a feasible option, you have absolutely zero understanding of software development.
---
I love these "you have no understanding of software development".
---
As a customer, I'm interested in getting an authentic Vanilla experience. I'm not interesting in "it takes much more effort" gibberish - and you certainly shouldn't give them that excuse either as another customer. 
---
Unless you're a software developer working on Classic, you neither have the understanding of what the magnitude of that effort is.
---
The reason they gave as to why haven't gone with 1.12 is there would be "invisible issues" - that could be a PR stunt just to keep in the layering tech backported from Legion to save on costs rather than having additional servers - who knows?
---
And it's contradictory because there could be "invisible issues" that have infested Classic from Legion as well.
---
So stop giving them excuses and advocate for a more authentic Vanilla experience - as a customer. What you're doing won't do anyone any good.
---
in 2.0, the only thing I can remember seeming different was the elite zombies on one of the WPL farms were made normal.    (this is comparing a ps that isn't around now and isn't famous to 2.0 which is when I started.
---
this was not the 2.3 major changes where most outdoor elites were removed.
---
otherwise, the best i can figure, classic wow was pretty much unchanged until 2.3.
---
Swifty, I bet?
---
240+ hours if you've never done it before.
---
\&gt;200 hours if you've done it before on Pservers.
---
Ultima Online - sandbox
---
WoW / EQ - theme park
---
I explained above how to do it but if you can't make the route work just go cross continent I guess. I've never had to go to darkshore or ashenvale to level an alliance toon. Do the thing that works for you it's vanilla after all.
---
If you're taken in a raid, you'll probably be the only one.
---
Adopt a cat IRL and see if you like rogue.
---
They shouldn't have set a release date. Or all of the reported bugs fixable by 8/27?
---
Everything rogue is the worst pvp class
---
[Sulfuron Hammer](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/17193) is BoE, [Eye of Sulfuras](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/17204) is BoP.  
---
Anyone can make the hammer and give it to you, you only need use the eye and it will combine.
---
&gt; The average time to 60 in Vanilla was around 240 hours.
---
I'm wondering if you have stats on this or if it's just a guess.
---
Not trying to throw shade, but I wouldn't consider someone to be an "average player" if they're hitting 60 within 240 hours.
---
The average player is going to be competing with a lot of other players within "the zerg," probably working on tradeskills, maybe running some BGs and dungeons. They'll take some time to socialize and do some other random stuff. When you factor that stuff in you're probably looking at about double the 240 hour figure.
---
IMO, it's about 144 to 168 hours for the super efficient speed levelers who are playing an optimal class like warlock, hunter, or mage. About 240 hours for people who are prioritizing getting to 60 and are fairly efficient but aren't necessarily speed leveling. Then, add time beyond that for players who play more casually.
---
Hey since you've got paladin experience can you give me a few pointers? I'm planning to play paladin in classic because the class really appeals to me and i have never been a healer before and want to learn. I tried healing deadmines in the stress test but it seemed like I was running out of mana faster than I should've and like my heals weren't enough. I was downranking to top off but it still didn't seem like enough. I get that level 15 is low, but it seemed like I just sucked. I was trying to cast the healing spell but cancel if they didn't need it to stay in the 5 second rule, but even doing that it still felt like I was always OOM. I was trying to wait to heal until they lost 1/3 of their health but still went OOM quick. Any pointers? The whole group was level 15.
---
They are too busy in the beta
---
In the beginning most guilds will take whatever they can get just to get 40 warm bodies into MC at the same time. After a few weeks of wiping on Magmadar the guilds will slowly start to cull the chaff. DPS Druids will be among the first to go.
---
You'll be fine as long as you are not expecting high end guilds to take you. Casual guilds will have a spot for you, also you'll be loved if you tank 5 mans. Realistic expectations.
---
lol, once I get a bigger apartment a cat is absolutely happening (love dogs, but they require actual attention).
---
Quite valid and to be expected.
---
Don't you spawn at the darkshore graveyard if you die on the coast of ashenvale though?
---
Yes it's viable, but it won't be optimal.  Feral druid excels at the leveling stage and can tank and dps 5-mans without much issue. But if you want to min-max and prioritize maximum dps then druids isn't the class to pick.
---
No speedleveler would call themselves that if they can't get a time under 120 hours, for any class.
---
No it's not.... Only 50% of people can play them. That is 100% relevant. Might want to look the definition of 'irrelevant' up.
---
not connected with or relevant to something.
---
How does being unplayable for 50% of the people on a discussion about most populae classes make that irrelevant?
---
True, it all just depends on how long it will take to really do serious  lasting damage to the economy. If it's out before phase one, and they ban abusers and/or fix the issues - I think we won't have to worry about much damage
---
hydramist for me
---
There must be a better way to report bugs than making a youtube video with god awful music... oh wait. There's a report feature built into the game.

However, it’s free to play compared to the sub model wow has.
---
no
---
I've been saying this. They are terrible!
---
I played way, way too much vanilla. Having played far beyond the limited stress test, I’ve been nothing but astounded by how hard Blizzard has nailed it. The game feels right in a way no private server has. Everything works, everything is where it should be, and the players actually interact with each other. I understand being afraid they’ll take a dump all over something you truly care about, but based on my experience, you have nothing to worry about. I hope you aren’t so focused on a few bent blades of grass that you miss out on the beauty of the meadow.

All settings max I have 10k beast machine so it’s the only way to play on 144 FPS :p cannot wait! Just praying for localised oce servers for that sweet 10ms

That’s like saying just because there’s more people with Camaros than lambo’s mean that camaros are more popular.

Poor choice of words, I meant if you could thanks snap and make a change. Not force anyone to do anythunf
---
I played a rogue in the stress test. Bare in mind they capped it at lvl 15. But in terms of world pvp I was getting targeted within 12 yards of the opposite faction with stealth. Speccing into improved stealth might be necessary. I did not go that route. So I got ganked fairly consistently by frost mages, hunters, shamans, and warlocks. Westfall is one of the more dangerous zones in the game. I felt like I was corpse walking more with a combat sword spec than fury warriors. Dual wield at lvl 10 is  lower dps than using a 2h. You don't really get hit gear until late game. You can get 5% hit in the combat tree which probably closes the gap.I also could not sap anything in the deadmines as the mobs aggro onto you even with stealth. With the right talents I believe it could handle what you are trying to get out of the class. But that talent tree will look different from the traditional combat spec.

Small aample size of 7000 but this is pretty accurate for what classic will be. Warrior/Mage/Rogue will 100% be the top 3 most popular. 
---
Paladin and Shaman the least played... HOLY SHIT. Who would've thought a faction specific class are the 2 least played.
---
then you hear the beautiful sound of a nearby stealthed rogue
---
Depend on the cat they can too.
---
I think that there will continue to be a pretty decent population, including a lot of players that have been playing on private servers for years.

Uther the Lightbringer was a former cleric.
---
The fact that this is your only argument for Rogues having utility only proves my point. Thanks mate
---
They absolutely are not.
---
&gt;wotf is insta-cast and comes with a small immunity after. It's hands down the better racial.
---
Escape artist 1m CD and can be used against any movement impairing effect.
---
WOTF is a 2m CD and can only be used against Charms, Fears, and Sleep.
---
The better racial is completely situation and depends on the circumstances.
---
Rogues and Warriors will probably prefer Escape Artist over WOTF while Range will prefer WOTF.
---
really accurate write up. DPS warrior is a lot of effort in a raid because of all those problems. if you want to main tank then you need to be stellar and well loved in your guild because its hell for gossiping. Off tanking isnt as bad but you need to pour a lot of blood sweat and tears for people not to think of you as a second string loser
---
Was the quest really that hard? Why were they the only ones who completed it?
---
Such is life as feral in vanilla.
---
We have plenty of utility. No other class has more CC options than us, especially in combat. And we're the second highest DPS class in the game. That's all you need to know.
---
Ya because waiting in a queue for 2 of the 3 hours I have to spend gaming after I get home from work is better than being able to play for all 3 hours but only seeing 30 people in STV instead of 60 ^^/s
---
CC is not utility
---
Yep. I main rogue and anytime I go stealth it's a grim reminder of how they butchered those animations. Praying they get fixed.
---
I made a paladin to level in Modern a couple of weeks ago.  I dinged 20 in SFK... and I instantly learned epic riding and the paladin epic mount spell.  It was both hilarious and sad.
---
I sure hope so... we need to avoid this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnw7XuGTJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnw7XuGTJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Yeah... "formally" &gt;_&gt;
---
I'm choosing freedom and honor over corruption and racism.
---
Not a difficult choice at all.
---
I'd keep those bugs if they remove layering and make localized servers for sure.
---
There’s an ocean of difference between not swinging in bloodlust and being a laughable dps class.
---
They resemble magic the gathering artwork on the cards. It’s really lovely!
---
It doesn't matter what you want as a customer if what you want is unrealistic. It also doesn't matter that you don't care about the realities of producing the game; those realities won't go away just because you're not interested in them. Stop acting like an entitled kid.
---
Throwing away 15 years worth of bug- and exploit fixes, crash fixes, performance optimizations, UI improvements, *everything* improvements, really, would have been colossally retarded. Not only would your client be utterly incompatible with the modern architecture, forcing you to make it compatible, it would also be unstable, vulnerable to every single exploit discovered since 2006, run poorly on modern hardware, lack support for modern UX features like screens that are wider than they are tall... And to fix all of this you'd be repeating work that's already been done. And not just a little work, but 15 years of work. And not just any work, but the most technically challenging work involved in developing the game.
---
It was either porting it to the modern client or not having Classic at all. That is why it took them this long to make the game.
---
So stop being a fucking child. You have no idea what you're talking about and you do not know what you want.
---
Uther was a knight in the service of Lordaeron, and an apprentice cleric for Faol. His primary occupation was in service to Terenas, not Faol.
---
Yeah, but it's the fucking dream for an Enhancement Shaman.
---
Except layering. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnw7XuGTJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnw7XuGTJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Or they could simply raise the server cap to deal with high population fluxes early on. If some neckbeards in a basement could raise the server cap on private servers to around 15 thousand, I'm sure Blizzard could do the same.
---
&gt;Everything works, everything is where it should be
---
A lot of things work, yes. But then there's a lot of things that are wrong like ["Blizzard confirms Instant Attack Normalization is incorrect on Beta."](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3igqg/blizzard_confirms_instant_attack_normalization_is/) , melee leeway (which also affects hunter dead zone), animations, arrow sounds, layering not working the way it's intended to work, hunter pet management is an absolute disaster.
---
&gt;and the players actually interact with each other
---
This has nothing to do with bugs. It's irrelevant. Players interacted on private servers because the game forces you to interact.
---
First and foremost, my muthafucking weapon skills.
---
Crafting my poisons and blinding powder. Leveling lockpicking.
---
Having ammo a quiver and needing to tame different pets to learn abilities.
---
Instead of coming up with an alternate solution, they introduce phasing on crack.
---
Because private servers didn't come up with an alternate solution that is less prone to abuse.
---
Even though i am a Hordie Teldrassil is breathtaking
---
Then don’t roll an auto attack simulator... I mean paladin.
---
I plan on playing paladin so the choice is obvious. I bliz decided to give both factions pallys and shamans, which I personally have no problem with, I would probably switch to horde
---
To be fair that isn't a quest.  You just have to grab a mallet from an elite then take it to an alter and forge it.  I wonder who was the first to figure that out.
---
I just do not Wana do the quest again. That quest is a fucking MMO punish
---
/r/classicwow/comments/btm7m5/i_developed_a_tool_so_that_you_can_calculate_when/

https://wowlevelspeedcalculator.com/
---
well its 4chan, so it must be true
---
The slow grind of leveling. For me I enjoy the leveling process the most I think and having a lot of people at your same level is the best. And all the amazing wpvp moments.
---
Then later when bgs hit every 10 levels is a game unto itself. You try to get the best gear and level up your professions so that at lvl _8 and _9 you can get into bgs and help your faction win more often.
---
I used to play this when I was a kid! I was thinking about it about a year ago.
---
There is if you have the CE.
---
I believe they're thinking in sentimental terms.
---
Still wore a dress.
---
Renataki's Charm of Trickery from the ZG edge of madness event. I have no desire to invest a minimum of 2 months IRL time with a willing raid group to get it again. So much so that I'm probably not going to play rogue this time.
---
Just confirmed with hiro, it’s true
---
actually the most popular classes will be warriors, rogues, shamans, mages, warlocks, hunters, paladins, druids, and priests. you literally wont see anything else
---
Yea, was an absolute pain in the ass to do, but the reward was worth it tho
---
To be fairrrrrrrrrrrrrr
---
This is actually amazing
---
Pservers warning.
---
I leveled a Druid on a fresh server as a skinner/enchanter. The goal was to get to 265 asap for the tanking trinket. I think I got it at level 57.
---
I was able to get my mount at 40, and it was actually quite nice to have enchants on the way up.
---
It's possible to level as you go, but it slows you down and money will be tight. Also, there's literally no reason to do it unless you want the trinket.
---
Listen, it almost took you to polar opposite sides of the map and it was one of the few times I ever did something like that as I bumbled my way to level 58 before TBC Launched. Lemme have this.
---
I agree. It is going to take several months for the bulk of people to hit 60. I'd be surprised if theres more than a small amount of people per server at 60 within the first month
---
And here I thought Bloodlust was a TBC skill...
---
You'll have to put in more work, what with powershifting and MCPs and stuff. If you're good and use your non-dps abilities when helpful people will like you. Did a 5 man with a good feral druid recently who threw out innervate and heals and shit whenever he could so we didn't have to stop pulling. I'd take him over pretty much any other dps again.
---
False dichotomy. I don't think it was necessarily imagination that gave us the slow descent into the madness that is current retail. Vanilla was extremely imaginative, and it got better and better, for the most part, with each patch. 
---
I also don't understand the argument that patches after 1.12 would be bad, but patches from 1.1 to 1.12 were fine. The game changed massively in its infancy; there is still room to grow while keeping to what made Vanilla great.
---
Haven't decided yet. I like Alliance cities and zones better. The Barrens just sucks. It's so empty and you have to walk 10 minutes to get where you want to be and every death is a 2000 yard walk back.
---
Alliance zones have better quests and more variety.
---
I dont like the Alliance races nearly as much as the Horde. They all just seem kind of  bland. Night elves are ok
---
So you have a definition of fun? Sounds boring.
---
What chairs are those? Anyone know?
---
How could I have forgotten about Illegal Danish!! Dang these videos are still good.
---
Yeah the class bias is a bit odd, but I guess it helps with that dilemma for sure
---
Tauren Paladins, sure. But you guys can keep the elves.
---
New low effort meme policy coming into action tomorrow. Or now. But within a day. Memes going down.
---
There will be a decent population (but much reduced from launch) for up to Naxx is released. No private server has been able to sustain a solid raid community for 6 months after Naxx release though. People fade out and then hype starts for a new fresh. The same thing will happen with Classic. People don't just play the same content forever.
---
Could be. I think it is jebait.
---
Please blizzard just give us servers with layering and servers without. Solves every problem.
---
Nice
---
Troll Mage and Gnome Mage. Because my team can’t pick a faction and I’m splitting my time.
---
I really doubt you’re that guy... hey anything is possible though.
---
&gt;So what is the true goal and where do we draw the line is the main question.
---
My own goal was to make Ret more fun and interactive (not just autos) while not just being Crusader Strike, and also while not being super OP.
---
Again, I don't care about the effort required as a customer - they should make it work and compatible with their current systems. They've had years to do this. Period.
---
Plus you're making it sound as if they would require to re-do 15 years of work, which is bullocks. They have to make it compatible. You and I don't know how much work that is. So stfu.
---
&gt;You have no idea what you're talking about and you do not know what you want.
---
So in other words, "you think you do but you don't".
---
I want authentic Vanilla, and not a Vanilla/retail sham. Crystal clear.
---
There are already changes. And there will be more. And they are not all bad.
---
Classicast is nice and has kept the hype going for me. 
---
Countdown is good too. 
---
Kargoz and defcamp and melderon. They do live shows that get reuploaded.
---
Very likely. They'd just be scoping out what sort of effort is required to do TBC: Classic at this point.
---
He has shoulders and a red full length cape. That's not classic!
---
I really wanted to make a Prot Pally. I had a friend of a friend who was a Prot Pally back in vanilla and he had Thuderfury. 
---
It was absolutely amazing to do runs with him, he’d just do so much damage that he never lost aggro, even with large pulls. It was one of the only times I could just go nuts on my rogue and not worry about pulling from the tank. 
---
Thinking I’m gonna go warrior though. I want to tank but I also want to dps on occasion. Or pvp. Never really played a warrior so I’m pretty excited.
---
Go for it man.  Have at it lol
---
Actualllllllllyyyyy
---
Probably join up with someone friendly that I meet and go from there. I will not under any circumstances fill out any sort of application to join a guild
---
You probably played vanilla in 4:3, so any modern widescreen ratio like 16:9 is going to have a wider field of view.
---
No stop shut up, that airport conveyor belt walk is retarded, please keep it dead
---
Does the leaker's uncle work at Blizzard, by any chance?
---
But why male models?
---
[Well it's time to listen to this.](https://youtu.be/dx5KnFr9xSk?t=21)
---
Sigh. Beta Paladins had crusader strike. T_T
---
I'm not sure why they would hotfix anything not game breaking on beta
---
The lighting and colors need to be fixed as well. AV is supposed to be a cool blue, not a warm yellow. Other zones have the same problem, like Teldrassil being pink instead of purple.
---
Because whether or not they’re an improvement is subjective. I genuinely hate the BFA human running animation. It looks out of place in WoW and reminds me of a modern MMO/JRPG. 
---
Maybe it’s because I’ve got years played of Classic-Cata and barely any time in Legion/BFA but the “improved” visuals look out of place in a 15 year old MMO.
---
However, I acknowledge that this is all opinion and it’s not objective that one is better than the other.
---
this is the line where it becomes weird
---
While you are technically correct, we had a good reputation on ours server so some of our raiders were able to get a spot with other guilds for their nefarian kill (in some cases for gold but in others just because they wanted to help).
---
I think I prefer the well-paced footing as well in the beta version, but I get why people like the first. It's neat, even if not intentional.
---
[A][NA]
---
Night shift fury warrior looking for a dedicated raiding guild. Availability for raiding is (ET) 7:30AM-noon, or 6PM-10PM.
---
The new animations are objectively better and only someone that's never done any physical activity in their life would disagree
---
Shaman and paladin were in vanilla. They probably won’t be in classic.
---
Each of those except maybe the water is very important and HAS to be fixed before release.
---
Oh for fuck's sake dude. Just stick to private servers. And why don't you buy an old CRT and a dial up connection too.

Looking for a semi-casual guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and just enjoy the game with like-minded players?  
---
**About**
---
**Premonition** is for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60—but at end-game we intend to raid and have a bit of PvP fun.
---
**Expectations**
---
Have a decent attitude towards everyone and understand that we all have real life commitments. Be willing to overlook mistakes and offer to help and support other players wherever you can. 
---
Be ready to run lots of dungeons and farm consumables at max level. 
---
**Timezone**
---
We plan to raid 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week/weekend—but anyone is welcome to join.
---
**Loot**
---
Probably loot council, but we haven't decided. Raiding is months away, and there will be plenty of time for some robust discussion about this.

**[NA][A][PVP][CST] &lt;Hurricane&gt; Progressive Raiding &amp; WPvP Guild**
---
___
---
Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old-style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you unfamiliar with Classic, and want a supportive and organized community to provide you with the environment, advice, and the backup you will need to survive on a PVP server?
---
#####What we do:
---
* Weekly city raids. If you’re unfamiliar with city raids let us know in advance, we can bring newbies up to speed on the do's and don’ts of zerg vs zerg PvP
---
* Support our members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP. 3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE, 1 City, from 7-10pm CST. Will likely fall between Sundays and Thursdays. **We will distribute loot with a modified DKP system** with class-specific sanity checks (Sorry Hunters, you can’t roll on the bindings). In addition to raids, DKP will also be awarded for city raid attendance and raid roster slots will be open to those that consistently attends them
---
#####Who we are:
---
* Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit
---
* A tight-knit group, decimating the horde every week 
---
* Our culture is strictly old-school - we have loads of fun but won’t stand for pettiness, harassment, racism, or consistent mindless regurgitation of tired memes
---
#####Who we want:
---
* Someone who’s friendly, willing to learn, communicative on Discord, and loves world PvP
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you in and teach you. If you’re a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, or If you’re a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla – you’re welcome, and you’re wanted.
---
###If you have any questions or are interested in joining, join our [Discord] (https://discord.gg/wc6HudX) server
---
*Alternatively, you can message me and I’ll answer any questions you have.*

#RECRUITMENT STATUS: OPEN
---
DAE THINK RETAIL BAD?!?!?!?!?!?!
---
First max level was a dwarf hunter, friends are Hoard this time so I'm trying out Troll.
---
It'll be fun to have party members with a more varied appearance.
---
Thats what I was thinking, bless his heart
---
Truly breathtaking
---
I want to play a paladin. Also I've played horde mostly so everything will be a bit more refreshing.
---
I have like 12 people irl joining a server together. We will likely just found out own guild and try and build it up as a casual guild.
---
You would rather wait in what?
---
by the 5 billion other rogues or any other class in the game
---
With tailoring enchanting you can make money with it starting from level 30ish. Turn your silks into silk headband, disenenchant them and turn those badboys into lesser magic wand. Most of Harry Potters need it for faster leveling.
---
You can also sell soul dust. I bought my mounts thanks to them.
---
I don’t care about what patch it is I just simply want classic. Maybe down the line they do classic+ but then we’re trusting the people who made retail wow so idk if that’s a good option. I just don’t understand why people are always posting oh what if they changed this or that can we not just simply enjoy classic something people have been waiting for year to play again?
---
You shouldn't roll warrior to dps in Classic. Warriors are for tanking in PvE end game. If you are lucky your guild will have too many tanks and THEN they may suggest you go dps but until then you should expect to tank.
---
When you present it as, “a lot of things work, a lot of things don’t work”, you aren’t accurately describing the game in its current state. This isn’t some 50/50 split; 99% of the game is accurate and amazing. Blizzard will most likely iron out minor kinks like instant attack normalization and melee leeway. I understand being protective and passionate about this game. I feel the same way. I’m simply telling you that based on my time in the beta, you will most likely get the Classic experience you’re looking for.
---
I've always been alliance, but all my IRL mates who are playing, are going horde, so looks like i'm gonna be an orc this time around!
---
&gt;Again, I don't care about the effort required as a customer - they should make it work and compatible with their current systems. They've had years to do this. Period.
---
Yeah, and they should get me a steak and a BJ, a flying pig and the moon out of the sky. Period. You can't always get what you want.
---
&gt; Plus you're making it sound as if they would require to re-do 15 years of work, which is bullocks. They would have to make it compatible. You and I don't know how much work that is. So stfu.
---
They would have to make it compatible, and then reimplement 15 years' worth of fixes and engine improvements. We know exactly how much work that is: it's 15 years' worth. That doesn't mean it'd take 15 years to reimplement it, but it *would* take enough man-hours to make the project financially unviable by a very wide margin. This, too, is something we know, because it's the reason vanilla servers were never made until a certain hero engineer showed it's possible to port the content to the modern engine.
---
&gt;So in other words, "you think you do but you don't".
---
Yes, literally. You think you know what you're talking about, but you don't. You are completely and utterly clueless.
---
&gt;I want authentic Vanilla, and not a Vanilla/retail sham. Crystal clear.
---
You're free to stay on private servers together with whatever other sorry individuals keep playing on them... assuming any of them even stay up after Classic launches. No one's stopping you. In fact I encourage you to. Please also navigate your browser to /r/wowservers while you're at it.
---
Best comment here
---
What if it's a huge upgrade for you, but might be more appropriate for somebody else?
---
Like, for example, a shield with stam/spirit. Is it OK for a warrior to need that if a shaman also needs it?
---
Or is it OK for a hunter to need everything?
---
Id go 2 mages and a warlock. Warlocks do a ton of aoe damage with hellfire and with mages keeping the mobs slowed and frost novaed, you can do so risk free. They can also pull with eye of killrog. Warlocks can also summon themselves. So when bags are full, cast summon on one of the mages, that mage HS's to town to repair and sell and ports back before the summon expires. Rinse and repeat.
---
/r/BoneAppleTea
---
I think it's a big mistake to fracture the playerbase up again and again only to be left with a bunch of different versions of the game with too few in each.
---
Any link?
---
I will be enjoying Classic as it was. After Naxx is on farm, we're going to need something, and I would prefer to not just go to TBC and split the community in half. I say give Classic a new path forward like how Mark Kern put it on his stream.
---
Yep the summoning is definitely a consideration, some dungeons are in the middle of nowhere with no vendors anywhere near. Thanks for the input
---
There's nothing classic about introducing a new class. This is for BfA
---
No thanks
---
Visual issues are always lowest priority item to be fixed.
---
I will be leading a group of paladins through this ASAP. Leaving my bros to go in a journey with 4 random paladins was such a good feeling experience. DM and Loch Modan is easy ofc, but BFD has a horde flightpath right there so there were many horde groups. Running through arathi highlands -&gt; hillsbrad -&gt; silver pine was fun. Silver pine obviously had literally endless horde questing so it was like a constant war to SFK.
---
it's just for fun, not serious
---
Funny, the only one I care about is the skeleton one.
---
I know it's a created class that's supposed to fit in the Vanilla landscape, but this doesn't seem like the right sub for this.
---
mages overrated and lose a high amount of matchups? what? you need to bind your abilities
---
The strafing and skeletons are big ones. This vid is short, concise, and effectively shows bugs. Nice video.
---
\# &lt;Forty Decent People&gt;
---
We are an 18+ PvE Horde guild of goal oriented individuals who aim to clear all the PvE content that Classic WoW has to offer, and to have a good time doing it. With the ultimate goal of defeating Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.
---
This is a new guild, and we are currently in the process of recruiting Officers, Raiders, deciding which PvE server to play on, and the guild tabard design.
---
All raid times are EST unless otherwise stated. We plan to raid 2 nights a week so people do not get burned out. If there is high demand for raids outside of these times, those discussions will be had once phase 4 is on the horizon because clearing MC, Ony, and BWL in two nights is quite doable. Tuesday 7-12PM Thursday 7-12PM
---
\## Our 3 main guidelines:
---
\*\*Guideline #1:\*\* RESPECT EACH OTHER. One of the core things for a successful raid is to be able to function with 39 other people. No one has ever gotten a KT kill by spewing toxic language on everyone in the raid. Racism, sexism, and other forms of toxic nonsense will not be taken lightly and will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
---
\*\*Guideline #2:\*\* We are here to play a game, have a good time, slay monsters, and get sweet loot. Don't bring up politics, religion, or anything else of similar volatile nature during raid time.
---
\*\*Guideline #3:\*\* No doomsaying. Some examples include: Loud sighing after something you do not like happened in the raid, "oh my goooooooood" after a wipe, "this comp sucks, it's X fault we wiped" etc.
---
If we wipe, we will get up, buff up, and try again. Trust that the Officers are making adjustments to have the raid succeed. Don't be the guy bringing everyone's spirit down.
---
Please, do not apply if:
---
\- You cannot respect your fellow raiders, even if they have made a mistake that caused a wipe.
---
\- Multiple raid wipes make you emotionally unstable or hopeless.
---
\- You cannot speak on voice coms.
---
\- You feel like playing for 5 hours 2 times a week is too much of a commitment for you.
---
Do apply if:
---
\- You are a relaxed person who's fun to play with.
---
\- You are willing to make a long-term commitment to take down Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.
---
\- You are dedicated to improve and build the raid team with us.
---
If you read this far, you may be the kind of player we are looking for. The "get-applications-here" channel has instructions on how to apply. Everyone who raids with us applies. Even Zver the guild leader.
---
Discord: [https://discord.gg/jZCFDjW](https://discord.gg/jZCFDjW)
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Joana do it in 116 hours as the world record 1-60 in vanilla. No class but a hunter could do it under 120... And even that is only a couple hunters world wide. Very few people even got close to Joana's record, unless your talking about private servers?
---
where should I post it?
---
Most people use discord these days, that will most likely be the case in classic
---
Go and download it. And then realise no one really uses it anymore.
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
Technically it still exists, just out competed by discord.
---
Discord is free, more feature rich, and better supported.
---
[Sodapoppin disagrees with your interpretation of fun.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRzJDDxyZqk)
---
Yes, every class has been brought under 120 hours on Blizzlike Pservers, even though it's actually more difficult on them than it is in Classic.
---
Sugeknight.  Orc hunter on crushridge.  Haunted my dreams questing through low level alliance zones like duskwood.  He would appear from the mist in his black leather armor and gank us on a regular basis.  Now I know how Tupac felt
---
Honestly no matter what they do after naxx has a good chance on splitting the community. But you could argue maybe they don’t change the classes at all and maybe just add new raids and gear.
---
Surprisingly the leveling difficulty in BFA is much more difficult than what it was around WoD where you could quite literally get 15 mobs at once and kill them all easily.
---
I mean personally, I really prefer the original vanilla gliding animation if I had to choose between the two of them.  
---
Not saying there couldn't be a better way, though.
---
peace nerdo
---
How many beta servers were/are used?
---
Sadly it will be phase 5 before we get tier 0.5 :(.
---
I was hosting my own vent up until a couple years ago. Discord is just too easy.
---
Laughing at the fact you think pservers are accurate and or harder.
---
Actually, as someone who instantly knew he had to roll a pally in retail, I feel obligated to do the same in classic. I’ve always played Ret and thought about switching to holy once or twice, but now that classic is upon us I can learn the OG healing ways.
---
Honestly my biggest conundrum is: do I roll dwarf because dwarfs are my spirit race, or do I go the traditional and stereotypical human Paladin?
---
Why would any guild capable of killing Nef give up their one chance at a scepter?
---
The 'gliding' was so iconic at least for me of vanilla rogues, it looks way more badass to me. I love it, I was so upset when they changed it to the bunnyhopping some models have now. At least on live it's somewhat more ok because you get base speed or better.
---
leaker's bowling partner
---
😂😂👌👌
---
Would be tough to get a full raid to get Ventrilo. Everyone will just push Discord since it's free and most people have been using it for a while now.
---
😂😂😂😂👍
---
Go try leveling 1-5 on a Pserver, it's MUCH harder.
---
And now that we have Classic Beta, we've been practicing on a perfectly accurate server and still have players reaching 60 in ~90 hours.
---
There's been people that have put decent numbers up on private servers. The problem is that there has been some evidence that feral mechanics and numbers are fairly different from vanillas.
---
We won't know what feral druids are capable of until we get to late game in classic.
---
And this whole Reddit was like "no hunter bugs will be fixed before launch". 
---
I wonder how if the warlock pet bugs have bwwn fixed too. Gotta check tomorrow
---
Alliance because of Paladins. PvE and PvP wise.
---
I love that secret path.
---
Thanks so much for putting this together! I really appreciate all of the insight. Any way you can link the trees you're referring to throughout the post? I'd love to see the specs from the source and not mistake some other similar build to the ones you're talking about!
---
2005-2010

Don't kid yourself, league is way more popular

---
If Redditors are good at one thing, it's complaining.
---
If you combine that with WoW player's ability to complain, it's insane.
---
The past week or so has been insufferable "omg game is doomed, shit Blizzard, let's stick to private servers, Blizz fucking up"
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Unless you're a software developer working on Classic, you neither have the understanding of what the magnitude of that effort is.
---
Not true.
---
If you are an architect and create buildings and bridges for a living, even if you haven't built the exact "*blizzard (tm) bridge 2000*", you would still have insight as to how blizzard designed/built it just by looking at it.
---
The fuck? You get epic mounts at 20 now? Or is that just a paladin/lock thing and everyone else still has to get theirs at 40?
---
They're not going to ban people for it period. Not for fear of missing offenders,  but fear of banning people incorrectly. And no, I don't have a lot if faith in Blizzard and their "analytics tools". I also don't think they care. 
---
Layering is a bad solution to an unsolvable problem. But it's probably the perfect balance between low cost and low effort and that's why they're sticking to it.
---
Without something like layering they'd have to gatekeep queue to stagger people through staring zones, and I very much doubt people would prefer that to layering.
---
Viable? Yes. Optimal? No.  In equal gear and buffs rogues and warriors win out. A well played feral will bear out bad rogue or warrior,  but at the top end we're a middle of the chart dps at best.  However, the reason for bringing a feral isn't for the dps.  It's for LotP in melee party, innervate, battle rez, and the ability to tank or heal.  Druids shine when they're flexible. Just don't roll druid to meter top.
---
240 hours is exactly correct.  I leveled to 60 four times in Classic (Mage, Rogue, Druid, Warlock).  It required a full month of full time work (8 hours per day).  I never took a speed route or optimized things.  I just quested through all the zones and did dungeons.
---
I see the "in classic" but I still have to mention Kickin Nass and Taking Manes from WotLK is my favorite.
---
I have a paladin in retail wow mainly because I always wanted that tier 2 set or whatever to transmog since I thought it was the coolest set ever. I leveled prot and it was stupid easy and kinda fun but that's only because of how much paladins have changed. I know how they were in vanilla and there's no way I could put myself through the punishment of doing it. Didn't seem rewarding I guess. My first toon was a warrior in vanilla and I regretted that too. Always poor, always respeccing, etc. etc. I have learned my lessons since then. Good luck to you sir.
---
Judgement of Justice actually does nothing in PvP, in vanilla.
---
Only as dps.  If you want to be one of a million struggling for a raid spot then you go rogue.
---
Yet is does make sense to plan low budget, high return projects every 2 years when the majority of your launch customers have already cycled through existing content.
---
Once servers reach their life cycle before fresh servers are required to enter the mix, the landscape changes dramatically. Thus far, the Classic project is built entirely in a static manner with no hints of further development. Maintenance is minimal as they do not even want to regionalize clients, RP PVP servers or hire many GM/support staff.
---
To me, it appears Blizzard is only interested in bringing to life legacy games in the most minimalist way possible in order to maintain ownership of their own IPs. I'll take the good with the bad. At least we are getting the game.
---
I have a GTX 1080, so I'll have every graphics settings at maximum.
---
You arnt competing cross faction so cut everything in half. There are multiple polls on here with 30k+ responses so your 7k is pretty cute.
---
He said viable. Not optimal.  And you didn't even have an actual reply.  You're wrong.
---
I originally wanted to play horde but all of my friends wanted to play alliance so I went with the group decision. Years of experience on the alliance, I realized that the alliance are a bunch of 12 year olds who want to be the "good guys".
---
Now I'm going to play horde.
---
I would be cool with it if they added lateral gear that had different set bonuses and/or itemized for new specs, e.g. Arcane Mage, Boomkin, Prot Paladin, etc. I wouldn't want to just see T1&gt;T2&gt;T2.5&gt;T3&gt;whatever is next. Give me something worth getting, not just power creep.
---
Build better tech, dont license it, then give it to blizz. Then youll get the game you want. Here I'll help you start

---
Or play feral and enjoy the game. And watch the failrogues get outdps'd
---
Link me one then instead of saying it.
---
The sad reality, no one will be able to re-experience raids with that awful Vent push-to-talk sound in the background.
---
Can you do me, a pretty new druid, a huge favor and explain some of the macros you use?
---
You are not competing cross faction
---
Found 2 old Guildies on there!
---
Thanks for putting your two cents in mate, I appreciate the time and info, especially from a rank 8. 
---
Definitely not worrying anymore about racials, and more concerned about learning how to react to certain situations and just BIS as much as possible.
---
If all you care about is meter humping then yeah that's mediocre.  I get to do more than a rogue and don't have to roll a second character if I want to tank or heal.
---
Yeah you played lock, I hated hearing that damn felhunter attack, you'd look at your debuff bar and see the end.
---
You just don't get it, your own link proved you wrong.
---
chuck?
---
I'm planning on hitting them all at least a few times, and I'll probably go a bit more than that when people whisper me to ask if I'll tank for them.
---
I'm not racing to 60, I'm having fun leveling and learning how to tank on the way up.
---
It's not really a valid concern. Private servers have shown a server can feel fun and alive with 2k regular players. Everquest and DaoC have active healthy communities with only a few thousand players. If Blizzard maintained Vanilla:Classic, TBC:Classic, and WotlK:Classic there would easily be enough player for multiple healthy servers of each one. This idea that you need 2million+ player all playing the same thing is ridiculous.
---
.....ya.....f Gul’dan....😏
---
Well it was dumb to have multiple layers, with less than 1k people, good thing they are finally working on it.
---
He's not god, he's like a fucking Void Lord. Like he's the furthest away from benevolence as you can get
---
It's not so much that I want to top dps meters, I just don't want to wallow at the bottom of them.  Feral druids got a major buff at end of TBC and continued to get buffed throughout WotLK.  It was an amazing time.  They retained their utility while suddenly becoming chart toppers.
---
My old account from 2006 was irretrievably terminated due to inactivity in 2015 (fittingly, Blizz sent the email to a defunct email address, so I didn't find it until recently). Kind of sad, but I also look forward to starting 100 percent fresh for the first time in over a decade.
---
How so?
---
Feral is not a raiding spec. You'll be fine in dungeons, pvp and during questing/farming
---
God, please fix the strafing, the old way was so much better.
---
Werw talking about most played classes not faction specific ones.
---
Is he our Mod Ash?
---
Hope my friends are enough to form one, everyone goes yeah sure well try it, but come the day we will see.
---
It's 0 sure but your muted 
---
Hey...
---
Tap on shoulder, removes one ear. 
---
What???
---
\&gt; I want old school vent
---
Good luck with that. No guild wants to pay for something they don’t have to to satisfy someone’s desire to be ‘old school’ where it literally adds nothing. Hope you are also building a PC from that time period with XP so you can feel better about how ‘old school‘ you are.
---
It shows that shaman and pally are the most popular behind warrior
---
You'll be one of the most played classes.  You'll have to fight for raid spots if you want to be any a competitive raiding guild. You'll have to roll an alt if you want to try any other role.  
---
I don't hate rogues as a class.  End up always missing the self heals as a druid. I'd just find a guild ASAP if you want to raid. Secure that spot!
---
Pretty much theyll have to transition or close.
---
One of the best!
---
That's great news, but not unexpected. My understanding is that they'll continue to adjust the aggressiveness of the layering throughout the beta. Of course, we're all hoping it's as light as possible come launch.
---
&gt; benevolence
---
&gt; God
---
Those two words don't go together.
---
I quit just prior to the AQ stuff and came back for TBC launch, would like to experience that this time around.
---
That song is a banger, nice addition
---
I've mained Paladin for 12 years, and I aint changing anytime soon.  Sure I'll level slow (until the 30's when I can switch to aoe grinding, maybe) but after the respec to Holy at max level I'll already be a useful member of just about any raid team.  Yes, as a buffbot, but also throwing some heals around.
---
I know. I mained a Feral Druid from Vanilla to Legion.  In BC they weren't chart toppers. And had to use 2 T4 in Sunwell.  In Wrath we had a good spot, but we weren't chart toppers every tier. 
---
And you're probably only going to sit bottom of the charts in a tryhard guild. If you don't get powershifting down you'll sit at the bottom though.
---
Blood Elf  Druid. With dark/twisted forms to take.
---
The comment was about competition therefore the only relevant topic is factions.
---
Playerbase is going to fracture anyway. People who prefer TBC aren't going to stick around for ever. While I'm as excited for Classic as anyone, I don't see myself playing it in 18 months.
---
Ah yes, I forgot about AQ. I was active during it, but didn't actually go there for any of the event because my computer at the time couldn't even handle Ironforge so I figured I wouldn't get anything out of going there.
---
cant tell. invite to beta and i will let you know
---
This sub has officially reached facebook tier memery.
---
Lol @ comparing code to building a bridge.
---
They have a log of all the changes they've made. They could make those changes work with 1.12. What is the effort magnitude required to make it work? You don't know because you don't have insight on what tech, software and tools they have in hand.
---
As I've said, they've had years to do this. It all came down to cutting down costs in the end, as evident in the recent news surrounding their greed.
---
Harder than other prof for sure since you depend on rng to get items\mats, but if your guild\playgroup funnle on 1, then its easy.
---
That virgin Footman only has a pathetic 420 hit points vs the chad Tauren's whopping 1300 hp and 33 dmg per swing WITH a chance of cleaving damage. Even if the Footman is 3/3 upgraded he's still gonna lose that fight.
---
If I play Classic this is my one grief because I love the Warcraft Paladin. I wish the Paladin kit was more fleshed out in a classic, lore friendly way. I don't want pure homogeneous classes but a fleshed out more successful ret/prot kit would be cool.
---
Are you colorblind?
---
You can only duel every 5 minutes.
---
Your combo points are only on one target and swapping cancels all of them

Lack of helping others means groups are less likely to take you.

You die very quickly.

Untrue. I just tested this in the beta not an hour ago, night elf females move their legs while turning. I can’t speak for the other races, but if you’d like I’ll find out once I get home.

Now that I reread the comment I agree. 👍

#somechanges
---
Rogues are incredible in premades
---
They’ve already been proven to be harder, especially earlier on and for melee classes.
---
Nope.
---
I checked about an hour ago, I can confirm the clock tower is missing. Not a huge deal, but I hope they fix it.
---
It's always interesting see how the internet changes over time.
---
I love this video, but I can't help but think if it released today, people would just go "l0l cringe" with mass downvotes.
---
&gt; Mount costs were decreased and obtainable at level 30.
---
That was pretty late in TBC though. I joined in Feb 2008, a little over a year after TBC released. I made level 40 literally the day before they announced that change.
---
Exactly.  Druid became my main in TBC (was my 2nd character) and I never intended it to be a dps, it just sort of happened that way.  I still remember vividly my guild's first raid after the patch that buffed feral druids, we were doing that one troll jungle place where you had to race from boss to boss, not Zul'Gurub but the other one.  I was suddenly placing respectably on the dps chart!  Then WotLK hit and I optimized the f--- out of it, was always in the top 3.  Would spend hours refining my rotation at test dummies to squeeze every last point of damage out of it.  I won't have that in classic, I know.  Hoping maybe I can recreate some of that with rogue.
---
Thanks this is awesome!! I'm definitely going to try to optimize with macros for sure. I also enjoy adding emotes that make noises in my spells. For instance, a /charge with thorns, /cheer for innervate. Something to give a little flavor!
---
Irvine represent!
---
I mean, if OP liked Wrath feral, Rogue should definitely be fun for them. 
---
Post didn't seem like they were dead set on the class fantasy.
---
[Here's](https://clips.twitch.tv/HumbleAgileArugulaM4xHeh) the PvP clip.
---
We already found that bug with private servers. Blizzard has a Nerf on all mobs in the starting zones (tutorial), the private servers didn't know to emulate that. All the mobs over 5 are fine, and have way more abilities/use them smarter(ai), run away faster, way more patrols, etc. 
---
Tons of quests that we're on the private server speed routes are jacked. Many that were thought to have fast drops are actually terrible in classic, or the xp values are off. 
---
Your 1000% better off following say Joana's vanilla leveling guide than a private server one.
---
Is there really a neutral flight path between Everlook and Moonglade? I had no idea!
---
I plan to join the guild with the best/most humorous/toll name while I level until I find one that fits my raid/progression plans and schedule.
---
Senior software 2... man how big is their pyramid
---
"I could walk all the way from Tarren Mill to South Shore stepping only on skeletons" - some kid in 2005
---
The animations being off is a huge deal, for me. If the undead female doesn't have the same eviscerate, I'm going to be disappointed. 
---
It's weird that this sub tells people to not worry about min-maxing and just play what you like, but then when these animation differences are pointed out, people are told to not worry about it because it's the numbers underneath the hood that really matter for gameplay. The cognitive dissonance is real.
---
The “gliding” doesn’t look bad at all. that’s my opinion and you have a different one and that’s ok. Regardless, classic is meant to restore vanilla in its best state. Not introduce new animations like the one that’s currently in beta.
---
This is a whole nostalgia trip
---
You who else understood that principle?
---
Thanks, and very good call. I'll likely be beating most of my friends level-wise so this will be a nice way to let them catch up. Looking forward to reading the post!
---
I get the argument for Defias over Tunic of Westall (although I prefer Tunic) but Crusader weapon enchant is a non-negotiable!!
---
Ooooo but upon phase 3 there will be battlemasters in cities, correct?
---
Vanish and wait haha
---
Great finds bro. A lot of these “bugs” seem to smell of retail. It’s amazing to me how much retail has regressed, even things like keyboard turning your character and the legs and feet don’t even move I mean are you kidding why would you take that away... assuming that’s the way retail is now...
---
Corrupted ashbringer.  Or my rogue's kingsfall.
---
this is fucking awful
---
Ashenvale is the zone directly North of the Barrens, and Horde has a flight point on the same beach as BFD. There are also some great quest rewards that you may really want.
---
If anything, the trip there is worse for Alliance unless you're a Night Elf.
---
What races would paladins be on horde and shamans on alliance? 
---
Night elf makes sense for shaman but Tauren Paladin just feels weird
---
Doing God’s work!
---
Where was faction mentioned? He asked about playing a rogue.
---
Previous comments have already mentioned the major changes. In terms of the physical world itself, very little changed with TBC. Some zones became much more fleshed out and viable. Dustwallow Marsh comes to mind. Worthless in vanilla, but a major quest hub for 36-40 in TBC. 
---
Most people, myself included, consider TBC to be Vanilla+. Classes were more fleshed out, lots of specs were viable. TBC introduced some light quality of life improvements such as a rough and rarely used LFG system, 60 percent mount at level 30, etc.  I think you'll find the physical world to be almost identical. The gameplay feel was also very, very similar. I played mostly during Vanilla and Burning Crusade. I've dabbled in some later expansions briefly. 
---
Edit: for what it's worth, I also only played Alliance during retail. I played a vanilla private server a year ago and rolled Horde. It felt almost like an entirely new game, and I wish I had saved that experience for retail vanilla. I think you'll be very pleased if you roll different than you were in TBC.
---
So when you say stay feral, I'm assuming you're talking about the feral/resto hybrid build? Any preference to the build? Always interested in seeing people's choices.
---
Then you apparently don't know how to read grapshs.
---
Tauren Paladins and dwarf shamans are in live so those at least would make sense
---
Lol, I was going to mention the same. Hell, I've been playing BfA now for about a month and you can, while leveling, take on 2, sometimes even 3, elites at level and kill them all. I'm talking as dps or heal spec. Someone tank specced is near unkillable unless they ROYALLY fuck up
---
It’s either that or get nothing and stick to private for more years?
---
Flag runners and that’s it right?
---
Fact: The Plague &amp; Scourge never would have happened if not for members of The Alliance.
---
Fact: The Sundering never would have happened if not for members of The Alliance.
---
Fact: The Burning Legion would never have come to Azeroth if not for members of The Alliance.
---
Fact: The Black Dragonflight would never have had so much power if not for members of The Alliance.
---
Fact: The Blood Elves would never have joined the Horde if not for members of The Alliance, depriving the Goblins of true sentience for almost a decade.
---
Fact: Ragnaros would never have come back to power if not for members of The Alliance.
---
Fact: The AQ gates would never have needed to be opened if not for members of The Alliance.
---
Pretty much every bad thing that has ever happened on Azeroth is The Alliance's fault.
---
Roids bruh. You see how swole that dude got between Wotlk and MoP? When your biceps are bigger than your brain you may have gone too far....too much blood fueling too many muscles to spend enough on something as silly as cognitive ability.
---
Any raid will take at least a few of both Hunter and Warlock.  Warlock will have more competition for gear. Hunters gear up rather quickly in raids, do to lack of competition. 
---
Hunter dps in raid starts out pretty competitive but doesn't scale as well later on with more gear. 
---
Warlocks have good dps early, but are limited  by tank threat. Later once the tanks are geared the Warlock can really turn it up.
---
Shamans will feel like something more than an odd fury warrior or not so stealthy rogue for melee, and they have a lot of their utility again. Elemental is going to be super lackluster if I remember correctly though.
---
Who cares about the streamer, I would just show up for the fight. Don't gotta gibra hoot about why it's happening.
---
Probably new water but classic everything else if I can. 
---
I like the new water.
---
My objective is to try to patch it down to sub-720p resolution and cap my fps at 15-20.
---
If it’s made by blizzard then it’s blizzlike. Every wow iteration has tons of bugs. Yes, some are major, while others are nitpicking and hopefully get fixed one day. I’m just happy to be able to play classic again.
---
Will hunters have a problem getting into later raids due to the poor scaling?
---
&gt;The past week or so has been insufferable "omg game is doomed, shit Blizzard, let's stick to private servers, Blizz fucking up"
---
The hilarious thing is that private servers have way more bugs and a lot of them will never be fixed because they can't do anything about it.
---
Yea and people will still downvote those that say “calm down it’s 2 months before release, they will fix it”
---
I'm horde all the way :) played it since wow began. Playing again with the same friends from all the way back then. We are pumped for the nostalgia of horde zones and characters. Also due to paladin bubbles and the fact that they were alliance specific, we have all shared a firm hatred of the class :p
---
Vanilla Rogues are a snooze fest to play compared to Wrath Feral.  Wrath Feral in Ulduar was to the point if you screwed up you fell halfway down the dps charts.  Vanilla Rogues cannot provide the same experience.
---
Always loved doing the Mallet of Zul Farrak chain
---
For me, this is the last great hoorah for World of Warcraft.  It is fantastic to be able to relive the days of 2005 when the game was actually rewarding and the community was so tight knit and awesome.  I have no faith that Blizzard will correct Modern WoW, so whatever happens we at least have one last good year with the original Classic we all know and love.  I haven't been this excited for a game in years.  Lads, let's make it count!  For the Horde!!!
---
I know he said viable. Cat DPS is not viable.
---
No, because their utility and ability to kite keeps them needed.
---
I was born in 96, luckily my first day playing World of Warcraft was during the end of Burning Crusade and I was god awful at it playing it on my potato (cliche but true). So technically I never got to play vanilla either, especially not the endgame. I played heavily in wrath when I was in high school, cata as well and I got pretty good and had the most fun with the game (because I played with irl friends) in panda. When WoD came out I gave up hope that the game would ever be good again and that’s when I stated looking into private servers. Played on the most popular one that got shut down for a little while and it really proved to me that the original version of the game was amazing and I missed it so much. Then they announced classic and I couldn’t believe it like anyone else. Now I’m getting a solid group of people together to play classic, we’re all at least 23, get serious jobs and starting our careers but we all want to make time for the game we love. The best game ever made IMO (up until wrath, looking back that’s when things started to go downhill but I still love wrath). My final point is, we come from totally different times in the game and have had different experiences, but we can both acknowledge the fact that classic is and will be amazing and we can both enjoy it and be immersed. Classic is for everyone, I’ll see you in Azeroth brother!
---
Getting to lvl 60 lmao
---
Tauren is the only one it makes sense for lore-wise but I started as a Belf pally so it always looked so alien to me
---
You either get a backport or you get nothing. Your choice.
---
Orc warrior in vanilla, orc warrior in classic
---
They changed the pvp gear to the honor currency system and everyone was grinding out grand Marshall weapons before BC. They also changed the talent trees and a few classes like feral druids, demo locks, and ret paladins were godly. 
---
Feral actually got nerfed because they could get super high crit and recieved heals with leader of the pack everytime they crit with no cooldown and healed for a large amount. I leveled a bear to 60 pulling packs of 8 mobs and swiping while never stopping to heal. 
---
Ret paladin could stun&gt;judge crit&gt; devine storm&gt;instant repentance&gt; heal up&gt; judge crit&gt;Devine storm. Blizzard actually said they wouldn't fix it because talents were balanced around 70 with resilliance gear. 
---
Pvp was super fun because everyone was Queing up because the gear was on par with AQ gear and no one knew what half the abilities actually did.
---
Awesome, does their poor scaling put them at the lower end if dps or just in the middle?
---
You either get this or you can stick to your private servers. Your choice.
---
Naxx
---
Going to main either discipline or shadow priest, thinking about trying a slower profession oriented route with enchanting and tailoring, paired with a warrior, feral, and rogue. If I could I'd convince my druid buddy to play mage and complete our group pvp synergy but it sounds like I will have no shortage of tank to heal in August.
---
Don't forget the text to speech binds either. THE HELICOPTER GOES SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI
---
For Hunters agility went from 1 agility = 2 ranged attack power to 1=1, removing Survival (+15% agility) as a viable DPS spec. They also removed the last vestige of pet uniqueness, making all pets of the same type the same.  
---
I will say The Beast Within was pretty good though. If I could choose one thing from TBC it'd be that.
---
Played alliance from vanilla to cata.  It’s time to experience the other side.
---
The howling vale is amazing, most people normally skip all the travelling. One time I decided to read and complete the chain and it's a really great story.
---
Carry a lot of items. Consumables, poisons, first aid. Soloing can be tough too, depends on down time between fights. It's fun to stealth  Gurubashi arena. It's been a long time so I can't remember all of it.
---
Probably dragonstalker shoulders. They were so cool-looking to me at the time, that once I got them, I felt like I had pretty much beaten the game.
---
Vanilla maintained the same FoV even at widescreen resolutions. It didn’t change the FoV based on your aspect ratio, it just stretched the image.
---
Leveling is a fair bit faster as hunter.
---
Gearing is easier as hunter, but your stat stick melee will be low priority compared to the people who swing them.
---
After BWL hunter dps drops, so lock is a lot better then. However, Tranq and other utility is still enough to keep you around.
---
Lock is easier to get invites as overall.
---
If you're looking for Vanilla Rogue to be like Wrath Feral I'm sorry, but you're going to be terribly disappointed.  If a challenge is your goal then Feral is it. If dps meters is your goal then enjoy rogue.  Cheers!
---
Too bad that dumb cow left his whole torso exposed. And it's much easier to move that extremely sharp steel than a giant blunt log. 
---
Looks like filet mignon is back in the menu boys !
---
Bwomsamdi?
---
Yes, because we should have utmost confidence in Blizzard since they have notoriously and consistently released polished, quality games and content for the last decade. Oh wait, they've done the complete opposite 100% of the time without fail. 
---
The fact that Pservers are able to fix issues in a more timely manner than blizzavision's bullshit is retarded. No complaint here, just stating the facts.

and so on. Blizzard has been a very very consistently shit company for a very long time now taking what were once great franchises and shitting on them. Listening to the shitstains of the community if anyone at all when considering moving forward. Releasing heavily unpolished games like Diablo3 just to meet financial goals, holy fuck was that game a disgrace. It still is, even though it's not even remotely the same game that was released, and not from features, they literally had to rebuild the game 50 times before the first expansion was even announced.
---
The company fucks everything up. It goes far beyond hunter and warlock pet bugs. Classic will be released on time, this we all know. However, it will be a massive turd out of the assholes of shareholders as a result. 
---
I hope they prove me wrong, I really fucking do. I loved vanilla and hated Blizzard for destroying WoW with their future greed. Had to let go in Wotlk, the game got entirely too retard bubbly emo weeb friendly for me so I moved on. Fingers crossed, but hopes are very low. Maybe I'll just go cut my dick off, watch some anime, and follow some homosexual streamers cry when they get ganked in world PvP.
---
That’s not entirely accurate. Hunters scale poorly, but Warlocks scale very well and only get stronger as you progress through raids. 
---
Hunter utility isn’t enough to make up for their decrease in DPS as you progress. Not nearly close enough to Warlocks.
---
On the real though we need a feral Druid for our guild, NA alliance pvp server east coast
---
Above the hybrid classes, but below Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and Warlock. 
---
Unless your guild is pushing content super hard, having an extra Hunter won't hold up progression.
---
I'm going to do my thing a try for my goals (make gold, collect mounts/items, PvP when bored) and pug raids where I can.
---
If I find some cool people and join a guild that's great. If not I can go without and just have acquaintances.
---
Nah, I wasn't expecting it to be just like it, but somewhat similar (mostly from a pvp point of view in terms of being able to stealth around and deal good single target dps with dots).  Rogue definitely wouldn't have the utility of a druid, that's for sure, with exception to sap but that's pretty limited in terms of usefulness.
---
Depends, they beat meme specs and lazy people, but if the raid is optimized you'll be pretty dang low.
---

Watch Barons videos on YouTube to get a feel for it and decide.
---
I got the launch week off work so I'm going to get to level 60 relatively quick and make friends with people I level and do dungons with at 60 find a guild that has already started raiding or is just about to and join them.
---
Joana made it to level 40 in 46 hours and 51 minutes in Vanilla, using a Hunter.
---
I've managed 39 hours and 12 minutes on the Classic Beta, using PServer routes, with a Rogue.
---
Even Joana thinks his record is going to get obliterated on launch week.
---
I'll be there on my warrior... For the Horde !
---
&gt;The fact that Pservers are able to fix issues in a more timely manner than blizzavision's bullshit is retarded. No complaint here, just stating the facts.
---
Name one private server that has less bugs than the beta right now?
---
Ya, never mind the part where the whole blood crazed race of orcs was literally corrupted by power and greed and concluded it was good idea to, you know, raid an entirely separate planet and to raid and pillage their way into a living. That is, of course, only after having enslaved the Draenei. But....I’m sure they had a good reason. Corruption and racism indeed!

Just because something is better, doesn’t mean it’s acceptable
---
But it’s good to hear that they’re working on it
---
I was too young (13?) and busy with other things to even make it to 60 when I played real vanilla. Had no goals besides just having fun. This time around I want to be filthy rich and make it rain on the dancers in Lion’s Pride Inn. Forget raiding, my end game will be grinding for sweet vendor loot and plundering underpricers on the AH to fund my army of 1, 19, and 29 twinks :)
---
Hope they know about these and are planning on fixing them. Only 2 months left for them to get it right.
---
True
---
Already have it bookmarked!
---
Am I the only one just admiring how pretty a screenshot this is?
---
The Orcs that did all that were under the influence of demon blood. They were not themselves and not true members of the Horde. The only reason they even came to Azeroth is because one of your heroes, your guardians, was also under the influence of the demons and showed them the way!
---
&gt;no more elite mobs
---
That was the beginning of the end for the leveling social experience in my eyes. Those areas required you to reach out and band together for what was essentially a mini dungeon.

none of these are fixed btw

I never said Warlocks didn't scale well. Just that the thing holding them back early on was tank threat. Which is very accurate.

Hunter utility is very helpful, and no content has such a tight dps check where you can't bring a few Hunters.

I personally think LFR did a lot of damage to the game that can't be reversed now.
---
Did *you*? It seems like you missed the part where he says he's going to try Balance leveling because it seems more interesting to him than Feral leveling. 
---
&gt;but I actually might try that too because it seems more interesting than Feral leveling, regardless of the constant drinking.
---
We might just both be misinterpreting each-other though. I think we both you and I are essentially saying the same thing here.
---
I played hunter in vanilla and made it to C’thun and most of the way through naxx. I had a horrible computer and lagged a lot and was able to keep up, never really topped the damage meters from what I remember. But I’m sure if you put in the effort to farm consumables you will be fine. The gear will be easy to get too.  As long as you get in a decent guild you will always have a spot in the raid.
---
This game comes out way too soon for all this to be fixed.
---
&gt;You need one of every spec of every class in the guild
---
Not really, no. You don't need a feral druid pretty much ever. There are a few encounters where it's nice, like Jin'do. But a guild definitely doesn't need one.

?  I loved running into rogues.
---
As easy to rob of mobility as a warrior, and with half the health!
---
It makes AV feel way more intense too. Having so many bones that you can't see the ground just feels awesome. It increases the scope of the BG and makes it feel like a real massive battle.
---
I hope they aren't thinking about keeping the bones out of the game because of computer performance. With this being Classic in 2019, any computer can run anything in the game on max graphics with no issues at all.
---
i started in late 06' my first character was a human holy pally. I stopped playing during the beginning of wotlk. I will recreate my original pally!! So many memories. Met some good people. I cant wait tbh. My gf has no idea whats about happen. She has no idea the old me who would nerd out until sun up laying down the l33t healz.
---
meanwhile on retail they want to get rid of horde and alliance...
---
Vanilla-lite
---
You don’t know how bad I wish my lady liked video games. She loves being social but doesn’t like video games. Still struggling with the idea of showing her WoW. She might like it since it’s a social experience.
---
Heck, even for dps races having the hunter on nightfall weaving duty is a +.

No chance that that a site which prides its self on pranks and false info campaigns is lying about this
---
It wasn't Kevin Jordan that saved Horde vs Alliance, he even credits Allen Adham in this video!
---
Grand marshal.   Will I ever reach it??   Only if I end up unemployed.
---
Probably start with the classic for the nostalgia then turn the graphics up.
---
thats funny because i played vanilla through wrath and in my 1-10 stress test i reported and compiled (see my post history) many, many bugs.
---
I grew up Horde on Gurubashi before the br takeover and remember that pair well
---
Oh preach bro! But I missed the part where it was the alliance that bullied Gul’dan which caused him to willfully act as avatar for the largest threat to the universe because he was too much of a bitch to find his own self esteem in shaman school. Proceeded to corrupt his entire race and invade a planet that wasn’t his own. I bet you think the native Americans were the protagonists in the settling of America’s too 😂. 
---
Listen, I’m not making the case that allies haven’t done their share but the horde and their leaders  are most certainly not blameless in this universe...
---
5+ is gonna get real on my priest without a wand
---
It also gets shit fixed, so you take the good with the bad.
---
Holy shit Im hyped now
---
Feels like exactly my chain of events lol. What class are you thinking?
---
It would be nice to see Barrens chat filled up with 15-year-old memes.
---
Whatever era the memes come from, we'll still have Thunderfury and Mankrik's wife.
---
&gt;Blizzard will most likely iron out minor kinks
---
you mean like the *legion* of pet bugs in beta that have been in present in retail for literal years?
---
Are those watercolor pencils? Blasphemy!
---
I played forsaken lol
---
&gt;It looks bad on stream when no one is playing the beta.
---
That's not the purpose of beta.
---
If they keep it up, and we get a better game?
---
Keep it up.
---
I never got gold capped before they changed the technological hindrance making it 214,748 gold 36 silver and 47 copper.
---
I hope they artificially added the limit back in.
---
Not sure tbh.
---
Could be.
---
Just that dick behavoiur describes them well.
---
Source: ex Goon
---
This is a wonderful opinion
---
I agree, they should shut it down until I get an invite. Then when I get burned out they can close it off again.
---
The main downside to rogues is that they can't tank or heal. While playing as a feral durid I can do either in case of emergency.
---
During the stress test I got out of a BG and has my pet on aggressive so when i ran past the horde flight master my imo shit him and i got murdered
---
Sorry for not responding right away. I see exactly what you’re saying and I think you’re right like 90%. I remember when I got rank 13 in vanilla on my rogue, walking into a 1v3 when they weren’t expecting a fight was usually successful. Saps, blinds and thistle teas, and all the other fun things, I’m trying to convince myself to play hunter in classic but I’m having a hard time
---
&gt;If Redditors are good at one thing, it's complaining.
---
True, but moderators on most subreddits are just as good at squashing complaining
---
I had that mount to. Probably won't be doing that.
---
The Horde leaders are absolutely blameless. Thrall grew up a slave of The Alliance!
---
And they never would have been able to cross into Azeroth if it weren't for Medivh's corruption.
---
squeaky wheel gets the grease
---
&gt; private servers have way more bugs
---
Are private servers the new standard?
---
How about Vanilla being the standard? A remastered game shouldn't have *more* bugs.
---
Beta is for testing, not for playing or entertaining
---
How's auto shot doing? If I can bail on my secondary class choice list, I'd very much like to do that.
---
Considering how a bunch of hunter hotfixes just went through and are being tested, I couldn't disagree more with the need for an active beta.
---
As for appearances, the streamer advertising is clearly worth more than a seat-filling issue imo.
---
More invites would probably be good, but I'm sure Blizz knows how much feedback they can process by now.
---
Oh wow I'm glad that the weird strafing animation is a bug, I noticed it when playing the stress test and swore it never used to look so janky. Good post
---
B-B-B-B-B-BUT IT'S PART OF THE CLASSIC EXPERIENCE!
---
N-N-N-NO CHANGES!!!!1111
---
As a CPA I found this exchange pretty humorous. Blahs is saying to get to the number of warriors to shaman for ratio purposes, you effectively need to cut the value roughly in half to account for shamans being faction locked.
---
That means on horde, shamans will be one of the most popular. At the same time, the total number of players playing shaman will be less than warrior, but that relative mix only matters for the number of horde warriors.
---
[Here's](https://clips.twitch.tv/HumbleAgileArugulaM4xHeh) the PVP clip. Kevin is now a full-time streamer -- check him out!!!! [https://www.twitch.tv/kevinjordan](https://www.twitch.tv/kevinjordan)
---
Was sure I’d roll a warrior and try to MT because I wanted to fulfill my childhood dream of tanking with thunderfury. 
---
Yet with being an adult now and working full time and doin college classes I don’t want to be the dude who screws over the guild with real life getting in the way.
---
So I was sure of going warlock as I only focus on a single set of gear which locks are great dps and amazing in pvp.
---
Now I’m thinking shaman as I’ll have to go heals for pve but what has me hooked is the fun elemental face melting chain lightning in pvp. The burst looks too fun.
---
Decisions decisions.
---
I think that he was in some random place guarded by nagas, but there wasn't really anything going on with that, like they had planned the questline out, but didn't have time to implement the rest of it
---
well to test you have to play the game guy
---
That passive bug effected my hunter I was playing last in BFA and it was never fixed the entire time. It was so frustrating my pet ended up in passive so much for no reason. Glad to see they fixed it for here.
---
Ok, well let's say that's true. What do you think the ratio dollar for dollar is in favor of Blizzard to Private servers? 
---
Let's say these private servers have a budget of $500,000 for dealing with these issues (but in reality we know the budget is closer to $0 give or take about $10). What do you think Blizzard is working with? How much of that money do you think went directly to advertising the release day and generate hype? How much of that money went to meeting their goals on release?
---
My thought it their goals on release aren't to give people a polished and flawless gaming experience, but instead to generate a shitload of hype to generate as much "fast money" as they can. I believe, and you can quote me on this, that Blizzard is completely content with releasing a turd as long as they can bring in a bunch of new subscribtions and renewal of expired subscriptions that exceeds whatever it cost for them to spread their buttcheeks and squeeze out this soon to be pile of shit. 
---
Think what you want, speculate as much as you need to, but if you'd like to know what's going to happen to Classic from the day of launch onward just look at the track record of the last decade+
---
Blizzard isn't Blizzard anymore, Activision doesn't care about doing anything more than bleeding the franchise dry. As long as they get the money they could care less, they have bigger and better things going on. This is unimportant to them. What is important to you and me is just a dollar figure to them, and they know that it's at it's end. This is the last breath WoW has. It's done. Forever. Maybe they will sell the rights to someone else after they've sucked every penny out of it and it can be revived by people who care.
---
They've been developing WoW for 10+ years. Not developing a single patch of WoW for 10+ years. Every Expansion after BC was an absolute let down spiraling into this casual "WoW is for everybody let's all be friends and log in every week for our free epics" style of play. It's over. It's done. A few months after Classic is released will be the final nail in the coffin. 
---
I look forward to the downvotes, I'll repost these exact words timestamped 3 months after Classic is released and we can compare notes.
---
It wasn’t the taunt that made them viable, it was Spiritual Attunement giving them 10% of healed HP back as mana.  Taunt is of course a basic tool, but wasn’t the chief problem with protadins.  Keeping mana up and threat scaling was.  
---
The big bonus with BC was that ALL the specs became viable.  Perhaps not ideal, but not as GTFO as things like OOMkins, Prot Paladins, and shadow priests (barring the token shadow weaver).
---
This sounds awesome! Keep in mind you can also skip a lot of content by stealthing through it.
---
&gt;They should have done an NDA on beta and not allowed people to stream it
---
Why? Streaming has only increased the hype for Classic.
---
https://i.imgur.com/3RS9KD8.png
---
They need to increase the level cap to level 60 and invite more players for more hype and testing imo. Viewership is only going down because the level cap is at 40.
---
Well it *is* layering, but used differently from the current system. Difference being each layer would serve as a subset of a server which players can *choose* from. Silvermoon #1-2-3-4 would each be seperated but share *data (hence why it's still layering)*, and by the time of phase 1, it would end up as Silvermoon e.g one server.
---
Nah, let the streamers do their thing. Most people are itching to play regardless of who is in Beta atm or not. Your character goes away after so many don't want to commit or don't have the time to commit to a player that will disappear in a month. Also, for the streamers this is their one time to play and not have the world population hunting them.
---
I was referring to the total amount of players not faction specific. i can't revall anyone specifying horde/alliance only. Aporeciate the outsider input though
---
Jesus, did ANYONE hit gold cap in vanilla? I could see doing it in TBC or WOTLK if that was still the cap.
---
High levels of competition as a DPS and high levels of responsibility as a tank. Some people just want a more laid back experience.
---
2 Druids + Rogue would be better.
---
i heard they are combining osrs and classic
---
Even better, dont be a narrow back and play with the high voltage. 200k a year easy.
---
I actually used to love turning back and forth slightly and making the legs dance.
---
Oh I know! That’s why I found it funny. You two were arguing apples and oranges.
---
*That fuckin Mor'Ladim isn't that tough, he's green! Here, hold my beer!*
---
For dungeons you will need to over prep by a fair amount to 3 man with that comp.
---
Once you're at cap farming runs should be plenty fine, but split 3 ways it's kinda lame.
---
Another case of viable and potentially fun, but far from optimal imo.
---
One time I laughed so hard I milked all over the floor.
---
&gt;Are private servers the new standard?
---
Simply saying this because people have been saying "Let's go back to private servers after Classic WoW dies in phase 1".
---
Yes, my class leader did. He was a wizard at the Auction House. Had a complete monopoly over several markets.
---
I don't doubt that, though we would lose out on (in my opinion) the *cool* factor and travelling speed mismatch.
---
Horde. Everyone talking about races, but shaman are so far superior to paladins in world pvp. Ignoring the damage specs since they're more selfish, the amount of utility an ele/resto sham brings is absolutely insane compared to a healing paladin. So many totems for every situation, ranged interupts on a short cd, and able to LB/CL for some added heavy burst. What's your paladin going to do? Bubble hearth?
---
Interesting! I didn't know that because I didn't have a widescreen monitor at the time.
---
off topic, but I remember losing my shit the first time i saw a devilsaur.
---
Overall, I think I like this idea, a new arch on how I have [previously stated progression should exist](/r/classicwow/comments/c0hqdc/scaling_to_retail/er4t3ol/).  
---
Perhaps I'm missing where this is stated, but if I am on my L2-EXP2 character and get a shitty little "Robe of Way Better Than L60-EXP1 gear", does my L60-EXP1 character back on the old server also get to wear that robe?  
---
My preference would be no, same for mounts, gold etc.
---
Omfg thank you so much!!!
---
Yeah, if you had a Rogue, one of you would be cool. Not really fair to the other two forced to roll Droolid.
---
That's amazing. What class was he?
---
Fair point. 
---
I still think he’d have an easier time getting into raids with a Warlock. I suppose it depends on how much value he placed on DPS over utility.
---
This mindset is so weird to me. If you love to play the class then you should play it. 
---
Will you be expected to heal in raids? **Sure you will**. But if you enjoy druid then you must enjoy being versatile and dynamic, something you can still be while healing.
---
On top of that there are plenty of specs such as [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxhxscMdxxxsoxo) that allow you to perform well healing raids while being able to tank/dps/farm/whatever the hell you want outside of them.
---
If you are a player who wants to have 1 job while leveling and in 5-mans and in raids then druid just isn't the class for you after all.
---
A closed mouth don't get fed &amp; a lazy hustler don't get bread!
---
Paladin/Lock gets their epic mount *instantly* at 20.  Everyone else has to go train for it.  But don't worry, they give you a quest to go talk to the riding trainer so you don't forget...
---
what's the ponit of getting fit if there is classic bruh ?
---
Gul’Dan is at LEAST as equally to blame as Medivh in the dark portal episode. If Gul’dan wasn’t in Outland ready to answer the call then medivh’s opening the portal wouldn’t have mattered. Horde and it’s leaders most definitely aren’t blameless.
---
Rogue.
---
My understanding is it was so low to maximize the amount of layer transitions that happened.
---
Does discord have a way to have multiple voice coms at the same time? 
---
I remember being in the main raids voice coms but had a separate button I could press to just talk to my boys within the guild not the whole raid. It was pretty fun shit talking the guild leader when he was being dumb. Only got me in trouble a couple times
---
Imagine being this obsessed with streamers.
---
My mage being a solo class again. Never understood why they gave us a pet as frost. If I wanted a pet, I'd play a warlock or hunter. If I recall correctly, there was a class panel talk at the first Blizzcon that specifically said mages shouldn't have pets. 
---
Note: I have literally no idea if it's still like this or not. I quit WoW long ago.
---
😂
---
Pmuch, sub is full of blizzdrones who cannot fathom that wow is below 1m subs for a reason, Classic is already ruined with all the changes to it. You have a core fanbase that hates leveling and asks for classic, the disappointment will be massive.
---
They changed epic riding down from 40 to 20? Good Lord.
---
ahahahahah.
---
thx, i will!
---
Is it fair to say that, relative to other classes, Druid gear is less important given Bear/Cat form? Perhaps it would actually make sense to have someone go Leatherworking?
---
Booty muncher
---
I did a stealth edit there to clarify, I got the epic mount at 20 but I think it was only 60% riding speed.  I can't actually look it up to be sure at the moment.
---
Yeah, he's not been afraid to admit that. Especially a mage that gets out ahead of everyone and aoe farms empty spots. It's the kind of thing that can only happen on a fresh server. I love Joanna, but anyone who thinks his previous world record means anything in Classic has not been paying attention.
---
Most people only bring 1 in WSG and in AB it’s entirely possible you’re relegated to farm duty.
---
liiiiiiiiiive
---
wiiiiiiiiiiin
---
....right...cuz they were tempted by their Lust for power and then were corrupted. Like “oh ya, I was totally blameless cuz it was the meth I decided to take that made me break into that dude’s apartment and eat his throat out of his neck. Not my fault...all I did was the meth.”
---
You're totally right - but what was a bit lost in the initial clip here is that HE was the one to convince Allen Adham, who then convinced the rest of the team. The PVP clip I commented touches on this a bit more.
---
I could clip it for you when the VOD goes up later tonight where Kevin says that he often would be the one to convince Allen and then Allen would convince everyone else lol. Both GOATS for sure.
---
Thank you for the clarification. Idc whose side you choose but enjoy the upvotes. Imo were right in our own perspectives.
---
Gul'Dan is not a member of the Horde that Thrall created.
---
Thrall = blameless.
---
Cairne = blameless.
---
Vol'jin = blameless.
---
Sylvanas = blameless.
---
&gt; Skeletons is a HUGE deal. 
---
Literally unplayable.      
---
Not seeing more skeletons on the ground is a deal breaker. Going back to private servers now. So sad.
---
You misspelled Orc.
---
Might just be a scaling issue that could be fixed by level 60 ... will have to wait and see till beta users get to 60 to tell for sure.
---
This reminds me of an Undead (either shadow priest or warlock I can't remember) on Burning Legion named Turtles who terrorized us in Westfall
---
If you read that leak and believe parts of it then you should know that classic will fail.
---
Ive seen stream sniping pan out in other open world games.. almost inevitably the streamers end up having to log on to alts or hide information or put on a delay because.. sure, the warzone might be interesting the first few times.. or the group of 5 stealthed rogues might be cute.. 
---
but it starts to affect 'the content' and mood of the streamer and then they bail first because it starts to become something that isn't fun to watch at all.
---
Really any caster after 5,
---
Yo Krafty, hook me up with that discord.  I played as Mourgan,  looking to fire up classic!
---
They're also good cloth-wearing healers.
---
Then you hear the unmistakable clack of a cheap shot.
---
Can you turn on the spot without moving your legs at all?
---
Gear is relatively less important yeah.
---
Your call on weather it's worth losing out on the gold potential from other professions.
---
No one will take you to premades for pvp because rogues suck if you are mediocre, you need to be EXTREMELY good and dedicated then rogue is amazing.
---
PvE you are fury warriors but worse.
---
&gt; Is this a cause for concern? 
---
No. It's not a cause for concern at all. There are also a ton of benefits to using the newer engine. The game looks better. It runs better. And it has big improvements to looting and bag/inventory management.    
---
Not everyone cares that the animation looks slightly different. Or that one waterfall pool has less water in it.
---
This sounds awesome. I'm jealous
---
Ohh, as in it has the model of the epic one but moves like the normal one?
---
That's...a little less sad, I guess.
---
Sounds fun but it's going to be a lot of work. Druid isn't the easiest class to play, especially when you're swapping forms on the fly and performing all the roles at once. You're going to need a bunch of macros to cancel your forms and cast spells quicker. 
---
Aside from that though the biggest downsides to this is going to be constantly running out of mana and having to slow down to drink. Shapeshifting takes a bunch of mana, especially at lower levels. It may make more sense for 2 of you to stay in Bear form while one goes resto/feral hybrid, that'll make it easier on the healer. 
---
Or alternatively later on 2 of you can go balance to AoE farm with Hurricane large packs of enemies while one goes bear form.
---
Oh yeah there's also the gear problem, you're going to have to run dungeons a lot to gear up 3 of the same classes.
---
well done!  
---
now... just a map without any flight paths. something i'd actually want to use as a background or print.
---
Seems completely and utterly pointless
---
Clearly is Tanaris with the turtles in the picture.
---
Remastering is far from copy paste. They're going to encounter bugs as if this were a new expansion, because it's essentially building old wow on a current framework.
---
No, but I'm not talking about that issue. I'm talking about the stealth gliding.
---
He could've simply have asked for the year directly..
---
Huntards who need everything will sort themselves out. At some point you they won’t get into groups. 
---
If you score a shield with Stam and Spirit (thanks vanilla itemisation) then both roll need of course. Assuming it’s an upgrade for them.
---
&gt;Why? Because both blizzard and players have given up on trying to make the game fun. The focus is all on the dopamine rush at the end, for achieving the goal. The idea of the grind itself being enjoyable isn't even part of the conversation anymore. They just want to finish it faster.
---
Because you are saying that the playstyle that doesn't involve questing, traveling, and leveling are a negative.
---
I’m just speculating here, but layering will most likely stop somewhere around level 30. By the time these huge stream snipe battles take place people will be at lvl 40 when everyone has a mount.
---
No. But you could set that up in a Skype call or something.
---
You bring in less and less hunters. You bring in more Warlocks than Hunters in the later stages.
---
Can someone make a wallpaper engine out of this?!
---
I wonder if the skeleton issue is due to the layering mechanic..
---
Also, am I correct in remembering player corpses that lasted days/weeks?  Back in vanilla, when I first started playing, I feel like I remember a horde corpse (who had not released, but apparently logged out while dead, so not a skeleton) actually persisted outside of either IF or SW front gates for what seemed like days or weeks, if not longer.. Was that a thing or am I remembering wrong?
---
Its also likely going to thread content between the old game and the new one. Its a garaunteed back up that can fill content droughts and gives them more development time to make a BETTER retail game. 
---
BFA was bad cause it was rushed, and hopefully now will be at least ok after 8.2. If they get this free extra dev time, it can only be good for the health of the game.
---
phase 1
---
My old account is stuck on my mom's old email somewhere, so I figured I might as well save myself the trouble. There's probably a recruitment bonus for new players(?)
---
t. started first week of EU launch and quit a few weeks before TBC.
---
my cat sleeps in my arms, sits on my lap when I game, and shits on my floor if i dont clean his box twice a day. I love him.
---
Are you sure its not a monitor issue?
---
I’m gonna be spending 6 days backpacking in the Canadian rockies... you all have fun without me. At least I won’t have trouble finding mobs to kill...
---
classic wow = murlocks are farmed to death by aoe mages pulling pack of 10 at a time.
---
Jokes on you, I just got a beta invite today on two accounts...
---
Neither of which are even subbed to BFA.
---
Arugal must die!
---
Not easily setup, but you can do it in a roundabout way with multiple accounts.
---
Something seems way off with classic.
---
I did 1-15 in 4 hours 12 minutes with a human pally on the stress test.  Way faster than I remember any times on pservers.
---
Even past the starting zones, mobs barely ever parried or dodged, and I rarely ever missed.  I have to use a health potion, bubble and/or lay on hands on pservers to solo Hogger, but on classic stress test, I did it with just a health potion.
---
Hm you overlooked the fact that I didn’t get into the beta, so I also think it should be shut down.
---
Classic settings and maybe turned up lighting and shadows.
---
I trust 4chan about as much as the shoeless dude on the corner yelling at street signs. I reckon there's probably some overlap there.
---
Not sure if I’m 100% remembering correctly but my favorite quest was the quest for getting the last stage of the first aid profession.
---
Basically had to triage a bunch of dying soldiers. Idk why but it was a good challenge with a solid reward and didn’t matter what gear you had.
---
I suppose. I just really liked vent.  I’ll probably like discord once I start using it
---
I think the decrease skeleton timer is to reduce lag on the server.
---
All of the mounts scale with your riding/flying speed these days.  99% of mount differences are only cosmetic, except for things like the Sky Golem (which can pick herbs without dismounting) and the Water Strider (which can cross water).  But they're taking away those differences soon with 'mount equipment' which will let you use one feature (like mounted gathering or water walking) whenever you are mounted.  But those features won't be mount-specific, you choose one and it applies to every mount until you choose a different one, the goal being to make mount choice 100% cosmetic in the future.
---
Dm at 15 is rough, that's your problem there for sure. You're right to down rank, but the reason it's amazing is because in vanilla the spells scaled MUCH better. For example + healing is like 1-1 on any rank, so your flash of light at 60 let's say is 500 heal+150 in bonus, but your rank 1 is 50+150 and almost casts instantly. It's also almost free to the point where your mp5 eventually will love faster than your mana spent. You will spam like rank 3-5 mostly and Max crit. Paladins get their Mana back from crits, at one point you got 100% Mana spent returned. So Max crit and enjoy the free healing xD I pretty much always topped the healing charts, mc-naxx which I did actually raid.  But in low levels you have to just holy light and prey your DPS is good enough to burn down the mobs haha. You can cycle in hoj/repentance when you get them to reduce damage in tank.
---
Classic wow won't be the same as vanilla wow.
---
But you're ignoring my point.  You are choosing to invest rather than pay down a debt.  With that logic, it is best to never pay down the debt and continue to invest the equity.  The 3.75% interest is less than expected return from a mutual fund.  But yet no one does this...  nobody mortgages a paid off house to invest in mutual funds,  so why would I use a large down payment to invest in mutual funds.
---
Dno, that's why I'm asking
---
Basically I’d really like to have a voice com for my rl friends and anyone we meet along the way and like and then be in the raid voice com at the same time
---
Pservers are way harder. Classic is a joke.
---
you think it's unlikely that they're going to put the tools to import data that they've been building for the last two years to additional work?
---
Cool idea. My concerns are the long res timers. Gearing up may take longer because you guys are on the same loot table. Raiding spots.
---
And you cackle, because you were just bait for the priest to mind control the rogue into the lava.
---
Use the battle net app to talk with your friends and use discord for raiding.
---
God damn, that fucking place. It is my favorite location in all of wow, or maybe in any game ever.  My first ever toon was undead rogue Orokusaki on Blood Furnace. We made a guild named TheFootClan and would duel in the arena there all day. We called the Lev there off to the side “Tatsu” and we would just hang out in vent and spend hours there doing nothing, and then go back to ganking in southsore. Most fun I’ve ever had in wow revolves around that unfinished ninja castle hideaway that is so so beautiful and rad but so tragically unfinished.
---
So?
---
In short, they are the best AoE farmers in the game. Their AoE is high DPS and sustainable, and once Dire Maul comes out this further increases their advantage. Here's a sample of what can be done:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6xMarzdU-w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6xMarzdU-w)
---
Ehm. You can’t compare those elitist cave dwellers, who has played vanilla since vanilla days and only played warrior. They can level while blindfolded...
---
I have a i7 8800k gtx 2070 and 32gb ram but for some.reason my wow runs at 50fps at max settings. 200% super sample highest AA and something else set to high in the advance tab.
---
My buddy gets 133 with the exact same setup. Any thoughts?
---
That would be flat out amazing.  I lovvve me some TBC.  WotLK too...
---
This is very wrong. Fury Warriors are amazing DPS and any good guild will bring a bunch of them
---
True, true.
---
~90 hours is bullshit first off, that'd be world record time. I'v played on pservers. 1-5 isn't hard...what the actual fuck are you even going on about.
---
Do any mobs in BFA still flee when low health?
---
Setup a discord server for your friends and whoever else. Use one account for that.
---
Join the guild/raid discord with the other account.
---
Run one on the desktop app, the other on the web app.
---
Your guild isnt doing a day 1 capitol invasion?
---
Always been partial to The Legend of Stalvan. Going to abandoned locations unraveling the story always felt kinda cozy to me.
---
"Proven" as more of the beta comes out it shows more and more how pservers are wrong. pservers had bosses parry chance wrong for quite some time.
---
I understand that WotF is nice, but a passive Stun resist in PvP is superior. There are far more sources of stuns in organized PvP than fear. If you were doing 1v1 world pvp I could see undead over orc.
---
Even with max settings I was getting 300-350 FPS on stress test and my GPU was going crazy.
---
I'll probably be maxxing the FPS at 200 or 250.
---
mages can be faster than hunter, and joana record has been broken
---
I've reverse downvoted you
---
I simply must disagree. Did I miss the vote where the community suddenly decided that they all love Vanilla models and textures over retail graphics?
---
*I just don't understand why* people literally want a downgrade in graphics.. 
---
inb4 "*But nostalgia memberberries!*"
---
Nostalgia will get you to try classic again, but I don't see how it will persist for players through months/years of playing again..
---
Not that WoW is a graphical powerhouse or anything. Obviously, it's a bit cartoonish in its graphics but I don't think anybody would vote to downgrade retail graphics to the state of vanilla/classic.. So what's the difference? Would giving Classic WoW the new textures/models actually change the gameplay or mechanics of the game? Please help me understand
---
I never said they weren't good. But going into classic with no intention of tanking at all is the wrong way to go about it. Warriors are tanks first and dps second...
---
The gliding is vanilla-like, and what people got used to.
---
There are many differences between vanilla and current WoW where the latter implementation is objectively better, but the goal isn't to make the best version of WoW possible - goal is to make it as close to vanilla 1.13 as possible.
---
I agree that leveling and dungeons were harder in Vanilla, but they had to be. Vanilla needed to have it's content drawn out over a much longer period than each expansion should. You don't want people maxing out within a week of a brand new MMO, but you also don't want people to be waiting months to be able to start endgame content of a new xpac when they've been doing raids for awhile. Over time they've slimmed the classes so they *can* have more complicated boss fights, and one of the negative impacts was affecting the way classes leveled.
---
 I don't really agree with all of the changes over the years, but I understand why they would shift the philosophy from slow, hard, grindy leveling to easier leveling with a bigger focus on getting to end game.
---
I've actually spent a lot of time thinking about this and unless there's I'm mistaken about the mechanics, you should be able to use a fire/frost hybrid spec to farm dungeons with aoe flamestrike/blastwave shatter combos, in theory (again unless there's something I'm missing) ignite stacking mechanics would allow for insane top end dps with this method. Although you might have trouble with bosses and certain ranged mobs, I have a sense that especially with 3+ mages this could potentially be an very effective method for both leveling and farming.
---
That's awesome! The friend who will be on most with me is rolling a hunter, so this makes me excited!
---
Quality jpg, but most of the analysis here is not relevant to the patch classic is running un/fortunately.
---
&gt; I'm not sure where you got the idea that I work for Youtube 
---
Okay sounds like you don't actually know then.
---
Ya it could be. Sucks for leveling tho.
---
But the world record was set by a troll
---
I mean sure if that sounds fun to you go for it. You don't really have any CC because roots isn't usable in 95% of dungeons and beasts are rare. It is rare you'd want to stealth past anything in 5mans while levelling. Your aim is to kill stuff, not skip it.    
---
If you wanted a good group for this you'd go warrior + (pally/shaman) + (rogue/hunter/warrior). Casters run into  mana issues when your dps is low (such as when 3 manning instances). Not being able to make use of any good weapons/mail/plate gear would be pretty annoying when you'll get a lot of good gear drops doing instances.
---
I wish, I hate discord. So many more instances of ...discord occur by having people sit around waiting for a game and having a permanent chat readily available.
---
I'd imagine there would be a certain level breakpoint where you could respec to that spec and deal good damage. Would probably be terrible for single target though
---
Follow-up: this is a kick ass post. Thanks so much!
---
As more info about mobs comes out of the beta the more proof there is that the pservers were harder... The raid bosses might be harder than pservers but the normal mobs out in the world are easier, there's literally no two ways about it.
---
Mage is never favored against a Druid. If you want to add grenades to a Mage (which are not even close to a guaranteed win, but for the sake of argument we'll say they are), then we can add a Free Action Potion to the Druid. There is always something the Druid can do that the Mage has no answer to. It's a counter for a reason.
---
Oh shit, a Warsong throwback. I was just reminiscing the other day about Avatar but couldn’t remember CH’s name before they transferred off. I Mained alliance and was in &lt;Divine Right&gt; through TBC until eventually the server turned BR/Russian basically by the time I came back in cata.
---
If you mean autoshot being straight up broken if you had a quiver equipped and then did a non-ranged abilities, that was fixed a while ago.
---

---
Yo shout out for the Telefon Tel Aviv track as the background! This one is so nice
---
Why can't the tank just be a tank, the dps be a dps, and the healer be a healer? Why all the switching? You're spreading yourselves too thin.
---
Using that same logic, current alliance leaders are all blameless as well.
---
The legal team in Activision Blizzard will continue to arbitrarily send C&amp;D letters for the sole sake of justifying their salaries.
---
Nothing will change on the company end; they've shut down servers with max primetime head counts of 30 players. Whether a private server is popular or not is not in the equation other than how fast it's detected.
---
&gt;This mindset is so weird to me. If you love to play the class then you should play it. 
---
I also love playing other classes as well. I was on the fence so I fell to the other side. Ive played a bunch of specs on druid on different ps.
---
Pure DPS is the fucking bomb.  I played pally and shaman in Vanilla into BC and always felt mediocre.  Sure I had raid support, but it’s not measurable.
---
Mained a mage from BC through Cata.  Never touching a hybrid again.  You can blow shit up, because all your awesome cool downs revolve around blowing shit up.  Every pure DPS class has their own upside.  Mages will the cool APE farming, portals and water income.  Rogues have their flair for PvP and always chosing when to fight.  Hunter pets tank and they can solo crazy shit.  Warlocks have some of the same benefits as hunters with pet utility, as well as a dash of DoT Farming, soulstones.
---
I’d say the outliers to the hybrid vs pure dps class would be Priests and Warriors.  Their specialty is amplified in Vanilla.  Priests are “the” healing class while warriors are “the” tanking class.  Priests can MC people to death while warrior dps is theoretically the highest in Vanilla raid sims.
---
After playing mage for so long, my debate was rogue or warrior.  Leaning warrior for the tanking aspect.  If I PvPed more it’d be undead rogue all the way.  I honestly see myself running more 5 mans then battlegrounds.
---
Only downside to pure DPS is the wait for groups.  It’s hard to find them dungeons groups unless you form it yourself.
---
I'd say does anyone remember Moddex from Arthas-US but hes still active from what I understand... And was, up until the Warmode change still regularly camping Nesingwarys and Thrallamar.
---
And of course Mesa from Dragonblight-US, while Dragonblight was PvE, you could be damn sure if there was a World Boss up. It was coming to a city near you! (Until they chained them to their areas)
---
Favorite quest: probably the entire stitches quest line in darkshire. Favorite zone with quest is a tie between duskwood and ungoro crater. When you hit level 50 you start to feel endgame kick in for your character. the quests are all so fluid and you can easily go from 50-52 in like a day making huge progress
---
Of all people you asked Payo to fact check something.
---
Dude, for real
---
"Blizzard never fixes any bugs lol, what are you talking about" any time anyone was optimistic
---
I remember reading that originally they were going to have a third faction. Horde and Alliance which had dropped their standing in their faction far enough would just be hostile to everyone except neutral cities. Might explain the goblin auction houses a bit.
---
Asskandy hands down.
---
Unless your guild is pushing bleeding edge, you take reliable raiders who put in the work. (with in reason)
---
??? The melting represents forming in-game social bonds
---
Regarding the patch, I didn't care about it. It's not the focus of the article. It's just missing the past. If you want to know about the patch, it might be helpful to check other things :)

\_\_Basic Information\_\_
---
\*\*Raid Days/Times\*\*: Tuesday/Wednesday/Sunday 630pm-10pm PST (930pm-1am EST). However, it is likely that we will only raid two of those days until the release of ZG due to limited content initially. I expect that we'll be able to clear MC/BWL in the same night within a few months.
---
\*\*Server\*\* NA (likely Central) PVP realm to be decided pending announcement.
---
\*\*Guild Structure\*\*: GM and 4 Officers, as well as class leads for Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Hunter, Warlock, and one overall Healer leader.
---
\*\*Transparent loot council\*\*: GM, Officers, and class leads will form the loot council. Loot council spreadsheet will be viewable by all members, and you will know where you stand in line for each piece of gear you want before you set foot in the raid, there will be no surprises when someone gets an item. If you disagree with the council's decision, speak to an officer before raid night.
---
\_\_Expectations\_\_
---
\*\*Professions\*\*: Engineering is a uniquely beneficial profession in Classic. Having many engineers in the raid can improve DPS dramatically with items like Goblin Sapper Charge, Battle Chicken, and Arcanite Dragonling.
---
\*\*Attendance\*\*: Attendance will be tracked via spreadsheet and will be a KEY factor in loot decisions. Members must attend 80% of all raids or higher to maintain the rank of Raider.
---
\*\*Gearing/Consumables\*\*: Min/max your pre-bis. Enchants are expected on any item pre-bis or higher. Consumables vary by class, but are expected to be used for each boss fight.

---
This does help, a lot. Thanks, very appreciated!
---
A mage will not get the first sixty
---
You serious?
---
Many of these changes were late tbc and not early.
---
In a nut shell.
---
I don't think it would necessarily be terrible for single target. Frost nova -&gt; 3x pyroblast fireblast would be huge burst and leave an even bigger ignite dot, repeat indefinitely alternating novas. Bosses would be another story however.
---
If that's going to ruin a game for you then maybe it would be best to just avoid it altogether.
---
Not really. TBC private servers are a lot less popular than Vanilla private servers, and I think the reason for that is because levels 1-58 is almost exactly the same as they are on a Vanilla server. 
---
You level up a bit more quickly in TBC, you get your mount a bit sooner, and some classes have a few extra tricks up their sleeves after level 50 or so (when they get their 41-point talents), but for the most part: Vanilla is part of the TBC experience. It's not a new game until you reach Outland.
---
OP never said when he leveled in TBC. It could have been after the XP nerf.
---
I'm broke af in beta, but if I can snag some spell power and nature dmg items for cheap, ill test it on my 40 rogue.
---
I plan on running instances while I level at the ideal raid time for me and friend the good players. Try to pull them in for future instance runs and try to connect with a few players at a time. 
---
I will then look where they end up at max level. After I join a guild, I will pull from that list to help fill out the roster.
---
Or I will just stalk all the leaders of the various top guilds and invite them to instance runs.
---
Why not just use in game voice chat?
---
Sorry, I meant for solo out in the world.
---
I think the beauty of 3/3 Imp blizz build is that you don't lose a lot of single target power or efficiency compared to frostbite with 5/5 shatter.
---
In my tests it's maybe 10-20%\~ worse
---
Tested on Beta. Poisons have absolutely no scaling with +spell damage or +nature damage.
---
It's so bad ass. And extra procs in pvp ;)
---
*cough* Garrosh *cough*....😬
---
I came all the way down here to tell you haphazardly is the word you were looking for.
---
Doesn't exist in the one true WoW.
---
There are a lot of fanatics on this sub and they're certifiably crazy. This person just said this animation would ruin the game.
---
Who really cares at this point. It's small Potatos compared to the fact that layering will ruin the game.
---
Follow up: your post just made me so excited to play a druid!!!
---
Remember 2 days ago when everyone thought layers would doom the experience and Blizzard wouldnt touch anything?
---
Looks like we got the ole infamous QUAD32 on our hands here guys and gals. Real piece of work she is.
---
Don't worry you won't see skeletons anyways because they will be on separate layers
---
Afaik they lasted until server restart.
---
Dude, you know there are some quests you don't have to do right? just skip the shitty bottleneck quests and grind some mobs. In the stress test i skipped gold dust/candle quest because of how fucked it was and still got to westfall at level 11
---
I am ok with not being real dps, my problem is with how boring leveling a paladin is.
---
Bah! Well played...well played sir
---
"Your place in this world" quest
---
Looks like they had the cool down animation commented out for a particular buff and debuff.
---
Just guessing based off the little context I have
---
First one looks like it's probably dealing with the cooldown text on ability icons, or possibly cooldowns on buff icons.
---
Second one, this one is really tough to say. I'd have to lookup those IDs to get more context. Could be related to the hunter fixes if pets were bugging out due to being limited to one target somehow.
---
It’s an unspoken agreement. 
---
Art, requests for skins, mounts, pets belong in /WoW. 
---
/classicwow is only for memes, „what class do I roll?“-, “Am I the only one who will take it slow to level 60 and won’t min/max“-, “no changes but barber, transmog, lfg would be ok”-posts.
---
I debated on going warrior MT so much. I admired the MT warrior in my BC guild.  And then in Cata I rolled a warrior. Sure, the class had changed and threat was different, but I enjoyed it.  I looked back at Vanilla and BC and wondered about tanking as a warrior.  I tried to level one on a private server, but guild fell apart and I quit.
---
 When Classic was announced I was dead set on being a warrior. However, I came to the same conclusion you did. I work 50+ hours a week. I can't be a guild's MT even if I want to be one. I always enjoyed my druid and played one continually from 2006-2017.  So I figure I will give druid tanking a try and be the most flexible member of the raid as possible.   Lot of work to get all the sets and consumes/MCP farm, but not the end of the world if I miss a raid as I would at the warrior MT of my guild.
---
Think I’m going rogue this time with hunter alt. I really just wanna kite ashenvale dragon packs to Org on the hunter and Emberstrife to XR.
---
I agree, but he's the top comment. And his comment **implies** these things all changed at the start of tbc. When in fact some of them did not. I was just clarifying.
---
Quest chain started in Ironforge. Can google Valor upgrade and find vids on it when the time comes, but it will be a few phases in as the other poster said. But since I’m not going to be hitting 60 in a hurry this won’t bother me much.
---
That’s just nostalgia, honestly
---
That's most likely the public stress test which is over now.
---
1.  So we have to have layering because an incredibly small percent of the population might feel their notoriety is diminished?  That's ridiculous!  Also, no one "likes" server merges, but by and large it barely has an effect on anything.
---
2.  You read it correctly.  If you don't like a server, switch servers like people have done since MMOs began.  I don't know why people are gasping at that concept.  That's always been how it is.  If you don't like a populated server, don't play on one.  The entire WoW community doesn't need to cater to people that are upset because they didn't have  streamlined levelling like in retail.
---
&gt;And im not talking towards just the "full" warning but the idea that a full server might actually lock to allow more characters on it
---
I don't know why you are talking about it as no one thinks locking servers is a good idea nor has anyone proposed it.
---
I'm the one that made that list and I never implied these things changed at the start of TBC.
---
Literally just a post about how it seems to have been adjusted.
---
That's exactly what it was like.  Feral dps had to be on point with its rotation all the time or it would drop off the charts fast, you're not wrong at all.  It was enjoyable because it was rogue-like but could still backup heal (not really effectively but better than nothing), backup tank (one time I saved a Sartharion 3 Drakes pull by going bear for the last 2% with more than half the 25 man raid group dead on the ground) and provide some buffs here and there.  I'll miss all that with rogue but that's ok, I'll at least be able to pvp somewhat how I remember.
---
Streamer viewers have already pointed out a lot of bugs the streamers themselves overlooked just from watching them play.
---
The benefits of allowing BETA to be streamed vastly outweighs the negatives.
---
Is there an addon for this???
---
A new UI frame involving buff and debuff cooldown is made available.
---
We just had a post for this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c4u1n6/comment/erycit8
---
That said, still Rok'delar. The need to both raid and go hard solo is great.
---
I'm sure Benediction is the same way.
---
I want to believe that, but I've seen bugs many of us reported and highly documented get reported for the last 4 expansions go ignored for months in beta phase and then ship like that. It's not unreasonable to have that fear that classic beta will be treated similarly.
---
Damn, that sucks! You should probably check back on August 27th.
---
Hey   there! If you are still searching  for a guild I'd love to speak about   your classic plans. We are looking  to add a few solid players to our   core group and I'd like to see if  we are a fit for one another. Feel   free to contact me on [battle.net](https://battle.net/) @ wildgunmen#1302 or discord wildgunmen#9537
---
May your axe arm be mighty!
---
oh you sweet delusional little man
---
Hard coding the factions was by far the best thing they did.
---
RIP realm forum drama. I was in Divine Right on Warsong! Avatar is a name I’ll remember forever
---
Your BiS lists are stupid hard to get since half the server is farming one of them
---
Escape Artist is the shit my dude
---
Nah, not dead set really, just looking for a play experience that would be similar to what I had ten years ago.  Vanilla rogue would be the closest thing without question.  Not the same by any means, but...similar.
---
idk about that, people were just worried because there's so many of them that Blizz wouldn't manage to get to all of them. Which is a pretty reasonable/logical worry given that there isn't that much time left for so much fixing.
---
i did not have an active subscription this month and it was only available just today for download, but you could be right on this
---
From the perspective of someone who does not know either way, it definitely implies all the changes were the start of tbc.
---
So you, like Blizzard apparently, are assuming the exact right amount of people are going to leave each server to prevent server merges as well as make layering unnecessary in the long run?  Do you understand how unrealistic that is?
---
I had the same experience! except I saw the lvl ?? Mobs and was too scared to go down and explore more 😂
---
I miss this so much tho. The feeling of accomplishment you’d get as a healer after keeping a group alive because the hunter accidentally (or intentionally) pulled a second mob, or that feeling of ending a fight and eating because it was a necessity. Spending money of food more than every 15 levels, buying arrows, having to work in groups to do certain quests, etc. It was part of the fun. Plus, if you pulled a big group it meant that you were actually pretty good at soloing, which also felt nice. It felt good to be good because I was good, not because the game was easy.
---
The current fresh silver hand race seems to be disagreeing
---
Eh yes and no. I've done a few test runs on perservers vs stress (only low levels obviously) every run as a warrior.
---
Classic servers have much slower mob respawns but do have items and named mobs respawning faster. Additionally I kill stuff much more comfortably on classic. Much lower chance to miss/dodged/parried by mobs which is huge. Also generate more rage and get many more gear drops so I'm not nearly 100% reliant on quest drops. 
---
In pservers there's a chance with some mobs like prowlers for humans near eastvale that they can 1v1 me if I get unlucky.
---
The only thing pservers have going for them is dynamic respawns. If you can get ahead of the crowd it will be a mostly non issue except for quests with garbage drop rates.
---
How much faster? I remember in vanilla they patched it prior to BGs to shorten the time corpses sit there. Before that you would enter Hillsbrad and fucking lock up or stutter super hard.
---
Yeah this probably makes more sense.
---
Ion's stated the opposite in interviews. 
---
But there is player sentiment that "Since every single Xpack is about Horde/Alliance working together after realizing their conflict was meaningless/manipulated by others the conflict stuff is getting old"... and I mean, yeah, most Xpacks kind of followed that routine so it's at least understandable.
---
By who? Thought his record was shortly before tbc launched... Which would mean it was impossible to beat it until August 27th that is.
---
They are if they're aoe farming in empty zones on a fresh server.
---
Sucks you’re getting downvotes. Lots of us who have been on this sub and awaiting classic since the announcement and earlier agree. 
---
Pretty sad that Blizzard can’t provide a service as good as what the public could recreate themselves with Nostalrius. That “You think you do but you don’t” type hubris is still a big force and it’s driving classic.
---
I really appreciate the insight into this.
---
The mana is a big concern for me -- that might be a deal breaker. I'm definitely reconsidering it.
---
yeah. i think the leveling experience would be fun, but simply being a healer w/out rez at 60 seems ehhh. Would maybe consider if i really wanted to be a FC though
---
Skeletons used to be there forever prior to a patch that shortened the time they stay on the ground. Prior to BGs you would walk to Tarren Mill / Southshore and drop so many frames from the thousands of skeletons.
---
I agree with the notion, but most players prefer pve or the general tolkienism of alliance. I see alliance still being the much larger faction overall with populations being close to 50-50 on PvP servers. Pve and rp servers alliance will dominate 70-30 or more.
---
&gt;I just saw like 30 people in Ironforge!
---
Is this a joke?
---
- Pwnunoob gains Will of the Forsaken
---
- Pwnunoob gains vanish 
---
- You are afflicted by sap 
---
- Priest is afflicted by everything under the sun 
---
- Priest dies
---
- Sap fades from you 
---
- You are afflicted by Sap
---
.... and so on and so on, the story goes
---
Whirlwind Axe quest at Level 30 with 4 other level 30 Warriors.
---
Can't die if all the other enemies are dead.
---
The spells/effects from that list:
---
* Entangling Roots
---
* Sleep
---
* Turn Undead
---
* Scare Beast
---
* Hibernate
---
* Sap
---
* Fear
---
* Druid's Slumber
---
Yes, he is right
---
Yeah I was kidding. Bow specialization is pretty damn good. But being Orc is so much better on a pvp server, lol.
---
And then they resist your cheap shot.
---
And that is called balance!
---
Oh thank god.
---
I have two accounts but only one has an active sub. So both have the Classic option but during the stress test the one without sub was not able to connect to the stress test server with the message need an active sub.
---
That's your own inference, nothing I said suggests that.
---
Strong feelings that the people that downvote are the people that play retail and think they're the same devs.
---
But trolls get regeneration so they’re better than every other race combined (even including gnomes and gnorcs)
---
It’s not the same engine dude.
---
Why doesn’t he just ask the guy what year it is?
---
Thank you -- just the kind of advice I was looking for.
---
It's definitely not a minmax setup. Excellent points on the CC and Thorns. It sounds like our survivability will be pretty decent, but low DPS might make it too much of a slog.
---
&gt;tfw you want to protect the innocent but all enemies ignore you
---
Fascinating. I always thought it made sense Orc, Troll, Tauren were a team and Human, Dwarf, Gnome were a team just like WC3, and I thought it made sense as to why Nelves and Forsaken got into their respective faction. To hear that wasn't even the plan from the start is incredible because it just makes sense coming from WC3.
---
That's funny I asked the other guy about the whole BR trend, we transferred around AQ patch when they finally opened up new servers and it was pretty bad even then
---
The comment that started this chain was talking about rogue competition which is a faction only issue.
---
But a ret dream IS a meme
---
Remember only Streamer nomenklatura and F&amp;F are actually in the beta.
---
Doesn't mention an owl for leveling, can't be right.
---
This sounds really fun. The only thing to think about is with rogue/mage/warr gear competition wasn't an issue. With 3 druids it might be slow to hear all of you up evenly. Not saying don't do it, just food for thought!
---
Oh yeah you'd absolutely be gimping yourself out in the world at early levels if you were shooting for something like this, but as you get close to 60 you're going to end up taking just about every dps increasing talent available. Something like: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/-505100310303315-21300230130051 doesn't miss out on much compared to a more regular fire build and if you're playing with a single other mage that's specced this way it would almost certainly be better due to the fact that you can take shatter and not only capitalize on it, but exploit the hell out of it with with ignite stacking.
---
oh for sure. countries like sweden/denmark/finland have been much more into PC gaming than 95% of the united states for a longer time. people my age (25) in lets say finland grew up playing CS from age 6 and way more of them than most kids in america
---
wait what!? shamans dont actually physically put down totems any more? when did they get rid of that LOL that is shitty, why would they ever do that?
---
No. The comments topic implies it. "When tbc hit"
---
Correction: weebs who play female night elves and weebs who want to play female night elves but can’t since they want to play classes that night elves won’t have.
---
Paladins and druids were shipped as incomplete and a lot of people on this sub will fight you if you say it.
---
Master of mobility; master of damage mitigation (not avoidance) and 1-3 target threat generation; master of saving wipes by being able to battle rez, innervate a healer going OOM, pop bear and taunt an add.
---
I'm sure there's more. "Shit at everything" is complete fucking horseshit.
---
i have been checking weekly for beta access since it appears many people have already lost interest in the game
---
if i had to guess ele shaman was one of the least played specs in vanilla lol
---
Until layering detects too many people in one area and splits everyone in 8 different layers totally destroying the world pvp
---
Time travel aside, garrosh was in the running for biggest dick in Azeroth or Outland.
---
Yes, those articles are just as bombastic as the video.  We all know queues "reached past 1000".  OP posted literal visual proof.  But that also means jack shit, since what matters is the time it takes to get into the game, and a 1000 person queue might only take 15 minutes (I have experienced that first hand).  And yes, obviously the launch of friggin World of Warcraft wasn't smooth as butter.  No one is saying Blizzard shouldn't be prepared or go with 40 servers ffs.  
---
The irony of course, is the game you are arguing had a dreadful, terrible launch *went on to be the biggest MMO of all time*.   That's right, the queues, in the end, *didn't matter at all*.  What mattered was the game.
---
I'm gonna find out where the rest of the perverts from Moon Guard go, and join them there.
---
I did hate how BC made mages irrelevant for portals. Just have your hearth set to Shat and you can portal anywhere you want.
---
Dwarf Pally Twink would eat this up.
---
Vanish bug kinda sucked. You don't want that ability that you hold on to to save your ass to fizzle and a NPC will still attack you and put you back in combat.
---
Fighting druids also kinda sucked.
---
The idea is that 3-manning a dungeon essentially means you sacrifice DPS. A standard 5-man team has 1 healer and 1 tank, really. For the remaining 3 slots, it's typical to have DPS.
---
With a 3-man, there is only 1 dedicated DPS. However, by switching forms, my hope was to have the Tank provide supplemental DPS in Cat form (when able) and have the Healer provide supplemental DPS in Cat form (when able) to improve our collective DPS. Of course, we also have 2 backup healers and 2 backup tanks in this layout as well, improving survivability.
---
upvoted for the sick music
---
I know it isn't relevant but we 3 manned everything as paladins in TBC. Now that won't work for classic so right now the group is Warrior or Druid Tank (he hasn't decided yet) me as a Shaman and a Hunter. Im gonna be really honest i think we could 3 man stuff when we get some of the important spells so somewhere in the 20s to 30s i think we will be able to 3 man quite a bit of stuff.
---
Piss drunk, no pants on pissing myself is how I plan on joining a guild. Well, I already did and that's how it went, lol
---
The day they are announced is the day I quit again, for good.
---
There's nothing wrong with clicking. WoW is a slow paced game all thigns considered. People who say you should have everything binded are the same kind of people who buy gaming chairs.
---
Just bind the spam/reactive abilities for ease of use, fuck the rest.
---
Alliance via Nostalgia and city Aesthetics. First moment of awe in this game was stepping into The Great Forge.
---
Your back would be killing you sitting up and forward like that. Unless the table for mouse and keyboard slide back. no thanks.
---
“Greetings” - Tauren NPCs
---
Did you just say troll is better than undead?
---
i cant wait for this either. obviously its nice to just be able to quest from say, level 90-100 and have enough gold from that alone to get the next level of flying or whatever, with gold left over. but i genuinely can NOT wait to have a goal (gear, mats, just gold, whatever), grind for it, and obtain it. everyone knows that when you put time and effort into getting something worthwhile it feels SO much better than having it just given to you.
---
plus for me anyway i'll be rolling lock, so grinding mobs/farming will be ezpz. even if i wasnt playing lock (or hunter) i still wouldnt mind just throwing some tunes on, ripping my wacky pen a few times, and going to town for a few hours for some felcloth or rugged leather.
---
ZG tiger mount
---
Wash yer back!
---
So undead have regeneration?
---
18? Naxx content is at least 2 years
---
Just play a rogue.
---
Carrying about celebrities is fucking pathetic. 
---
Carrying about streamer is ultra fucking low.
---
we are starting a guild and will probably just invite most anyone and then slowly start forming a team as we level up. We have about 7-10 people already on board so we just have to make some friends along the way.
---
&gt;180 if you’ve done it before, before it was classic.
---
We would have also accepted: Thanos, Sauron and the T1000

I pvp and play rogue so horde it is
---
Starsky and Hutch. An Spriest/rogue duo that lived in tarren mill ganking.

Exactly.
---

---
What will be interesting is since the streamer will be the target by default, it might lead to certain formations we never witnessed in Vanilla where it was typically just guerrilla warfare and spread out skirmishes. You'd imagine this would look more like a concentrated battle where at least one side is huddles around protecting the target.
---
Excellent point, I concur
---
The issue is the comparability with their server tech/battle.net. The server side is not backwards compatible and they're not going to compromise their server structure just to try and shove the 2006 client engine into it. They're doing their best to emulate the 1.12 experience in a legion-age client.   
---
I don't think it'll be ready by launch and there will be noticable issues, but it will be fun as hell to play and more enjoyable than retail. I think they will get it to a level where it's acceptably 'vanilla like' eventually, maybe 6 months after launch?
---
MY YOU’RE A TALL ONE
---
Nah, Sargeras, The Lich King, Deathwing, Illidan, C'thun, Kil'jaeden, Onyxia, Kel'thuzad, Medivh, Gul'dan, Ragnaros, Mannoroth, Varimathras, Professor Putricide, Edwin VanCleef - they're all worse.
---
yeah man. i didnt play a druid in vanilla, just the end of TBC and through wotlk and one of my favorite parts was "stance dancing" in PvP between Bear and Cat. idk ANYTHING about modern WoW druids but it doesnt seem like you can really do that.
---
Technically yeah, but undead and Tauren is waaaaaaay cooler than lanky bois, no disrespect to vol’jin RIP.
---
This subreddit is swarmed with retail "I played actual Vanilla" wannabes now, so I'm not surprised one bit.
---
I can easily tell because it's become almost identical to how it was when I used to post on the forums - the very same asinine bullocks is being spewed at you every time you critique the beta, and the mods over-moderating actual discussion whilst keeping garbage meme posts is not making it any better.
---
No need to destroy the gameplay for lore; just make a zone where they are friendly to each other; name it "The Happy Palace." 
---
Ok, maybe give it a different name...but you get the idea.
---
Awesome
---
wonder what the normal going rate for mage ports will be. 
---
also lock summons, hrrrnggg.
---
Time is money, friend!
---
Cireth (Dwarf Priest): well known ninja looter, every few days a new forum post would show up warning people not to group with him
---
SteelBalla (Undead Rogue): President of Tichondrius, need I say more.
---
At least eat the corpse. What were you born with a bloody silver spoon? It's a renewable resource and priest brains are very healing.
---
It all started with my best friend playing Warcraft, and getting me into it. Then when World of Warcraft came out his computer was the only one that could handle it. He and his brothers all had characters on the horde side (we all loved thrall, and in Warcraft the alliance are racist as hell), so I made an orc hunter.   After playing for a while and taking turns with other friends, getting in fights about playing time etc. and truly having a blast playing, I got a computer that could run it. 
---
I decided to start an undead priest. So after seeing the horde side from both kalimdor and EK, I stuck with horde up until retail. Now classic will be a great opportunity for nostalgia with those same friends!!
---
But trolls have risks and undead don’t so I’m right

Of fucking course it's not, I mean goddamn.
---
*Retail bad, please upvote.*
---
Would be really interested to see if this is actually higher DPS than just straight Blizzard and cone of cold.
---
Knowing Vanilla, there's a good chance clicking more buttons actually does worse DPS haha
---
I was MT in my guild and there’s no way I can do it again. Unless you have a guild that is setup to carry the tank through the game, you have to put in 4x the work as everyone else.
---
Before each raid:
---
1. Make sure you have all the buffs you need.
---
2. Make sure you have all the resistances you need.
---
3. You need extra gold to repair all your expensive ass gear.
---
4. Make an alt to farm for gold.
---
5. Be online at least 30 min before the raid so everyone can buff you and give you pots
---
6. Know every boss fight
---
7. DO NOT let real life interfere. We spent multiple MC runs to gear you out, you HAVE to be present at every raid
---
8. The list goes on
---
Being a tank is probably the most rewarding thing ever, but holy shit is it exhausting if you are not a no-lifer.
---
It would have been cool if paladins had a substantial damage boost against undead such that they were top DPS in Naxx.
---
Thank you so much I always try to find the right angle
---
They should have put soy sauce as a table condiment so I didnt have to wait to eat my meal to ask for it. This is common sense imo
---
I’ll be happy that mob density is way lower back then.  I feel like now I can’t go 3 feet without 5+ mobs chasing me.  When I’m fishing, looking at the map etc it’s an army of off assholes bearing down on me.
---
Blizz is starting to turn the corner
---
They acknowledged to attack normalization bug
---
They've fix some of the pet issues
---
They removed right click report
---
ATVI is so busy watching 8.2 that the devs are able to sneak a few fixes in.
---
That whole story got so much more press than what actually happened on the server. I played on Detheroc during that time. They posted that crap at like 2 in the morning, and were going to wait for most of their guild to be on to open the gates  anyway. No one really cared because there weren't any other guilds pushing as hard as they were. TKT or End Guys on horde side were up there, and High Guarde and Armed and Dangerous were keeping up with them for a while, but no one else really gave 2 shits. Most people just raided so they could pvp.
---
&gt;I bet you think the native Americans were the protagonists in the settling of America’s too
---
What did the low IQ individual mean by this?
---
"He was really good at that."  
---
Made me realize he was talking about someone else right away. Should probably post another clip for a correction and context, imo.
---
It's not even exaggerated.
---
I can tell you that of my /played I spent maybe 1/20th of it leveling, but I remember the most from my leveling experience.
---
Whats with people marrying people they got nothing in common with. Bang whoever but if you aint willing to meet me in the barrens it aint love
---
Standard 1g
---
Ouch.
---
can you elaborate? unless i am not remembering correctly, the "class neutering" kinda started in Cata, got worse in MoP and really got way worse in WoD. I never said anything about the "class design being shit" in MoP,  but at that point a lot of classes got more streamlined and lost a lot of their unique stuff that made them feel like a unique class
---
granted a lot of that stuff wasn't just to cut the nuts off the classes, it came with a lot of QoL stuff (like a lot of the hunter changes)
---
They were actually sold to crapvision in 2008.  And not surprisingly wotlk was when the game started to truly suck.
---
It could hurt the game in many significant ways, none of which make up for it's primary benefit (lack of realm merging, server queues, "overcrowding").
---
In this situation I am likely the priest :(
---
Imagine don't playing the game of your dreams just because some missing bones smh
---
Druids from MoP onward were spec specific. Definitely can't do that well on live.  You can swap forms, but you're missing a lot of what made a druid a hybrid from Vanilla to Wrath.  Cata still had "bearcat".  I don't enjoy my druid or the one I'm screwing around with leveling in BfA. Hell, they lock former baseline abilities to pvp.
---
Yeah, 3 manning stuff *sounds* fun, but I think in practice after a few hours of trying it you'll probably be thinking very strongly of inviting a mage and a warrior which will triple your dps.  
---
I did a bit of work trying to make dual-boxing warrior/holy paladin work soloing through Deadmines, stockades and SM. I found it quite doable, but it's really just kinda boring killing elites so slowly. You can do it, but a run just takes a long time and it's very slow exp/hour. Once the novelty wears off of finding out you *can* do it, the reality of the slow grind isn't that appealing.
---
why not roll warrior and go fury dps? same question goes for you /u/Dante_Incarnate
---
Yes!! I just put a macro together last night that will:
---
1. Go into cat form from any other form
---
2. If already cat form, cast Prowl
---
3. If already stealthed, cast Pounce
---
This lets me spam a button to disappear and still have the same key for when I want to initiate from stealth. Similarly:
---
1. Go into bear form from any other form
---
2. If already bear form, cast Feral Charge
---
This lets me spam a button when I am at range and want to interrupt or close on a caster, or even escape to a nearby enemy (away from a more dangerous enemy).
---
Prot can be pretty good at running flags in WSG and tanking in AV. I do agree with you though, the specs are everywhere.
---
I been in cities and crowded areas a majority of my life and would love to just play WoW in some rural area where i see nature and stars but....
---
 Thats exactly what they should have done. 
---
Or just maybe, they continue to use Beta for its primary purpose. Testing, and fixing the game.
---
I went to High school 2004-2007 and it was a small town but a few of my friends played wow and we played football. A lot of the team didn’t play but they knew we did and everyone in our school knew about it.
---
This is far far beyond a remastering. This game is a new game, plain and simple. One does not simply bolt 14 year old data onto a modern engine/codebase and call it a "remaster". As a beta tester, the game feels pretty fucking great, and the fact that it doesn't have way way way more bugs is basically a miracle. Also, if blizzard is actually doing it the way the community wants (#nochanges), it its actually literally impossible for it to not have more bugs, unless they plan to fix the old bugs, which as far as I know is something they never said they were going to do (unless they were exploits).
---
&gt;First and foremost, my muthafucking weapon skills.
---
yeah til you're level 44, get a dope new axe, and realize your 2h axe skill is at 25 LULULUL. but yeah while kinda shitty to level up (at least a bunch at once) i always liked weapon skills as a mechanic.
---
Not much on fury dps. Warrior dps just doesn't hold the appeal for me.  I sucked at it so bad leveling. Lol
---
I haven't heard this goal before. Refreshing
---
It'll happen regardless of streamers, and I'm concerned that the PvP zone will get so crowded that no one will be able to do anything. 
---
That said, world PvP is world PvP. Unless the streamers make it unplayable, I have no reason to hate them (or if their followers camp me....)
---
Completely agree about increasing the level cap to 60 and inviting more players so that more content can be tested.
---
+1 for Garona and seeing what felt like the entire AH being TinyBaby listings.
---
Seriously, I've been resigned to playing druid or rogue the last week, but if they fix the deadzone being out to 8-11 yards, hunter will be back on the menu.
---
You’ve lost the plot mate
---
Tryphon from &lt;Macabre&gt; on Mannoroth. First person in the world to hold a Scepter of the Shifting Sands.
---
Yes.
---
Hmm. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I dont remember multiple druid hots stacking, ie you could only have max 1 rejuv and max 1 regrowth hot on any person (this was changed in TBC though).
---
This could pose 1 issue of wasted potential.
---
But......?!
---
I mean, German would at least survive. Not necessarily worth it for Blizz though.
---
Wow you must be incredibly sophisticated that you are able to evade such base callings.  Such an honor to reply to the comment of such a noble man that even the most renown icons are but the buzzing of flies to him.
---
I agree it will still be fun to play, way more fun than retail for sure - It's just sad that this has been announced since 2017 and we have a lot of inconsistencies still, especially when release is 2 months away.

# &lt;NA Horde CST&gt; PVP Server Hardcore Raiding Guild Seeking Members
---
Hey everyone,
---
We are in the early stages of putting together a guild community (on a Horde PVP server) so that come launch time we will have a good solid number of people to group up with, run dungeons very soon, raid with.   
---
**We will be a Raiding focused guild** with a welcoming home for PVPers.
---
As the GM (im 33 years old, Wife and kids) *I have extensive experience in end game vanilla content (9/15 Naxx before BC) as well as years and years of expansion raid experience, Raid Leading Experience, and Guild Management.*  
---
Our goal is to build a community of people seeking **fun times**, **phat loots**, and **raid dungeon clears**. We will be building the guild from the ground up, *Guild name, Guild tabbard, exact raid times (Tues, Thurs and Weekends), raid leaders, officers and class leaders will be things we will all be able to decide on together*.  
---
**I am looking for dedicated and willing to learn people. Experience is not required**. If you have never been in classic, thats ok, I'll teach you. *I will do anything in my power to make you as successful at raiding as i possibly can, I only ask that you meet me halfway.*  
---
***I will not require anyone to play a certain class or spec, if you want to play an enhancement shaman or a feral druid, the by god lets make you the best fucking enhancement shaman or feral druid on the server.***
---
**I want to go to the top boys! Will you come with me?**
---
Feel free to msg me on FB if this is something that interests you and we can go from there!

Being able to cast spells from every spec.
---
I won’t be an arcane mage.
---
I won’t be a frost mage.
---
I won’t be a fire mage.
---
I’ll be a mage.
---
Sure I’ll spec into arc+frost / fire, but that doesn’t lock me from casting frostbolt/firebolt. 
---
I’ve missed this since MoP. That was the last time I felt class fantasy over spec fantasy was a thing.
---
yeah man the 8's and 9's PvPing was one of my favorite parts of leveling just because it was a GREAT break from the sometimes rough grind that is vanilla leveling. it was a treat of sorts. also super fun if you had good gear for that level bracket and you just go in and poop on people.
---
on that note, i am SO pumped for no fucking resilience. that shit ruined PvP for me. i am going to welcome being able to wear my PvE gear and be able to PvP nearly as well as people with PvP gear (and unless i'm mistaken, the tier gear was just as good if not better than most of the best PvP stuff you could get)
---
Cuauhtemoc or similar on US Kil'Jaeden. First legendary I ever saw was him with Hand of Rag in AV at the front of the line near Balinda. 
---
Threkk orc warrior same server. Very well geared fury warrior who always had his posse with him. Tried fighting him the one time I saw him alone in Silithis on my own warrior. Was close but he was too much. Also was in WSG where I think he (maybe his teammate) got MCd into the little hole you can't get out of (right side, little farther than Rejuv hut Alliance side). Their side's raging made it epic and I think we still lost.
---
I didn't thing about summoning stones, great idea
---
Trolls also generate the most threat in pve due to berserking.
---
Trolls have their place but are more niche, and with the exception of op troll shadow priests, are more catered to pve.
---
To enjoy Vanilla and play it with mates at a casual speed.
---
I was a pretty serious raider in 2005, I was also 15 and at school full time.
---
Every night I would be grinding materials, or doing runs to scholo to make flasks or grinding MC for binding drops etc. it all felt like chores by the end of it, but I made commitments to my guild and I had the attitude of never quit something you commit to.
---
I would come home play for 2 hours, eat dinner then go to sleep get back up at 2:30am for raid or material farming, I had 1 day off a week, I would plan my evening while still at school to maximise my game time, my grades took a hit, my social life took a hit and honestly I stopped enjoying it around the launch of BWL.
---
In hindsight I am so glad my guild fell apart in AQ 40 (Twin emps) thanks to the GM refusing to dump his GF from raids (another story for another day), had I gone on I'm pretty sure I would of dropped right out of school and ruined my life with WoW.
---
I took a long break when the guild fell apart and came back in TBC to a casual guild and had the time of my life.
---
So this time around I want to enjoy vanilla, I'm not raiding and my only goal is Dungeon tier 1 and Epic Warlock mount, I want to play with friends and just soak up so much of what I missed in Vanilla WoW, the journey.
---
Blood and Thunder!
---
I know it can still be heard but it seems like you used to hear it a lot more.
---
Collecting the crystals in Ungoro...I just really like that zone
---
They discuss classic often on The Instance and Convert to Raid.  I’ve been listening to Convert to Raid since episode 1, and the instance since 2009.  Both are top notch wow podcasts.
---
&gt;My mage being a solo class again. Never understood why they gave us a pet as frost. 
---
hmmm this is an interesting viewpoint on it. i can get it for sure, thats cool. i always liked playing frost mage throughout WoW but i also did not like having the pet and having to micromanage it (like its frost nova and stuff).
---
Or I have my head on straight, you sassy little streamer bottom.
---
I played Horde in Vanilla and will probably play Horde again. In the last stress test I tried leveling a dwarf priest and I just couldn’t do it. The mystical areas and the “do good” of the alliance felt like I was playing a completely different game. For some reason I just love the lawlessness of the Horde and many of the starter areas.
---
It’s weird because I usually play the “alliance” version of all other MMOs. I’ll probably make an alliance alt though this time around.
---
If you have the beta, can you check if the bones in the Tanaris desert southwest of Gadgetzan (pic: https://i.imgur.com/AgsVAE2.png) are there? They were one of the models I noticed were missing in the demo client. Some buildings in Gadgetzan were missing too, eg. the westernmost house at the base of the little hill.
---
Faerie fire and hunters Mark. I mained rogue all through vanilla. Nothing is worse than becoming a leather warrior. Nothing.
---
The raft as an item first appeared in the first Zelda game.
---
All items removed.
---
Mounts introduced.
---
Postal system implemented.
---
Fuck yes.
---
Income. I have enough saved to pay rent and grocerys for like a month. Finally a good job. Im in the most crowded coast on usa major city and me and my gf wanna get out probably few month after classic WoW (lease over in winter) but it just seems unobtainable without a lottery. Maine or anything. The dream is to be smoking on legal with my bigass dogs around nothing and when i wanna see a city itll be orgrimmar.
---
Not sure how alliance side is but I have only been seeing about 2 people in Org when I am online. I would love to see 30 people in my hub town!
---
&gt;The Barrens just sucks
---
YOU TAKE THAT BACK!
---
There still were elite quests, but in outland.
---
I can understand why they did that, at the end of tbc there weren't enough players in the lowbies zones to find people to do those quests
---
1g will be steep in the first few months. You’ll be undercut by another mage in a heartbeat, even if it’s mage code not to take less than 1g. Shits gonna be cutthroat when no one has their epic mount.
---
It isn’t. You CAN have an elemental as frost, but the last time I played the meta was not to have it
---
Server: Nathrezim
---
Player: Sting
---
He was a Tauren hunter who was a High Warlord on our server. I always remember him from vanilla battlegrounds. I ended up being in a raiding guild with him in Wrath called Semi Pro. Chill guy. But I always remember following him into battle during AV. So much fun.
---
Blizz has said limited servers already so I can’t see it being worth it to have a medium pop german server at the expense of a bunch of low pop italian, spanish, french, servers
---
Whatever Mulrlocs say when they are about to wreck ass
---
From hunter perspective, it looks like they've finally got around to pushing pet fixes.
---
Interesting to know when that started.
---

Well, ya, I was being mostly hyperbolic—Sargeras for sure. ArthAs for sure. Deathwing for sure. Gul’dan ya. I think cases could be made against the others so, I stand corrected. Maybe he was in the running for 5th biggest dick.
---
I played mop, but not serous endgame. Maybe I don’t remember it well, but it didn’t seem anywhere close to vanilla or bc.
---
I sell only the finest goods :)
---
I totally get *why* \- it's why they have made all the choices: a more player friendly experience. Leave cooperation for the dungeons and the overworld for solo questing.
---
Entirely depends on when your guild intends to begin raiding
---
I personally don't think they expected how popular this would be and therefore have not assigned much dev resource to it, see Ion's  "You think you do but you don't" mindset that would have clearly heavily influenced resourcing decisions.  
---
Streaming of the classic beta has definitely drummed up huge interest and along with it, huge criticism of systems.
---
I would believe that average after the first one.
---
For me it's much higher since I love making alts. But yes! The leveling experience leads to such amazing moments at times. 
---
Like when you're cooking at a campfire in feralas and someone joins you just to chill. Or joining other allies to stop the opposite faction from dominating a zone. ^.^
---
Seeing nothing but bones at Nessingwary's camp and deciding you may as well log out now.
---
oh, I'm sorry, I thought he meant 'top WoW guild'.  It was the natural assumption given that it's a wow sub.
---
I guess I should try to get into a guild early I was planning on taking around 2 months to get to 60 but it might be to slow
---
&gt;for background noise 
---
Bruh it’s a couple having date night playing a game together, they don’t need background noise lmao you ever tried socializing?
---
Man I wish Taurens had totems as a weapon
---
Any arthas boys remember savagescott and moddex?  These 2 were the most dedicated gankers I've ever seen.  I know savagescott was still going in wrath and moddex even longer.  Moddex would camp lowbie towns for like 10 hours a day every day
---
YOU THERE - CHECK OUT THAT NOISE!
---
Same! 
---
First character was a Dwarf Pally. Still have him (since 2004).
---
My stress test was a Dwarf Pally, same name, I almost cried (not really but was emotional). Brought back so many memories. Oddly, I also remembered some tricks (shift+right click auto-looted, turn quest text scroll off, where some vanilla quest items were that are currently obsolete in BFA, etc). 
---
I am so damn excited to relive the time when I was 14... running through Ironforge (with it packed), rushing to beat other players with leveling, staying up stupid late with a group of friends, etc.
---
I don't think an elemental shaman will make a very good tank.
---
Yes you seem to understand that paying down low interest debts quickly or ahead of schedule is moronic, but after that I'm having a hard time comprehending your hang up. 
---
We aren't even taking into account inflation. 
---
Tons of people who are good with finance and understand what they are doing do this, just spend literally 5 minutes researching or go to the personal finance subreddit or financial independence subreddit dedicated to topics like this and ask them if you'd like. 
---
Or don't, it's your money, just don't give advice about things that you are unwilling to change your opinion on.
---
I never said to mortgage a paid off house and put that in the markets, because after 30 years your fucking risk profile is going to look a lot different than when you were in your 20's and 30's and had 30 years of potential exponential growth ahead of you, but oh no wait, you burned all your cash rushing to pay down a mortgage that is historically cheap like a fucking idiot, when if you instead plugged that money into a estimated returns calculator right now, you'd realize your advice if taken just lit 100k dollars on fire.
---
&gt; Are private servers the new standard?
---
Considering that they were literally the only way to play vanilla from 2007 to 2019, they kind of are.
---
Also historically a hotbed for leaks from Capcom Blizzard etc.
---
Namu - Frostmane. T3 Troll rogue with thunderfury from Kinetic (best guild on Frostmane at that time). I remember seeing him in org when i was 12 y/o and nerdgasming! My brother and i could not believe how cool he looked and how strong he must have been. Even to this my when i say vanilla wow, my brother, who does not play since a looong time ago, always says to me: man do you remember that Troll rogue Namu?!?!
---
Keep yer feet on the ground!
---
“Thanks for the advice... flightmaster.”
---
Did warlocks have the same issue as hunter pets?
---
https://classictinker.com
---
Came in here to look for any Dethecus heroes... didn’t find any. 
---
Which is 💯 accurate.
---
I wonder how many people checked this page hoping to see their character name.
---
I remember a guy named Moonster or something, a Tauren druid I think.  He ganked me a few times around level 20-30, had some pretty close fights but I lost.  Ran into him much later at Burning Steppes, weeks/months later, and killed him after a loooong battle.  I remember looking at his corpse and thinking "huh.  Finally got the bastard". I doubt it meant anything to him.
---
Off you go!
---
Yeah man, that evil Activision is doing everything in their power to make sure Classic fails, obviously
---
Who said anything about lightning bolts?
---
Probably that fucking [Draconian Deflector](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Draconian_Deflector). I was mostly geared out in a mixture of T1/T2/ZG gear and still had that fucking shield because I could never get a better drop....
---
I ended up loving that stupid thing.
---
Just tank good in dungeons. If you’re 60 on October you will find a spot where you fit in. Tanks, when it comes to raids, are more exclusive but if you play good 1-60 you will have puggers begging you to play
---
They updated the rep contributions from quests - so that you could do low level quests for full rep, and they gave more rep (so easier to hit exalted).
---
The reason for so many hunter bugs is that blizzard took the class from legion and stripped it down to a vanilla version. There was bound to be lots of teething problems with doing that. Hunters have changed a whole lot, possibly more than any other class.
---
The overwhelmingly response to your statements is that you are wrong. Either everyone else missed something in which case I'm sure we'd all appreciate you sharing that knowledge with us OR you just can't handle being wrong and you're acting like a baby. I'd go with the latter if that is the kind of response you're dishing out.
---
Considering that during the """stress test""" I walked into Org and only saw 2 other people around the bank/AH area, I'd say it's not a joke.
---
Mankrik's cry when i tell him his wife is dead.
---
Dwarf! That hammer may be taller than you but by Thorim you know how to swing it.
---
My plan is to tank a lot on my way up and a ton in my 55-60 range, maybe get some friends on my way up. 
---
Tanking is my goal, I could get to lvl 60 in less
---
Then a month but I don't know if I wanna do that... sounds like less fun
---
Heh, caught up in a typing storm; meant *antagonists* because clearly, given the context protagonist doesn’t make sense.  I was suggesting that I bet-as OP seems to think the alliance is at fault for the invasion of Azeroth—that similarly they might think that the native Americans were at fault for the settling of America and subsequent atrocities...which is of course ridiculous...hence the point. I think most high IQ readers would have inferred the meaning given the context and realized the honest error as it related to the analogy being drawn....🤔
---
I mean doing/who queries at this time there probably 500 ppl total on the entire server. So id hope there is only one layer
---
These are so lame.
---
You can keep your steak. Elves have infinitely better lore.
---
Alliance. Their leveling experience while questing is significantly more fleshed out. Horde questing is the forgotten half loved child of vanilla wow.
---
They will most likely just close down beta and do random stress test rather than invite more people to beta
---
&gt; Elves have infinitely better lore.
---
Ah, yes, the race responsible for pretty much every world-ending event in the history of Azeroth.
---
There. Edited. Problem solved.
---
As someone who played through the Emerald Dream, Nostalrius and Anathema classic pservers, I can assure you that Alliance wins any form of group pvp because paladins are straight up broken. Apart from handing out millions of buffs (which makes it impossible to dispel bops off their buffed up mages who then get a freepass spamming braindead aoe on the horde), they also get 12 seconds of free healing which is enough for their fully buffed up freedomed warriors to obliterate the frontlines.
---
im just remembering back when OSRS first launched, everyone on equal terms and everything was a race for the first items. that was the most fun i have ever had in any video game ever. now comes the 2nd.
---
Manno!
---
I’ll be home in 30 or so, I’ll report back. Anything else you’d like me to check?
---
Why did I watch this, I will not unsee.
---
Yeah Camp Nacho made me laugh my ass off, haha
---
&gt; All percentage based stats (crit, hit, etc) became numbered ratings and gave different percentages based on your level.
---
Wasn't this made on wotlk so rogues could no longer tank?
---
&gt;Racial bonuses were changed/balanced.
---
This 100% sure was on wotlk,  not tbc. Emfh was added on wotlk, shadowmeld and stoneform were changed during wotlk.
---
&gt;Many Vanilla quests were changed to be soloed and gave more XP.
---
100% 3.0.2 I remember the first morladim nerf (and how disappointed I was)
---
The sword Destiny.  I wasn't a big raider or anything like that, I was a ret pally, and I remember buying it off the AH with all the gold I'd saved up (who needs an epic mount afterall? lol).  At the time, it was the highest level, most expensive epic I knew about.  I was high 50s and was straight up melting 60s with the sword, since it was early in vanilla and everyone was bad.
---
It probably wouldn't be the same, but I'd love to have that sword one last time.
---
"I'll rip the secreta from your flesh"
---
Always sounded like a pop song.
---
Alliance GM group I played with on Warsong would absolutely wipe the floor with the horde HWL group. My guild 3-0’d them in WSG easy with only maybe about half of us being experienced PVP/BGers, maybe 3-4 of us who ever ranked above 8/9 (we were a top 5 raid guild, though, so the gear was there). 
---
But that’s one anecdote from one server. When I played feenix the main GM group was better but the subgroups could go either way. 
---
But in the end everyone just dodges the other R14 groups and stomps pugs all day right?
---
yeah man, this is part of what i was getting at. however there are still a select few spells you can only get as certain specs, which is a good thing.
---
Omgwtf, I'm gonna go complain on the Allakhazam forums.
---
Kult der Verdammten RP-PVP:
---
Frostfinchen. My raidleader in Classic.
---
Rebiros. My guild leader (RP Guild).
---
Alliance. Druids have two choices, Tauren or Night Elf. Tauren cat form is hideous.  Tauren bear form is not not bad.  Tauren have largest hit box in game.   Tauren lore is mediocre in Vanilla WoW imo.  Not a huge fan of most sets on Tauren.  I'd go female Tauren if I rolled a druid one. 
---
Night Elves have my favorite lore in Warcraft. Blizzard did them a major slap in the face in WoW. Night Elves were known as a savage race prior to WoW.  In Vanilla and until Cataclysm  I was a Male Night Elf druid. Always liked the tier sets better on female than male elves like with Tauren so I'll be a female Night Elf Druid.  Night Elf cat form is awesome.  Bear form isn't half bad.  
---
I'll probably roll Horde alts on a group of old BC guildies' server if they'll let me hang out.
---
Is this loss?
---
It's ok they can still auto attack. Oh wait that's bugged too. Very gooord
---
Where did the bad man touch you?
---
1.12 was 2006.
---
He was a top tier arena player in wotlk so I think he should be able to adapt, thanks!
---
&gt; And no, one night of 40 people helping out for 4 hours is not 160 hours, its 4 hours.
---
No, it's 160 man hours. this is a real, defined term, being used correctly here.
---
pserver I meant, by quite a margin too.
---
They do but not as crazy as retail, and other spell classes have separate DR timers, like cheap shot and kidney shot.
---
Damage can break your fear but it's a lot harder to break it with smaller numbers in classic as apposed to any damage rolling a yes or no in retail. The amount determines the chance in classic.
---
Thanks dude!
---
&gt; and it was a small town
---
yeah exactly. so the nerds and the people who played football were one in the same lol
---
Ratings for crit, hit, haste, dodge, block, etc became a thing as soon as the TBC pre-patch hit.
---
Patch 2.3 saw major changes to several racials, mostly the removal of all weapon skills.
---
Also from patch 2.3:
---
&gt; Many elite creatures and quests in the level 1-60 experience have been changed to accommodate solo play.
---
"fact check it fact check it". ALRIGHT!!!!
---
Also correct me if I'm just being a sook but this post has 54% upvotes, which indicates to me that this isn't a question I should be asking in this sub, did I do the wrong thing?
---
Sort of like the Horde who are just a bunch of 12 year olds trying to be edgy and cool...
---
Says the Blood Elf only player.
---
why does this only work this way for servers and not layering? instead of 5 full servers at the start you're going to have one super server that then has a queue time once the layers are merged?
---
Hoohah....obviously....
---
I’ve been expecting... you...
---
We don’t have elves friendo
---
Pserver value were wrong in the terms that they were harder lol. Dev overestimated the difficulty in dungeons and leveling.
---
We won't know about raids yet until game is actually release, but dungeons and leveling are proven to be easier
---
MRGLMRGLMRGLMRGLMRGL
---
I guess if you need morality in your gaming and have to drag your real life into a game ruining it for everyone else since you can't separate the two.
---
Go with honor friend.
---
So that's why all your characters from BC onward were elves...
---
They will destroy both classes if they have access to aoe spots uncontested.
---
source?
---
&gt;Game was never as hard as it was back in vanilla
---
With game you mean leveling in wow, right?
---
Hoohah...obviously....
---
Did you mean to put this in the sayings thread?
---
Still in beta
---
I think the BFA surge wore off and those players are looking for their next fix.  They are joining this sub saying stuff along the lines of "layering is fine, who cares, trust Blizz".  Many don't seem to understand the fight and many don't seem to care.
---
Actually last time it was posted it made front page with most people agreeing for it to be changed to the no sliding way.
---
Noice, you got a link to the guy who did it? Or the place where he said it? I'm making a video about the ways in which you can maximize Rogue Poison damage and I just want to make sure the data is locked tight.
---
Always rocked troll male and always will &lt;3
---
I’m playing a MAGE and I won’t be 60 in 2 months. Best thing you can do is play the game, by time you’re 60 you will have a full friends list and probably be in a guild with people hyping you up to tank RAG this Tuesday!!!!
---
Just ignore it until release
---
You people-
---
even back in 2007 there were multiple guilds raiding MC within first month of fresh servers. We'd prob have guilds raiding MC week 2 of release if it were to be released that early
---
Poor Dethecus
---
Oh dude, that would be so amazing. I think the lowest scaling possible is something like 7-10%, so at least +10 spell/nature damage would be required to notice a difference. Seriously though, I'll make up the cost of the gear in gold when Classic launches in exchange if you want. Just tell me what server you're going on.
---
It's just too damn big man lol
---
It will become obvious quite quickly that you just try to bw funny to get a raidspot. No matter how prepared you show up, you will still be leeching in the raid.
---
Might have to just stick to private servers. Dont count on Blizz to fix things like this, they rarely ever get it right anymore.
---
Jayrock.
---
The tank druid could put the hots on himself when needed. They're never used as main healing spells anyway.
---
You and me both. If I ever craft Sulfuras (or watch it crafted in front of me with the hammer I made) that'll probably mean that I've spent enough time in classic and call it quits.
---

---
Just don’t play BGs? Lol
---
In the beginning of vanilla 10 days /played was server first for **many** servers.
---
I think you're underestimating the vanilla grind slightly.
---
This sounds wrong.
---
Wait how did this get here, it was supposed to be on the other one trololol
---
You mean balance druid.
---
I said most likely. How can I give a source for my opinion?
---
He means it's not cool to wait for a slow boy.
---
They also said for years that it would never, ever happen, yet here we are. You’re essentially asking them to perfectly rebuild the game from the ground up with fewer resources than they had the first time around. The fact that they’ve 99% accurately recreated a fifteen year old MMO is, frankly, astounding. If that isn’t good enough for you, I doubt anything could be.
---
WPvP is definitely the most fun.  You just never know what you are going to find.  But no, there is 0 chance of a battleground-less server.
---
Ret is the most faceroll class in the game for PvP. wings and KO.
---
Yeah looks like some UI logic had the comments removed (meaning the code was inactive previously and now it will be active code)
---
That wouldn't force people to have to go out in azeroth to PVP. Lol
---
I remember the first tauren on my server on Dark Iron to get a raptor. Everyone was gathered around in Org calling it Godzilla because it scaled so huge
---
that is a terrible idea lol
---
How can you see this ?

They are literally ruining his life!

Twink vanilla afk horde out of bgs trick
---
I did it. 2-piece "of the Fang" had no effect on poisons. Acidic Walkers (and a few other spell damage gear) had no effect on poisons.
---
Spell damage does affect Shadow Oil, which is the best thing to use as a consumable-buffed Rogue in raids. Unless, you're Horde, then you only want Shadow Oil on your OH.
---
The Battle of Darrowshire
---
I think it is a cool idea. Have you multiboxed on that scale much before? I ran two accounts often and was considering doing it again.

Tinkerz from Watch Your Back, here. Found a few of the Months Behind guys as well, Crouton and Brenen and a handful of others.
---
It’s something new every week. “X is broken, unplayable, terrible, won’t be fixed before launch because Blizzard is awful. X has been known about for 2 months and hasn’t been fixed, what are they even doing? Fixing other issues before they fix this issue that I think is more important?” 
---
then that issue gets fixed and we go back to complaining/arguing about layering and twitch streamers until the next big complain post hits front page.
---
I prefer almost everything about alliance, their cities, earlier zones, racials (as a mage, expansive mind and escape artist are fuckin BiS no one will.convince me otherwise)
---
The one thing I will say is, *in general* alliance seems more pve oriented and won't go out of their way to help you if you're getting ganked or whatever I just wanna play a gnome mage so that's what imma do
---
&gt; yet it’s not even acknowledged by blizzard to be a bug.
---
Well, technically it's not a bug. It's working exactly as it should with the new client. It just isn't the same as 1.12. Since they are using the modern client, it's working as coded.
---
That just gave me some ptsd flashbacks from leveling my warrior way back then... not to mention the endless amount of wolves and bears also in that area...
---
But no one else can see them.
---
There will still be world pvp but mainly around raid/dungeon entrances and farming spots, once bgs open.
---
I'm gonna ask you to reread this comment chain and see how ridiculous that sounds. Slow leveler? Nah, just the slowest.

I'll rip the secrets from your flesh
---
The honor rewards for doing battlegrounds are like 10x better. This leads to a lot of players just sitting in Capital Cities, since ranking up in world zones doesn't work.
---
How long can you sit underwater for?
---
Also I have no jaw.
---
What? Elves being responsible for every bad thing that happened on Azeroth has nothing to do with real life.
---
The hell you're talking about? Relics are a bitch but nowhere near hard enough to require grouping, and they are infamous for the fact that other players steal your relics - a group would make it even worse.
---
Excellent work and good thinking. I actually have two just like that on Q and E that I call my Bear and Cat buttons, respectively. I added any skills I thought I'd want to activate immediately on transformation, like Bash, Charge, Enrage, Prowl or Dash. I've got my other travel forms on R which activate depending on whether I'm swimming or outdoors, and when in combat is spammable to break snares. R also has my gear swaps and mount, just for kicks.

Did an AI write this after being fed a bunch of wow websites?
---
So undead have a whopping +5 to throwing weapons? Everyone knows throwing weapons are the most OP weapon type
---
Classic isn't going to be like Vanilla. The number of online resources and addons available will cut that time in half for many players, regardless of whether or not they've played WoW before.
---
[Here](https://clips.twitch.tv/AverageFitSlothDxCat) it is ! :)
---
Yeah, I know. Watching players run flags and sit stables is the streaming content that is in high demand.  Nobody wants to watch that premade vs premade wintrade nonsense. They want world PvP. There is a reason all the most popular PvP video from classic heavily feature world pvp. Premade vs Premade is a total snorefest.
---
Of course, publicity is one of the goals of the beta. If Blizzard cared only for bug reporting they would hire QA people, assuming they give a fuck about Classic quality.
---
I mean at least on the beta it kinda cost us like 250 avg testers per faction since the aggressive implementation. The concern was/is quite warranted imo. Especially considering how few people will be willing to do 40-50. If they need us to test any higher level content they'll be SOL even still.
---
As far as I can tell they might have to template characters for 40-60 content.
---
Hey at least Harvest Watchers don't give you a 20-minute debuff that lowers your stats and cuts your health regen in half.

Fuck Darkshore.

People were idiots in 2005, and 1.10 class specs were very different from 1.12. In 2005, my guild were full of noobs, using badly optimized gear, and useless hybrid specs who would be way better off just running around bandaging people.
---
We cleared MC a week after it was opened on fresh launched server in 2007. Might have taken slight longer for rag because of rep requirement I don't recall the exact detail, but it was a breeze.
---
They are literally the slowest levellers and there's years of stats to prove it.
---
It sounds like a joke, but it's not a joke. When it first happened there'd be like 100 people in IF but the layers were split down into like 3-4 people, so it'd look dead. A server looking dead makes a server actually dead...which happened.
---
I agree.
---
Eh, I don't see the relationship. How do you know the people who want to play casually are also the people saying that it's the numbers underneath that really matter? TBH it seems to me that the type of people who don't care about playing casually, and care mostly about min-maxing, would be the exact kind of people who would say it's really the numbers that matter.  
---
I'm sure there's a solid mix of both kinds of people who would harbor both opinions though, but I think you may be wrong about who is in the majority of these opinions.
---
Don’t do that, holy is a terrible unviable spec and nobody should play it.
---
I’m definitely not a horde pvper btw &gt;__&gt;
---
Mini split system! Bad ass!
---
Can’t go wrong with some Au/Ra 😇
---
I don't even watch streamers.  You are just the equivalent of some old fuck commenting on a Yahoo article about videogames saying "why don't people just  go outside like when I was young instead staying of their mom's basements?!"
---
OK so it's better than layering because you can't swap layers. I understand, thank you.
---
And unsurprisingly he's out of here.

“Avast ye swabs, REPEL THE INVADERS!”

According to https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity it was as low as 120/faction at times...on the weekend.

It really messed things up.

What if I'm Alliance in northern STV or Desolace?
---
Hey Jaime you ever raid on DMT?
---
Thanks!
---
Not just redditors. Twitch chats and even streamers too. I don't want to name anyone, but a fairly mature classic twitch that I watched tonight was talking fairly negatively about their confidence in any Hunter bugs being fixed. I was afraid to try and defend blizzard in the chat, because it seemed like everyone shared the same sentiment. But people need to take a deep breath, and relax. They're working on things.
---
I see where you're coming from, but remember that pally's have great suitability, surely the time spent corpse running would bring warriors way down.
---
Walk with the earthmother.
---
And the setup, of course!
---
This is a thing people don't really get, it's not that you suck at everything by choosing a hybrid, it's that you are just so good at healing/supporting that it's just better to fill a raid spot by doing that.
---
I remember even when I played other games during vanilla I'd sit on vent with my guild from wow in case they wanted to do something. I'd just hangout with whoever was around.
---
Left square bracket right square bracket left square brakcet right square bracket

Progression would only carry forward, so you would only have the robes in EXP2.

No second monitor? Ouch.

Also no sunlight. =(

I'd buy him a Captain Rumsey's Lager.
---
I mean I can see both sides; it won’t make a difference for those who don’t know better and ultimately if you get down to it the numbers all being right and whatnot really solidifies a more “valid” classic experience. 
---
Howeverrrr; for those of us who’ve been around since the beginning- some of these animations and quirks contain the *soul* of this game for some. Human mages used to use the ‘buff/support spell’ animation for arcane explosion, they changed it after zillions of years. Rogues had a cool and calm, confidently striding forward in stealth feel, not comically tip toeing around and still somehow maintaining or gaining speed. Charge played a hyper fast animation of the standard run animation that really displayed a frantic berserker rush forward into combat, now (or at least the last time I saw it on live) it’s a slowed down sprint animation that  awkwardly glides forward at a weird pace. While I appreciate the new animations, and can totally get behind some of them... for some, such as myself it’s alienating. One of my mages was undead because I just loved the casting animations so much, same to a rogue. Now those animations are potentially gone entirely depending on spec, I think- I’m not sure I logged into him the other day and aside from being so confused about all the switched up spells (it’s been a lonnng time) I don’t recall any of them in my spec having that animation I fell in love with a billion years ago. It’s the small parts of identity tied to characters that when it just inexplicably gets changed and it’s a “eh deal with it” situation.  I’m drunk and rambly and I honestly don’t remember what point I intended to post, aside from agreeing that animations and the like  are a huge deal for some. I’m sorry
---
They get one (T2) and a half (T3). Tier 1 looks horrible and very low effort and T2.5 looks like an orange slurpee
---
Feel out the server while leveling and meet people along the way. Maybe commit to one around 50+ after u filter out the ones with bad rep/players or who spam trade all day.
---
Also one that has a schedule i like. Im indifferent about loot systems and as long as the same 40ish people keep raiding then eventually you can get items even if your the last one.
---
Zero chance.
---
They're not even giving 20% of their EU playerbase their own server.
---
Damage was too high with most classes on the beta servers, wasn't it?

I'm 51 now!

I've been practicing with this over the past few weeks but it always breaks my brain and I revert to WASD.

---
Ahh, cool. Thanks.
---
No, not really. The big unknown in regards to leveling on Pservers was mob data. They had to recreate spells, HP values, armor values, etc. And they got the starting zones all wrong (much harder on Pservers). Almost all of the actual player data was accurate.
---
I just checked the beta client. Parts of this video are incorrect/outdated, humans DO move their legs when they turn in place. Some of the info is correct, such as the missing background trees in SW and missing Stockade clock tower, but take the rest with a grain of salt. I’m happy to check on any other landmarks or mechanics you feel may be missing, just comment with a screenshot or request. I’ll help when I can.
---
dude if you can't stand waiting in queue just push the release date back a week for yourself. why does it matter so much that you get to play release when it won't be an epic event with 10,000 people in the same zone? you can only play weekends so you're not looking to hit cap in 4 days so wtf man?

Undead rogue who terrorized alliance at the Harbor...many deaths from this one.
---
I hated him but I respected him.
---
No problem - you were right to want clarification haha. He does give Allen most of the credit for helping everyone see the light.
---
Doubt they even are allowed to buy a server to host on.  Even with their complete lack of copy right rules etc.
---
Why not just play paladin then? It's your money and your time. You can play the class you want. Don't worry about meta or what other people say. If they want to choose your class, they can pay for your sub.
---
Thing is, in most games they work hard to make your move speed and animation match. Like if your character stride is 5 ft, then you should move 5 ft. That's what animators strive for. The glide is the exact opposite of what that natural motion looks like. The hyper fast animation that they have in for sprint looks a but off but the actual stealth movement animation looks far more correct in terms of stride to movement in game. 
---
Objectively it's a more accurate movement. That cant be argued.
---
Subjectively I think it looks better. We'll have to see how blizzard decides to go to see what they prefer
---
I haven't. I'll have to learn as I go. I've only seen some videos on Isboxer.
---
sorry but im going hafta downvote this :(
---
and then TBC comes around and enemies (and allies) cant get enough of you, especially in shattered halls :D
---
Alliance have better zones, horde have better races.
---
Do you realize how fucking stupid you sound? I state pservers are wrong, you say they arent, i bring up something that is wrong and you agree, then you still go on about how you're right. The stupidity people throw around in this thread is unfathomable. Pservers are wrong in so many ways and undertuned to fuck all
---
Bonereaver's Edge on my warrior.
---
The rest of my gear was pretty trash but this beauty made up for it. I saved up all of my DKP for this guy.
---
Nothing sadder than seeing a Warrior type LFM Tank/Heals.
---
Then I guarantee he’ll be fine, and love hunter to death. Can’t wait until August :D
---
I was 14 at the time so I don't remember well but my older sister played Druid and would endlessly complain that some of her BiS pieces for their raid progression were just cloth for her and she had more competition for those pieces
---
There's always someone...
---
&gt;People always remember Wrath in a bad light because of LFD, 
---
what? i dont think i've seen anyone speak badly of wotlk, like ever. i'd argue that overall most people would consider it the "best" WoW expansion/best time to play WoW. just about everything was good, and the issues were pretty minor, especially compared to the problems the game had prior, and the neutering the game got after it.
---
Instead of widening the field of view when playing 1.12 on a wide screen monitor, it instead just chops the top and bottom of the game window off. Meaning if two players were standing in the same spot, looking the same way with the same level of camera zoom, the player on the 4:3 monitor would be able to see more, because essentially the 16:9 gets the same image and then hides most of it off the top and bottom of the screen.
---
There was a fixed client commonly used by a lot of private server players.
---
Ok, so you're saying if we're currently playing BFA which would be EXP8 and you obtain Ashes with your TBC raiding guild back on a EXP2 server, Ashes will only be available in EXP2 and EXP8?  
---
What if you haven't yet progressed a character from EXP2 into EXP3, or should progressing a character to the next Expac only be available when a new Expac is released?
---
oh you know people are gonna be doing it. its gonna be a dirty lil secret.
---
Lol
---
Great video, but i'm low key worried they will push release back further with every one of these vids lmao.

I think you're wrong, I base this only on memory but I think I remember display showing more of the world on my uncle's computer when compared to what was in mine (CRT vs. LCD widescreen). He just had more peripheral vision.

That one female undead saying "I haven't got all day" in a snarky way.
---
&gt; tank = easy gearing up 
---
Your tank gear? Sure thing. Dps gear? You better be patient, because other than 2H weapons every rogue and hunter will have priority on most of your pre-raid BiS (with good reason, more so if you're the one tanking the dungeons) and keep dreaming if you want to get your T2.5, Onslaught Girdle and Chromatic Boots before your fury bois just because you're the tank.  
---
Being a warrior is like wearing a lead crown. It's even heavier if you're the main tank.
---
Lmaooo
---
Strong pvp 1v1, weak in group pvp.
---
That isn’t really saying anything. One might reasonable assume TBC and WOTLK is next is Classic is popular enough. Blizzard also has a history of cancelling projects.
---
Tl:dr: Doesn’t reveal anything we didn’t know.
---
Please post more stuff like this! I thrive on stories from vanilla.
---
After Phase 1? The next expansion release in Retail.

See you in STV
---
\-Stabby
---
While I am with you, even caused a wipe in vanilla tanking due to weapon skills; got a little over zealous when a new weapon dropped.
---
Its just one mechanic that I loved and was sad when they removed it. Always made me feel closer to UO. I was a swordsman again cause I had my swords skill up. Although in WoW it was better cause I wouldn't have to lower one skill to raise the other. I could just raise them all and change weapons at will.
---
Anyone who's ever tried to perform magic in real life can tell you that you can't shoot ice, fire, or shadows from your hand at will, either. Classic isn't trying to emulate real life, it's trying to recreate a game and a world that has already been established. The gliding thing isn't game-breaking, but people still have a right to complain about it.
---
hahahah my thoughts exactly. it seems like most of the posts on here are cringe as fuck but i cant stop consuming everything classic WoW until it comes out.
---
Final boss. level 39 elemental shaman twink on Terenas. Absolute menace in battlegrounds, whenever my fellow twink friend and I would queue up against him we knew it was a wrap.
---
Yea but didn't blizz in the last few days fix a bug that had all classes doing more damage to mobs than they were ment too? Maybe i read something wrong
---
you cant, 12 year olds/40 year olds with no life can
---
You're welcome mate, I'm glad people are finding it useful. I'm still tinkering with my stuff (and I'm sure I always will be), but I think I'm going to toss in some emotes on my buff macro and a couple other places. I already had raid callouts, but I should do something social and fun too. Maybe I'll even explicitly mention them in my post.
---
I mean, I wouldn't mind one xpac where you can work together, might be interesting.
---
because it doesn't show the reward of waiting in the queue, entering an epic event of 1000's of other players grateful for their chance to play world of warcraft together.   
---
as opposed to layered 50 people nearby which in 4 hours will be for all intents and purposes a dead server because your layer group has spread out.
---
You see no issue with making changes in the game solely to support streams?
---
I found the fourth Ooga Gang member, the one that didn't get the beta invite.

hahahah stealing this
---
I still use the same vent channel we got for BC arenas with a couple RL friends that I’ve played with since SWG.
---
Is whine all you do?
---
Yeah, it was a small increase to classes that relied on weapon speed for their class abilities, namely Hunters, Warriors, and Rogues.
---
They won’t. For all intents and purposes, the game is ready to go. Much of this video is either incorrect or outdated, as well.
---
It's easy to accomplish when you have a guild of 40-100 in a discord and actually listening to whatever leadership is going on.
---
Through in another guild with the same thing and the two guild leaders whispering the most basic of plans to each other, yes it's quite easy to pull off coordination.
---
Now randoms on the other hand, that's like trying to herd chickens with the severest of mental disorders.

Don't have to delete any if you don't have any :)

I've had more Battle.Net friend requests in the 3 stress tests than in the last 3 expansions.

For what it's worth, it does look like you can shove the chairs forward and the screens are high enough to force you to lean back.
---
But I wound  want to sit like that for hours ether
---
After 5 or 10 years you'll have caught up.
---
How? A geared twink has like 60% Dodge and a pally just auto attacks. Your only damage is judgement and shield spike.
---
hey man. stop shooting down this guys fanfic. he spent a lot of time on it.
---
 I can't imagine Private Server Admins going out of their way to plant trees like that.
---
Private servers have ten thousand more little bugs than the tiny nitpicks discussed in this thread. Having played both, I can tell you that the private server experience isn’t even in the same universe as Classic. They’ve gotten Classic really, really right.
---
Let me tell you about a little addon called [Spy](https://legacy-wow.com/wotlk-addons/spy/). It'll get ported to Classic (if it hasn't already), and you'll never need that sound again because you'll get a big shiny WARNING: EXCENT (ENEMY) USES STEALTH across your screen.
---
I used am external macro script to send my 1-9 keys to all open instances when I pressed them. Then I just customized the action bar of each character. One would be the main character, then everyone would have a in-game macro to target his target. I also had a macro to follow him.
---
I got into it with the recruit a friend program. I had two and a friend had two that I would often run the four as a set. Occasionally add a max level booster for instance farming. We powered multiple sets to 45 this way. Then I paired mine off and quested up to 60, then again to 70 with TBC.
---
I'm considering doing it again with classic, but not sure if I will be able to transfer characters to get me account when done.
---
You'll almost certainly be limited to 60 FPS, but other than that should be fine. There are addons that make playing with a controller relatively easy.
---
&gt;skip a lot of trash by stealthing past it
---
and skip a lot of XP in doing so, which isn't exactly a good thing in vanilla
---
Sodapoppin talked about this before. Something like how this is just basically how doing anything is as a streamer his size. Farming mats? A few viewers will come to gank, then a few viewers will come to defend him, streamers aren’t necessarily calling fanboy armies some people just want attention and show up to be on stream. Then viewers see there’s 5v5 wpvp happening and someone starts forming a raid group, then another raid group forms to fight them. Now it’s 40v40 wpvp and he just wanted to farm mats.
---
If this happened every once in a while it would be cool, but this would be like almost every day and unavoidable for him.
---
retail is world of diablo, they took their design team to wow. its how you got great rifts (mythic +) paragon levels (ap grinds), legendary's in legion etc and while that fresh coat of paint was okay it wore thin extremely quick explaining diablo 3 and bfa's failure to retain players. who knew grinding the same content for the same reward wouldn't be fun for long?
---
You'll need to get a cot to sleep on, and a few more things.... you don't plan to actually leave this room do you?   Is it the layering that's holding this room back?  I just filed for divorce so if blizzard fucks this up I'm ruined.  YOU GOT ME CONCERNED BRO WHERE IS THE BED!?  I'VE ALREADY WORKED OUT CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS WHY ISN'T THIS ROOM COMPLETE!?
---
Ok.... I'm sorry...... I'm just...... concerned that's all......
---
lock could fill the dps spot with no mana issues. lifetap and later on talents that improve mana regen, even imp mana battery.
---
I just played on a "FRESH" server and mobs were respawning way faster than retail Vanilla.
---
Alliance shows population lead in all polls though. Pserver meta is Alliance favored and these are the guys that will stick around, not the r1 streamers who will stream something else when the Classic hype tanks and they can't monetize it as well anymore.
---
I'm hoping Isboxer can easily map keys to a mouse or keyboard that has many extra buttons. I think I'll like to have a lot of keybinds.
---
The concept of sacrifice used to exist in every corner of Vanilla WoW. This psychology made every decision important. 
---
Over the years they've slowly removed every bit of sacrifice, and with it all meaning in the game.
---
I'm personally gonna wait a bit so the first toxic players can fight over the quest mobs themselves first.
---
There's going to be so many players going *"ffs, noob, stop stealing my quest kills"* that have no idea why you should form a party
---
If you want world pvp you'll have to start your own. Get out there and gank! If it's red, it's dead!
---
#nochanges
---
Does the other stockades have the missing clock part too?
---
Yes, dynamic respawning is on Pservers and isn't on Classic (even though it should be, because it existed in Vanilla).
---
I wasn't talking about sub 90 hours with players abusing this. My comment strictly dealt with people running their own servers with updated data from the Classic Beta.

---
Yes that is indeed the joke
---
the feel of a game is important. the original stealth animation is a large part of it. 
---
orc rogues are especially screwed, theirs is the worst by far.
---
You do realise classic is the only way for Blizz to redeem themselves at least a bit, right? It's not just a cash grab, it's a way for them to restore at least some of the customer confidence they lost in the recent years. 
---
I agree with all the Activision shit but I don't think this project is what you are describing. The classic team have communicated more with us and have listened and acted on feedback more than the retail team have in the last 5+ years.
---
At the end of the day we're all just speculating so I guess we just have to wait and see

The bones are there. Anything else I can check out for you?
---
the only thing you are "out" ing is out-cringing everyone on this subreddit right now
---
please don't spread lies just because you're jealous.
---
So this sounds like an awesome initiative, I really hope you guys make it happen and find three great names to go along it. 
---
It seems like you'll be running mostly instances, outside you wont have any issues whatsover but inside i like others see some issues coming up that you should prepare for. 
---
Like others I also note you wont have any real cc, while you can chain stun mobs you will have to use globalcooldowns for it. I also have a hard time seeing cat tanking in dungeons working out great but that is not of much concern as a feral bear does great dps for a tank so for the "normal" dungeon pulls you wont loose out much compared to your original plan. 
---
Engineering would supplement you all greatly, try to get as many engineers of you as possible. Drawing a whole room into mines, bombs and then X3 hurricanes will most likely be awesome for aoe farming. 
---
Your hope of out-DPSing a priest, rogue and a warrior is futile if they are playing it optimal, a feral druid can compete against a fury tank in threath but hardly in dps, a feral cat would not be able to powershift if he is to have some kind of mana for anything else making a feral cat slower then a rogue. You will on the other hand be able to stealth through most of everything so that is really of no concern. 
---
On the talent department you tons of options, if you all are together at all times i would almost suggest having the resto druid going a bit more balance as shifting and dpsing then shifting back again to heal is hardly less mana then a proper starfire, while you will have to be carefull converting the healers mana into dps the initial burst is highly important. Solo levling as balance is really slow and a hybrid is at all times better for that so dont leave this dude alone with this slow solo specc. 
---
&gt;Hopefully minimal mana issues.
---
Perhaps if you really abuse preplanning professions, gear, pulls, threath and the 5 second rule. Like if the bear stacks strength and stamina, the dps cat stacks agi and int while the resto balance stacks int spi, there will be loads of really great gear in crafting and on AH.
---
When the balance druid is out of mana he uses his last to go into catform while the cat dps shifts out and starts to heal. Or if the bears innervate is needed the cat switches to bear and aoe taunts. 
---
Dont miss insect swarm and imp thorns
---
Sweet! I’m definitely not too concerned with getting ultra high fps because I doubt i was pulling that performance off back in 2005. I hadn’t even thought of using a controller, but i’d love to give it a shot. I figure a wireless mouse and keyboard might also contribute to some input lag.
---
If your video card on your PC has HDMI outputs, just get a long HDMI cable and you can hook it up that way. If not, you'll need an [DVI to HDMI](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Input-Output-Adapter-Cable/dp/B014I8UQJY) cable and you can hook it up that way.
---
A TV is treated like a monitor, you just set the resolution you want it to run at.
---
4k is 3840 x 2160
---
1080p is  1920  x 1080
---
720p is 1280 x 720
---
Since you're running on an older machine, I wouldn't even both trying to run it at 4k. I'd try it at 1080p and 720p and see which you like best.
---
You'll also want to set your refresh rate to 60hz
---
WoW isn't a game where input lag has much of an effect, regardless most TVs usually have a "gamer mode" setting that handles the settings for you.
---
I think that this is a good thing, that kind of discussion belongs on that sub and there's easily at least one post a day that I see that's about post-Naxx theories and ideas here, all of which are off-topic. Informationally, it's good to spread.
---
I see, I guess you'd rather have all the wrong numbers, mechanics and actual bugs than some visual bugs. Makes sense.
---
We've turned into /r/classiccirclejerk
---
What was the norm in 1.12 will pretty much be the norm for all of Classic.
---
Stormwind now being more popular than Ironforge is because SW didn't have an Auction House for the first ~13 months (~64% of the Vanilla game). It will now have an Auction House on launch day.

I doubt someone that did it once 15 years ago remembers enough to do it faster than someone that did it at least once in the last year

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5K2NrSZvO4) does a pretty good job of explaining controllers in WoW.

---
Awesome! Now we need to have them looks at druid base paw damage to see if druids are nerfed in classic compared to pservers.
---
Save this for August...
---
It's a whole different team and they have been fixing bugs. If you guys had at least some devrloper background you'd know bug fixing can be tricky, especially tracking down the source of the bug.
---
lol wow people who downvoted you are really idiots for not picking up the obvious sarcasm
---
What do you require?
---
I think it was, though. I only played 3 months or so before TBC, but I remember being able to compare stats in tool tips *somehow.* I thought it was shift + hover?
---
Sorry tho, I wanted to use WoW songs but it's copyright.
---
Hopefully I can find one organically through playing and having positive experiences. Not sure what I'll be doing at 60 yet.
---
You know that even if I am going to play Classic, I can simply choose who I want group up and play with? In case you didn't know - I do. It's my time and I do what I want with it. I might even spare another hour just not to group up with total asshole. and create my own party. I am cool guy and never cause any drama, but I do fuck drama queens badly.

Hugo was a big Tauren who was well liked and well known on the server. He would often dress in a pink shirt and dance on the bank while talking in trade chat. He was probably the most popular person on the server Eldre'Thalas.
---
Troll world chat and guild hop until I have a bad reputation on the server, pug everything until naxx, then get upset when the only 3 naxx progressing guilds won’t take me
---
Hey buddy you're both saying private servers are wrong.
---
I love how all the people cry about how pservers are more blizzlike, but they ignore the fact that pservers players have been complaining how things are wrong based on their pserver experience and being shown how the pservers are actually wrong. Have you ever even played one? They're terrible.
---
What?
---
I swear half the posts on this sub about modern WoW are completely made up to just stir some shit. They absolutely are not getting rid of the Horde vs Alliance rivalry - hell, if BFA did *anything* right, it was ignite the war again after Legion settled it down (fight-together-against-common-enemy deal).
---
Don't touch the classes.
---
Just add gear that allows the classes to perform different ways functionally.
---
You could easily make things like Boomkin and Prot Pally raid viable with some properly itemized gear drops.
---
Feral is a DPS and OT spec - so you should be ready to OT as well as DPS. If you treat it that way, you can get a spot in many guilds. Feral is good for the skull target, while the warriors build threat. Feral has the fastest threat climb. Then, once your marks are dead, you switch weapons and do dps at an acceptable rate, when taking into account the rest of your raid utility.  
---
In TBC: Druids tanks were defense capped (non crittable) for free - Talent was Survival of the Fittest. However, without a shield, they couldn't hit uncrushable. They also tended to do a better job going high stam and armor than agility, so they worked better with pally or resto druid healers.
---
Was/Is there a bug where pets weren't properly holding aggro? I saw some discussion about it and during the last stress test it seemed to be an issue.
---
That would have been Legion. 
---
Lore wise, "teaming together" (it was more of a cease-fire) was a better alternative to the Legion taking over and killing everything on Azeroth.
---
Ok this is seriously worrying. Wtf is Blizz doing.
---
How is melee leeway a bug?
---
You can't ever catch up, because of how the honor system works.
---
but every single post above yours mentions vanilla wow, not pservers
---
i dont know any singular pserver that is actually true to vanilla wow
---
Pretty sure they're worse on classic beta though than they were back in vanilla.
---
i'm assuming you reported these? often i wonder if an entire forum just sees a video like this and goes "huh, shit" and just assumes someone else will report it, but nobody does lmao
---
You're a good man! Easy to tell.

I wish I could've taken screenshots during vanilla but I was just a kid focusing on playing the game. This time I'll take the time to find good places to take screenshots of.
---
Private server players have been proven time and time again how their private servers aren't even close to being blizzlike. Remember the "elites are too easy" drama. They're not, it's just that private servers guessed at a lot of the numbers, and guessed at a lot of the mechanics, and also I loved buying XP tokens and Shop mounts on private servers, that was so blizzlike.
---
I rarely have my second monitor turned on or showing anything other than a background picture to be honest.
---
I still alt tab a lot of stuff, I think it's from growing up gaming on a single monitor, never could get used to having two going at the same time, always seems like overkill.
---
Now at work I live for having three monitors, I couldn't function without them.
---
I'm weird though.
---
Chill fam he finna poop in a bucket it’s coo
---
Why do you say things that hurt me?
---
&gt;Laughing at the fact you think pservers are accurate and **or harder.** 
---
You said that. I and others were disputing that. Everyone knows they aren't accurate and I never said they were accurate to vanilla values. But you came in arguing that they weren't harder. The evidence shows that the content currently available in the beta is easier than the same content on private servers. If anyone is delusional here it's you.
---
Did anybody stop to consider that they might have been testing the aggressive layering in preparation for potentially millions at launch? And now that they’ve tested it, which is the entire point of a beta, they can start scaling it down?
---
Agree, easily my Thunderfury.
---
Damn, that memory! I had an engineering buddy that would talk to me about the “cool” quirks of engineering, and this was one of them. Also, unlearning goblin/gnomish engineering by reading an obscure book in a hut on the coast of desolace.

I get your point. But all my characters went from looking cute to looking like meth heads with the new models and it broke my heart. Looking forward to those old familiar faces!

I could never imagine going back to one, let alone two.

I have my main monitor with two vertical monitors on either side of it. One is usually dedicated to Discord and the other to guides/content/etc.

Can't wait to share it with all of you...who happen to be on my particular layer

There’s honestly no way to know until classic comes out. We are going to form new trends that I bet we weren’t doing in ‘05. Such is the beauty of the evolution of gaming
---
In some ways, Ion has combined the factions though. With Mercenary mode, alliance and horde effectively PvP together. Some groups can communicate with each other. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if we got cross-faction raiding or dungeons at some point.
---
Bg’s are optional so if you want a server with no battlegrounds that’s all you fam
---
World PvP will never be at risk in Classic because you have to leave the main cities to farm/endgame content.
---
Some of the best PvP gear is from raids, which require attunement quests/materials for consumables etc.
---
Some of the best consumables useful in PvP requires materials from the world, or a lot of gold which is farmed in the world.
---
It doesn't matter if you PvP or PvE exclusively, and even if you do nothing but BGs, you will still find yourself out in the world often.
---
I am turning 30 in about 3 weeks. :( It's bothering me for some reason. Thankfully Classic and my daughter occupy my mind. I don't know why I am sharing this...
---
I'm pretty sure you're reading that wrong. To me it sounds like they wanna stop doing the whole "grrrrr we're at war but let's stop and fight azshara together" and do something else, but nowhere did he say that that something else would be to make them friendly to each other.

Came here to comment this

Either Blizzard's plans to convert Classic players over to Retail happens within ~2 years or they release TBC, nothing else is likely.

Even if you have a direct line of communication, people still don't listen. People want to be special boys. While listening to streamer isn't as good as discord due to the stream delay, people still frequently don't listen to simple instructions like "don't run ahead of me" or "stop running off alone you're going to die".
---
There are so many variables in wPvP that level of coordination becomes harder the more people you have, and becomes impossible at full raid numbers.
---
Yes, we are all just speculating. I'm simply putting my money on what I have described. It's the safe bet.
---
Read the rest of my responses on this post you'll see I was talking specifically about how they had to make it hyperaggressive to maximize the transitions per interval. I don't fault them for it just seems like it killed the beta.
---

I was alliance on nath and I don’t remember him unfortunately. I do remember tokro though, the Hunter who camped stv 24/7 fanning

Bellikhan- Tauren warrior on Stonemaul. He was a high warlord I frequently battled in sithilus on my rank 10 pally. He would wait until we had a clear area and full stats, then bow for the battle. If another horde jumped me mid fight he would back off and wait until I killed the intruder.

or, alternatively, you could get a job.
---
Yeah I wont be messing with support classes this time around. It's either full on dps or full on healer.
---
It certainly is, sometimes.
---
I've been doing 1-30 runs on every class. I've done 3 so far and I'm half way through number 4. As far as I can tell, every class is really fun and I'll have a good time no matter what I main.

Every class I play I think "this is the one". Then I move on to test the next one and I think the same thing.

Alamo (druid):  Teaches you how to play durid
---
Well there is only druid guild that has cleared raid content since Vanilla so I am pretty positive this is totally viable (and sure really fun) way to do 5mans.
---
I don’t think cancelform ever triggered GCD though, and potions are long CD, so they wouldn’t either. You wouldn’t run into CD conflicts until re-shifting. It’s been a loooong time since I made a WoW macro though.
---
I do the same thing. I want to take one class to 60, though. I’m torn between a bear tank Druid running 5-mans or a marksman hunter doing heavy DPS. I’ll play a billion alts, I have no regrets about that, but I’d like to have at least one main hit 60.
---
Or maybe these changes don't happen overnight and have been worked on for some time... nah, it must have been the Reddit posts.
---
We did it reddit!!
---
No need for the sad face, I think I can survive a downvote.
---
holy fuck dude, are you really so entitled to believe these 'autoattack' bugs are more important than some server related issue that you may not even be aware of ? From a dev perspective these bug reports of yours are not urgent at all. They can easily be fixed within 1 iteration, whereas some internal issues with layering/scalability or similar would be far far more urgent, complex and time consuming. 
---
This is such a typical situation from the IT field: customer reports his bug, believes it is the utmost important bug of them all and proceeds to get angry when company/product do not fix it within first couple of days. There are so many things you are not aware of that should be prioritized higher than your minor issues. 
---
You want to help development of your favorite game ? Report your fucking bug and wait for it to be fixed. All of these 'doom posts' disrupt development process and make it harder to do anything.

For me I want to get to 60 and raid ready ASAP so I’ll get invited to a guild ready to go who needs to fill spots with 60s early. Get in early, get in good!

I just loved the fact that some specs aren’t “viable” but still have their moments. Even in TBC they tried to make every spec of every class equally viable but I think the imbalance of specs made wow classic feel more real. You can be a boomkin and help in raids while never being top dps, but then go tear shit up in bgs.
---
As someone who actually played a gnome I disagree.
---
Trinket doesnt remove snares or slows; sub doesnt reduce sprint cd, it only gives another one with a very long cd; not all specs run imp sprint.
---
Having an on demand snare removal with only one min cd is great when you dont want to use your big cd just for that or you get chain snared by a mage.

On August 12th, I'll make my:

* Male Troll Mage

* Male Undead Priest

On August 26th, I'll make my:
---
* Male Orc Warrior
---
* Female Undead Warlock
---
* Female Troll Hunter
---
And I'll level them to 60, in that order. I will never touch Druid or Shaman. 
---
My main drive for the Rogue is being a part of the World First Ragnaros kill (or at least a week one Ragnaros kill).
---
My main drive for the Mage is being geared before AQ gates open.
---
My main drive for the Priest is because that was my main during WotLK.
---
I won't be leveling any alts until I can over them ghetto heirlooms (Skinning Knife with +30 spell power) and all the bags, money, etc that they need for a perfect leveling experience.
---
Of course private servers have more bugs. I never said they were anywhere near perfect right now, but after classic launches, they certainly can get a lot closer. 
---
&gt;Hell, half the "bugs" in Classic are just mistaken private server fanboys 
---
Aaand there it comes out. Are you just following all of my posts just to shit on everything I comment? Most of the bug reports have been verified from real vanilla footage.
---
Why do you continue to defend Blizzard and assuming they are perfect, infallible, and could never doing anything wrong? Why do you continue to deny the existence of bugs?
---
&gt;you have absolutely zero understanding of software development.
---
I'm a fucking software developer. I fully understand why Blizzard chose the path they did: It's the easy way, not the right way. And if you really think supporting the 1.12 client is impossible, consider that a couple of French dudes in a basement managed to do it from scratch. Of course it wasn

No, it wasn't, that's the point of a beta, to test things. They can't test 3000 player layers when their whole beta has 3000 players. So you scale things down to see how they work out.

A couple of beta versions ago they fixed fd responsiveness and you could scatter / fd / trap really effectively everywhere EXCEPT in BGs where it was still completely broken. Still it was nice to be able to use it in duels and dungeons

The Aaaaaughibbrgubugbugrguburgle is strong with this one.

This is a beta. The point of the beta is to test everything. They can't test layering with huge layers like there will be on release if they don't have those players.

Server: Azjol-Nerub 
---
Alliance: Marshall Darde the druid. I was a complete noob, click and keyboard turning druid. When I saw him absolutely handle 3 people to cap flags in AV/AB I thought he was some sort of god. I thought druids were awful. I remember constantly badgering him for tips and him threatening to put me on ignore. Eventually we would become great friends and we would win WSG games together, one hybrid feral druid (him) and one resto (me). 
---
Horde: Dejoule the UD mage of guild KoV. Azj had a horde pvp guild with all the highwarlords whereas the Alliance was mostly a ragtag group of aspiring pvpers the horde had KoV. They would pvp flag and show up anywhere and dominate any fight. One player was particularly terrifying and that was Dejoule in WSG. They would send this one guy to go get the flag back and he would get it back every single time. Some Alliance thought he was hacking the numbers because his burst was so insane. Later he would roll alliance and we would laugh about it and discuss our love for Legacy of Kain series (his character was from Blood Omen). 
---
I have fond memories of our shortbus pvp community. Good times.
---
This seems more reasonable, I was like 99.9% sure it didn't stretch the image lol.
---
It depends on the class though. Hunters are pretty much entirely broken on the beta, and most seem to say that it's very noticeable.
---
Maybe the community can just designate one server as the unofficial wpvp server. I'd probably pick that one.
---
Stoneform alone (bleeds, poisons, 10% armor added)... arguably the best PVP racial ability for the alliance. Spiritual Focus offers a 70% chance to ignore attacks, making basic healing very simple.
---
Bubble, BoP, LoH... three last ditch efforts that rogues don’t have. Throw down consecration during any of those... helps stop a rogue from healing/vanishing. 
---
Hammer or Repentance (for later lvl twinks), two stuns that rogues generally can’t jump out of. 
---
On top of all of this, the typical heavy style armor (mail/plate), heals, possibly added shield, different skills, etc.
---
If you Google Vanilla Paladin PvP/Twink build, or Pally vs Rogue Classic / Vanilla, you’ll find most conversations agree the Pally puts up a hard fight or is the best anti-rogue. Dwarf Pallys are known to be the perfect anti-rogue, right there with Frost Mages.
---
It’s a reference to the Joe Rogan Podcast, Classic WoW isn’t a podcast.
---
So what? The beta isn’t any better and as of now it’s way worse.
---
Leveling is kill one mob, bandage/eat, next. And the kill time is slow. But if you get the hang of trading autos with hamstring kiting you can do 2.5 mobs without healing.
---
*Once
---
Good assumption,
---
15 years ago only? How all of the years, before each expansion until the current wow?
---
Yeah my point is it may have been at the cost of the detriment of all the other testing.
---
I didn't just upgrade my GPU and moved to 4k monitor so I can play WoW with low graphics and 800x600 resolution. I will crank every single slider to far right.. and then I lay back and enjoy the views.
---
It's in testing phases, but the makers of ConsolePort have assured their fanbase that the addon will be available for Classic.
---
Yes if the content is easily soloable, say 2 xpacs ago like they do raid legacy modes now, same for xmogs, this would allow you to have the Scarab Lord title in BFA but obtained as current content like people did all over Wrath when blizz kept adding more servers that never hit the gong to open the AQ gates
---
Copying the character over to a new expansion stays a decision of the player, as long as it’s only done once. You could stay behind since you started late and finish at least one piece of endgame before going to the new xpac.
---
These are great questions and the reason why I made the post, thanks!
---
If you think some visual bugs are just as bad as pserver cash shops and guesstimated mechanics, maybe you should stick to those.

Hardcoded factions are actually shit -- 99% of the people praising them are carebears.
---
Let me decide who I want to group with/kill.
---
90% of the time the person I want to kill is the one on my own faction.
---
No they were in Gurubashi. Must be more than one starsky and hutch.
---
&gt;I just don't understand why* people literally want a downgrade in graphics.. 
---
Have you ever played minecraft? That game has some of the worst graphics but the art style is so central to the game that it doesn't matter. People have made realistic looking texture packs, and still, the vast majority of players prefer the original blocky 16x16 resolution.
---
I don't consider it to be a downgrade in the slightest, and I intend to keep the old graphics turned on because in my opinion they fit the game much better.

Pallydwarf on nordrassilEU, my first real WoW friend I guess.
---
He quit somewhere in wotlk, and i rolled horde on boulderfist.
---

---
I prefer to span nothing but frostbolt, like a true man of culture.
---
Can you elaborate on what "entirely broken" means? I've heard a hunter or two complain about their pet in vague terms, but they wouldn't give specifics. Hunters are easily the strongest DPS in the forced 40 meta, but that's mostly due to their lack of glancing blows against higher level targets. I've seen hunters do hunter things without any real problems, so I'm very curious about what's allegedly going wrong with them. Any clarity you could give would be much appreciated.
---
It's called TBC
---
When I tried it, even my human male moved his legs. Seems to be situational. No character I tried however has a correct strafing animation, let alone even moves the head when turning.
---
2 out of 49! nice, way to go!
---
glad to be back
---
Do drums of war exist with LW in vanilla? Probably not, but that would be a fun /charge one to make. If you end up posting anything else around druids let me know!
---
That's not how it works.
---
People not needing to eat or drink between mobs. Mobs in low level areas having way lower avoidance. Mob damage is lower. Elite damage is lower to the point that people could solo stuff that is practically impossible to solo on the popular pservers. There errors in pserver data tuned the difficulty up, not down, compared to vanilla. 
---
You haven't presented any evidence.
---
Horde ofc. They are simply the best
---
That's actually a great idea. I would join that one as well.
---
Not for me because I simply won't play a rogue. But if you have to deal with your character waddling around like it's holding in a shit and trying to find a bathroom every time you stealth, yeah that can definitely ruin that character for you. That animation in particular is extremely important for rogues.
---
First off: triple Druid is an excellent idea that will totally work as you described.  
---
You will probably be able to make you group work best by running with the full roster of 5. 
---
 The idea  of rotating among bears to cycle through periods of off healing vs dps can work as long as the three of you are always in voice chat.
---
Any other two people should be fine to 5 man with, as bears are pretty good tanks Pre raid progression.  Though you def want to try to bring a class with a resurrection if you can.  The good news is that is that there will be tons of elemental, enhancement, and shadow spec orphans who are actually quite good in dungeons.  Mana totems from shamans and summoned drinks from mages will be *particularly* powerful for your group composition
---
In all fairness the playerbase was horribly let down with BFA beta. So many bugs and other broken shit that Blizzard said would be fixed by release that are still in the game almost a year later. 
---
People had a right to be worried the same would happen. Luckily the classic lads at blizzard actually work for their paycheck.
---
Straight up no chance of being a scarab lord on the same server as a streamer either
---
The biggest (I think, basically only legit server out right now) is closing around classic launch but they said when they started if blizz makes official vanilla they would shut down.
---
Bc servers are gonna get huge, also wrath and mop have been getting popular lately. Classic wow hype made people that preferred other xpacs want to play their favorites again.

Magerko on Thunderhorn. 
---
Similar to the mage OP described.
---
That's not vanilla. It doesn't really matter what the retail fans want it to be changed to.
---
In half? I disagree.
---
The point remains that the avg in vanilla was probably closer to 12-15 days played for most people. In classic it might drop to 9-12, I'd say average will still above 10 days played.
---
This all also depends on xp values vs private servers since there aren't too many resources to compare with true vanilla wow 2004-2006 
---
I think for people like me who will make speed a priority in the first week , following guides etc, will still be at 7+ days
---
These dudes like joker and Joana make 4 day runs seem possible but it's much harder to do than it looks for them, they've been doing this shiz a while..

Joker hit 45 today on silverhand (the fresh LH server) -- 1d16h played. Fucking disgusting.

Coulda swore Steelballa was a Human pally..

Split that in half and add in some qerzxc and you've got a useable setup. But if you're going to lift you hand across the keyboard to reach 7~= you may as well just be clicking it. This means half of your keybinds may as well not be bound at all.
---
Paladins are prettymuch 2 button healers in classic. If that sounds rewarding, then go for it
---
Healing is very rewarding! If you're unsure about whether healing is fulfilling or rewarding or fun, maybe it isn't for you.   
---
My favourite part of healing is the secret guild channel that only tanks and healers know about where we shittalk about the DPS.
---
Buffs. Buffing someone or receiving a buff really makes a difference for leveling, PvP, and raiding!
---
Came here to post about Rhok'Delar.  
---
Such an amazing achievement.
---
But what's he gonna blindly hate on now ?
---
they could try stop silencing discussion surrounding layering. fckin nazis
---
There was a lot of production value in the video you made. I want to say this is the best and the easiest to comprehend post in the subreddit.
---
I hope you are right and all the bugs get squashed.
---
I remember that! 
---
"Outlaws" was the idea. I was totally planning on doing that :).
---
Sure, there was a post yesterday talking about this in more detail: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c4cjum/state_of_hunter_on_the_beta/). A decent number of people have backed out of playing a hunter due to how broken the class is at the moment. I plan on playing a warlock, so I'm a bit worried the minion AI is going to be messed up too.
---
You're overreacting a fair bit I think. I'm well aware that it's all a matter of triage when it comes to bug fixing. The reality is that many bugs do not get fixed  by the time a game launches. They can be reported and well documented for months during the testing phases and just don't get fixed.  I'll be just fine come launch, I'll be playing a warrior for my guild with a Warlock or hopefully a hunter alt for farming gold. 
---
Sometimes the ones that don't get fixed are more meaningful to some players. People who want to main hunter are definitely heavily invested in these bugs getting fixed but trying to silence people with blanket statements that things will be fixed because of X days before launch is not always accurate.
---
Remember when mobs would kill you by calling for help near death?
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
Such a unique fight for those days.  Action everywhere.  Everyone having to do their separate part to weave together a success.  It's my favorite part of vanilla.
---
And yep, experience and knowledge was critical, and there was one way to get it.    
---
We went through our fair share of wipes and "re-strategery" as well.  I remember one "attempt" that consisted of the Raid Leader saying, "Okay, let everything charge the platform and just kill it when it gets here.  Just go apeshit."  The whole point was just to get one officer to shut up about his terrible idea.  We died quickly of course.   "Just go apeshit" became a default joke when boss attempts weren't going well.
---
Well heirlooms came out in wrath and Cata completely changed some zones, stats, classes, removed and added quests.
---
So at best: who would level faster, someone who leveled at least once 15 years ago or at least once in a similar game 9 years ago, or someone who leveled in the exact game 1 year or less ago?
---
Yes and no, it can get repetitive but it depends what you find rewarding.
---
I've always felt that vanilla wasn't as much about individual gameplay experience as it was about the group gameplay experience. What I mean by that is, what your class does individually isn't what is engaging about the game. It's about how everyone comes together to use their strengths to compliment each classes weakness.
---
I missed that. I just took Gurubashi... no alliance in sight
---
Sweet, thanks. That's the only thing I could think of. In the demo client there were only shadows where the bones were supposed to be. They must've had some problems porting the maps over which lead to some models missing, and the ones in Stormwind just happen to be such models that they haven't gotten around to fixing yet.
---
I can see that perspective, but at the same thing The Alliance and Horde aren't really enemies at the end of WC3, and Forsaken are totally doing their own thing at the end of it.
---
the biggest danger will be the healer running out of mana, so bring pots and you will be fine.
---
But run with 3 dps over one will always be faster so I would expect you would probably end up filling out the group as you are able to
---
I like how when a few hundred people say something it's "the whole subreddit".
---
People always forget it's a vocal minority.  I promise more people just didn't speak up because we want to wait and see.  There's a lot of bugs it's not silly to be a bit reserved.
---
Very few dungeon and raid mechanics in Classic require healers to do anything but stay in range of the tank (or their assigned targets) and spam heals.
---
I wouldn't say it lacks rewards, because no one would be able to do any group content without healers, but it certainly lacks recognition.
---
If you want more utility outside of buffing, I would consider Priest over Paladin. At least with 31/0/20 you have several nice cooldowns and will be responsible for keeping up Shadow Weaving.
---
I personally love healing, but I won't be maining a healer in Classic. There's just not much challenge to it.
---
horde for sure so everything besides pala... 
---
having a blast frontstabbing with the rogue at the moment, but that seems fixed in classic.
---
biggest issue i have is:
---
if i play a tank i am always thinking "what useless dps and incompetent heal"
---
if i play a dps i am always thinking "what useless tank and incompetent heal"
---
if i play a heal i am always thinking "what useless tank and incompetent dps"
---
but i will play shaman probably. or warry? maybe rogue... but on 2nd thought hunter seems fun, but i never had a priest sooooo
---
fuck i dont know hahaha kill me now..
---
Invite more people?
---
I could have sworn he was horde, but it's very possible I'm mixing things up as it's been so long.
---
Sry bud but those reputable sources are most likely private server kids who were born on private servers and never experienced the real thing. I remember not so long ago when the same people were trying to tell us that enrage procced from/sitting
---
You turn small green bars into big green bars, what could be more rewarding?
---
Wait during the arena chest 48 min ago? Charles had us in a group of 8 and we lost, but we were there. Might be a sign layering is still there. Either way we'll be around nessy :P
---
 You honestly surprised that blizzard gonna release yet another broken game?
---
as arnold said, ill be back
---
Blizzard themselves quoted 10 days /played in Vanilla.
---
Anything that isn't level 40 in under 40 hours isn't really considered a speedrun anymore.
---
We will see people hit sub 90 hours to 60 in the first week of Classic.
---
I most definitely remember him!
---
 Check the bugs from 1 month ago in posts, 99% of them are still there, people like you allow blizzard to make shit games for years and get away with it.
---
yeah, suck it illidan i dont need to sleep for a few thousand years
---
Overwrites the former if the crit was more damage, otherwise does nothing.
---
&gt; Are you just following all of my posts just to shit on everything I comment?
---
Don't worry, I shit on every private server poster on this sub equally whenever I catch them in the act.
---
&gt; And if you really think supporting the 1.12 client is impossible, consider that a couple of French dudes in a basement managed to do it from scratch without any money.
---
They didn't support the client itself in any way, and Nostalrius, just like all private servers, was vulnerable to every telehack and flight exploit on the planet which, as usual, led to botters farming chests by teleporting (and other nice things). If you think it was "better" you were not looking hard enough, if at all.
---
As an example of why supporting the client is important, the 1.12 client has bad microstuttering problems with certain kinds of modern hardware and generally runs at about 1/3rd the speed the Classic client does.
---
/r/instagramreality
---
My axe
---
 Wow a multi billion company fixes 2 bugs, that really proved all the haters wrong ! Only thousand more bugs to go, including hundreds game breaking bugs that been fixed in privates years ago.
---
Lvl 20 pally mace quest will forever be my favorite quest line for the simple fact it was so hard to get a grp for sfk because allie had zero quests for it. So inevitably you'd partner up with 5 other pallys and run your asses there and you'd all 2h tank mobs while others healed. The amount of time and running all for a blue is why I love classic. 
---
Talking to coworkers that play retail and never played classic often ask me why I still played classic on private servers. I often answer with shinning silver breastplate. Why? Because that lvl 24 item was so worth either finding the mats and someone to make it or buying it off the ah that if you saw someone who was lvl 30 without it you'd scoff and laugh when they would give you the answer as to why they didn't spend the 2 or 3 gold for it because it's worth every copper. In retail you never get that feeling from lvling that an item is a must have or putting the time into something that you won't replace for weeks.
---
You don't need a lot of people to test that, it's easier for them to monitor everything with a smaller amount of player and then scale things up.
---
That sad as fuck ghost quest in the plaguelands
---
Healing is about consistently making good decisions to cast the right level heal with the best mana efficiency to conserve your mana as much as possible. To me, ending a fight right at 0 mana feels great. Even better when you’re high on healing meters.
---
Healing is constantly making the right choice which is always changing, dps is about min maxing your rotation without much freedom, tanking is about being a huge nerd minmaxing tps with spreadsheets only to have aggro ripped off of you because a hunter pressed aimed shot before the optimal sunder stack.
---
Huehuehuehue
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one. I still can’t find it.
---
Wow
---
My favorite part of being DPS is the secret Discord server we use to tell the other faction where our healers and tanks are so they can get ganked for talking shit about us.
---
Blizzard can quote whatever they like, the fact remains that in 2005 there were fresh servers being released where [Server First] was over 10 days played.
---
You also aren't accounting for the "average" player taking advantage of rested xp , where speed lvlers will be running more often and have less rested xp, causing a skew in the figures.
---
Joana says "that's why I don't call it speed running"
---
Sorry man, these guys I'm referencing are people who have put in years of personal time and research. Not just pulling this stuff out of my butthole.
---
But hey, if you wanna hold yourself to a standard of sub 4 days to 60, by all means. 
---
I just have an issue with people in this sub saying anything over 10 days is slow or something, that's ridiculous. 10 days used to be a guaranteed server first 60.
---
&gt; I shit on every private server poster
---
Then you should stop doing that. Go do something more productive instead of hunting down people.
---
If you enjoy dungeoning, then paladin is a great choice. You can go as healer to learn the dungeons, collect tanking gear, and then tank the dungeons afterwards. Paladin does great at tanking 5 mans, but it still has a bit of challenge to it given no taunt and so on. With one spec, you can run as healer or tank in dungeons.
---
&gt; the fact remains that in 2005 there were fresh servers being released where [Server First] was over 10 days played.
---
No, I don't think this is the case in the slightest, but would happily be proven wrong if you provide a source.
---
Time to switch to arathi/desolace
---
N.... no
---
Go look at Joanas screenshots my man, you're obviously not studied up on this stuff.
---
Joanas warlock in 2005 over 10d played server first, getting whispers "are you first on Alli and horde to 60?" From 109483 people lol
---
Again, not pulling this out of my ass.
---
Why does it have to be “someone who did it once”. 
---
Multiple people, who weren’t even power levelers, had MULTIPLE lvl 60’s before BFC.
---
Wrath is the jekyll and hyde of expansions.
---
Imo Wrath circa-Ulduar is the absolute pinnacle of WoW. Ulduar was the best raid ever created, both in looks and technology and also fight design. Classes felt great, everything was viable. DKs were maybe a bit overtuned but heroclasslol, and DKs were the best variation of the class in that all 3 trees had a mix of tank and dps abilities so you could be a DPS Blood dk or a Frost Tank (or a put-everything-in-blood-because-vampireslol-and-suck-at-both but hey, heroclass). 
---
Then Trial of the Champion came out, they introduced heroic/normal versions and they necessitated spam farming the same raid in the same circular room in both modes and the easiest bosses on 10 man dropped loot better than 25 man Ulduar. Then they introduced LFD.
---
Icecrown Citadel was a great raid, but the magic had gone from WoW for a lot of people as WoW had turned into a game of "grind the raids lots for loot" rather than "adventure with your friends".
---
If they do bring out Wrath servers... I hope they somehow keep them at a hybrid stage that makes them more like the game was around Ulduar.
---

Natural, the best geared Druid on Tichondrius-H, guild leader of The Core.
---
Do you have a link?
---
The bugs have been known since the 2018 demo. You think its a coincidence they fixed a bug the day after a big reddit thread when they have known about the bugs for over 7 months? Keep licking Blizzards boots buddy.
---
Just linked it
---
And within a patch were already working together again. I find the war to be insanely forced and cringe worthy these days. I'd rather they just put it out if it's misery and left PvP to extreme subfactions ala the BG reps. Warcraft 3 ended with peace even so it always struck me as odd why there was war in vanilla.
---
You probably shouldn't sit directly under one of those.
---
I understand it overwrites whatever happens so small off hand crits can trigger it and overwrite a large crit Eviscerate for example. That's why it's only usually invested in at only 1 point for dispel fodder.
---
Stance dancing
---
What are you on about cash shops for? My point is that the scripting (obviously not perfect) and modeling was done better than it is on the Beta. Cash shops have nothing to do with the recreation of the actual mechanical game as it was recreated by the Nostalrius team (not that Nostalrius had cash shops anyway - nor would any server I would choose to play on). As for “guesstimated mechanics” you’re claiming the beta doesn’t have that?
---
No. Its filling up empty bars.
---
Yes just not at 19. Mages and paladins lose to rogues at 19.
---
Always read your emails + blizz updates first my guy.
---
do they actually fix any of these bugs?
---
It's very boring, the only benefits are your own feeling of accomplishment, and out-of-raid guild advantages.
---
It really depends i would say 10 days to 60, but thats doing dungeons, professions etc.sure if u dont do professions, no dungeons just level with a guide u can bring that time down to maybe 6 days but u have to ask urself if that is the expirience u want to have. people here saying pservers are harder but many streamers confirmed that they have longer to level cause lower item droprates etc. and also they say u can go under 4days with every class, that maybe true but thats only possible with huge support from other players or twink (gold/items/summons/portals etc.)
---
No, smaller crits will not overwrite bigger crits.
---
&gt;If they're 3 manning 5 man dungeons it's not likely they're trying to min/max xp is it?
---
It's just called Three Brothers
---
This is true, people who prefer the other expacs will just play them on private servers instead of what could be an official XYZ 'Classic'
---
That's a great idea. It is just hard, because of how tempting the 5 cap battleground honor is.
---
What class is slower
---
No you have to buy an account to get in. Or play on F R E S H!
---
And my point is that you're wrong. The beta has some visual bugs. On private servers a lot of the mechanics and numbers such as npc health, damage, armor etc are completely wrong. And no, beta doesn't have those because blizzard has shown us their internal 1.12 server where they test things, like when people were crying over elite dmg remembering the broken private servers.
---
1. Start small, bind 3 abilities,  play until you feel comfortable/muscle memory kicks in. Add 1-2 more abilities, repeat.
---
2. Important abilities with long cooldowns should not be near your movement keys because you will fatfinger when you practice.
---
3. Bind strafe left/right on A/D instead of turning left/right. From now on you turn your character by pressing right mouse button.
---
4. Don't just copy other peoples keybinds. Keybinds are personal preference and there is no right or wrong.
---
I'm not sure if it was spelled Shadoweyes or something along that line, an undead rogue on Shadowsong-EU who I believe was server first to reach R14 and constantly ran WSG with a pre-made. It was basically guaranteed that Alliance would lose the battle against his group and many players would just /afk out of the BG if they saw his name on the board.
---
Absolutely but thought it was worth mentioning for a fresh druid that might otherwise not know and spend the money on a flight :)
---
So by your logic DPS is emptying full bars then.
---
From Joana: " I wouldn't exactly call this a speedrun"
---
Yeah, 3 months after US release and 11 days after EU release might have been impressive then, but it has no bearing on what will be the average in 2019.
---
Really? Is it not just as possible that many of the people hit max level, looked around, got bored, and will play again when the level cap is raised or something interesting happens?
---
http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/6985-talents-1-point-in-blessed-recovery/
---
Arena Junkies from back then doesn't confirm that
---
I actually cannot remember; but I suppose the idea still holds up against things like a shammy purge so they need multiple clicks?
---
You're better off just waiting for a fresh server! I am sure they will release some after the initial wave... here's to hoping.
---
Worst thing is three people schedule. Nothing real wrong with druid! Just a guild won't ever want there to be three druids in a forty man raid. Eh you can get carried though or start your own raid.
---
I didn't know this! I always just removed cure from the hotbar after abolish because they had the same mana cost! Thank you stranger :)
---
Don't warriors have a talent that increases stun resistance by an additional 15 %?
---
Warrior player, agreed with most of this 
---
But what do you mean when you say no one wants a protection warrior in their raids? This doesn’t make sense to me. If threat is an issue in later phases, yes, fury tanking is good, but it’s not like most guilds won’t have some prot warriors.
---
Sure, but the optics were pretty bad, it was the reason of all those posts about how classic was dead due to layering.
---
Take a look at the sidebar.
---
"What should I play" wednesday should have a lot of like mindend people
---
How in-demand do you think DPS and heals will be? I love healing, but want to try bear tanking for the novelty. I think it’d be fun for 5 mans. If DPS is in demand, I’ll do night elf hunter + leatherworking.
---
1. All of those comments are from well into TBC.
---
2. A couple of those comments talk about lesser crits NOT overwriting bigger ones.
---
The problem with the thousands of layering threads is that it's the vocal minority who keeps posting them, while the silent majority downvotes and keeps them at 0 upvotes. Not everyone is against layering (doesn't mean they are pro either), it's the best solution from a 2019 company and the best outcome we could have hoped for. They are not going to remove it until they want to, no matter how much people complain. I'd much rather sacrifice not being able to play the game for 2 days but being in a clusterfuck over having to transfer from a dead realm 2 months in, abandoning all the people I've met and possibly having to rename my character, losing all it's identity.
---
I’ve heard of this on a private server where they removed the scaling and said it was a bug, probably same for classic.
---
There’s another meme rogue private server build where you get Blazefury Amulet that adds 2 fire damage to attacks and (may or may not be intended) scales with sp.
---
Elemental and enhance was only really lackluster in raid content due to severe mana issues.  If you brought tons of pots/drinks you could do well to great in dungeons
---
Well, it won't be mount-offs or transmog competitions any more.
---
Probably raids and organized wPvP.
---
Not for levelling
---
right so all the numbers are perfect on the beta and so is this supposed internal 1.12 server. That’s what you’re claiming?
---
The demand for competent tanks will always be larger than the demand for competent healers which will always be larger than the demand for competent DPS. That's just the way of the world.
---
A single person choosing not to enter BGs does nothing for world pvp.
---
they should beable to beat his record by now...he set that record a very long time ago...
---
Most likely wpvp since every time will be different. Raids are the same things over and over so wpvp is what will keep people entertained
---
Thank You!
---
I disagree. This is the classic experience I want!
---
\#stoplayering
---
Yep. such an iconic animation especially for undead vanilla rogues. They changed to the 2nd animation in TBC or Wrath don't remember which
---
3. I have the machine, i played long enough on vanilla settings and i hate that vanilla-doodad pop up of the foliage.
---
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
---
Could have been pre-patch, but I remember it as TBC.
---
No luck with Google-fu?
---
I think every Classic streamer is in for a huge gut punch. Once the game is released to the public, there's absolutely no reason for anyone to watch them outside of a very few special occasions like the AQ scepter quest and gate opening.
---
People will watch week one Ragnaros kills. They'll watch every stream in the running for world first anything.
---
But they're not going to watch someone simply play the game once they can play it themselves.
---
Spends 2 hours in the bathroom doing her hair, makeup.

---
“Woke up like this! Hope I look OK!”
---
I guess he was more concerned with mitigation than threat.  It wouldn't be the end of the world assuming the dps weren't threat capped, but it's certainly better on the warrior.
---
Upvoting for awareness.
---
Stop talking about Druids... more people will play them, and we'll be more crowded.
---
&gt;(or at least a week one Ragnaros kill).
---
Yeah this isn't going to happen. I doubt a single guild will achieve this or any pubg. It's going to take at the very least 4-5 days /played just to hit 60. Then you need to get the Eternal Quintessence to spawn Majordomo.
---
Good luck with that.
---
The excitement is great and all but realistically it's going to just be nuts for the first 2 weeks. 
---
That's fine with me. There's a very good chance I won't even make it to 60!
---
I like your comments in this thread, on point.
---
Well it's literally a *downgrade* from the current state of the game. The in-game characters and *world* of Warcraft have been improved over the past several years by the developers. So anyone who has played even once in the past 10 years or so can log onto Classic and see graphically inferior characters and worlds. 
---
And I really don't think you can compare Minecraft and its optional Texture Packs to WoW and the forced graphical improvements that the developers made to their own game. Besides, to say "the vast majority of players prefer the original blocky 16x16 resolution" of Minecraft is just conjecture on your part. The problem with MC texture/resource packs is that they are constantly going out of date and it's an incredible hassle just overall. 
---
Apples and oranges.. Not the same at all.
---
It's probably my most missed feature, but it was a TBC feature.
---
What if the fight only lasts 30 seconds.  Kill times are a lot shorter now.
---
That is incorrect. Widescreen (with the correct aspect radio) was (and is) available still in the old 1.12.1 game client.
---
I’m glad you don’t develop the game.
---
I understand the confusion because it should be “[relevant activity] by day, [podcast pertaining to said activity] by night” as is the case with JRE. The commenter mixed it up.
---
Wpvp, raiding, battlegrounds will all have their own viewership. Chances are between Battlegrounds and Wpvp being the biggest, since they are dynamic and constant changing especially Wpvp. 
---
Raiding will have its spot when  new raids open, but once you’ve seen it cleared what’s the point of watching it get cleared again and again.
---
A NE Hunter named Terryelf on Kul Tiras, was always 5-10 levels higher than me, and would help me struggle through content as a 12 yo
---
Dual Talent Specialization was added 5 months into Wrath of the Lich King and cost 1000g, with a minimum level of 40.
---
Competitive Layer Hopping
---
That just means there will be more content for you to consume and a more fleshed out world to play in.
---
No. No no no no no
---
It's a part of what kept this game alive. Tribalism is a *hell* of a drug.
---
Restrictions are very, very good for an MMORPG
---
I literally haven’t met any children on pservers, virtually everyone playing classic is over the age of 20 and doesn’t gaf about that shit
---
Oh, it will happen. There's at least one guild with 120+ people making it happen.
---
100 hours /played to 60 with key players like the MT having round-the-clock account sharing. Summons, dungeon groups, gold and consumable feeding, the works.
---
They have it all worked out.
---
Is it really a “World first” or its it actually a “World 15,000th” considering how old the content is.
---
Give me some beer, a vent dj, and some friends, and I could run kara for years (Alts thrown in to mix up the raid squad, letting people switch roles).
---
Pretty sure it was in wotlk together with glyphs.
---
I guess to see the item drops, and watch streamers miss out.
---
The punchline is the Murloc ran away in fear and brought his friends.
---
Point 3 makes me happy :)
---
Auto attacks are your biggest damage as a rogue in raids, Stats impact that, energy doesn't. You can keep slice and dice up regardless of that energy boost with a proper rotation. 
---
It can certainly be fun to meme with though, Stormshroud + darkmantle with thistle tea etc can result in the most hilarious duels.
---
There is no overarching narrative. Vanilla is meant to be a world so it's a bunch of small interconnected story with a few bigger beats.
---
Retail is a movie
---
Vanilla is a world
---
Like that will ever happen, most streamers are the guild leader, aka head of loot council.
---
Holy shit that Wisp mining! Back to the WC3 roots
---
Vent or nothing. Deal with it.
---
It'll be a world first. There's never been a fresh official server with 1.12 data where MC was relevant.
---
It's very specific to zone and most of it doesn't chain through everything. One of the big things is Onyxia controlling the king of storm wind. I know we go kill C'thun because old gods are too dangerous to leave alone. Naxx is Kel'thuzad massing an undead army so we gotta stop him. I think Rag and Nef are just bad dudes with purples we want?
---
&gt; round-the-clock account sharing.
---
Enjoy the ban and WoWProgress not recognizing the kill. It's happened in the past with account sharing.
---
2 hunters bugs out of 49 got fixed, nice now it's definitively fine !
---
I’m a very slow leveler, so it’s a good chance I won’t be level 60 until phase 2 anyway :D
---
Save the extra gold for epic mount
---
It’s not relevant what “most people” (retail babies) mean, as pointed out earlier, it’s objectively wrong. It’s not vanilla. Blizzards goal is to create an authentic vanilla experience.
---
Vanilla WoW to me at least is like a world with many stories depending on your class fantasy and the way you  play, you're the story teller.
---
Yup definitely buy a weapon and wand. It helps so much with leveling. But don’t splurge on it because you still need to save gold for your 100% mount.
---
&gt; Seeing as level 40 mount + training costs 110 gold in classic wow
---
No it doesn't. It costs 90g if you're Honored with your own faction, which is pretty much guaranteed by level 40.
---
Nefarian and onyxia are siblings and offspring of neltharion/deathwing
---
Nope, I’m rolling paladin, gotta prove the haters wrong. 
---
I genuinely think there will be too many warriors this time around, people know too much.
---
any dps, you bring no utility to group pve
---
I just want a big brother streamer server with a 10k cap that I never have to join.
---
The ban won't happen and no one will know. They're all on the exact same machine.
---
&gt;which is pretty much guaranteed by level 40.
---
nope.
---
Cheers mate
---
I did. Almost all the OG veterans that started in Vanilla despised Wrath. I remember alot of wow veterans not logging on and all together disappearing from the game during that expansion.
---
So warlocks you want to buy any early items "of shadow wrath" I think its called. They can be semi cheap sometimes and is basically spell power for early levels. 
---
Paladins are probably fine. Most great 2h weapons are probably too expensive to be worthwhile.
---
The thing is you get fuckall rep from doing that
---
Yep.
---
My god, some fella is gonna hit it in one sitting...
---
How can your memory be so bad? Dual spec came out years after Classic.
---
I personally like getting upgrades every 5-10 levels on weps. If your leveling profs as u level you’ll still be fine
---
at which point you’re better off just getting on the tank team for one or two MC farm runs and picking up some t1, no?
---
The quest in the scepter of the shifting sands quest line where you summon eranikus in Moonglade
---
Ya but like Onyxia ya she is messing with the king of stormwind but did we really kill Nef because his sister is mean?
---
i love the colors in the caves, super bright/saturated
---
What you fail to realize is that bugs can take a lot of time to solve especially on such a gigantic code base like WOW must be.
---
I have spent almost a week tracking and solving one bug on a small code base, I can't imagine what it must be like at Blizzard !
---
Holy shit. I hate taking money from people and refuse. Idgaf
---
Skeleton should remain visible until next server reset
---
I guess they didn't expect people to be so clueless about what a beta is.
---
It'll be pretty obvious. Doesn't matter if you're on the same machine.
---
Ah I read it wrong, thought you meant getting 90g by lvl 40 was guaranteed. Yes honored is pretty much guaranteed by lvl 20 lol. Cheers for the downvote tho.
---
Did you even read anything about the lore before spreading bullshit ?   
---
Fact: Kel'Thuzad who helped spread the plague had no connections to the Alliance. Ner'zhul IS the Lich King, and he's a former orc.  
---
Fact: The only reason the sundering happened is because of high elves which were their own faction then and currently members of the Horde.  
---
Fact: The Burning Legion would never have come to Azeroth if the orcs refused to drink demon juice and get roided up to kill draenei, forcing them to retreat to azeroth. And having the burning legion chase them here  
---
Fact: The Blood Elves joined the Horde because of Sylvannas. The elves turned away by Garithos joined Kael'thas in Outland.  
---
Fact: The dark iron dwarves were not part of the Alliance when they summoned Ragnaros.  
---
Fact: The AQ gates wouldn't have existed if not for members of the Alliance.  
---
Pretty much every bad thing that has ever happened on Azeroth is the Orcs' invading fault.
---
Can you disprove that in any way? Cause others have tried and all they did was prove how clueless they were/how wrong private servers got it.
---
&gt;Imo Wrath circa-Ulduar is the absolute pinnacle of WoW. Ulduar was the best raid ever created
---
This^ Still cant believe the followed up that perfect raid with the worst raid of all time in Toc. God that raid was so boring and easy. Blizzard to me went downhill after that patch.
---
Organized Wpvp always attracts many viewers. Raiding will also be very popular especially the first clear of every new phase.
---
Anyone that says this ruins the game for them is a baby. If helmets looking like trash on half of the races for the last 15 years didn't ruin the game, this won't either.
---
If you are using an addon, like pfquest, so you can see where the quests are.  It kind of is.   You would have to go out of your way to fail to do it.
---
you gonna have a great time enjoy it :)
---
It's usually not reliable cuz your pet will die in big raids.
---
In 5 mans and UBRS I'm gonna roll master demonologist builds for a while, for fun.
---
Once it's 40 man it'll probably be SM/Ruin
---
the fact that they didn’t make it the Rogue class hall for Legion is shockingly terrible
---
Not much for the gameplay. Maybe a High Warlord farmer will get an audience, but apart from progression guilds and world bosses on PvP realms, there isn't much viewable content in WoW. Which is why modern WoW streaming is a lot of arenas, mythic+, progression raiding, and non gameplay focused streams.
---
There will be at least one level 60 player by midnight August 31st, 2019.
---
holy moly I am way off! O.K thanks. I played wrath for like 30 hours at most maybe... I am all mixed up. I must have just paid to change specs constantly (at least weekly)
---
That's what I'm saying 'tho :o. Saying that Ion stated the opposite of wanting to get rid of horde and alliance. I.e. he feels the faction conflict is still important.
---
You can still do it, but it.is harder.. Reason is that you tend to try strifeing back and forth in an attempt at not body pulling nearby mobs. Since the range of mobs is so much bigger it is harder.
---
How would summoning themselves work
---
&gt; They can be reported and well documented for months during the testing phases and just don't get fixed.
---
yes, because they were prioritized so.
---
For some reason people on this sub believe that Blizzard is some kind of super villain whose primary goal is to ruin your 'classic experience'. They are well aware about hunters autoattack problem, warlock pet problems etc. And I assure you anyone from dev team would love to fix their code. It is that sometimes you do not have human capacity to fix everything at once.
---
Hunter and Warlock players are angry that their bugs are not fixed? Well okay, too bad layering still has some work to do to handle the launch. Or some internal formulas has to be changed to match correct dps/dmg numbers. And we don't even know situation with lvl 60 content. For what it is worth Blizzard may be actively working on fixing and polishing max lvl raids and instances.
---
Basically it comes up to everyone's understanding of the development process and situation. All of the bugs that are reported here are either minor class issues or visual differences from original Classic. Saying Classic is doomed because they are not fixed within couple of weeks is as stupid as it may get.
---
No, it won't be obvious. Those of us without teams behind us have been sharing Adderall prescriptions across state lines to make sure we're ready.
---
How do you mean every class is broken to UD lock. As in UD is best or worst
---
Care to explain why a lvl 19 rogue has the advantage?
---
Yeah, having the hunter in melee range sounds like a great idea.  /s
---
Nightfall duty would surely go to an offtank, pally or shaman...
---
Wow Thank for that! I played this a shit down, but never remembered the name! Thank you!
---
Rembeast - Tauren Druid troll on Dreadmaul.
---
ditto, are you going orc for op racial/stun res but ugly stealth walk or undead ?
---
Why isn't World PvP a bigger part of the game? I am guessing Phase 2 will be popular for streamers?
---
Buddy there toolkit was holy light, devotion aura, divine shield and mass Rez.... they were priests in plate
---
How many people have been saying that really? I mean come on, you have to admit you're exaggerating a bit there... There may be a vocal minority but the vast majority of people on this sub know that private servers are far from perfect emulations of vanilla.
---
Except all the new servers Blizzard created during vanilla to accommodate the growing population. The world first race ended 13 years ago.
---
isn't sort of hindered by rested exp
---
Hope they fix that stuff.
---
I saw that they added the old poison proc animation for rogues, so that's really nice. The stealth animation is so iconic so I do hope we get it back, even if it was unintended
---
Oh, my bad, I must have missed the first sentence somehow, I apologize D:
---
Also, you don't need the Eternal Quintessence to summon Majordomo, you just need 7 people with the Aqual Quintessence, which we have down to 3 hours of grinding and summons.
---
Exactly!
---
German players makes up over 1/5 of the current retail EU playerbase and has had their own servers since launch. I'd imagine they can pull off 2k+ players quite easily.
---
Nef was probably a bit pissed about that.
---
\#NotAllLegs
---
Haunted, a night elf rogue on Icecrown. He held on to Rank 14 for months and months and months. It really pissed off other alliance PvPers trying to get rank 14 but you had to respect the mans skill and dedication.
---
saddest and truest statement I've seen all year.../cries inside and outside :( :(
---
&gt; You need look no further than the replies to his comment to find out. The supposedly not offended people do seem rather offended.
---
Lol, you're one special snowflake. You sound pretty offended over a simple meme that even "you know where" finds hilarious.
---
There were no servers created between August 22nd 2006 and December 5th 2006.
---
You might not think World Firsts in Classic relevant, but you'd be in a minority there.
---
On my server, Gurubashi-US, there was a night elf shadow priest who would go around Hillsbrad Foothills SW:D'ing the lowbies leveling there. When I was leveling my undead rogue, I was terrified for a good 2-3 weeks to log on while I was working through that zone.
---
Chilling and taking in new information is not the strong suit of this sub. Half of them still believe that Classic is running off 7.3.5.
---
“Time is money, friend!”
---
I don't know if it will restore confidence in their ability to make new content though. They are essentially in the 'let's recycle all the good stuff from ages ago to make a quicker buck' phase at the moment.
---
That one guy called trimor , elemental shaman , he was the leader of the pvp premade i was part of. This mad man did r14  TWICE !!. On the same character , he dropped down to r11 when the pvp items got upgraded , so he went for 14 again. He was online for like 20 hours a day , never entered any raid , only bg's and open world pvp.  What a guy.
---
Max settings, because why did i even spend 2k on a new computer? \^\^
---
Agree with this right decision at the right time approach.
---
I used to listen to a podcast back in vanilla/tbc? not sure and i don't even remember the name, just the catchphrase they used "L M F A, NOOB with 24 exclamation marks the back of it"
---
if anyone remembers it, please let me know.
---
Well it's not running off 8.1, I can tell you that much.
---
It will not. I use the same thing for consecrate, it will cast whatever you have enough mana for.
---
no he is wrong, the macro will work as you expect
---
&gt; And I really don't think you can compare Minecraft and its optional Texture Packs to WoW and the forced graphical improvements that the developers made to their own game.
---
Okay, then I'll change it. If Mojang decided to change all Minecraft textures to be realistic looking, I can guarantee that most people would be opposed to that.
---
Sometimes, the art style is more important than the quality of the graphics. I'm not saying BFA graphics look bad, in fact the art team is the one team I still highly respect at Blizzard because they've done a really good job... but it's not classic, it's a different game.
---
Meaning T1 etc?  No.
---
The dungeon tier sets do not have a class requirement, the raid ones do.
---
..Just like the experience bar. And the reputation bar! Fuck this game, man. It's all about filling bars and shit. brb going back to Fortnite
---
There were no "speedruns" when the game first came out... just like with any game, as people have to first learn the content before giving it a speedrun.
---
The only true speedruns were on servers released after vanilla launch (such as ones pictured) , or hosted by blizz.
---
You can knitpick all you'd like, and yes, obviously to someone who shaved over 140 hours off that warlock time of 10d+, he wouldn't "exactly call" it a speedrun lmaooo 
---
yeah well comparing me to LeBron I wouldn't exactly call what I do playing basketball, but it still technically is.. see my point? Comparing to one of the best in the world, of course he will say that wasn't something he considers a "speedrun", because he's projecting under 4d played on classic launch 
---
Standards change, you were still wrong about vanilla speeds. He was 100% server first in early 2005 with a 10+ day warlock. Your whole "show me a source" shtick didn't work out cuz you're still here defending your opinion..
---
It's ok man, just say "my bad, you are right about that. Looks like we'll just have to wait til classic launches to see what the deal is!" And we can both move on :)
---
So you're saying it took them one day to fix these bugs? Do you think they've been sitting on these fixes and wanted to release an inferior product until Reddit got on their case?
---
Keep the tinfoil hat on buddy.
---
Generally no, but some sets are generic. They will say explicitly what class they are for if it's restricted.
---
Not the tier sets - they state which class they are for on the tool tip (so no, tankadins cannot roll on the tasty warrior set pieces unfortunately).
---
Isswhatevah meng
---
Eh you can ignore helmets looking silly, the animation isn't something you can really ignore.
---
Getting to level 60 doesn’t get you a raid spot to raid, regardless of what class you are playing. 
---
Getting to level 60 just allows you to start grinding instances to get you the gear to be able to raid. 
---
As you’re getting closer to 60, look on the forums  or in your capitols chat, for a guild who is preparing/looking for people to raid. Get into the guild and run some &lt;60 instances, like BRD or LBRS and get to know them. If you think you like them, stick with them. 
---
You’ll need consistent 5man instance running to get you the pre raid gear and even some UBRS runs. Those guilds who are looking to raid, will need to gear up themselves.
---
Spell damage dealt, *after* any bonus from +SP is applied.
---
Alrready joined my ppl from private servers , 56 ppl signed up, gonna be much fun :)
---
A small fridge, a footstand, a small trash can and a blanket for them late sessions and you are all set. Looking good so far tho. \*thumbs up\*
---
I didn't say the druid wasn't favored, but it isn't frost mage vs warrior levels of favored. You introduced the grenade first btw
---
&gt; But once the Druid has a decent mana pool, it's game over for the Mage.  Grenade + shatter + improved CS will get Druidy boy low but fall short  of a kill. Then he can just Nature's Swiftness and heal to full once the  silence wears off. 
---
I think higher levels of gear favor mage, making the matchup more even, do you agree that as the mage's overall damage outpaces the hp pool of the druid, while the druid gains more mana, it causes the fight to be closer or further apart in balance? I never said druid wasn't favored so let's keep the goal posts where they are, maybe I never fought server best druids but 1v1 unless they played extremely defensively and kited it seemed like a fair fight.
---
ghettomagic from skywall-us is the only name I remember from back then
---
Wonder how many skywall people are even on here; t'was a small server that I only picked because of the cool sounding name
---
Same at 60+ as well... You FAP to try and avoid change, but hunter still just kites you and the mage just ice blocks, then nova+ blinks
---
Thats no bug at all, you are supposed to mine until some footman and Antonidas rushes you, so you have to suicide near him to drain his mana and kill the Waterelementals!!
---
&gt; see my point?
---
No, I really don't, since Blizzard themselves said the average Vanilla time to 60 was 10 days /played.
---
Got ya.
---
Perklunt
---
&gt;3 months after US release and 11 days after EU release might have been impressive then, but it has no bearing on what will be the average in 2019.
---
We weren't talking about 2019 we were talking about vanilla.. no one knows what classic is going to bring... However you saying "this is a fact" about vanilla, when it clearly was NOT, is what I have an issue with.
---
And you continue to back up your own wrong statements you just keep doubling down, you want a source? I link. That's not good enough? I reason with you as to why it surely is and why your logic is flawed. You come back with "that has no bearing on 2019" well, why were you so adamant I was wrong before if it has no bearing?
---
Ppl like you will argue that the sky is red and then when I show you it's blue you'll still tell me I'm wrong.
---
Which 1 r u?
---
Keep in mind at that time there was massive resentment building towards the game, but few would openly admit disliking the direction it was going in.
---
Wellfare epics, current raid tiers being puggable, looking for group, class homogenization, heroic difficulty being non-existant, gear score and achievements being the test of merit, out of control catch up mechanics, five different types of badges, buying tier sets with badges, dailies becoming rampant (argent tournament), rep.grinds becoming streamlined (tabard systen), heirlooms harming the leveling experience, talents becoming out of control, etc etc. 
---
People were becoming really sick of what the game was becoming. Which is why the next expansion featured mass unsubs when they realized blizzard wasn't going to change any of it.
---
They had during the stress-test. I personally experienced the passive stance bug. Warlocks also had their personal bug, when resummoning a demon made it forget all previously learned abilites (and that was extremely painful).
---
A modern opensource alternative to vent is [Mumble](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page) but yea everyone's gonna be using the israeli spyware known as discord unfortunately.
---
I did that in Vanilla, I think it took me like 20 days /played to get to 60. Granted I was new to MMOs.
---
We already went over this, the avg player uses rested xp bruh. 
---
Can't fix stupid.
---
Goodnight tho man, I really can't waste anymore brain cells convincing you of something that isn't even a topic of debate lol
---
You just have it in your head you'll be chillin at 60 in 5 days /played lol
---
U might not make it bruh !
---
Depending on how accurate classic will be you can glitch run zf zombies with duo mage very effectively. Strat ud is also very good.
---
Is the naming filter supposed to censor balls? For real?
---
Pet armor talent has also been fixed in the last couple of days
---
&gt; no one knows what classic is going to bring
---
We know exactly what Classic will bring, it's all known ahead of time.
---
&gt; you saying "this is a fact" about vanilla
---
Blizzard themselves said the average Vanilla time to 60 was 10 days /played.
---
&gt; Ppl like you will argue that the sky is red
---
The sky is often red, dumbass.
---
\&gt;  ended with peace even so it always struck me as odd why there was war in vanilla. 
---
The lore in vanilla is a bit weird in regards to this. On one hand you have the battlegrounds and associated contested zones (ashenvale, arathi and alterac) where it's practically all out war. But on the other hand several NPCs indicate that there is a tenuous peace between the two factions (notably Thrall says this). So lore wise in vanilla I think it is mostly peaceful between the two factions especially given all the other stuff going on in Azeroth but the gameplay doesn't reflect that to spice up the pvp action.
---
IS GLIDING BECAUSE STEPS CAUSE NOISE!!!  that is standard stealth techniques, ninja techniques, assassin 101 look it up.   I don't appreciate changes like these and skeletons that just don't get acknowledged to try and slide them under the radar :(
---
If your guild is wiping on Magmadar, dps isnt the problem and removing a feral won't solve anything.
---
I will be 60 in under 4 days played, and I'm willing to bet a year's subscription on it, with my local credit union manager drawing up a contract and holding both our money in escrow.
---
Shut up or put your money where your mouth is.
---
ain't nobody on fresh rofl
---
It's common to melee weave after multi on mechanics-light fights. Shouldn't even clip auto if you're good about it.
---
You can swap weps, so it's not like you're losing out on stat sticks during ranged rotation.
---
It's a proc, so rounding out the droughts a bit is worth.
---
For clarity, the hunter will not be the sole person with nightfall unless the raid is a really scuffed PuG or something.
---
Hopefully all is well now.
---
I remember people say their may not be a beta. Lolol
---
You just need the obvious frostbolt related talents, and maybe frost channeling for threat/precision for hit, other than that you are able to spec whatever you want and it makes little difference, one mage will usually have winter's chill anyways.
---
no it does not work like private servers. some people have got it to work on the beta but not consistently/reliably i dont think
---
You are blowing so much air out your ass with your dumbass post its not worth seriously replying to, you are all over the place.
---
I mean half way through it you argue it wasnt about 1v1 as if you were arguing Druids and Locks beat you in BGs with you having a healbot spam cleansing/healing you.
---
Your dumbass lol, holy fuck your whole post is just the spergiest shit.
---
Good luck eating dick getting run over in Classic when you realize how much your dogshit ass sucks dick at the game because even playing the 2 button rotations in classic is too complicated for you.
---
Pce, blocked.
---
You got it! :P
---
As much as people joke about it being boring, depending on the person it can be relaxing. Groups want you. You can watch netflix while you raid. If you fuck up just heal yourself. Typically dont have to stress mechanics. Stand here stand there keep people alive and collect loot. I have enjoyed healing classes since vanilla.
---
I will be playing a lock and priest this time around and only druid if my friends twist my arm.
---
&gt; min maxing your rotation without much freedom
---
Sometimes that's spamming 1 button lol
---
Horde because alliance gives you the choice of elf or human, fat short human, and even shorter skinny person.  Not much fantasy there
---
Yes, it forced you to get critically hit, but Blizzard said that shouldn't trigger any abilities or talents that depend on being critically hit.
---
Dark Paradigm, now that takes me back! Who were you?
---
While this is probably not the best thing to do, I’ll probably be spending it on my professions as a Warlock. I enjoy leveling them and having extra money to get those annoying couple levels are nice
---
I know bear tanks aren’t popular, because they’re 2nd place to warriors in a lot of ways, but I think they sound fun. I kinda wanna give one of them a shot.
---
I love bear tanks. They don't roll on weapons I want and items like Hand of Justice.
---
I'm glad my memories were proved correct where you could demoshout the mobs and they'd run away in fear. Private servers never scripted the fights properly but Classic is working just fine &lt;3
---
BUT THEY'LL NEVER REMOVE IT THEY'RE ONLY IN THIS FOR THE MONEY ALSO THEY'RE FUCKING USELESS LOOK AT THE HUNTER BUGS THEY ONLY FIXED MOST OF THEM FUCKING ACTIVISION RUINING A 15 YEAR OLD GAME.
---
As you were.
---
They added the despawn time on skeletons due to gold farmers leaving messages in corpses in major cities, which GMs would have to tidy up.
---
Retail player.
---
Nice! I wish I was that far already :D Gotta get started with it... I swear I will!! Really! Soon™!
---
How cheap do you have to be to not activate Windows? Damn.
---
Oh my God I forgot how complete garbage original T1 was. Fire damage? Unbelievable.
---
I hope you guys have fun trying this. Thing is...you are already 2 men short, and that is 40% less DPS. You have no CC whatsoever, except short duration stuns, which, to be honest are not actually CC.
---
The use of consumables of your Bear and Cat will be minimal, and quite trickier to do. There will be A LOT of OOM moments and drinking after every pull.
---
I see you guys doing one dungeon/day. It will be a very slow leveling process, but the upside is that you will have massive fun:)
---
As for world WPvP, you guys will have a blast :)
---
3 Druids in WPvP are damn flexible...and deadly:D
---
That would be ideal in my opinion. I don't want to see more players than mobs instant tagging anything that moves, but I expect to be able to group up with people for the more demanding quests and don't want to play a single player game.
---
TBC was a fun time to be a prot paladin. Most groups were wary to have a paladin tank at first, they were very skeptical that paladins could even tank. They always changed their minds quickly when I would pull big packs, do a ton of aoe damage and threat, and not die. Then they were spoiled by me haha
---
Also, IF was closer to a lot of endgame dungeons and raiding.
---
There's absolutely no reason for her to level resto. She can heal you just fine without it, including dungeons.
---
I don't know if you're joking or being serious, but people don't just break NDA's while bowling like it's talking about the grill you had last week...
---
&gt;Yeah it does because I like to have fun and not be so serious about a kids game
---
Kids game? I believe an average classic player is 15 years older than Fortnite player. My entire guild on classic was 25+
---
Full floor carpets are still weird concept to me, isn't that kinda unsanitary :/
---
Complete nonsense. You don't "leech the raid", because it takes a few more seconds to down a boss. I have no idea where people get the idea, that it's a big deal, if the raid loses 1-2% total dps, because they took a ret along. Especially as you also get an additional blessing, easier access to judgement of light and wisdom and a person who can heal in a pinch.
---
Plus, you have an easier time gearing the raid, as rets can use several items, which are of no use to other classes.
---
I also like how people constantly assume, everybody who plays DPS plays their class perfectly. I've seen many parses from private servers with ret paladins and it was very rare that the ret was last in dps, he often was ahead of several pure dps palyers, who simply didn't manage to reach the full potential of their spec.
---
thank you :)
---
but then they just layered away.
---
Played alliance mostly since 05.
---
I prefer the alliance zones, cities, and music associated with both. 
---
However, I will be rolling horde this time around. 
---
Imagine not being allowed into your favorite cities and zones! How much would that suck.. 
---
Now imagine successively pvp raiding into those zones and cities you grew up with. It’s like a candy on a stick dangling from me. I am so excited to be horde and roll out to my favorite alliance zones to claim it as my own! Or at the very least cause a disturbance. 
---
I remember playing alliance as a kid and being struck in awe when I would see horde ganking on top of the red ridge inn roof. 
---
I remember an orc rogue would stealth in the human starting zone. He had this engineer item.. it was an explosive sheep that would follow the stealthed rogue around.. low level human noobs would attack the sheep, the sheep would blow up, kill the human, and then they would be flagged for pvp! I want to do that! How much fun would these activities be!? I can’t wait lol
---
Also, horde have better racials &amp; the races look way better as well!
---
I had fewer images of Dun Morogh than I thought, so I included some images of my IF rework as well (even though it's pretty ugly).
---
[https://imgur.com/a/ACyEyLk](https://imgur.com/a/ACyEyLk)
---
I buy and trade.
---
This was so long ago I can't hardly remember anybody's names, but two stand out not for amazing epic awesome stuff like raid gear but just... because it's the kind of shit my brain likes to remember.
---
Frostmane.
---
Dlido - I just remember his name, and eventually a name change.
---
Lard - Famous for sitting on mailboxes in XR and Ratchet in bear form.
---
I lost my windows key when I moved and it’s $118 is kinda expensive for me. Sorry.
---
No, not really. SW is closer to MC, BWL, ZG, and most of the world bosses. The travel difference between IF/SW to Onyxia, AQ, Naxx, and the rest of the world bosses is negligible, especially considering Hearthstones.
---
I think the trick on the beta was to /sit to get critically hit - but at the same time you get critted - you stand up again (is it /stand?!?!) so the System thinks you have been critically struck while you were Standing.
---
Otherwise it will not activate any blood craze or enrage
---
50 arcanite bars!? That's insane! I can't wait to play this insane game again.
---
No it doesn’t lol, the blood elves in Warcraft 3 are the ones who went to outland with illidan, but yeah, they had an ass human general.
---
Confirming, optimal (as much as I love arms) specs would be fury enhance. The healing without speccing the shaman for it is still fine. Just maintain a healing set with plenty of int. The same can be said for tanking as arms or fury.
---
Digital Licenses? And even if you don't have one, which you should if you ever had a legitimate copy, you can find Windows 10 keys for ~$15 USD.
---
Who's the photo?
---
I agree
---
came here to say this
---
&gt; dude if you can't stand waiting in queue just push the release date back a week for yourself. why does it matter so much that you get to play release when it won't be an epic event with 10,000 people in the same zone? you can only play weekends so you're not looking to hit cap in 4 days so wtf man?
---
If layering is such an issue for you, why don't you wait until its removed so you can keep your precious classic experience.
---
No, Arms + Enhancement would be best. Fury isn't all that great for leveling.
---
The items were separate. You’re thinking of Benediction which turned into Anathema.
---
In case you two are not too set on classes, you could consider watching Kargoz's video on duo leveling. I know one thing to consider is if the duo has traveling speed boosts. A warrior does not, so if a shaman has ghost wolf, they won't get to take advantage of it much while waiting on a warrior who's tromping behind. This doesn't mean don't do that combo; it is, however, the kind of thing to consider that Kargoz goes over in his duo-leveling video.

My favourite
---
You don't get that much xp from killing trash in dungeons anyways, so skipping it and instead do some quests after you finished with the dungeon sooner is probably better xp. But yeah, they are not even trying to min/max, so who cares.
---
True. How much gold would you personally use on weapons before 60? 30, 40g? Or is that too much?
---
Except when it is.
---
Who wore plate when healing?
---
North America didn't get Latin American servers until mid/late TBC. Before that many servers had huge spanish-speaking populations. Most of my non-IRL friends didn't speak much if any English. Community was fine.
---
I get it, wanting a unified language on one's server so you can communicate effectively with everybody, but all this blowup over server language is way, way out of proportion.
---
Additionally having played on a private server where many different languages are present in chat, this seriously wasn't an issue. You're comically overblowing this.
---
Bat pelts, ain't no bears in Tirisfal. And ye I love that quest for the same reason :)

I bought windows a wiggle back but I lost the hard copy and when I reformatted my hard drive I lost it, I was planning on buying one from amazon but it says $118. If you know any store that sell them for 15 usd, can you link it to me?

I liked the choice EQ gave, myself.

Thank you I was shaking

Robes of the guardian saint. Best paladin dress.
---
What is "average" speed? 
---
In TBC, the leveling was about 40% faster, compared to Vanilla. Most non-elites and all elites were nerfed. The XP required / levele was nerfed.
---
If you plan to also skill up professions while leveling, there will be lots of travel to a main city (for a crafting professions) and a lot of secondary traveling outdoors for resources. If you plan to do some dungeons now and than, it will also add to the leveling.
---
If you want to do the above, you are looking at roughly 400 hrs between 1 and 60. If you remove dungeons, or keep to a minimum, you are looking at 320 hrs. If you remove crafting professions (which you should NOT) you are looking at 260 hrs. If you remove all professions and dungeons and focus on leveling...but average leveling, not spreed leveling, you look at about 200-240 hrs, depending on class and realm type (PvP, PvE).
---
So...what is average? Does it include professions? Or just "lazy" leveling?
---
Half of these are still in game.
---
\[H\] \[NA-PVP\] Tues, Thurs (possibly weekend) raid times around 7-8 CST/EST preferred. Plan on playing Mage/Rogue.
---
I haven't raided since vanilla but would like to again. I'm in my 30's now and can't play 12 hours a day. I plan to level somewhat casually through this great game with a guild and friends, and endgame goals of raiding. Looking for a fun guild and people to share the experience of this game with, who want to focus on end game content with a non-hardcore approach so it doesn't seem like a second job. Thanks!
---
Dude it's not like they have only bugs to worry about, let alone hunter bugs. They probably have what seems like an endless list of things they need to fix, and sometimes their order does not line up with reddit shitstorms.

Warriors are literally the best dps class in the game.
---
Here's the world record speedrun of BWL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZcLo5uXK-I
---
While 22 warriors is a bit extreme and speedrunning is not the same as progressing, top guilds still tend to bring at least 10 warriors to progress raids.
---
So an elem shaman can fully heal dungeons until late game?

Vanish and Charge also still show the Legion animations instead of the Classic ones. Hope they will get fixed until launch.
---
The perfect answer to this question, kudos
---
Esfand tested this pretty early on in the beta and found he could stand up just as he's getting hit and the server will treat his character as both sitting and standing at the same time, triggering his reckoning. It's not going to be worth doing for grinding purposes as the timing has to be just right so failure rate is high.
---
Damn it, you're not suppose to tell them about it!
---
Definitely “kings honor friend” or “enjoying your stay in stormwind?”
---
I started in TBC and I loved Paladin healing so much that I leveled as holy, and it was glorious.  There aren't a lot of buttons to press *when things are going well*, but your job as healer is to fix just about every problem that occurs (especially in dungeons).  Tank is about to die and you're almost OOM?  Lay on Hands saves the day.  One DPS pulls aggro and is getting chunked?  Drop a Blessing of Protection to save his life.  Is a wipe (and the accompanying minutes-long ghost run) looking inevitable?  Divine Intervention a druid/pally/priest to get the team back in the fight quickly.
---
And more generally, you have the moment-to-moment task of triaging who needs healing the most, which isn't necessarily a simple task.  If you know exactly where your teammates are and what the enemies are doing, you'll be much better at estimating how much healing is needed.  If the player took a momentary hit of unavoidable damage, there's no pressing need to heal them.  But if one has pulled aggro and is taking constant damage, you'll need to make them your priority.
---
And during all of that, you need to consider mana management.  Depending on how the fight is progressing, you can be more or less liberal with your output.
---
All together, it's by far my favorite thing to do in WoW because unlike a DPS rotation (even the overly-complicated rotations of Modern WoW) what you should be doing is always changing based on the situation around you.  Get good at it and make some day-saving plays, and it's the most satisfying thing you can do.
---
Love that they upgraded the rewards for that after Vanilla, that blue axe was sick
---
I can't speak to PvE healing, since I'm awful at it but PvP healing is awesome in classic.  I ran a prot/holy pally for a while and had a ball in BGs.
---
First character was an IRC. Plus old horde is much better than what it is at the moment.
---
I meant when items they want dont drop
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
TBH I'm going to miss it, all of my friends want to roll Alliance despite horde having better PVP racials. But they're all nostalgic for Alliance and I'm the only one who played Horde. :(
---
That's all a matter of perspective and size, that giant blunt log may feel like a twig to the Tauren, and given the muscle looks like corrugated iron there's a real chance it would slow down the blade on the way in and if the Tauren shifted his weigh pull the blade out of the humans hands, the Tauren would still get messed up by having a blade in his stomach but that log is already high enough to break almost every limb in that soldiers body from gravity alone.

Neither a chain nor a quest at all, but epic nonetheless

Gnome size isn't client side though
---
It's not like, you have nothing to do. Judge every 8 sec, Consecration every 8 sec, in Naxx exorcism every 15 sec. Once the boss is low, you can use hammer of wrath. Pots, trinkets, other consumables. There are quite a few buttons to press.
---
Lmao I miss role specific raid channels. Felt like a community within a community.
---
Or.... I know this is a crazy suggestion, they could send out more beta invites to regular joes instead of Streamer bois.
---
But to many people being able to layer away from that is not really sad.
---
You can easily make 5,000g per hour just vendoring high-level fish.
---
3*24 = 72 hours = 360,000 gold.

That's enough for 2 WoW Tokens.

I remember a LOT of people back then told me it was hard as fuck, apparently everyone clicked the item from bag instead of dragging it to a keybind

I am planning on doing this aswell
---
The only problem I have with a faction switch is that I don't recognize most lore characters. 
---
I remember leveling my orc and coming across Naz'grel, Rokhan or Rokaro was such a great feeling
---
I won't have that when I play Alliance
---
&gt; It'll be pretty obvious. Doesn't matter if you're on the same machine, still against TOU.

Out of curiosity, how will it be obvious that different people are sitting in the chair at different times?

Patch 1.12 : language dedicated server in EU

Patch 1.13 classic wow : no language dedicated server
---
I'll be rolling a Nelf Druid purely for nostalgia's sake.  Was my first ever character in vanilla.  
---
Then I'll be playing Horde (likely Tauren) for the rest of Classic because I enjoy them so much more for every other reason.
---
Why not? Didn't it work like that in Vanilla?
---
Unless you extreme player ... by the time you will be 10 there will be thousands of lvl 30s, by the time you lvl 30 game will be filled with lvl 60s. By the time you 60 all raids will already be downed, people leaving the game calling it a bore.  
---
Good luck xD
---
#Check out that noise!
---
Never.
---
All we know is that there will be at least one in July and it will include EU subscribers.
---
Yeah, all depended on how you played. For me personally I look forward to shamans being a true support class again. That's how I played ele back then, goal wasn't to be a top tier damage dealer, but to do some damage, heal a bit where necessary and generally just support the group. That's honestly what I miss most about the classic time, it was less about defined roles. Nobody (outside raid content) really cared too much about damage numbers and the like, as long as you contributed in some way, shape or form. Not sure if the classic servers will be a return to that, I feel that ship has sailed, with the new "be as efficient as possible at all times" mindset being pretty ingrained. But maybe I'm too pessimistic.
---
Call of Water.
---
There are other reasons for that too although im sure it didnt help.
---
1. people deciding to wait till release
---
2. at level cap and not interested in pvp
---
3. retail players getting ready for 8.2 (two weeks to prep for new raid)
---
4. hype fell off a cliff after a couple of weeks
---
5. people deciding that they just don't like it (heresy I know, but it happens)
---
None of this means anything for launch though. It will still be enormous and the player base will be literally millions bigger.
---
There's multiple teams working on unannounced projects that probably require lots of money. Next blizzcon has to be big
---
Aren't they supposed to stay until weekly server resets? Or is that for unrevived player corpses?
---
Paying multiple subscriptions is what allows it. But you guys go enjoy your pvp servers 😶
---
I bought it, thanks a lot.
---
And a good tank is usually expected, rather than recognized for their knowledge or skill.
---
Me and a friend of mine did something similar in WOTLK. He queued as healer but was ele-shamy and i queued as tank but played moonkin. So we basically had 5dps players. We both were pretty good equiped so we speedrun pretty much every dungeon! It was soo incredible fun - from joining the instance to confused "???" when i wouldn´t switch into bear and my "heal" spammed chainlightning and some oder dps stuff! Loved WOTLK for this experience!
---
If some guy says he’ll give you $15 a month or $75 a month, what option would you take?
---
The same AI runs hunter and warlock pets.
---
I only played the stress test and warlock pets there seemed to have the same issues.
---
If you played warrior during later expansions (TBC, WOTLK, etc), vanilla warrior will feel even slower in terms of gameplay: mobility is terrible in comparison (30 sec intercept, no heroic leap, no intervene).
---
Other than that, yea you are a piece of crap until geared :-(
---
But in the end, I will still be playing warrior: a nice 2H and a healbot, and you become a killing machine.
---
I was stating the base cost. Reputation is another story. Besides, come classic, dungeon running with a premade 5 man team may be the fastest way to level 60, depending on layer sizes. You get no reputation, well almost none, from doing that.
---
Elem or Enhance can, yes. I understand TBC and Classic are different, but for what it's worth I recently leveled a shaman on a TBC Blizz like pserver and have healed dungeons the whole way until Outlands as enhancement with a healing set I kept. Had zero issues doing so. (although they do get tougher the closer to 60 you get - would frequently go oom after moderately difficult trash pulls).
---
Wrath is the greatest time to play WoW for those who started there. For many people, who played in vanilla, Wrath was the beginning of the end for WoW.
---
While it does have great aspects, namely the excellent class design and two stunning raids with ICC and Ulduar, it also has severe problems.
---
* Simplification of content, levelling was much easier than in vanilla and tbc, group quests mostly disappeared
---
* incredibly easy dungeons. Doing heroics in tbc was very hard, in wrath I never even ran a non levelling dungeon on normal, because the heroics were so easy.
---
* Every raid available as 10 man and 25 man. Diminishes the raids, especially as the 10 man version was usually easier. As you could do both versions every week, you burned out faster. The previous design was far superior, as the raids were designed for those numbers, in wrath a 25 man raid doesn't feel as epic, when you can do the same instance with 10 and the rooms are usually far too big for 10 man.
---
* heroic difficulty for raids, start of the entire raid difficulty shenanigans enabling everybody to do everything
---
* LFD tool
---
* terrible raids: Naxxramas was a shadow of its former self and that really annoyed people who played it in vanilla. And you ran that twice a week for nearly half a year, severe burnout. ToC is the worst raid Blizz ever made.
---
If Blizz were to continue releasing old versions of WoW, I'd accept TBC unchanged, but Wrath would need some changes to keep my interest.
---
Stay away from the voodoo.
---
For the Coke! The one true pop!
---
They are, but the difference seems to be bigger at low levels.
---
No shit. You Scandinavians have been way ahead of the times when it comes to gaming culture. Basshunter and the DotA song blew my mind as a kid. He and everyone in his video seemed so cool and they were singing about one of the nerdiest games on the planet!
---
In the US, gaming is just now becoming accepted. Everyone knew what WoW was, but few people would admit to actively playing it. People would say "oh I know about wow" or "oh, yeah I tried it/played it a little bit before" but very few would actually come out and say they play it (unless they were talking to other gamers)
---
Knowledge
---
Lack of incentives. It's very poor honor farming.
---
Where my Us hyjal players boissss?
---

&gt; If you combine that with WoW player's ability to complain

it's the same with any game's player base. They typical league of legends front page looks like this.

---

---
I was hoping for it on my paladin, but I guess it's not going to be as good as theres no reck-bombs now 🤔
---
Except the base cost is not 110g, it's 100g, 10g for the training and 90g for the mount.
---
Why wouldn't they allow it?
---
Thanks for the suggestion, the video did bring up some interesting points.
---
His comparison to wow being free til 20 is super accurate though. You can barely do shit in osrs without getting membership. It's still fun, but so is levelling up to 20 in wow. It gets really old really quickly though
---
The same can be said about dps and tanking...
---
In recent years betas have kind of lost their initial meaning tbf. That's the fault of both studios and general public I might add.
---
The best hunter who runs WSG that I’ve come across is Milkthis who is a Tauren. His use of the stomp is on point.
---
&gt; Does it come with option to switch between vanilla models and upgraded models?
---
Nope. You get the original WoW models in all their "glory". Though there's an ongoing effort to enable injecting the new models into the game, though it may be against the EULA and get you banned.
---
What is the issue with owning multiple accounts that you only play yourself?
---
The base cost is 100g. 90g if your honored and 80g if you have the PVP rank (not available before phase 2).
---
Archage had that.  Game had a lot of flaws, but the player interaction and world PvP were so much fun.  Probably the most fun I've ever had in an MMO.  For a while at least, until they completely ruined the economy by adding loot boxes with a chance to have the center piece item in them.
---
I think that elem might be easier, since you don’t have to keep a second int sent for dungeons, and melee+range might be more versatile.
---
Have to agree with UbiGeofram. These first might be 'meaningless', but people will care about them. (And then stop caring about them the second they're through.)
---
When you say legitimate, you meant grey. It's not uncommon for those keys to become invalid over time. But, it works for now I suppose.
---
Legend! Thanks! :) bookmarking this baby now!
---
Pure pwnage is indeed a classic
---
I did. Difference is noticeable but as I did quite a lot of PvP back in the day I never bothered with two sets. 
---
D1 provides no +heal but decent amounts of int. Add a few rings, trinkets and necks that help you there and you're viable but not optimal. Basically you'll have mana issues as you have to downrank less. It can be countered with runes and potions. 
---
While the mostly cloth pre raid BIS is doable poaching clothing items in raids will be almost impossible as those will be upgrades for priests/mages/wl and druids as well. Sure if you raid MC for two years in a row you'll pick up anything you want. But expect the first nice clothing pieces go to the classes that can only use those.
---
a) no guarantee layering ever gets removed.
---
b) layering doesn't guarantee no queue times.
---
c) because it'll make no difference? a dead zone is a dead zone. once everyone is through westfall after the assumed 2 months westfall, loch modan etc will be dead zones. like if i play with layering.
---
d)the long lasting effects of layering will be there, inflated AH, economy etc that would effect my run through were i to do it after layering as i can't double tap the node everyone else could. making my proffessions worth far less until months after layering maybe longer.
---
e) i miss the experience i actually want out of a release, massively over inflated populations per zone, i want the clusterfuck and camaraderie that comes with it. something that won't be replicated until aq if at all. and won't happen with layering. 
---
f) classic was "sold" as no changes, "warts and all". 
---
so what are your reasons?
---
so twice as many buttons as your second druid gets to use
---
Mage is spending 30 minutes before a raid making water. Your top dps is spamming a single spell over and over in most fights.
---
Rogue worst part is when you’re about to get slice n dice off but the mob dies.
---
Qol stuff mages not having table and rogues having reagents for vanish and blind, also having to craft your own poison but some people like that for class fantasy.
---
I lost 3 girls aswell because of wow, not that i imagined spending the rest of my life with them, but still. As you grow older you realize everything happens for a reason and i can not blame me for playing so much games (including wow) i had fun and i still have fun. Alot of people go through theyr whole life not enjoying anything they do and chase the next thing. You should cherish this! And ofc dont let yourself go completely and give up on everything else in life, but yea enjoy and play if you want to. Its your life man :)

Hearthstone was good, but they used an extremely well established IP and theme and then took mechanics from a metric assload of TCGs.

**Guild Name:** Tempest  
---
**Server Type:** PvP  
---
**Region:** NA - East  
---
**Faction:** Alliance
---
**About us:**Tempest is a guild dedicated to high raiding efficiency and strong game knowledge with proactive community members. Our mission is to complete all available content and compete in the top echelon of the server. To ensure our success, and fulfill the guild vision, many individual aspects will be sacrificed for the overall benefit of the guild. Coordination centered on concepts such as: reputation, recipes, gear, and world events require necessary amounts of teamwork at the potential cost of individual gain. While raid times will not be moved for server firsts, it is the leadership’s expectation that all content (with the exception of MC), be cleared the first day/week of release. Furthermore, raid members will be expected to min/max to the best of their abilities to properly contribute to raids. Members that demonstrate they are not able to play their characters to the highest potential will see limited gear acquisition and raid invitations. The leadership recognizes that the above described environment is not for everyone and may be different from guilds you’ve previously raided with.
---
Our current members are private vanilla raiders with experience in all available content of raiding, pvp, world bosses, and farming. Over the years we have learned to prioritize collaboration, professionalism, dedication, and competitiveness.
---
**Raid Schedule:**9 PM – 12 AM EST (6 – 9 PM PST) Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
---
**Loot:** Loot council decision.
---
**Attendance:** All aspiring raiders will be expected to attend at least 90% of the raids.
---
**Initial plans:** 3rd week MC clear. We will not be moving raid times for server firsts, but all newly released content will be cleared the day/week of release.
---
**Basic Requirements:** All professions, buffs, consumables, and gearing is expected to be min/maxed to provide top tier raiding performance.
---
***Potential applicants should have a hardcore mindset and experience min/maxing in some WoW expansion, with detailed classic knowledge preferred. If you are interested in being a part of this guild, regardless of your background and experience with the current leadership, you are expected to fill out the following application:*** [***https://forms.gle/11UVtbgguU8AExWYA***](https://forms.gle/11UVtbgguU8AExWYA)
---
***The guild discord can be found at:*** [***https://discord.gg/haBrQ7U***](https://discord.gg/haBrQ7U)
---
Because it's the equivalent of giving an advantage to someone for being rich. Your 5-mage team will be far more efficient at farming than playing one character. It will also help you out the next time someone tries to kill you.   
---
People like to believe that, at least in fantasy worlds, you shouldn't be able to buy significant advantages over others. And those are advantages you enjoy because you have +$900 a year to spend on a video game.
---
Why 35 alt? Can a lvl 5 not get max crafts?
---
To be fair that argument is not really valid, both factions have the same 12 year olds who wants to be this and that..

They were united against common enemy, really. After killing undead scourge there was no "enemy of my enemy is my friend" attitude. Especially if you look at SC lore for example - they were united against same enemy as well, but after victory some of the leaders took off with their armies to contest some planets for monetary or power gain.  
---
If you look at how W3TFT orcs (rexxar) campaing turned out he had to kill Captain Proudmore because old habits die hard, Jaina was pissed about it but she understood it was necessary evil - her father was still living in the past, others probably didn't understood that.  
---
You can imagine conflict going on once again because somoene started cutting trees on your land or mining ore, or some terrains (like WSG) were basically no-mans land ready to be taken.
---
Sorry mate, tried to look through but didn't see any posts of a similar vein, must have been deleted like mine.
---
I disagree. 
---
Faction imbalance in servers and the drop of wPvP are both an aftermath of hardcoding factions. Most successful PvP MMOs either have no factions or at least three of them so that alliances can mitigate numbers imbalance. 
---
That's why we've never had anything other than instanced PvP for almost 15 years of WoW despite efforts. Even retail's War Mode failed.
---
Thanks alot!

Spot the duds.
---
Negative. The beta servers are up right now. If you can't login right now, you don't have beta access.
---
No but it's about on par for Reddit. Here Austism is normal.
---
No u
---
2h fury is really strong for leveling solo. But with heal the warrior can go arms and use sweepibg strikes as well
---
Keep in mind "private servers" existed even when vanilla was the only version of WoW.  Give it a few months and they'll pop up running the new 1.13 version of the game.  
---
There will always be an audience for that shit.
---
"You no take candle!"
---
These private servers use insane dynamic respawn rates to account for the population, it's not worth looking at the level times on them and compare them to Blizzard servers imo.
---
AFAIK (might be wrong here) that was pretty common to still raid villages near the border of the countries even if peace treaty was signed.  
---
Ofc never officially, always "Outlaws did that".
---
You would like EverQuest. 
---
When you're facing the possibility of a 30-minute corpse recovery, and the possibility of losing 2-hours worth of experience from a single death... when you're surrounded by creatures that you could only defeat with the help of 5 other people... that's when you know true terror in a video game.

World of Warcraft Classic is not the same as Beta: World of Warcraft Classic in your launcher ;)
---
Like I said before, take census data with a grain of salt.
---
Especially one that is a beta with a 30/40 level cap. The meta is entirely different, people make different choices. Get some wrinkles in your brain.
---
what is it running off?
---
I mean, wow betas haven't, they've always been actual betas, atleast as far as the ones I took part in.
---
&gt; wow is a complete game just by playing alone
---
Definitely no.
---
Somewhat yes, except when you do dps or tank - you act preemptively or (in case of dps) you just act. With healing you act reactively, and depending on what's happening it can be a snorefest. 
---
But vanilla wasn't that engaging mechanically anyways.
---
For the same money you can buy a lot of gold and not have to farm. Multiboxing affects others very little and you dont even encounter it as often as those threads make it sound. Let people have fun.
---
why post this on classic forum if its WOLTK era ?
---
Except for sap, kick, blind, a million stuns, armor reduction, healing reduction
---
They were separate after 1.8. Before that, it worked like bendiction/anathema
---
Vanilla wow wiki disagrees with you. The base cost is 100g, you can get up to 20% discount, 10 from honored with faction, and 10 from rank 3 pvp.
---
If it's only on your end, I don't really know, I remember changing my Troll's model for the Undead one and never got ban for that. But that might have been less intrusive than what you are talking about
---
"there is nothing to do but" and the guy lists the rest of the game. Don't listen to that boring sack of dried fun
---
So someone who works hard to make a good living. Can't spend that money to play WoW? Don't hate on people with disposable income that want to use to play WoW!
---
problem is while they are all bugs that need fixing they are not game breaking so they will fall to the bottom of the pile while there are still bugs with classes that actually effect the way they work rather than the way they look.
---
Apes or method?
---
Like I said before, take census data with a grain of salt. You're being incredibly short-sighted if you think that will be an accurate representation of classic.
---
Especially one that is a beta with a 30/40 level cap. The meta is entirely different, people make different choices. Get some wrinkles in your brain. Whats good at 60 isn't necessarily whats great at 30/40.
---

---
Shamans absolutely won't be that popular on release.
---
the usual leveling strat with warri+ heal is that the healer mainly auto-attacks (wand/ cat in case if priest/druid). 
---
That way you dont need breaks since all mana goes into healing. But because most of the time you wont be fighting to many mobs at once a dedicated healing spec is not needed.
---
Elemental might deal more damage, but you need to spend mana in order to do so. Which means more breaks.
---
Ultimately it is up to you. As long as you plas warri+ heal pretty much all doors are open to you, anyway.
---
Money, if he has 5 characters, he is paying 5 accounts. :)
---
The most PvP centric MMO I've played is Eve Online and I fought a fraction the number of fights in that I fought in wow with it's 2 faction design.
---
Nice OC
---
You are honoured by the time you have to run your first dungeon in most cases. And spamming dungeons is definitely a subpar way to level.
---
Still busy with these lanterns in Westfall I suppose.
---
Because it's going to take at least 5+ days on Classic WoW launch to hit 60 even on the lowest population server. All these 4 day speedruns on private servers are done when it's completely dead. A person needs to take an AFK break at some point. You can't just sit playing 24/7 for a week straight. World first races are monitored by Blizzard and you'll be on their radar when your guild is the first to enter Molten Core.
---
It took some time to figure it out. In the end I downloaded the Server-Software for privat servers and tested some classes offline. Result: Druid (like in classic) and a Warlock as a farming alt.
---
The main issue would be that you are using a software that effectively gives you an advantage in game even if somewhat not intrusive to it. I think it was ruled against EULA in cataclysm though
---
Without rep. riding costs 10g and the mount costs 90g.
---
With rep, riding costs 9g and the mount costs 81g.
---
With rep + rank 3, riding costs 8g and the mount costs 72g.
---
Keyboard turning... eeew
---
Minimum level 35 to craft highest level, but a low level enchanting can disenchant any level item.
---
First couple of weeks all bets are off, it will be a madhouse. After that Asmongold has pretty much cornered the market on casual wow content (not really my thing but I respect the hustle) with spikes for "world first" kills for high level guilds. Its pretty much how retail goes tbh (without the high level m+ and arena). Most of the biggest streamers are really good at entertainment value. The crowd that watches for high level play is generally much smaller although sometimes they intersect.
---
It's great alone. You must've missed something. You don't need a premade team. Finding groups is possible without being in a team
---
Hunters were hardly perfect in vanilla. This subreddit always finds something to complain about even when progress is being made, actually kind of impressive.
---
I remember when they announced that races would be divided in to horde/alliance, people were pissed on the wow forums. This was before even the closed beta was released.
---
I think that it will be pretty big at least for the first MC kill. Most people have not seen it in a really long time (or ever). I'm not sure after that. Part of the problem is that the raids are likely going to be cleared very very quickly, there wont be much time to build suspense if everyone gets home from work and it is already over.
---
I could imagine, that there are just not enough people online currently to have a second layer. That last census showed what, 700 people online for BOTH factions? Why would layering even kick in at those numbers to begin with.
---
I would try n balance classes but not balance as in make everyone equal. I am thinking about making the classes respectfully reflect their fabtasy/mechanics. Aka druids and paladins are obviously hybrids that can tank heal and dps but instead of being a third good at each they absolutely suck ass compared to a pure dps. Sure a mage should pull say 5k dps but that doesn't mean a druid should only be able to pull 2k. Buffs to make unviable specs more viable but never come close to surpassing a pure dps. That way guild leaders can look at a druid and a mage and think "Yes the mage will deal more damage but the utility of a druid.." instead of "Looool we don't need healers pff fuck off, mage it is ez pick". It doesn't feel right having a class that sucks both pvp and pve unless they only go healer despite the fact they were made being hybrid in mind. Y kno? There's so many specs that would be cool to play but they suck major ass nugget to be considered a legit build.
---
Just give up dude, you're retarded.
---
If I weren’t proving a point I’d never debase myself with disgusting keyboard turning, rest assured. It’s almost as filthy a habit as skill clicking. Almost.
---
If you play on a server completely devoid of other people, you will not be able to experience any end-game content and will only be able to experience dungeons you severely out-level. At least not without cheating.
---
Neither.
---
I prefer ORC cities! Don;t like big castles to run lf npc.
---
Being a part of the groups that decide rank 14 - and then one week going rogue and grinding over my preset limit.. 
---
Hit GM and get blacklisted by the PvP community but still.. do it for the story.
---
Those classes don't have enough of their abilities yet. No consecration, no ice block, and very poor scaling. A rogue stacking hp and agility will out last a mages Mana and have insane crit, attack power, and Dodge that a paladin can't deal with.
---
Slowest class is definitely the deprived /s
---
Salvation is reduced threat, not increased damage. So when you run the numbers it's actually closer to +43% more dmg with salvation.
---
Lets say you pull aggro at 100 threat points and X is your total damage:
---
X \* 0.7 = 100
---
X = 143
---
If your alliance kock your fine because you have the pally buff to reduce your threat.
---
I kind of agree with the UD cannibalise but Orc is the best.
---
Then again if there's only 3 players the exp split is much more reduced, not to mention dungeon mobs give more exp per kill so depending on their clearing speed, it might be a worthwhile grind. Even streamers like Venruki went with 3 mages to farm Scarlet Monastery in the beta because it was actually more efficient than leveling up via normal means.
---
!remind me 3 months
---
&gt;because it starts to become something that isn't fun to watch at all.
---
Where on the other hand watching them grind is just so much fun.
---
The only instance of Pserver speed I referenced was Joker's run on silverhand currently going down, and I don't disagree with you about Pserver figures.
---
Joanas runs were all on legit vanilla servers or on blizz hosted vanilla servers 
---
If anything, classic figures will also be inaccurate in comparison to legit vanilla (proven already by many videos of beta classic vs retail vanilla ) 
---
This stuff is easy to do in theory but more complicated when it comes down to each tiny  intricacy the game has to offer. there's a reason the classic team consulted many of the top private servers on how they did it, not to say private servers don't *always* have issues : they do, but to think classic won't also have similar issues is silly.
---
Now, about the respawns in particular, there will not be dynamic respawns and there will be layering instead.
---
Tbh, if layering does what everyone is afraid it will do it will make mage aoe farming even more troublesome (in terms of being able to compete with it as any other method of speed running)
---
If you're able to layer into a dead layer and from murlocs for hours uncontested by any Alli/horde , well mages might clean up even without the Dynamic respawn timers. 
---
Also, once you hit 46 and get the Mara scpeter as a mage, it GG. 
---
46-60 is kind of a joke on mage compared to other classes, you're farming relatively safe the whole time.
---
Will be interesting to see what actually happens on classic launch, whether a mage aoe farm will break the 4 day mark or a warlock (unlikely without pre 40 movement speed ability) / hunter just questing . Maybe a surprise drood
---
If someone playing 10-characters joins an AB, they're ruining the match for 20 people. Is it okay to ruin the match for 20 people "because you work hard and make a good living?" That being the case, Blizzard should sell cheats and special powers, so rich people can enjoy even more advantages.
---
Bind all of your spells and hide your action bars. It will be painful for a minute and you will die. If you do it leveling though you will grow into it slowly and by 60 you will never need them again. Bind it all: abilities, potions, food, all of it.
---
Other things are personal but I recommend moving to esdf for movement (strafe on s and f, not turn) and buying a mouse with at least a few side buttons. It will give you a good base to start from but there is no "right" answer.
---
Seems like the amount of warlocks should've been swapped, but good pic regardless.
---
Would asume you used lightning bolt to engage.. Otherwise i dont see why you would ever room
---
&gt;be like almost every day and unavoidable for him.
---
Damn, if only there was way to avoid it. Sucks that you can't not be streamer.
---
Arms is not that terrible in Pve, sure in 90% prot or fury could do the job better, but there are Moments Arms really shine. Multiple Trashtanking in zg comes to my mind, no other class will produce that much damage and threat in that short amount of time.
---
With descent gear you can Tank every 5 man in the game, and be the top Overall dps in this groups over the whole dungeon. Sure you need a good healer to do so, but if you have one, your 3 other dps, will never need to cc or take care of their aggro.
---
Lower ranks of stealth are awfull, iirc you get rank 2 on lvl 20 which decrease the risk of being spotted :)
---
There is a huge difference between what I think you mean and a coordinated wpvp event run by guilds. To give an example I was a part of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH2I1BUKmOA) where maximum 3 people spoke in Discord and rest did exactly what they were told. 
---
But sure, in a much less coordinated guild you are gonna have your snowflakes/special boys.
---
Just use Skype. Or use Vent (or teamspeak) for you close group on friends, and Discord for the others.
---
goibon uden lo
---
defending p2w..... I am guessing you are a staunch supporter of orange orangutans.
---
Nono, you dont need a single talent in the healing tree to heal any dungeon, just gear and alot of magewater ;)
---
There might be some people wanting to create this effect on a regular basis, but do you really believe most streamers wish to have a large scale wPvP battle every time they're farming a nod, or trying to kill a rare? I doubt it.   
---
I think the majority of streamers will eventually be forced to stream battlegrounds or raids only, and then just do world stuff off stream to avoid the non-stop ganking.
---
What about when they go into BGs and fuck everything up, and boot anyone that says anything critical of them?
---
Dont you think people got better by clearing the same content 15 years long? :D
---
https://www.vanillafriends.com
---
Looks like there are 5 Cult of Muabrednuw members registered.
---
Multiboxing does not give a real advantage in game. I've tried it. You slit XP while leveling.  There's always one toon that is dead, getting you body back another one dying. That's why you don't see them much. It's easier to level one at the time or grind with a frost mage doing the right abilities at the right time.  
---
Unless your fishing.
---
Maybe you got lucky with server balance but what people see in the beta servers now will NOT be the norm. The faction balance will scew heavily towards one side or the other soon after launch like it did for the original and people will be locked in shitty faction imbalance forever.
---
There would have been plenty of fighting without hardcoded factions just like there was in other MMOs of that era (Lineage 2 etc)
---
Last 2 were just publicity campaigns, bfa had a lot of bugs that were reported during all of beta and only now at 8.2 months after release its finally in a decent state.
---
And classic? It was extremely limited, unless you were a streamer, was it a coincidence that some people that had never played wow were invited and the most common link between them is that they are streamers? 
---
Now i dont mind this approach, i know you have to hype somehow, but when it looks like the main porpuse is to be a PR move it worries is a lot, i dont want another bfa release.
---
There literally aren't any comms in the video so I'm not sure how you could ever say people are doing exactly what they're told to be doing.
---
But Reddit told me they wouldn't!!! Who am i to believe !?
---
Absolutely but if you want to top meters you have to be unemployed. Ferals have the most room for min maxing if you have the time out of probably any class, but if you don’t do the farms you’ll be a sub par dps which is perfectly fine.
---
They actually did a huge ban wave for people doing just that recently. RPers using different models and the like. They reversed most of the bans, but since it still violates the ToS they said anyone continuing to do this would definitely get there account banned.
---
Do not turn your back on the light Paladin, for it may be the only thing that saves you.
---
&gt; Maybe you got lucky with server balance but what people see in the beta servers now will NOT be the norm. 
---
I got lucky 3 times over then on Vanilla.  My original server, the new server I re-rolled horde and then the server my guild transferred due because our existing server was having performance issues. There were a few PvP servers in vanilla there were out of balance, but for the most part it was the PvE servers who couldn't get a popper mix of the 2 factions while most PvP servers were fine.
---
This is basically how I feel
---
Awsome, sounds we have the same demands to a char, mobility and flexibility is my nr 1 prio ;). Need eny help with stats/gear just pm mee xP
---
As does everyone else's wife. The only wife that exists in this image is imaginary.
---
Good AOE with thorns? the buff does not stack and the damage is negligible even in normal mobs, let alone elite mobs in a dungeon. I think 3 druids can be fine because you can regrowth-rejuv 3x on the tank and then just pull the pack and kill and it might be fine.
---
A lot of gear sharing though which sucks.
---
Raptor Hearts &amp; Raptor Eyes from Arathi Highlands. 
---
I remember killing 40 raptors and getting 12 eyes. 
---
I remember ranting in General chat about how all raptors have eyes, TWO of them. 
---
I remember abandoning the quest and leaving Arathi Highlands.
---
It was not like TBC or Wrath CS. 
---
More like judgement of the crusader + some damage. Some mobs still have this ability. 
---
We got seals instead but having CS in vanilla would be awesome since 1 ret could keep the JoL or JoW of the other pallies up.
---
I played this when I was grounded and couldn't play the real game haha.
---
What did you expect? :P ret paladins skips school alot :)
---
That's... How things get fixed..
---
I think Nefarion(black dragons) and the blackrock orcs are manipulating, experimenting, and breeding dragons(red), and as such are seen as a big threat. Razorgore has that mind control orb, and vael is being controlled so you have to kill him--even tho hes not evil. That's just my guess tho, based on the boss mechanics and environmental design in LBRS/UBRS/BWL
---
You don't understand. Activision is just full of mustache twirling boomers who want everything to fail, but they still somehow make piles of money :/
---
I would personally use some gold until lvl 15/20 tops, then find my own in Dungeons or a good bargain at the AH.

---
I really doubt that would work with druids. Sure, if you can aoe farm and stack the one class that has the bes aoe in the game (and possibly way better gear than usual due to level caps) this can work in some dungeons, but druids don't get that. You have single target dps, no huge cooldowns, lots of form switching to even keep the group alive with only 3 players in the party. My guess would be, that it is extremely slow compared to even a normal dungeon group.
---
Dude, stop inciting this behavior. Just play your game and stop trying to get lynch mobs together. You need another hobby. It was funny 3 months ago and now you've killed the joke, you one joke simpleton.
---
Male Undead - "And you are?" 
---
Female Undead - "Embrace the shadow"
---
Asmongold left because he was butthurt. The rest of his group stayed there and just enjoyed the world PvP.
---
Just to clarify, that world record is on a private server. Joana's record of 4 Hours and 20 Minutes is the fastest time that has been recorded on official servers.
---
Also, you didn't really present any data. You just said things.
---
I see, thanks for your input I didn't know that. I am glad I stopped changing models years ago now, kek
---
They did so because when the level cap was 30 they consumed a lot of quests and then found themselves lacking quests to level up to 40.
---
That’s why he stopped streaming
---
I cannot present data because it's forbidden linking p server things, got my post deleted before that!
---
But all my findings are legit and are a google search away of anyone curious enough.
---
No one would ever end-game Paladin, Shaman, or Druid, that's for sure.
---
All the info you need, my friend  
---
 [https://www.joanasworld.com/](https://www.joanasworld.com/)
---
I doubt 100% will be fixed at launch but probably the most significant gameplay-affecting ones
---
I wouldn’t roll a class based on how their state is for phase 1, since most of the game will take place beyond that, in 2020 and 2021. It’s a long time. Maybe 3 months after launch there are 0 hunter bugs left and they’re having a great time, but you rolled a rogue and can’t ever get back that early progression.
---
Blizzards goal is to make money. Nothing more or less.
---
Well the majority of classic supporters. 
---
Lol there's already tons of changes with stuff missing being different. The meta is different and there is no discovery since it's repeated content.
---
It feels like vanilla gameplay but it's a whole different meta and there are some glaring issues that need fixed.
---
Also alot of people hate sharing which is about as far away from vanilla as you can get.
---
Most of them have near instant respawns due to dynamic respawns being tuned drastically high.
---
I miss you
---
because they pay also for every account....
---
You can always screenshot the data you're taking from private server records and upload them to an image hosting site.
---
I guarantee you most of this stuff will not be fixed for the release, or for a longer period after. It's obivously not as easy as just "taking the old client and updating a few things", they have to do the works for Classic, it seems.
---
Take a break from it all till release pal, seems to be getting to you a bit much.
---
Gearing as a paladin or a shaman while leveling (I'm talking healers) would suck major dick. There are barely any mail/plate healing items. So healing with them before 60 would be nigh impossible.
---
Even at lvl 60, best in slot items for paladin is like 90-95% cloth items, so it would truly hurt them even in the late-game, but not as much as leveling of course.
---
Just change the layer if someone wants to gank you, bro!
---
Decent, but not the best.
---
Legs work fine.
---
Want to try it out, retail is free until 20. It's the same abilities, similar talents and the same feeling. Don't expect a completely different game. If you both level to 20 you will know exactly how it will play in classic, just harder and slower but it's basically the same game.
---
I always liked The legend of Stalvan. Basically turns you into the defective of a horror story
---
But he is right. Joana is the fastest with 4 days and 20h on official servers (in the vanilla state). There are faster ones on official servers since BC up until now. But for „legitimate classic“ Joanna is the fastest to this day.
---
Somebody mention the famous people from my crapshoot server Onyxia please!? I wasn't cool enough to know about these people but the right name or story about someone might trigger something
---
I just checked the patch notes and there’s nothing there regarding that.
---
Also doesn’t make sense considering hunters used two weapons, main hand and ranged. Having one at a time isn’t logical.
---
The damn booty bay city was always filled with skeletons... Small story ahead:
---
 When I was on my first run and I got in booty bay I was like "oh nice! A pirate city"... Then while going through the gate I noticed some corpses here and here and the atmosphere got quite creepy... While roaming the city looking for vendors I entered an house without npc inside... Except that I found a room full of skeletons on the floor ... Like... A lot of skeletons. No need to say I was pretty scared and when I got outside I discovered the cause: I saw a few guys running toward me followed by dozens of guards... Few seconds later I was dead... And that was just the first of many death in that city... I actually think that was the most cursed city and I was always scared of gankings while leveling all my other alts...
---
I feel like you are not taking into account that shaman is faction locked.
---
So say 50/50 split alliance and horde.
---
Stats say 20 warrior on realm and only 8 shamans.
---
So cut out 1 faction. Now you have 10 warrior and 8 shaman.
---
Thanks for this clear explanation. However
---
&gt; It's the nature of the beast and the fact that they are beholden to investors and to a lesser extent the community to meet these release deadlines
---
It’s a shame you end it with this bullshit excuse. Those facts do not excuse crunch times. It’s completely and utterly unnecessary.
---
I’ll get back to my main point; why the fuck are we using the same bullshit excuses that where used by factory workers employing children/forcing crazy work hours on people a 100+ years ago. 
---
Activision - Blizzard has no excuse to push for crunch times. They have the resources. They have the power. It’s just pure greed.
---
Rescuing that gryphon in Hinterlands. It is so wholesome and gave me Harry Potter vibes.

That was on the front page of this sub...

---
Alot of the graphics missing

You don’t need to install or sign up with discord to use it. It wins and will win by default.

eey, neat site. thanks!
---
Ahhhh.. how to beat the whole point of classic. Rushing a power level immediately.
---
There are no surprises with WoW Classic. Everything is 100% known ahead of time. If you like that content and want to experience it (again), great. If you don't, WoW Classic is not for you.
---
Any windows in the room?
---
Would you consider running 2 druids and 1 hunter rather? So, a setup more like this:
---
* Primary Tank: Feral Specc (Bear)
---
* Primary DPS/Off tank: Hunter
---
* Primary Healer/DPS/: Resto/Balance  
---
This won't be a huge downside when moving, since Hunters can run fast before mount at 40-45. The hunter can also make his pet take aggro when the main tank/druid needs to off-heal, it also bring a bit more CC. It will also be a bit more efficient in regards to loot during the dungeons.
---
How can they be ruining the match? Why would that cause an issue in AB?
---
Well Paladin &amp; Shaman and in lesser extent Druid are all pretty essential to raids, no? Or do you think that is just because it is a combination of their skills while wearing cloth (or just healing gear).
---
I love fresh starts on new realms. I used to get so excited when a new server was announced then immediately so bummed when I'd realize people could transfer max level toons over, ruining that fresh server smell.

[Any chance he's talking about the same dudes?](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c51tdu/who_are_the_vanilla_players_you_remember_the_most/erzf999/) If so then holy shit, they really must've made their mark on that server.
---
Thank you, Kakyoin
---
I really think ret is the single most wasted potential back in Vanilla. The general idea is really cool, they just needed a tiny bit more - not talking about dps, but just mechanically they could use another ability to be more than mostly an AA bot. Seals and Judgement is really cool, but they don't work as standalone, they would be awesome along with a more "direct" damage ability.
---
Their counterpart, enh shamans, have this extra. Sure they enh by themselves are not full of abilities to use in their core rotation, but they still have the shocks and other ele abilities to use as well as totems and all that.
---
Thats literally why the second link is Horde only data. Put wrinkles in that brain son
---
None of them are essential, they're just nice-to-haves. Without being able to wear cloth, they'll be inferior to Priests in every way.
---
I care a lot about streamers, I care so much that I'll roll on a different server.
---
woah, a whole month passed and some minor ass shit wasn't fixed? On an immensely large and complex project such as WoW? Who would have fucking thought.
---
This is IT. Most of the issues devs are working on are not even visible or known to you. Classic team is most likely restricted on a human resources, let alone time. They can't possibly fix all of the minor bugs this sub keep reporting in a week or two. 99% is that they are working on something like layering, high level content or other staff that you don't even know.
---
Classic team already proved that they care and do everything possible to make Classic **good**. Now it's your turn to chill a little bit and let them do their work in peace
---
The difference is that buying gold in Classic is illegal, while multiboxing is legal.
---
Yup, saving the raid on H LK 10man by eating an entire wave of souls was great. Just got done playing on a Wrath pserver, was an amazing spec with DBW + heroic DV.
---
You start out as a young nobody. You have to prove yourself in the little village. You slowly become a young warrior doing quests for the village chief. He send you to the bigger village. You resolve local problems. You start to get a name. You go meet the chief of your race. He give you simple tasks. When you prove yourself to him he give you more complex tasks. After years of being a hero there's demons threatening the whole world. You get a team of hero together to save the world. About 50 times.
---
Skullflame shield should probably be something you aim for, there's an engineering one that iirc is slightly better for it's proc but Skullflame is a solid choice. Trinkets I'm not sure, I can't think of any "deals X damage upon being hit" trinkets off the top of my head.
---
I guess spec should be fairly obvious? You're likely gonna want consecration and pretty much every survivability talent in the paladin trees you can reach, deep prot will be a necessity.
---
Oh, before I forget. Mana pots, lots of em because you'll probably be oom every 60 seconds.
---
she holds the official record for speed level, so i would say its above "decent" :)  
---
Do you have any other nice guides to share ?
---
What is the advantage? It takes more time to level one character while controlling 5 and it's not particularly strong for things like raiding/dungeons/PvP. It's a little safer in world pvp but that's about it.
---
I don’t even understand why they would downgrade the animations in later patches to be worse than the vanilla ones, where is the logic in that?
---
I dont get it thou. 2nd link shows a census of there being  almost as many shamans as warriors
---
i'm not sure i remember this username :(
---
I have a strong feeling WoW is not a good game for streamers. Imagine a guy leveling up fishing...
---
Me
---
Hand of Edward the Odd is a mace. Warlocks can't use maces, otherwise Nef mace would be ourssssss.
---
I mean, no language based servers for EU...
---
The game has been theory-crafted for almost 15 years on live and then private servers (some of them with instant 60, all gear available, infinite gold etc etc). 
---
It's already known that paladin is the best healer for PvE and PvP (organized), it's pointless to fight over it or assume otherwise, and believe me it hurts as my favorite class is the shaman. Paladin has more utility than shamans (maybe the correct word is better, not more), this also became obvious to the devs and they started to give shamans some of the paladin utility in form of extra totems. 
---
Also keep in mind that a big portion of the players are not 12-25 year old, the ones returning will most likely be 30+, so, although at heart they might be children, the mind is that of an adult, and decision making works differently then it did when we were young. 
---
To add to all of the above, in classic, alot of the best PvP gear came from PvE (and reaching high level ranks is very very time consuming). This will probably end up with the leading faction on a server to excell in both PvE and PvP. 
---
Time will tell, but paladins &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shamans in all form of content.
---
Not that it matters but I'm far left. Your assumptions are batting 0 today. Rich children? I said people who work for their money try reading the post next time.
---
He, not she, and he agrees his record is going to be obliterated by PServer experts during Week One, none of which are sharing their routes publicly.
---
Good spot with the CS but no it's not from bunnyhopping habits. ;)
---
I just find it easier for kiting and doing 180° moves.
---
I wasn't expecting an immediate fix ofcourse since like you said it applies to a minority; mainly fps-players but I was hoping they'd eventually get to it. 
---
Sometimes my tickets were just dismissed without an answer, other times I was assured they were already working on it and a solution was at hand so you can imagine why it pissed me off being send around by their customer support.
---
An so what’s the best one ?
---
The second link shows that Warriors, Warlocks, Rogues, Mages, and Hunters are more populated than Shamans. You need to put wrinkles in your brain.
---
The first link also shows this even accounting for the split you're talking about.
---
i like the AC over you! well played
---
Forenx is just braindead lol. Osrs is actually $11 a month now btw
---
Sounds fair enough. I love it, but it's just complex feeling.
---
No. Will roll a Pala most probably. And play whatever skill I want to.
---
If you're healing reactively you're doing it wrong.
---
My laptop from 2009 begs to differ.
---
im going woyer(dps/ot, arms outside of raid days) then priest(healer), since i've always played those two and they are a consistent source of fun for me in any stage of the game.
---
Some random level 60 rogue walked (no Mount, walked)y level 20 friend and I all the way from stormwind to Southshore to get the flight point I think. I don't remember why I just remembered being in such awe at not only his humility but willingness to spend a long time walking and killing all the things that wanted to kill us and not expecting anything in return. It helped shaped my play style and stuck with me all this time above anything else.
---
The people that work the hardest is almost always the poorest.  Keep talking bullshit.
---
Not going human for the sword skill? WhAt A nOOb
---
Excuse me, its an he indeed.  
---
But for now he still has the record.  
---
And yeah it probably will get beaten, but still its a sick time IMO.
---
I do remember a bit of that. It always felt a bit like an uncalled for invasion of foreign lands tbh.
---
Dwarf rogue. Played a dwarf pally bc I loved the idea of being a holy warrior type dwarf. I always wanted to play a rogue after playing for a while, but was too far with my pally to spend the time to level a new toon. I’ve always played dwarf so I’m sticking with that, and rogue because now I can
---
Nah, you wont be crowded that's for sure.
---
Raiding.
---
I played on an RP-Server and most of our guild and partner guilds weren't that interested in raiding. I've been raiding in other MMORPGs (LotRO, The Secret World) and I love the teamplay aspect of it. And I know I'm a good healer.
---
I'm not sure about Naxx and AQ40, but I want to raid MC, BWL, ZG and AQ20. And I want my T1/T2-Set.
---
An add-on like pfquest is way more important. It will show where you need to go on the map.
---
You get into a town, accept every quest, check you map and quest add-on. You do all the quest. You get back to town to return them. 
---
I really don't see how the guide is helpful.
---
OMFG it was hutch!! After all these years I hear his name again...
---
I can't remember their name and it makes me really sad. I was playing on a PVE server named Nordrassil, in North America. I was a Tauren Druid, I can't even remember what they were. 
---
We were in the same guild for a short time before I started teetering off (Eventually I moved to an active Tichondrius and actually got good at the game)
---
They were quitting WoW for some reason, we had been reminiscing about runescape and out of nowhere he offered me his account. CaillousKitty, level 126 with near max on most skills and an inv full of dragon weapons. 
---
Those were the days.
---
No
---
All of them except the first
---
That gnome was a veterinary before the war, the daggers were actually scalpels.
---
He was performing this procedure - [http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/beef/facts/07-029.htm](http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/beef/facts/07-029.htm)
---
First link has both factions.
---
Your argument was that shamans wont be "nearly" as popular as warriors. Which is false. They are very popular. No AS popular, but to no stretch as you put it is true
---
You mentioned nothing of the other classes before
---
So the way I did it back in the days, I would put another healer on follow, than used the early OP version of Healbot that you could set up so the lowest health raid member would be in the same spot on your screen, then use an autoclicker to cast flash of light. This way I could get cool DPS loot while playing with my PS2. Good times.
---
Too soon!
---
when you are 60 the real bfa starts ;)
---
You couldn't. I'm a Eu - Portuguese guild.
---
Even so, i miss you and ppl like you
---
There were so many. Halloween, Christmas, Summer, special in game events. You can get special costume pets.
---
My favorite part of WoW.
---
Hi a eu - portuguese guild.
---
even so, i miss you and ppl like you, I'm dad.
---
"I'll gladly pay you today for a cheeseburger today!"
---
Great answer, but I have two small extra notes.
---
1. You mention Alliance don't have a lot of good wPvP racials, but I'd include Shadowmeld here. Not just because it allows you to get an opener, but because it can be used to eat and drink. Especially if you get some distance, people can't just target you even if they know where you are, and with Invisibility potion you can move to a place they don't know, then use Shadowmeld to eat and drink. This is certainly harder to use than stun resist or WotF, but if you take the time to learn how to use it then it becomes really strong.
---
2. Horde have a favourable start in AB. Horde are set up for LM, BS and Farm at the start of a match, where as Alliance is set up to get Stable, BS and GM. The problem with GM is you can only leave it from two sides, but enemies can enter it from all sides. LM on the other hand allows you to slowfall down to BS, but enemies have to go through one of two chokepoints to attack. This means you want LM and BS, and from there due to roads to BS farm is the last ideal. Horde instant get Farm at the start of a match and they have a crossroad between the 3 wanted nodes.
---
THEY SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO PVE REALMS.
---
Perfect. I'm planning to be a filthy casual during classic but events were always the best, I just couldn't remember if they were in that far back. Thank you.

&gt;First link has both factions.
---
And even accounting for the split you referred (dividing the other populations by 2) to Shamans are still less popular.
---
I never said Shamans aren't played. I never said people don't play them. I said that Rogues, Warriors, and Mages are MORE popular and Shamans are one of the LEAST played classes.
---
Which true, seeing as they come in only above Priests and Druids.
---
&lt;3
---
Have been healing for over a decade now, the rewarding part comes from being able to control flow of battles more, a good healer keeping a newer player on dps alive will give the chance for the not so good dps guy do more dmg than a superior warrior with a shit healer just because he dies.
---
Also you make a name for urself with just a few clutch heals. Your dps amigos will respect that and peal for you like no tomorrow.
---
It looks quite amazing when a rogue opens up on You and 2 warriors drop their main target to intercept and melt the guy.
---
Here's a list;
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Event
---
I would stick to what you want to play. Doesn’t seem like in the long run playing Horde is the right choice for you “.
---
Even Joana admits his record is going to get obliterated in the first week of Classic.
---
Less than 90 hours /played to 60 is the new meta.
---
Personally I was so stuck in Dark Age of Camelot (best game ever made) during Vanilla being a pro pvper so I didnt do a ton of raiding. I wanna do that this time around and possibly rock the BG scene too. Not much surprising content though but still a lot to learn still.
---
You want argent defender with thorium shield spike
---
Perhaps if it would be mail/plate for pallies it'd be doable. Not as good as bis but still. With some proper itemization it would add to class fantasy I think. They'd have room for such items in Classic.
---
Trust me I know, I always called out healers for healing me way too much but as a healer myself I made the same mistake.
---
When the tank isn't taking any damage and your manapool is very healthy suddenly it doesn't seem so bad to heal that lock to grow your epeen on the healingmeters. Which is normally no problem but if all healers think like that on the exact same moment then you could have a problem. ;)
---
Not sure where that stat comes from (source?) but it sounds made up. I'm not sure why your making this a weird political thing, just dont discriminate.
---
Stay awaaaaaaay from da vodo ROFL
---
Pirates day!
---
You can just spoof windows 7 and get a key for free nowadays and the activate it through windows and your good. No one's paid for it since that Russian dude spoofed it. Been like 2 years now.
---
So where is the data?
---
Self mana burn, mana is VERY VERY important in classic, for all classes. That is why viper sting is so insanely strong. 
---
Guess who is the healer with the least mana problem in the game?? Hint: Horde doesn't have them
---
It should definitely have been like that.
---
Paladin: Stack spell dmg, stack block rating, spiked shield, enchant Fiery Weapon.
---
Druid: HoT the paladin and throw a Hurricane.. With this combo you dont have to min max that much
---
Pala should go for Consecration and shield block talents. 
---
The specs dosnt matter for this kinda thing realy.
---
Dont do this as a leveling 'thing', thorns and retri aura have to low dmg, compared to how many mobs that you can actily find in the open world :) it might be usefull in Wpl at the graveyard, but no where else id say
---
So you're saying Hunter pets, their AI, everything, now works like in 1.12 and not like how in BFA?
---
X - doubt
---
Diving the other classes by 2 doesnt even put druid on the map dood. Wtf are you on?
---
Yes it's viable.
---
But it's considerably less viable than the other alternatives.
---
Also there's the taboo around it being not viable.
---
Therefore I think the biggest problem with the spec isn't the DPS, but the fact that you'll have a hard time getting gear because you'll have a hard time getting a spot.
---
There's no difference horde or alliance.  
---
After 20 you level in the same zones, do the same dungeons, do the same raids.
---
Calm down, champ, everything will be ok.
---
I don't understand your point.
---
Thank you! I'll try :)
---
Where can I find more of this type of artwork? It's fire
---
&gt; Again, I don't care about the effort required as a customer
---
And you don't need to. You can always decide not to pay and thus not to play the game. Voting with your wallet is a thing.
---
&gt; Plus you're making it sound as if they would require to re-do 15 years of work, which is bullocks. They would have to make it compatible.
---
No. Making it compatible doesn't make the program secure from all the vulnerabilities discovered in the past 15 years. The problem is, these vulnerabilities are know now. And they will be exploited in a commercial product. It's mightily easier for an attacker just to try a list of known stuff than to find new vulnerabilities.
---
Thing is, you really do not seem to know what Software Development is about. There are reasons for decisions. Being oblivious to them doesn't make them invalid or go away.
---
sadHeehee
---
just camp resources, entrypoints(flightpaths etc) and the likes and wpvp will happen.
---
SS vs TM situations wont happen, you'll be contesting nodes and dinosaurs. Cut off frequently travelled roads like Thorium point &gt; BRM, Dire Maul entrance etc. 
---
 BG's dont remove the need of farming consumeable reagents for people. Trust me this will all come naturally, you'll know in no time what the hotspots are. ;)
---
I'm jealous, I don't even have a girlfriend.
---
They recently was a ban wave on retail for people who used model edits to do dumb shit like give their character bigger boobs. Initially it was a six month ban, but they lowered afterwards.
---
No, if you have not played vanilla for 15 years you are not going to get 60 in 5 days played. A more realistic “average” is 10 days played, which is what “most” people will end up getting.  7 days played is good for someone who is familiar with the quests and has done them recently. 
---
The “world record” data that OP refers to is not really legit since it happened on a pserver with flawed xp values (30% too high from quests amongst others).
---
Rip
---
I would rly like such desks. Don't have much space in my room and they are so compact.
---
It's almost as if Blizzard are using the beta to test different parameters for the layering system.  What an amazing revelation.
---
Overpopulation.
---
You'll have to be a better rogue because there's a lot of competition.
---
But they need to get to the bosses quickly as they'll be doing each dungeon 15 times so they can all gear up.
---
4 hours and 20 minutes seems like it beats 3 days :P
---
Prot?
---
Same. My first run in wasn't even with proper twinks, just 19 rogues in WSG with scary red enchantments on their weapons running around murdering everyone. For the longest time I equating twinks specifically with rogues with fiery enchants.
---
No man, is not that simple, there are a lot of buffs that can be applied, so that purge must go through a lot of them before reaching the one you actually want. And that warrior is ripping through your team in the same time. Also you manaburn yourself and "silence" yourself during those purge GCDs, this means no healing for your team.
---
Also people underestimate a lot of the utility paladin has. Let me give you and example: in organized PvP alliance will always have the upper hand (equally skilled teams) just due the fact that the initial battle in most BGs will be won by the alliance - paladins will have 12 seconds of UNINTERRUPTED healing, plus a LoH for one instant top, plus freedom, plus BoP, these tools are huge and the alliance can snowball hard from there.
---
&gt;Vanilla is meant to be a world so it's a bunch of small interconnected story with a few bigger beats.
---
Well, that's not really true. Retail have just as many small interconnected stories (well, more actually). The main difference is that retail makes their main story very obvious, you get it thrown at you and can't avoid it.
---
Vanilla also have a main story, that part is no different really - it is just not thrown in your face. Take the Gates of AQ and their opening and then the raid, it was the main story at that point of the game. The difference is just that you don't have some mage running next to you explaining what is happening, but there is lore of the whole event and NPC's that explain it - it was just not voice acted and as obvious to find. Sometimes I would say it is a problem in vanilla that too much lore of something is left out. If you never read about Warcraft lore you will miss out a lot of what we are actually doing in raids, where as in Retail you always know the story implications of a raid.
---
On top of that, the main story in retail tends to be connected a lot more with both the past and future of the main story.
---
I do agree with you on "vanilla is meant to be a world", because on retail it feels like we are bystanders watching the story of some characters like Thrall or Jaina, in vanilla it feels like we are just living in a world where events happen and we just get caught up in them (probably by choice, considering our characters are "adventurers"). You didn't feel like you watched a movie about the Gates of AQ, you felt like you were part of it. Done in the retail way it would have felt like a movie about Khadgar and friends.
---
Honestly, neither is perfect methods, but I do think the more subtle approach of vanilla is a core part of why it feels like a world and not a movie. They could just use a bit more information about things like the raids in the actual game.
---
Honestly Vent was pretty terrible, the obscene cost of slots on a server and that terrible codec that made everyone sound like they were wearing a welding mask inside of a vacuum cleaner make me not miss it.
---
Discord is pretty great, the VOIP is crisp as heck and it's free and very customizable. I'm not sure if it has any downsides compared to Vent or Teamspeak.
---
Blizzard has an inhouse 1.12.1 client that they cross-reference against so its super easy to blizzard to test and verify this bug.
---
Lets just hope they do.
---
"Omg, none of the bugs will get fixed"
---
**bugs start getting fixed**
---
"Omg they only fixed 2 bugs"
---
I guess some things never change. I remember patch day was always a lot of fun, because of all the whining
---
**overpowered ability gets slightly nerfed**
---
"The priest community has had enough of being pushed around by Blizzard"
---
Sounding like they are protesters for some civil rights cause with how dramatic people are bitching about wow
---
It's a completely different game.
---
You think any streamers are gonna be on pvp servers? That's just asking to get camped 24/7 when they're streaming.
---
My classic time was alliance. BC and Wotlk was Horde. Then i quit. 
---
I have many good memories with both factions and like both the same.
---
Luckily my friends prefer horde, therefore I dont have to sponder over that.  
---
The race choice is hard enough.

# [Horde, EU, PvE server] &lt;The Muffin Vendor&gt;
---
Hello there!
---
“The Muffin Vendor” is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We’re going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn’t mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!
---
**Who are we?**
---
We’re a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I’m sure a lot of others have. We’ve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we’re all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla’s endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
Right now, our core raid spots are covered, and we're seeking to expand our numbers - as well as potentially build a second raid to strengthen our progression. In particular, we're looking for **Holy Priests and Resto Shamans**, though other applications may be considered depending on their quality. Recruit prios may change from week to week so stay tuned!
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
* A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we’ll go far!
---
* Consumables. We’re not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefis/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
* English – or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
* Looting rules: We're planning to use a **DKP** system with **blind bidding** in order to avoid bid wars. **Loot Council** will be employed for **legendary items**. We believe this represents the fairest compromise between the needs of the guild and the needs of its members.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We’re currently planning to have at least three weekly raids. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there’s only MC/Ony and people don’t have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we're currently planning to raid from 8:30 to 11:30 CET. Earlier starting times may be considered for weekends, depending on players' turn-up.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to apply on our site:  [https://themuffinvendor.enjin.com/](https://themuffinvendor.enjin.com/)
---
Fury is the defacto 1-39 levelling spec. Then arms 40-60.
---
This is just so f***Ing beautiful.
---
Ok.
---
Easy.
---
Turn on 4k.
---
Set windows scaling to 200%
---
I think the tv supports 120hz but I can't remember if it's real or fake or was it faked to 244...
---
Either way wow will support it if the tv does.
---
Then you need to change your color profile to the YKK or whatever color profile. On both the Nvidia color and the TV settings. Then turn on game mode for the tv to reduce input lag by about 30%(tho it doesn't really matter)
---
This was a lame insult in 2007. I'm not even sure what to do with it a decade and a half later.
---
Nice video mado!
---
...Keep going..
---
"The ability to transform Rhok'delar and Lok'delar has been removed, but you can talk to Vartrus the Ancient to receive the item you currently don't possess." 
---
It doesn't make sense, that's why they removed it
---
That’s not true. You’d still bring them for their buffs, and you can get away with healing in Judgement and/or misc other pieces like Peacekeeper Gauntlets. MC would be pretty much the only issue.
---
They fixed it!

0ms coms and a druid healbot for a GF
---
Consecration is pretty useful in a lot of situations. Yes it's far from mana efficient but kinda required for tanking and additional DPS for RET or a AOE in PvP to prevent bandaging and unstealthing rogues.
---
Is this an Easter egg nobody saw until now? Would be very amazed.
---
Yah. I'm done here. Gg you win. Goodnight
---
&gt;That's great news, but not unexpected
---
a surprise to be sure - but a welcome one
---
With heroic leap, it's the spell I will miss the most /cry
---
I wonder why the other guy lied about them legs not working....
---
i thought layers only came into effect if there were like more than 3000 people online or something?  from what people are saying it sounds like they've been doing them as percentages of current pop :O
---
Tell me how?
---
Deus vult!
---
I made a mistake, its actualy 4 days and 20 hours, but I feel you lol
---
There's quite a difference between 'hardly perfect' and the current state, what is borderline broken. They haven't even acknowledged most of the infamous bug list, let alone fix it.
---
Now let’s see how they contend with the true lord of Blackrock Spire!
---
Make sure you manually disconnect yourself if you get too close to fire aoe during raids.
---
Ah, poor missery-merchants, at this rate they'll be out of bussiness before release...
---
The healing game is not about button presses, rather it is about mana management, preventing overhealing while at the same time keeping everyone alive. Meaning to be an above average healer you need to use multiple downranked spells, precast heals, and play the support role aswell. 
---
For example, paladin have great supportive and defensive tools such as Blessing of protection, freedom, sacrifice, lay on hands, and an arsenal of seals that can boost your team in a jiffy.
---
So with all this combined, yea healing is rewarding.
---
lol what server you playing on
---
I'll just go over the "red" aka "bad" ones and the situations when you might consider these. 
---
Improved SoR - SPD Reckbomb build or 5man tanking. 
---
Consecration - Never ever hurts, thousands of potential uses. 
---
Longer Seals - I always take at least 1 or 2 points in there, 3/3 is a bit of an overkill. Very solid talent for raiding pallies putting judgements on bosses.
---
Imp. Devotion aura - if you go max raid support  spec then it's more useful than block. 
---
Bonus defense - this one fairly sucks, probably some 5man tank spec?
---
Imp. Blessing of Might - at least one pally in the raid must have this.
---
Imp.Crusader - decent for leveling.
---
Well just looking at it you can clearly see the coordination.
---
Great!!  I'm pvper from all the time. 
---
I have to admit there is more fun in PVP old time.
---
But then, we are facing tons of balacing issue. 
---
If they could actually balance it such as what they do now, it's fascinating.
---
I remember when that controversy was going down, I'm not going to pretend that Discord is some holy program we should all worship. BUT! With any application/service/program that is free you should expect and understand that YOU are the product. Usually these companies compile meta-data and sell it off to advertisers to be used in targeted advertisement. 
---
Facebook does it, Google does it, Discord does it, I wouldn't be surprised if Reddit did it as well.
---
It costs a lot of money to develop these programs, and who's going to pay for the bandwidth and upkeep?
---
I don't know how much things have changed in the past 10 years but when I played it was definitely the stereotype and the truth that younger players rolled Alliance and "older" players rolled Horde. That alone was enough to make a lot of people Hordies for life.
---
Private server data doesn't mean anything. There's a reason they're called "Blizz like" no private server has be been close too even a 90% recreation of the original game in terms of values,  drop chances, spawn times ect. Hell look at how reck bomb pallies have been on private servers,  then blizzard comes out to say that's not how the talent worked or was intended to work...
---
Troll rogue for life
---
I posted a balance thread yday and it was not met very positive around here haha.
---
I'd put Pursuit of Justice in the Good category. 8% movement speed isn't as crazy as the 30%-40% that Druids, Hunters, and Shaman get while leveling but it helps a lot. It helps even more when mounts come into play.
---
Its also a great PvP talent as it saves you a boot enchat, and also your mount is faster.
---
Based on this comment, I assume the people who group with you probably want to kill you too.
---
Yes but you still stare at the same character for as long as you play the game. I like gnomes myself but some people can't even stand to see them. I personally hate hooves on characters, I feel it ruins perfectly good looking boots. Plus the difference of running through Ironforge with the background music and dark theme is very different to running through Orgrimmar. And you spend alot more time in the capital cities in Vanilla than you do in modern wow.
---
Lol glad we have the reputable original classic people. Who forgot 90% of the game. I wouldn't trust either opinion.
---
I won't miss vent except for the voice announcing every time somebody entered the channel. Since the voice spoke the players' names, it could be funny at times. 
---
"Treddy Boy, Im Treddy has joined channel."
---
&gt; I think Rag and Nef are just bad dudes with purples we want?
---
There are actually pretty much lore reasons for all raids in Vanilla, the problem is that you don't get much of that lore in the actual game. For example with MC it trays back to the War of the Three Hammers (some of the most important dwarf lore) as well as the destruction of Redridge Mountains and making of Blackrock Mountain / Searing Gorge. Ragnaros in current time is trying to bolster his army of golems (as you can see in Blackrock Mountain) and use them to conquer Azeroth.
---
Nefarian on the other hand, being a corrupted black dragon, plans to overthrow the other dragon aspects, which obviously is a bad thing. Actually, his plan is pretty much the same as Deathwing, so just think of the whole story of Cataclysm boiled down to a weaker dragon leading the black dragon flight.
---
Normal players/parties do that, too. Not multibox specific and not especially common either.
---
The one that sadly isnt returning :(
---
I kill two dwarves in the morning
---
I kill two dwarves at night
---
I kill two dwarves in the evening
---
And den i feel allright!
---
I kill two dwarves in time of peace
---
And two in time of war
---
I kill two dwarves before i kill two dwarves
---
.... And den i kill two more!
---
I miss that /silly :(
---
Sure you do.  
---
you got any proof of that ?  
---
Also you know the Classic Beta level cap is below 60 right ?  
---
So unless you can provide some poof of that, i call fake.
---
Its updated to 8.0 but not 8.1, hopefully they will update it to 8.1 for the multithread and DX12 support later on.
---
At 19 hunters and rogues just have a huge advantage. They can stack agi and stam and just melt anyone else in solo situations. From what I remember, mages were one of the worst twink classes in that bracket. 19 paladins are great support options, but they will absolutely be wrecked by rogues and hunters.
---
There is litteraly no reason to assume that the huge amount of missery-peddling fixes things. Bug reports fix things, accurate concise posts (which make up less than 1% of the qq-posts on this subreddit) might help fix things but the "erhmagerd huntardz so broken, y blizz fuck up my main class since 2003"-outragebullshit doesn't help at all, it just makes the proper feedback harder to find.  
---
Quality &gt; quantity is key to fixing things and that ratio is so terrible on this subreddit that I doubt a company would waste resources to find those few needles in this haystack of bad feedback.
---
You're right, only Priests, Locks and Druids are played less. They are right in the middle between those bottom 3 and the top 4 being War, Mages, Hunts and Rogues.
---
Interesting, thanks for linking the pservers census.
---
&gt;**Vanilla**: Explore the world, series of small interconnected plots. Make your own story with friends.
---
Just because people don't know the endgame story and want to make vanilla out as the perfect "it's all about exploring with your buddies" doesn't mean it didn't have a story like all the expansions.
---
The best because Cannibalize is probably the most underrated and underused racial. It's on a 2min CD and regenerates **35%** hp. 
---
For leveling you can imagine how immense that is for sustain but it's also really helpful for soloing instances. 
---
In the end my lock had 6k hp so that's a **2.1k** heal that you can convert into mana.
---
In pvp I used it pretty much on cooldown and made me win a lot of 1vsX fights. With fear you can keep someone CCed and then Cannibalize+Bandage+Healthstone and you're back at full hp from 0 and there's no shortage of dead bodies around the world/bgs.
---
When I rolled an Alliance lock I just felt lost without my Cannibalize, I suddenly had to drink after a couple of mobs which I never had to before. It's like you're missing a core ability of your class. I'd love to roll an Orc for the stun resist but that's only useful against multiple opponents since you're a 1vs1 GOD anyway and Cannibalize serves it's purpose in those 1vsX fights as well.
---
But if private server players don't share there knowlage than joana's route is still the best for us without expirience.
---
What is suppose to happen?
---
Ok healing is going to be a different experience than retail. You dont need to actively dodge mechanics or look at whats going on or even get dps in. From what ive seen you are literally going to be standing and casting the same spells all fight. The main thing you will be focusing on is not running out of mana so that means switching between ranks of spells etc. Yes it can be fun and ive always enjoyed healing so will probably give it a go at some point.
---
The reason why I wont main a healer at the start of the expansion is that dual specs didnt exist back then, and switching between specs was an awkward and also expensive task. That means if you are playing a healer, you will be forced into doing group content anytime you want to make gold or just chill out in the world. Solo exp as a healer is going to be slow and a bit dull, unless you want to churn out money respeccing every day.
---
I've played on Vek'Nilash EU and Lightnings Blade EU in Vanilla and they were both heavy Horde (55%+)
---
I'm playing in Twilights Hammer EU (90%+ Horde) and Ravencrest EU (90%+ alliance) in retail.
---
They were all PvP servers.
---
I'm a horde player for life. But if my group of friends decided they were rolling Alliance, I'd swallow my pride and roll Alliance as well. WoW is a social game.
---
I played through all of vanilla in vanilla but it definitely doesn't do a good job if communicating the story. Blizzard really improved on that for the latest games.
---
As I said in a post further down you are correct.
---
My brain has plenty of wrinkles don't worry about that. I just find it doubtful that people would roll their class for a beta based on lvl40 meta since the beta cap has been increasing steadily and I've purposefully taken out anything lower than lvl 20 in an effort to capture only "mains".
---
I would have expected Shamans to be more populated considering how instrumental and strategy defining they are in Horde pve and PvP.
---
What's your take on that?
---
Seriously who the hell thought changing the stealth animation was a good idea in tbc?
---
The f**k this is amazing!!
---
When that vocal minority constantly floods the first 50 posts of this subreddit, it isn't unfair to claim it's the whole subreddit imho. It makes it quite hard to ignore even if it is a minority making those posts.
---
Exactly. People want Sharding for low level zones and nothing of the sort for the rest.
---
But since it's Sharding that's a no-no word and we can't have that. SMH
---
What do the broken classes sacrifice?
---
Ironforge is way prettier. Starting zones for alliance are much more fun. Pally are better than shaman. A local guild rolling horde offered me a main tank job. Troll it is!
---
&gt;If you have knowledge of any exploitation taking place, you should report it to your local authorities.
---
Hoo boy, Marx is gonna blow your mind.
---
Ah I didn't look close enough at Warlocks in the larger sample size. They are played less.
---
I suppose one could argue that splitting it by half isn't fair for Warlocks, as Alliance have less Warlocks in general due to WoTF being a thing. But perhaps thats just splitting hairs.
---
I was very young at the time, maybe like 8-9. I really liked Night elves in WC3 because of their cool living tree buildings. When my older brother got WoW he made a troll because he thought the headhunters were cool af, which they are. He let me play on his account and I was going to make a night elf but he convinced me to play Horde because I had to in order to play on the same (pvp) server as him. I made a undead warr because I wasn't too keen on the other horde races yet. Now I love the Horde and every time I go back to play WC3 I'll play as orc.
---
Honestly animations and no layering aswell as some trees can actually be just as important as numbers and gameplay.
---
I'm assuming that white guy is dead, but I don't know who that is supposed to be.
---
he still has the record.  
---
untill someone beats it, with evidence, he has the record.
---
There there, at least we can stare into the wastelands that is the fucking barrens.
---
They should've invited like 2000 more. I got my beta sort of late, and was busy irl just when I got it and ended up behind the main force levelling up. I haven't had anyone looking for groups for elite content in the 20's and low 30's for weeks.
---
Do you mean the integrated party voice chat from WOTLK? (OR was it TBC?)
---
Or do you mean the separate VOIP through the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client?
---
[Battle.net](https://Battle.net) is being integrated which means the features like notifications when someone messages you from the client and the separate voip option will be there. However, the integrated VOIP will not be in the game as it was added via expansions)
---
Think your edit went wrong
---
Somehow I have very fond memories of Kara despite having run it more or less every week for most of TBC's life span.
---
Im assuming every one of these is a side effect from reverse engineeing the legion client, will test if these have been fixed on launch!
---
DON'T TOUCH ME! I played alliance briefly and loved this NPC.
---
The late Varian Wrynn, former King of Stormwind and the Alliance from the World of Warcraft IP
---
I would argue healing is the most engaging playstyle of all. Its just a constant mindgame picking targets and/or conserving mana using correct cooldowns etc etc
---
Is there any data out from speed levelers on the private servers? I mean routes or something that can help people like me with no expirience level a bit faster?
---
That's who I figured it was, I just remembered him with bigger anime hair.
---
Wait, the other guy just made this up or what?
---
Or Nagrand. :(
---
Multiboxers will not be in bgs in classic. /follow is disabled in bgs.
---
Mana regen is also too high on any live blizz like pserver. This dramatically improves leveling times. The mana regen I seen during the stress tests between 1-10 and 1-15 was about half as good as the pserver mana regen.
---
That feeling is Nostalgia and it will only take you so far. The itch will be scratched within the first month or two and then Classic will have nothing else to offer you. 
---
And that's okay.
---
I always dreamed for NE  paladins, oh well, 15 years and counting
---
I'm not gonna lie, every single stealth animation (were there two or three updates) has bothered me a lot. They all look incredibly stupid, the vanilla animation looks amazing and should have never been changed
---
It's still quite epic in-game viewing, him and Goku must have the same barber.
---
No, you will fly atound it, maybe from the north side through winterspring.
---
Yup
---
Id say so, vanilla is very easy to get into and understand.
---
How is that? I got my old vanilla account that hadn't been touched or subbed in since vanilla back a few months ago. I just  emailed them my info and my I'd and asked for them to look for it and then added into my new one in like 33 hours lol .
---
I've played since 2005, and I would not invest in current WoW personally. I'd start off with Classic, it's a "proper" MMO and a lot more immersive imo. Retail is just full of feel good mechanics and little to no community. Classic requires a community to even play, so you'll meet more people etc. It's a no contest!
---
Honestly now I have no clue
---
This would be a fine and dandy idea, if vanilla itemization was more streamlined and gave all specs an option in their armor class: in fact this is how it worked since like wotlk.
---
But it isn’t: warrior tier gear is all tanking stuff so DPS warriors need to use a ton of leather and mail gear usually meant for rogues and hunters, Holy Paladins basically wore dresses because there was no intellect plate, not really any intellect leather so fuck rdruids as well, it would be a complete nightmare without a total overhaul of the itemization available in vanilla wow.
---
In all the possible ways...
---
You will not find multiboxers in bgs with /follow disabled. It’s purely an open world/instanced pve thing.
---
You'd also have to take into account that the people who got invited into the beta are not a good sample of the general public. They're mostly OG vanilla veterans as far as I can tell. The beta seems to had a preference for inviting players with accounts from '05.
---
&gt;I would have expected Shamans to be more populated considering how instrumental and strategy defining they are in Horde pve and PvP.
---
I still think they're a popular class. Lots of people play them, just more people play other classes. I don't think we're going to experience any kind of Shaman drought. A lot of raids will bring as many Shaman as they can to raids; up to 8. 
---
I think maybe gear competition or totem frustration? There is also the fact that in raids they're healers and that puts some people off of the class if they're interested in doing raids.
---
Plagueworld? Now that you mention it, Plaguewood was kind of a large area.
---
&gt;Wrath of the Lich King finally delivered on a lot of the class fantasy aspects
---
so true, I think wotlk was the most fun I had on ret, few patches were rocky but in general, the expansion fixed so much stuff I'd say it was the most balanced one ever
---
Lied? There's video evidence.
---
we kick people out of the irl friend group if they go alliance.  
---
^(/s)   
---
No but serious, nobody in our group plays alliance, so if they would like to play alliance he knows he's alone
---
Damn drawing distance is definitely a lot better than it was in the Vanilla client.
---
It actually takes a bit of luck to get TF.  Like the avg time to get one is a year.
---
Wrong background, there are no murlocs in tanaris. kek
---
thanks
---
you mean you will play for more than 18-20 hours a day that is needed? xD or account share, that works too lul
---
I honestly have no idea. It could be old footage reposted by someone else, it could have been fixed between when he took the footage and when it posted it, he could be completely full of shit, your guess is as good as mine. It was annoying to see so many people dumping on an absolutely magnificent game for such petty nitpicks, so I figured I’d share the good news.
---
Joanna holds the record.  
---
If you have any proof of somebody else beaten that record feel free to share
---
They were using hyper aggressive layering with payers of 2-3 without any exaggeration for awhile now.
---
I'd say druids were OKE-ish, but ret got tons of abilities removed for some fcking dumb reason so they gutted them too much...
---
Yes, because while your team is getting hammered and the healthbars are dropping fast, you will be spamming purge to get rid of that FaP, or BoF, or BoP from that one warrior with 2 full rows of buffs. At least you get him to be a gnome and not a pirate.
---
Is it reasonable to expect them to? Hunters were hardly bugfree at launch back in '04.
---
My ass itches.
---
Macro them all to one button, spam one button and we're back to playing with one hand!
---
I completely agree, but I again want to focus on PVP... people are way smarter right now! Back then I completely annihilated everyone in my MC/BWL gear but people these days wont be keyboard turning and clicking their spells from the spellbook... PVP is my life
---
Fuck we're getting old.
---
Thanks for the tip! Maybe I’ll take a look at the newer expansions in the future
---
The average audience of WWE is 35, doesnt mean its not a kids show
---
Every shamans dream is to become the next Unbreakable :')
---
You mean literally what he mentioned thinking about doing for Classic?
---
Yeah multiboxer are just making pvp servers hell! /s
---
haha I get you dude and I agree. thing is I know the ret is way worse than say war/rogue for pvp and since PVP is the only thing I care about, I just don't want to shoot myself in the foot (again). If they open TBC or WOTLK servers, I'd go for paladin again, but in vanilla... damn people are not keyboard turning anymore, they will shit on paladins hard.
---
Just giving my opinion. I'm on light hopes new server. Even after 5 days there's literally 100 person waiting and grinding the same mobs in starting areas. Respawn are superfast. I can't imagine with 6 minutes respawn how 2500 player per layers will work. No way I would start my first toon on release. You just want to be able to tag a mob. It's not a fun experience at all.
---
Same, paladin lore is absolutely my favorite in the game, I love paladins. I want to DPS in raids when Classic comes out though, im rolling a mage.
---
Do you not put down totems in retail? I haven't played since Cata.
---
I sometimes say rofl and people look at me and I have to say "Haha just kidding I meant to say lmao". ;~;
---
It is a social game, but to play a faction you don't like for a friend who probably wont stick with it is a bit different.  I have been excited about classic since it was announced, me and my other friend originally were going Alliance all the way then our other friend decided he would prob play classic after all and now he want's to go Horde, which does not excite me in the least.
---
wOW wE tOtAlLy DiDnT kNoW tHaT
---
It might have been an older build or the issue might have been on his end, but it’s also possible he’s a lying jerk. It’s weird, because his video does have some truth to it. The clock tower above stockades is missing, as are the out-of-district trees. If it was all BS it’d be easy to dismiss, but the nuggets of truth lead me to believe it used to be an issue, but Blizzard fixed it. 
---
The only truly upsetting and noticeable bug I’ve found on the beta is missing water around Van Cleef’s ship. It’s just a big hole. Other than that, Classic has been everything I’d hoped, and more.
---
It was my first character and first 60 on that server, later I moved to pvp server Dentarg and rolled Horde.
---
What are some current examples of game breaking bugs which are not fixed yet? (For Classic WoW)
---
That's really up to the person. Some people like retail, some people like classic, some people love other expansions. If you can, try both and see which one you like. Classic isn't without its flaws but it promotes social interactions and other things that for me make a better MMO. Retail is like a streamlined wow and more accessible to a newer player but does lack RPG mechanics.
---
Hehe yeah... the whole Point of Classic re-release is for certain things to be like they were back then. Chaning the balancing would also Change the difficulty of raids which would be a Major difference I suppose... Although I wouldn't be totally against it :P
---
I mean - they don't have to make everything OP but just a Little bit stronger so it becomes a bit more viable...
---
I don't understand how private server stats can be comepared to actual Classic stats. Spawn rates, drops rates, exp, regen are all different. 
---
Speedrunners in other games only compare down to the exact patch so why do people make so many exceptions with WoW?
---
A small loan of one million gold.
---
don't get me wrong, but ret dps compared to warrior, esp in pvp... is a joke. I want to go for rank14 again and even back then, I did that on rogue (which I stopped playing later). I had my fun in vanilla on ret, crushing nubz but now, people are not keyboard turning anymore, they know how to kite, restealth... it will be a mess
---
Either Zin'rokh or ashjre'thul
---
Fair point. I remember leveling one at the launch of a highly anticipated pserver (had never played one in Vanilla) and remembering all those GCDs spent on totem dropping as the dungeon group moved on... And all that drinking between pulls. I actually enjoyed healing but did not particularly fall in love with making my group wait for my Mana.
---
Depends on the guild I guess. I got my fancy teal dress from AQ over some cloth wearers. Ruffled some feathers at the time, but it was a bigger healing upgrade for me than them.
---
and many many other abilities... don't even google that list of stuff we lost when the game went live...
---
LUL
---
God yes, this! I find the Horde models unappealing and I hate the layout and aesthetic of the cities!
---
Thanks dude
---
It’s possible his “video evidence” was from an emulated server, or something. All I can tell you is that the footage in this video was captured tonight, by me, on the beta. I know nothing about his footage except that parts were totally wrong.
---
Omg, what a rich writing style.  That's the perfect answer so far :)
---
I remember an older man with a gnome mage(shazima) and his two sons, a retri pala and warlock named Tengill and kiarha.
---
They raided high end content together in the same guild at Thunderhorn
---
Either the multiple server merge or only layering at level 1-10. Blizzard underestimate how fast people can level that they give us 2 months. Even if you're casual it will take you 3 weeks to get to 60. Dunno why they insist on this shit show
---
yeah the aesthetics and T2 are so good, but I'm going back for the PVP side of the game. being healer wouldn't fly for me : D
---
Wait there is no brewfest?
---
Is it added in TBC?
---
Im not sure in what manner this guy wants to farm (gold/exp?) but chugging major mana potions seems very counter-productive IF he want to farm for gold.
---
Thats pretty cool
---
Expected tho. Well, I guess I'll keep following the balancing status. 
---
Let me check the balance thread.
---
You think that would be better than the 
---
Force Reactive Disk?   I guess it might largely depend on how fast the engineering shield breaks too.
---
You better tell everyone who said that classic is doomed because of layering.
---
Doubtful about Arthas being one of the greatest paladins but agree about Uther.
---
easily the best zone in modern wow
---
hope it will work for you dude, I dread to pvp as ret again because people are way better than they were back then. none is keyboard turning anymore xD
---
It depends where he wants to farm and what he's farming, but that was more a bit of a throwaway section of the comment to point out how little mana a prot paladin has to work with
---
and assaulting SW or Ironforge happens so silently .. right? is not like the only way to get into the cities is though the front gates, where all the dueling happens, and also the alliance won't use the tram to reinforce the cities.
---
If you want to know how is done, simple: you don't have backdoors so you must have 2 groups, one hidden one to attack one of the capitals, once the alliance troops move to reinforce the capital attacked, your hidden main force should attack the other capital. Also hope you don't get discovered
---
Depends on the RL. Ideally you will want to gear players to benefit the raid, not the ego of single players. If it is better for the raid when the Paladin gets the cloth item, the Paladin gets the cloth item. If it's a toss up, the clothie gets it if there's a comparable plate item down the line.
---
human ftw, rep boost is awesome and you don't really need the stoneform that much : )
---
View distance looks great - Can't wait to experience the classic zones with the new graphical settings.
---
That's the wow community for you. We are so full of pessimistic neighsayers it's honestly sad. Remember when death knights were suggested and people laughed. We got them. Remember when pandas were discussed and laughed at. We got those. Demon hunter? Got those. Allied races? Got those. Thinkers? Honestly. We will get those just wait.. So now that we cry about layering they go "Hurr durr it betterzzzz" honestly. Taking a look around you realize how annoying alot of the forums and posts can get when people just say "No" as their only argument and it's gets hundreds of upvotes. Now we have to live with this unless blizzard show any sign of brain.
---
When we got married, there was only MySpace really. Things weren't as bad then.
---
That's awesome lmao! Love these server personalities
---
we’re getting the models and animations as they were in 2006
---
crusader strike and we would be golden dude. if TBC/WOTLK comes, I'd roll ret again, but vanilla ret is hot mess
---
Pugs ... yes, premades .. no
---
That guy has been trolling these threads for a while now. He never can back up his claims so just ignore him like most of us do.
---
&gt; Damn, if only there was way to avoid it. Sucks that you can't not be streamer.
---
Yea, just quit your job LOL, because that's reasonable..
---
yeah, vanilla failed hard with no language based servers for EU... oh wait
---
\#nochanges btw
---
I wish I'd thought to wall mount my printer.
---
Interesting take on the matter. The player-player interaction appeals to me, so I’ll probably be trying out classic first. Thanks for not being super biased and looking at both sides :)
---
Even if it was true, phase 1-3 content is super easy, you can run it with 20 man. Even if it was true, if you try-hard and farm your flask and world buff you will break the dmg meter. Even if it was true most players stays in PVP spec most of the time anyways. Even if it was true, every character have utilities that you need. Blizzard made sure of that. Shadowpriest debuff etc... Even if that was true, once world first then server first is done your looking at 6 months of boring grinding for every guild. But it's far from the truth. There's a weird toxic min-max mentality on thus sub that doesn't exist in classic or pservers. We see bookin and feral and a bunch of not optimal spec in MC and lower tier dungeon all the time. Like I said once worl first and server first is done (two seeks) everyone chill and have fun.
---
agree with everything dude. I'd roll rogue because I want to pvp mainly, but as you said, so many people have the same idea. But it feels even more people will roll a warrior so there's that. I knew tons of hybrids who rolled pure dps in vanilla/tbc and they always said it was worth the time to re-level and re-gear. Blowing shit up is awesome!
---
Consecration on red? This guy never PVP
---
Longer seal red? This guy never PVE
---
Pursuit on white? This guy never played vanilla
---
On the other hand, being able to buy a BiS weapon from the AH now and then helps a lot with level speed. Fresh means working with  quest rewards.
---
and classic will have layering. There are beta testers reporting same or even fasters leveling speed on beta vs private servers
---
Edgysan, I feel the Light coursing through your veins. Don't give in to the vile temptations of BiS and meta, He that seeks to follow the true Light--to follow, not precede it; to follow always, not only when it coincides with his own will; to follow patiently and trustfully, step by step, wherever it may lead--cannot walk in darkness, for he is never without the presence of the Light.
---
^(Roll ret nub)
---
Ah yes, they didn't work on this over the past weeks, at all. They literally saw the posts that originated on saturday and pulled three all nighters back-to-back! That's how programming works :\^)
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ that’s where their confrontational power is most directly noticable. And who the f is going to pay for several accounts NOT to go gank people out of tiny-penis-spite?? Your sarcasm is unjust.
---
Good lord
---
First  5 points should go into combat (gouge and sinister)
---
- longer gouge -&gt; more energy ticks -&gt; easier backstabs.
---
-  sinister to get to the next row and to make the first few levels easier, since each weapon upgrade - dagger or not - is too significant to pass on
---
After that the 20% damage (sub) and 30% critchance (combat). 
---
Remorseless is nice to have, but especially early on I find it hard to use, because I need to refill health between mobs. If you want to use it I recommend picking it up a little bit later down the road and rather go towards the passive 45% critchance first.
---
How is it even a discussion at this point? If Blizzard prioritized the 'accuracy' of animations, everything about classic animations would be retail instead of the stiffer animations of vanilla. Luckily, they don't care about this and already confirmed no modern character models/animations in classic. Thus, this is a bug and needs to be fixed.
---
It's good that you've accepted your fate.
---
this, I feel they over-nerfed ret when launching the game... check google, how many spells paladins had that were removed...
---
Could you start a series with season 1? 
---
If yes..you dont know how to play a rogue.
---
Looking for:
---
**[Horde][PVP][NA]**
---
*High-Population Realm
---
*Serious Raiding
---
*Evening / Late-Night
---
**Availability:**
---
10pm EST / 7pm CST onward (on days I am available, there should be no conflicts once the raid has begun due to personal schedule)
---
I am a first responder in North America, who works nights fourteen days on and fourteen days off a month on a two week rotating basis. The first week, I work: on Mo/Tu, off Wed/Th, on Fri/Sat/Sun. Second week, I work: off Mo/Tu, on Wed/Th, off Fri/Sat/Sun. This repeats every two weeks.
---
With that being said, while I cannot adhere to a standard raiding schedule, I am looking for a guild who is willing to work with me. You will gain a valuable player in return.
---
**Experience:**
---
Vanilla:
---
 *Raided through BWL/ZG/AQ20 with a Dwarf Hunter.
---
The Burning Crusade:
---
	*Hunter: Raided through Tempest Keep / Serpentshrine Cavern (Pre-nerf kills on both Lady Vashj and Kael'thas)
---
	*Warrior: Main tanked 9/9 Black Temple, 5/5 Hyjal, 1/6 Sunwell
---
	*Raid Lead experience: Through SSC/TK, ZA and minimally in t6 content
---
Wrath of the Lich King:
---
	Don't even quite remember, but did play semi casually for some of it and saw an okay amount of content.
---
I am the type of player to be prepared and early for raids. I am willing to put forth more than my fair share of effort to see Vanilla content. Furthermore, I would completely understand being lower on the loot totem pole due to my scheduling conflicts. 
---
I am also interested in willing to play multiple classes to split raid if necessary. I'm mostly interested in playing mage/warrior(tank or fury)/hunter/shaman. I would be willing to make that selection based on guild needs.

I didnt choose the hirde  the horde chose me
---
you on light hopes?
---
Doing every quest in each zone is as far away from efficient you can get while still playing
---
xD horde and paladins, yeeaaa maybe next expa : )     
---
honestly I just want to pvp, doing that on ret is pain in the ass, since people are not that dumb as they used to be back then
---
It’s not, MMOs by their nature are horrible for streaming. Lots of downtime and monotonous questing.
---
The reason streams have been so popular for beta is because basically nobody else is in the beta so streams are the only way to get that fix till launch. I can’t imagine anyone watching someone play Classic once they can play it themselves.
---
Majordomo Executus' monologue after you defeat him and when he summons The Fire lord.
---
They aren’t going to be a serious issue because they are very uncommon and are easily wiped out by a handful of people with sappers
---
Ah, the point of classic is to level as slowly as possible and not enjoy the game in your own way?
---
It had always seem odd to me that you have to drink every pull or two on private server. I don't remember that ever being the case in vanilla pre-20
---
&gt; Doing every quest in each zone is as far away from efficient you can get while still playing
---
you see on the map what level are the mobs for the quests. you do the quest close to your level and change zones when they get too high. Seriously leveling in WoW vanilla is not a science. You do the green and yellow quest and wait for the orange. You need questie or pfquest but having the guide is useless.
---
Everything works as coded, by definition lol
---
Ambush is bad for pve. First of all, you wouldn't be able to ambush every mob you fight. They will constantly unstealth you. And when you will ambush then, ambush won't do enough damage to kill mob fast enough. 
---
Sub talents will be good only after 30-ish levels. Before that, you better play combat. 
---
And, by the way, if you going to duo level with tank, you should better try backstab build. It's like ambush, but a lot less steath-dependent and allow to do more dps. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMxc0xZGcZV

---
We've been using this for years now, I have a little Linux VM that I spin up and we all connect to it.
---
They sure are. Exactly why you won’t ever see one in a pve server. My point being all along..
---
Compared to only demonstrated 100% blizzlike experience pservers
---
You have to understand that people looked at that animation for hundreds and hundreds of hours while playing and while watching videos - it's become a part of the experience of playing a rogue. And isn't that what classic is supposed to be about? Or is it about new people coming in and creating their 2.0 version of it?
---
PRIDE HERALDS THE END OF YOUR WORLD. COME, MORTALS! FACE THE WRATH OF THE SOULFLAYER!
---
Skeletons used to stay around for really freaking long from what I remember. It definitely adds to the world building which is what vanilla is all about. Please do put it back, Blizzard!
---
 How did they prove anything? Care to give an actual example? Because so far we saw only terribly bugged game.
---
 What minor stuff are you talking about, there are major game breaking bugs all over the place and people havent even stepped into high level content. 
---
 how private servers managed to fix issues? Maybe they have more resources lol ?
---
It’s funny because he’s tweeted that he’s probably not streaming at the start of classic and keeping his character name hidden like he’s done before for private server launches, but you don’t know anything other than streamer = bad dumb man!
---
Woah man, chill :) I was j/k. I think your video is nice since it’s showcasing that waking is working as intended! 
---
Take care!
---
Play with the horde friend on one server and the alliance friends on another
---
And all the kids think classic will be the best thing that ever happen in gaming history. Can't wait to have their dream shattered when they realize WoW is just a big and long grind fest.
---
The idea is to farm gold when not raiding.  I don't see why I would want to go deep into the prot tree.   I was thinking maybe something like 30/21.
---
Maybe something like this, 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/0550312152105-050151035001
---
Sounds like a really fun idea to me!
---
Yeah, most of the lore is not even near the raids. Like, if you really search for it some dwarves around other zones might talk a bit about some of the things here and there, but overall they left out too much. I don't want the retail version where they overdone it and made it feel like it is a movie about other characters, but adding some more NPC's you can talk with would have been great. For example there could be a quest chain revolving around Ironforge and the dwarves to flesh out the story of Ragnaros.
---
The subscription covers both games but to play the newest expansion you also need to buy it. I'd say start off with Classic since you only have to pay sub to play it and later down the line you can buy and try out the new expansion. Because if you happen to not like Classic, which the better version according to the majority of the community, then theres no point in even buying the new expansion.
---
same here, i am a german and played on several pservers through the last couple of years. ended up in a mainly englishspeaking guild with a swedish leader. i never had a problem, people adapt and get together on the language they share in those cases.
---
shoutout to numilock haha
---
You're missing the fact that it's not like it was in Vanilla. Why not upgrade models into new ones aswell, as some might consider them looking better?
---
Yeah same, my main and main alts have always been Horde, and will be again. But my first character was a Nelf, and I'll definitely roll another Nelf or two at some point, even if all I do is level through Teldrassil.
---
Where did he say he would be using 7 on his keyboard?

[**Patch 2.2.2**](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.2.2) **(2007-10-02):** Added.
---
So you're upset because people complained and gave feedback about a system that was being tested?
---
Spyeyes
---
I remember him well. I played Alliance PVP premades on SSE and we were never scared of anyone. But having Tsar, Ashen etc on your team helped a lot.
---
Sinar/Syranndyr were both better than him tho and NE
---
I really hope they don't scrap layering all together it was a good idea for handling the start.. really should be in 1-20 zones only or at least give us crazy dynamic spawns at the start like priv servers do.
---
except they’re not 100% blizzlike.
---
I can empathise actually. I want to play a Priest again, but I don't want to go through the same hassle I had to go through in vanilla simply because I don't like Dwarves. This will be exacerbated by the fact that every guide points out how only Dwarves are viable on Alliance side and that you shouldn't accept any other race.
---
On one hand I don't want to play Horde because the community is generally more laid back/friendlier on Alliance side. On the other hand, that race requirement...
---
What we learn from this? That the "my buddy wants to play with me" is the biggest fun killer in every game design. Factions back then, layering now.
---
Don't forget the real bonding tends to take place in dungeons and not so much during questing in the world ;-)
---
And by that time layering may have been seriously reduced already.
---
tanaris will kill you both
---
I dont see any info about Classic port from creator
---
Repentance 20 yards.
---
That's what I thought.
---
How viable are rogues without the big CDs?
---
If the animations are more important to you than how the game actually works, then classic is probably not the game for you.
---
If you have no experience your best bet is to use Joana's guide. Just keep in mind that some quests/routes that he recommends may not be optimal for you, for example some quests become a lot less efficient when there are tons of players competing for something. 
---
So, use Joana's guide but remain flexible and don't get stubborn about following it 100%.
---
&gt;Don't worry, I shit on every private server poster on this sub equally whenever I catch them in the act.
---
Damn that's sad
---
As a fury warrior during TBC this hurts me to my soul, but isn't shocking!
---
Why not? Can you actually explain why its not for me or do you just get off from gatekeeping?
---
Think of it like an actual world. What would you say the plot of Earth is? It doesn't have one because it follows many many narratives and hundreds of characters. (Billions in our case)
---
I'll be using my new ultrawide 1440p monitor along with "modded lightning" I suppose. Was a post here recently how to do it but currently on mobile so cant link
---
I hope everyone with beta logins and send in bug report today, so they get flooded and proiritize skeleton spawn rate 😊 streamers dont report bugs..
---
Thanks for the advice! I never knew the sub covered both, that’s actually pretty nice of blizzard to do
---
Cat is for fite!
---
You can tank 5 mans as Fury without issues. I've tanked everything including UBRS on my Fury Warrior alt back then, just like you can heal as Shadow. It's just the raids that require you to actually spec for your role to maximise performance during progress.
---
In an empty world, sure. Do you think it'll be empty?
---
I think a backstab build is probably the best in-between you could do.
---
If you try and mix PvP and PvE talents you're going to find that you're kind of lackluster at both and it is super frustrating. Thats my experience anyway. 
---
I would either go backstab build, go full combat and accept that I might lose some duels, or go full burst PvP spec and just accept that I'm going to level a bit slower.
---
?
---
I actually didn't know this. I don't know what Crusader Strike and Holy Strike is, but considering we now have the first on retail it is probably something like that. That is actually exactly the kind of stuff I think they need. Crusader Strike could be a low CD filler with Holy Strike being their high damage ability (like a warriors Mortal Strike). That would honestly be enough to make me play a ret pala.
---
It's funny to see the old talents as well, with Blessings of Kings being the last talent in ret. If only they had kept that it might have given ret a spot in raids. Sure only one is needed, but it would still be an improvement.
---
Thanks for the sites, ill check em out
---
The main problem with private servers is that they use dynamic respawns which is great when you're leveling in the "zerg" of players concentrated within a certain level range, but once you out-level that group of players you gain a huge advantage by being able to grind a lot of very fast respawning mobs with little to no competition. This especially benefits Mage AoE.
---
Another thing to keep in mind is when those times were recorded. Private servers were mistakenly using TBC exp values up until about 2-3 years ago when it was discovered and fixed.
---
As far as weapon and shield go, the absolute BIS is Edward the odd with life steal and Skullflame shield with a spike.  
---
Id skip Holy shield because its kinda ’meh’  spend the mana on conc. 
---
There also a trinket from Rag with fire thorns damage and ofcourse nagelring with 3 thorns damage. 
---
There is also a chest that has a 5% chance to steal health from the attacker. 
---
And theres that trinket that reduces damage taken by like 20, which is pretty crazy when you already have high armor and blessing of Sanc.  
---
Id look up the names in more detail - but im on mobile.  
---
Ofcourse while leveling 55+ in sorrow hill, these items arent NEEDED, but the ones you can get would help - Skullflame being the number 1 prio.
---
Boulderfist was my first ever server, ally side in vanilla.
---
Layers should collapse in phase 1 anytime there are less than 3k people online too.
---
Force react loses durabilty with each proc. 
---
Skullflame is super BIS.
---
Dude that was an NPC.
---
or that's just how you remember it from 14 years ago?
---
Thunderfury is just 100 arcanite bars.
---
The initial day lots of people will rush like crazy, so you might experience people ignoring you or outright refusing to help you. They're rushing after all, so no time to help you wit ha quest. However, on the second day, those rushers will have leveled way past you and the people at your level will be more helpful as they don't rush either. Just keep this in mind ;-)
---
Don’t worry - we have The hinterlands. Just don’t mind the trolls
---
You have no clue wtf u r talking about.
---
Fitting username.
---
If you watch Monkeynews he got pretty good at reliably proccing Enrage.
---
I've been seeing people mentioning "change the layer" like to avoid ganks or reset nodes. Is this actually a thing? With layering, can we the players force swap from layer to layer somehow?
---
Remember when nearly everyone on this sub said "I'd rather have to wait an hour in a queue than have the experience ruined by sharding"?
---
Apparently it's ok if you just call it something else.
---
If you're going for daggers/wpvp/duo leveling something like this might work
---

---
Not optimal but could provide good fun. Big backstab crits, imp sprint with lower cooldown and cold blood for some wpvp fun!
---
What do you mean in time for Phase 2 ? Phase 2 of the already released classic or what ?
---
This shit better be fixed in time for damn release...
---
I can do 12 hours a day easy and i’ll get my little brother to grind a few hours each day. Blizz says its cool so im going to make the most of that/
---
Arthas did nothing wrong. Ner'zhul killed Uther using an arthas meat puppet.
---
I think the footage was older and it was fixed by blizzard recently
---
Seems pretty weak, unless it scales with +Dmg
---
Yep, by accepting a group invite from a friend on another layer, for example.
---
Travistt- Dragonblight 
---
He was the first Tauren warrior I saw with Valor shoulders and a Draconic Deflector. 
---
I C O N I C.
---
I didn't mean classic was going to fail because of it but it's definitely because they don't have faith it's going to be a success
---
It's about 3-5% lower lol, there's no reason to reroll over it.
---
Don't you have to kill another raid boss for materials midway through?
---
Otherwise that questline sounds amazing, that would be a cool final goal for my hunter since I doubt I'll do any raiding past MC
---
Ah that's funny because recent WSG tournaments showed the exact opposite. Better team wins, no matter the faction. Paladin or not changes nothing. Besides, it's every healers' job to purge every buffs from the warrior during the initial middle brawl.
---
If he has had a race/faction change, the data disappears or doesn't update. This happened to my rogue
---
Your spec doesn't help you as much as you'd think for world PvP. The power for rogues comes from killing mobs as quickly as possible to maintain stealth as much as you can. Being healthy and stealthed will win you a 1vs1 in the world more often than improved kick or something would.
---
I remember doing that questline when on my very first character and being blown away at HAVING to join forces with other players or else get rekt. Damn that area was confusing af to navigate as well
---
The sound could likely be added but the texture is not part of GUI so I doubt it could be changed.
---
YOU NO TAKE CANDLE!!

There she finally is! Everything went well, we couldn't be happier 😁

---
Yes it does.
---
Real question why is the bow one of the coolest looking weapons in the game and the staff is just the druid starting weapon with an ugly green glow? I guess they used all the modeling time on the bow?
---
They’re closing on their own
---
Classic settings on max.
---
Nope
---
If you're in holy gear then this is probably not worth the effort, you'll have little survivability.
---
The reason I mentioned mana pots is because if you're pulling decent sized packs (IE not pulling 2 mobs to AoE) then you're gonna go oom mid fight. 
---
Blessing of sanctuary would be core for Paladin AoE farm tanking, trying it without it is like going Ret and expecting to tank. It contributes very nicely nicely to your survivability, if you don't want holy shield then that's up to you but I would suggest that too.
---
I also notice your spec has no righteous fury talents? Your poor pocket healer!

Even in a super packed world you get honored with your faction super early. Skipping all the quests that are too hard with many people doesn't hurt that much, as long as you are not just doing a fedex run or something.
---
This shit is gettin out of hand
---
I guess, but I didn't really bother mentioning them since there will probably be less than 10 people per server who hit 60 in under 5 days.
---
&gt;I've managed 39 hours and 12 minutes on the Classic Beta, using PServer routes, with a Rogue.
---
You do understand that during Classic Launch you won't be getting anywhere near 39 hours and 12 minutes right? Classic Beta is fucking dead compared to Classic Launch.
---
There is no pocket healer....  I am doing it solo.

The known issue of hunter/warlock's pet that would somehow stuck and not follow your pet attack command seems get fixed today. I have not countered any pet stuck issues today and the buddy in guild also find that their pets are working as intended as well.
---
I may actually do that for 1 slot. Pick a highly wanted name (if it's still there) and wait until people are established and are interested in creating alts/twinks.
---
Names like "Frosty", "Ice", "Blade" and "Deadshot" will be worth a lot of gold then.

I'm looking for a casual guild to do dungeons and , whenever possible, raid with. I'm an ex hardcore player , I took an arrow to my schedule and now I'm busy most days of the week, drowning in work. I usually have Mondays off and will use to try and catch up and play with everyone . I will main Mage and have a healer ALT (still haven't chosen). I don't mind being a casual or social member. Thank you for reading , if you need any extra info please just ask
---
You can find huge lists with a simple search. Just **don't** type "vanilla" macros as it will show you the old macro formats with /script etc where as Classic will be using modern macro architecture.
---
No need. Most of the big ones will shut down themselves. It won't be a profitable model once classic hits.
---
Where's the Thorns coming from....
---
More importantly though, this flat out will not be feasible on high level mobs at all if you're trying it solo as a holy paladin.

well they are two diffrent games... vanilla is a true mmorpg where u need to talk with players levling is loong and hard but end game is pretty easy (u need alot of time but not alot of skill) classes are simple most specs only use 2-3 spells (or one)
---
there are not that many rewards but they feel very good
---
retail is like the opposite
---
ez levling doesnt go that long, end game content can get a challenge, classes are more complex (or at least have high skillcap), u get alot of rewards but they dont feel meaningfull, nobody talks to each other and many people are very toxic leave groups etc (u can avoid that point by finding a good guild)

The best thing about reading all of these comments is that when u read the sentence I can actually hear it in my mind. That's the true power of classic, a warm blanket in the middle of winter.
---
For a build with consecration, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5zsDGafjGo) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkZjEml6GU) is probably not bad.
---
Someone linked [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxZVGxcczxZV0xxbb) spec yesterday for leveling when consecration is too expensive.
---
35 damage life steal and 126 aoe damage = weak? 
---
Maybe with 1 mob at a time.  But you are pulling 6-10. Its going off constantly. 
---
Its always been known to be the best AOE shield. Unless you want to spend the gold you grind on repairing your Engineering shield every few procs.
---
Don't forvet to also nuture your Mountain Dew addiction so that your body does not go into shock once classic hits.
---
It is hell of a lot more reasonable than expecting everyone else cater to your needs because you act like entitled spoiled brat. It works everywhere else, if you don't like some aspects of the job maybe the job is not for you. But for some reason when it comes to streamers the entire world has to take make sure they never experience any problems.
---
best music I ever heard
---
&gt;World's fastest 60 is 3 days and 7 hours of /played on a fresh server.
---
Fresh servers I've played on are nothing like Classic launch will be. Mobs were literally respawning every second in the crowded zones which lets skilled players get ahead of the pack way easier.
---
Just go play on a french server, see how you like it.
---
Kind of like when you see people saying "everyone hates layering, everyone would prefer long queues"
---
If you join a group with someone on a different layer, you change to theirs. Also, if you log out and back in, you may be placed in a different layer.
---
It's not that people don't want to play with people from other countries, that's guaranteed on european servers. It's just that some nations still have poor english skills. They use the general chat, trade chat etc in their native languages.
---
Well to be honest, 17 hours play time a day leaves you with 7 hours of sleep. I would really deduct that 30 min run, shower and healthy breakfast + other meals from the 17 hours playtime and not the 7 hours sleep. That will probably put you at 14-15 hours/day and keep it somewhat doable.
---
I can understand doing that for a week, which will be pretty heavy, but for an entire month might not be realistic. Even if doing this for a month straight works out for you, how will you be arriving at your job when it's over? You'd probably underperform for atleast the first week, which is pretty hard to explain after you've just had a month of free time! lol 
---
my point being, be realistic and honest to yourself so that the month of play and your life afterwards won't be utter shit.
---
Uhm, I never said that ? Suggest much ? They are just all crying about a problem that is not really there and easily avoidable. If they want to be famous streamer \*surprise\* you will be famous and people will be everywhere around you. Some people like that some don't and if they don't like it they can easily go do something else where they won't get so much attention.
---
Never said anything against it, I don't care what the player brings. But parses show mages are ahead 20-30% of Warlocks in most fights.
---
Won't work. You can't put consumables on a 1 button macro. You need to manage your mana and you need to time ability use right.
---

I fucking love Nagrand, used to fly it for hours farming and never got old, those tasty tasty ores
---
No idea what he said, don't follow him. But someone mentioned that he will not be streaming. Sounds like a reasonable thing to do if you want to just play in peace.
---
He could just do that but that would not git him the attention he craves so of course there will be 10 videos about how everyone is against him and how people are just the worst.
---
Damage taken when striking another target is called thorns damage.  
---
Going prot makes no sense.  Theres nothing worth getting past 21 pts.  Using a ton of prot gear other than +Block makes no sense.

Healing is and always will be the most fun thing to do. You are literally god. You choose if people die or live. I don't see how you can trade this for some damage or be spanked all day (unless it's your kink I'm not kink shaming no one).
---
That said, there's plenty of tribalism in EVE. Even the more hardcoded faction warfare system has a lot of loyalists despite there being options to switch factions.
---
They're very different games though and WoW would need to be significantly different to allow for that.
---
Thank you Pluff, but I think I already decided I want to spend the first 24h+ I'll level playing something that does well in PVP. Sadly war/rogue (and others) are way better. People are not that dumb as they used to be.    
---
   
---
Maybe when the time comes, I'll choose the righteous path once more. But to slay the enemy, I have to be stronger.    
---
^(Also the Light comes in TBC/WOTLK, until then the ret dps is like wet noodle.)
---
they're using a lot from the current engine it seems. its like classic special edition. meh i'll live with it.

**&lt;BANISH&gt; [A] EU PVP English**
---
**&gt;Schedule&lt;**
---
Raid Times: Tue/Thu/Sun 19:00-23:00 (CET) + Wed on BWL/AQ/Naxx releaseday.
---
**&gt;About Us&lt;**
---
Banish is one of the oldest and longest running private server vanilla raiding guilds – It was founded in 2015 on Nostalrius and is still active on horde Lightbringer now. Over the last four years we have accumulated an active community of the most dedicated and experiences players the vanilla wow scene has to offer. We pride ourselves for our warm atmosphere where people enjoy logging on for more than just killing bosses.
---
**&gt;Experience and Achievements&lt;**
---
With over 59 recorded Kel’Thuzad kills we are arguably the most experienced vanilla guild out there. We are:
---
Clearing MC since September 2015
---
Clearing BWL since January 2016
---
Killing world bosses weekly since March 2017
---
Clearing AQ since June 2017
---
Clearing Naxx since January 2018
---
**&gt;Goals/Expectations&lt;**
---
On release we expect most people to get raid-ready in a timely manner, but acknowledge the social commitments of our members who are unable to do so. From phase three (BWL) onward we will aim for first week, if not first day clears (we will add a Wednesday raid on content releases). After progression we will reclear weekly and cut down on raidtime where possible.
---
To achieve our goals we expect everyone to: - be dedicated and motivated, during and after progression - have full knowledge of raid mechanics and intricacies before entering - bring full consumables, no matter what - have a mature and respectful attitude

Never played healer.

If you have a friend to hold aggro, leveling as ambush/backstab daggers would be tons of fun. You’ll want slower daggers with high weapon damage. Here’s a good [foundation](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005-3023-05005003), build around it with talents you like. In all of Warcraft there’s nothing else as fun as two-shotting some cloth wearer, imo. This would be a more difficult build if you were leveling solo, but with a Druid partner it’ll work well.
---
People strongly recommend swords for a very good reason, though. The Sword of Serenity/Vanquisher’s Sword combo from SM and RFD quests leads neatly into the overpowered Thrash Blade. Combat is also pretty good in PvP, as you’re able to pick up improved sprint or riposte along the way to deal with the matchups you dislike. Chance to hit is a valuable talent for any spec.
---
Play whatever seems the most fun to you. Rogues are great no matter how they’re built.
---
screw u hippy
---
I just love how so many people genuinely still think they can speak for others :D
---
If there was a toggle, I would.
---
Agreed. 
---
Just try not to add or remove spell or anything.
---
But add some flat Dmg or defense. I think that will do.
---
I hope they use the old combat text and since they are not using the old combat text that is imo a visual bug (the old combat text is seriously vastly superior to the new combat text)
---
Yeah, they have truly fucked up by importing 15 years worth of progress of arms race against hackers, exploiters and their ilk to Vanilla experience.
---
I would go with Druid/Paladin/Priest combo. Otherwise you will waste too much good gear and will compete with each other for drop. 
---
You can go with the Paladin tanking, the druid goes feral but can always switch to bear and throw a taunt when necessary or toss a heal here and there. The priest can go shadow for out in the world questing, but still heal fine through all lower level dungeons.
---
That's well advice. Now that i read over i'll give myself that extra hour of sleep. 15 hours a day is still a great amount of time. I am gonna be fucked either way as i work 10 hour night shift and im gonna try to switch myself back over to normal person hours for this month
---
I don't think that a raiding spot is their top priority. 
---
It's a valid point, but not everybody wants to raid.
---
not really but there is a community project from german, french, spain and russian players to choose on wich server those ppl go
---
Good point, looks like we actually have to put in effort.
---
He did this in Wotlk and wants to do it again in classic....
---
completely agree, ret got gutted too much and I remember playing in vanilla and feeling "oh my, I sure hope this stuff changes, I sure hope ret gets some love" but fast forward, I know now the wotlk was the "fix"  ret needed. and since I know the history, I'd be a fool rolling ret again when I KNOW warrior/rogue does way better. Also ret will get shat on by other DPSers for taking their gear, for obvious reasons.    
---
pre-live vanilla ret was awesome, I'm still sad to this day they removed so many spells, but I guess they were in such hurry that they just overdid it, as they always do
---
If you care more about the look of the game than the actual gameplay you're probably better off playing bfa.
---
Haha, I read it. Now I understand a bit.
---
I think some of them make sense.
---
Changing some part will actually affect the entire system.
---
It is so called 'butterfly effect' right.  That, I can promise, no one want it :)
---
VanCleef pay BIG for your heads!
---
Hey man, I will be doing something similar just with cousins.
---
I mailed druid in vanilla, and even so, I would just take one, as class variety makes for a far stronger group.  
---
We are going to run Warrior, Priest, and are debating druid/paladin/shaman for the third.
---
I'm usually a horde player. Played classic up until cata and stopped my wow days.
---
I will be coming back to wow and I was gonna roll an undead mage until my friend who's guild played a lot on private servers are playing alliance and I have been given a spot in their raid team.
---
Alliance it is.
---
To be fair it will be a nice change to see a different perspective. Done horde. Might as well do alliance.  So I'm not to bothered.
---
I will always have horde in the heart though.
---
King's honour, friend.
---
^(Yea you're right, I hope to do TBC ret once more)
---
I have the finest wares in the land!
---
It was pretty clear you were kidding, I’m just being silly. Have a good one, friend.
---
Unless you’re a key turner.
---
hmm I should get a brother too, how long until they are capable of farming BGs? lul
---
Yeah I agree with most tbh. It will be avalanche if you touch it.
---
mana costs / mana pool ratio  is so fucking terrible in vanilla
---
thats why i love TBC more
---
I remember when a friend of mine got into the game shortly after I did he desperately wanted to play an orc. I was full blue-blooded Alliance but I decided it was better to play with my friend than my faction. So I left my night elf in the dust to roll Horde with him.
---
He ended up quitting the game after a couple of months and so I wasted hours on a character I didn't even like for the sake of a friend. Last time I ever let someone else influence the way I want to play the game.
---
Ah, balance :)
---
I'll just RP as a warrior, then roll paladin and be like "OMFG I FOUND LIGHT YET AGAIN, HAHA FITS LORE COZ WARRIOR WITH LIGHT IS PALADIN"  or some BS to make me sleep at nights
---
Bold move Cotton, let's see if it works out
---
How many fingers do y'all have to *never* have to spell click?
---
I will calm you down with an intellectual message: The hype before the storm is better than the gaming experience
---
Thorns is a Druid spell, when you say Thorns in here you're naming a spell so there's obvious misunderstandings to be had there.
---
What do you mean it makes no sense to use a ton of prot gear, if you're trying to AoE tank you will need the defence stat for your survivability or else you'll die quicker than you can DPS. 
---
It sounds like you haven't played Classic before is that correct? If I'm honest it sounds like you're coming from another MMO completely when I take into account the term "Thorns damage" being used for AoE tanking but I admit that may be a term used in retail nowadays. (I'm not asking this to deter you but to help)
---
The whole point of the build is to be kind of self sufficient though. If leveling with a tank backstab build would be superior for sure!
---
Both are good for PVP, but Undead is better, WOTF is just amazing and escape artist isnt really that important for mage (still good though). For PvE it doesnt really matter tbh (15% int vs wotf for some encounters). The strongest PvE pick is Troll with berzerking.
---
I'm sorry, i though the topic is Alliance vs Horde, not Team A vs Team B. Ofcourse the better team will win, put equally skilled teams and the alliance will have the slight advantage. 
---
In the initial brawl you will have a gnome warrior pushing your ranks, 1-2 mages creating chaos with AoE and sheeps, one of them behind a BoP, maybe a hunter draining, CCing, slowing, trapping. It's not as straight forward as all healers purge BoF, FaP and once done we win. And all this happens while the paladin is immune to EVERYTHING for 12 seconds (maybe 11 due to GCDs). 
---
I really wish the shaman was as strong, as it's the class i resonate the most with and i like.
---
Since there aren't that many people on the beta it obviously has to be way lower for them to have a chance to test it.
---
what is /s? 
---
I am sort of new to reddit
---
Not that, I just don't want to fight orcs. Also ud is better than orc for rogue.
---
"LAYERING HAS GOT TO GO DUDE, IT'S GOT TO GO. IT'S GOT TO GO DUDE, THIS SHIT HAS GOOOOT TO GO DUDE" is hardly feedback. Most of the threads about layering had plenty of comments about it ruining the entire game, not a lot of it was constructive at all.
---
But BFA looks like shit? I specifically love exactly how classic looks, nothing else.
---
**&lt;Legacy&gt; | US PVE| Alliance | NA |**
---
Intro: Legacy is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from first timers to boss kills in Nax. We are semi hardcore with a twist in that we are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role.
---
**Who do we want?**
---
Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn’t always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
**What roles are in current demand?**
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for dps at the moment, especially warriors/rogues/mages
---
**Misc:**
---
Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT)
---
* Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even  
---
those with little interest in raiding).
---
* World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases.
---
* Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---
**How to join?**
---
https://discord.gg/YSwVxBK  
---
 . Feel free to ask any questions/contact us either in discord or through this post.
---
Just stream-snipe leveling enthusiasts during launch (2 monitors prefered)
---
Imp stealth is too good to not skill
---
12 years it seems, a bot would be cheaper :p
---
Ovi Warrior R14 on Emerald Dream US.
---
Ming, watched the shit out of him taught me Hemo love.
---
some people are stupid and cannot spot sarcasm so you put /s in your comment to make sure they know it was a joke. that way, they understand you didn't want to be mean but you wanted to make a funny comment.    
---
example: *you are stupid for not knowing what /s is, please delete your account... also your mom is fat*  /s
---
I havn't really found it that difficult to get my remorseless on the next mob. Maybe if they mobs are really far apart, but otherwise I tend to be able to bandage for 10s before moving on to the next mob, if neccessary.
---
How the hell is this post a top one on controversial list on CLASSIC subreddit? Retailers really infested this sub. How sad.
---
PVP for sure I think. As well as that I think the most viewed clips will be dungeon drop reactions, ninja loots, PVP montages.
---
The more charismatic personalities will be able to maintain an audience by chatting during crafting/grinding/questing I reckon.
---
My plan is to play it for 2-3 hours a day, maybe a bit more early on.
---
I don't know which class I'm going to play. Can' really decide between Druid, Mage, Priest and Warrior.
---
Maybe I'll even play all of them in parallel to make use of rested-XP.
---
I have like... two months, fuck dude xD but tbh, not sure I'd want to bot and risk getting banned lul
---
Hey asmon
---
It sounds like you are clueless.
---
The leveling speed will heavily depend on how layering is implemented. If layer hopping will be as easy as it is now I can see a sub 3 day played record happening with either AoE grinding or general hunter leveling and abusing layers as much as possible.
---
Joana said he is confident he can break his record with new routes by just regular speed leveling. 
---
On the beta we've also seen that you can go into a dungeon with 4 mages and a warlock pull the entire instance with eye of kilrog and aoe it down although they had engineering and BiS gear for 30 when they started to go to 40 which obviously people won't have on release.
---
If constant whining is against the rules we can shut this sub down.
---
Victim blaming?
---
I'm gonna get you ya gnome
---
If you play on their server on purpose, you are kind of a fanboy too arent you? :D
---
You only need honored with 1 faction for your discount.  That should be easy to get before 20.
---
Wow Affenjungs, schon ewig den Namen nicht mehr gehört
---
Ulyima Online had that with Buccaneers Den.  The city with no guards where red PKs could go.
---
If people roll on the streamer servers on purpose, kinda makes it feel like people care about streamers :D
---
never
---
since 2004
---
yes
---
US
---
2004
---
still no inv to classic beta :(
---
oooh oke thank you :D
---
We reformed our RP-PvP wPvP oriented guild we have back in vanilla until 2011. We're going to do wPvP from day 1 as a group of \~30 seasoned wPvP enthusiasts, half of them being originally in the guild between 2005 and 2010 !
---
What would you drop for it then? Imp poisons/cold blood perhaps?
---
I don't really care about factions as a gameplay mechanic but from story point of view it's an atrociously terrible factor. They will be in eternal cycle of coming together for greater good, then going to war again. Neither of the factions can't ever "win" because of gameplay reasons. You can't piss of half of the playerbase by making one side lose.
---
Interest ya in a pint?
---
And their haters, just as toxic
---
Is this the whacko gamer gate dev?
---
bUt iF It waSn'T iN vAniLla tHEn iT's NoT gOoD gaME dEsIGn #nochanges
---
Real talk, an MMO without updates will simply die out. If blizzard intends on not updating the game post naxx, then they're basically releasing a game with a predetermined expiration date.
---
We actually had one of those.
---
That's probably due to the batching window being so massive that you can easily do that, should they reduce the batch window it still should be possible but less reliable.
---
Or be on a PvE server.
---
That's what the PvE option is for.
---
Complaining about layering was the right thing to do. Saying that layering should be removed no matter what for launch based on the beta, not so much.
---
You can keybind sit/stand in the keybinds menu.
---
Awesome! I'm glad they listened.
---
he never expected that, holy shit you are salty.
---
Had a paladin in classic and TBC ,and TBC felt so much better for healing so some reason imho
---
Why would you want to use a worst program? xD   
---
I love classic too but this nostalgia is getting out of hand
---
You forget the gearing process of warrior which require alot of rare items to farm combined with expensive boe (expect 3k+ gold for fury pre bis for example). And if you don't bother getting gear, you will be last on the dps list.
---
The hate is strong in you, do you hate working your 9 to 5 scrubbing toilets?
---
You're a gnome though, a gnome!
---
&gt; And if you don't bother getting gear, you will be last on the dps list.
---
So like everyone else...
---
I just started watching him and he’s very interesting. 
---
He admits to, and looks like, he doesn’t shower for days. Admitting he sometimes just doesn’t brush his teeth. 
---
Wears the same clothes day after day. 
---
Admits to buying the cheapest clothes possible at thrift shops
---
Eats like absolute shit. 
---
Lives in a shithole with trash all around himself
---
Says he never checks his bank account, and that he could make a ton more cash if he claimed his own videos on YouTube and/or just made the clips himself
---
Like, part of me wants to think it’s all an act, but he lives the act 12 hours a day so... maybe it’s a mental issue
---
I was planning on going druid until the post here uncovering that private servers have had druid base damage set too high.  They’re passable but not optimal in that setting if you put in way more work than other DPS based classes.  With base auto attack damage bring a fair chunk lower on Classic, I don’t see them being truly viable.  You’ll probably need to find a guild that doesn’t mind bringing the snow flake players like shadow priest, Moonkin, Ret Paladin, etc.
---
Like I do in privates. Get ahead of the pack then at around 45+ you will only see dedicated players and join the one who schedule fits better.
---
I was 23 days played to 60. saw everything did everything
---
By fire be purged!
---
You are so jealous about the attention you get, its incredibly pathetic. You dont know the streamer you said you dont follow or watch him, yet you think you know the kind of person he is. Tone down the cringe why dont you
---
MVP right here
---
I’m going to play on us realm from uk
---
There is no point here. If you don't support troll specs you are an evil min/maxer that is ruining wow classic!
---
RAH We’re under attack!
---
Avast ye swabs
---
REPEL the invaders
---
I quote this on drunken game nights with my broskis, good times
---
Says the guy who plays Elite Dangerous that has basicly 0 content.
---
Nah that's Mark Kern? Firefall guy
---
You can reach Q E R T 1 2 3 4 5 Z X C V B F G all comfortably with your fingers on the WASD setup. Now, set up a second set of hotkeys for those 16 but with Shift + Q, etc. Now you have 32 hotkeys. If you need more, then do the same thing with ctrl + Q. There's never a good reason to spell click unless you're just learning a class and unsure what each icon does at first.
---
Same for LW?
---
Thank you!!!
---
This would be really really fun for all of the reasons you mentioned.  Pushing your limits and 60 and seeing what all you can clear should be fun to.
---
Try and set a goal of clearing UBRS with just you 3.  Would be epic as hell if you could pull it off!
---
I love the creativity! It prolongs the game experience past just hitting 60 and getting biS gear.
---
Azjol-Nerub hell yeah. I remember KoV fondly as an alliance player lol. Only people I really remember is Grimgore, Gromit and Seemos. For Alliance there was this one Grand Marshal NE warrior I'd see all the time but i can't remember his name.
---
If you have 7-8 keybinds you can just recycle those with alt, shift and control. Tadaa now you have 24 keybinds
---
Lol, they are gonna announce the server they play on, dont play on that server problem solved. Dont need to spend time making a list lol
---
That can't be right! the sky is falling, hunters are doomed, wow is doomed etc etc
---
Alliance have gnomes Horde doesn't have gnomes.  
---
Therefore Alliance &gt; Horde
---
DAoC and its 3 factions and 3 unique homelands was awesome tbh
---
Judging on some vids I've seen from beta test, the whole sit and stack still works and can result in some crazy 1 shots.
---
You are pathetic, you could play on a different server but you choose to play on the same server to ruin their day, how do you not see how utterly cringy that is? Is this what you waited 13 years for? To mess with streamers, get a life my man.
---
I don't understand why Blizzard even changed the way player skeletons worked in modern.  They worked in 2004 but we have to reduce the time they stay on the ground in 2019 because the game now can't handle it for some reason?
---
Player skeletons used to stay until (i think) the weekly server reset, and if not that at least they stayed until the daily reset.  And no matter how many times you died, your old skeletons would stay.  Now if you die a few times your old skeletons begin to get removed, but why???
---
Even in BG's, which last such a short amount of time, player skeletons no longer last the whole match, they get removed as more and more people die.
---
I was checking out some old footage I had of WSG and the ground was just littered with skeletons.  You don't ever see [anything like this](https://gfycat.com/phonynippyandalusianhorse) in modern WoW.
---
Yeah because my fantasy was always to be dead or be a cow or have huge back and posture problems!
---
Whats important is to get all your bodily needs from food, and not just upper food like sugars and carbs or energy drinks, it helps with performance tbh but you will experience severe mood swings when u run out of fuel and u can collapse if u keep refueling. Not recommended for a long period of time, and totally unhealthy for longevity. So what you need is simple, healthy fats, some carbs, french fries not a top option xD some protein, fibre and all other minerals and vitamins found in veggies and fruits. Ofc, dont forget the most important, hydration, 2 to 3 liters a day, aka a cup every 1.5 hours.
---
Eggs cheese and a sandwich is decent breakfast and dinner, prep some veggies with it, simple wash and cut lettuce or carrot or something because u need the nutrient and fibre. Lunch u can online order a delivery tbh, u need a nice hot meal, or u can prep beforehand meal portion as u said, for 4 to 5 lunches, slap them in the fridge or freezer and just cook them for 5 10 mins. Get bananas, wonderous marathon food. Go with energy drinks and sugar snacks on launch tbh, u need the sugar to pull away from the pack.
---
I managed 2nd lvl 80 warlock on stormscale eu, high populated server and for the 1st warlock title, was beaten by paragons main 5 man dungeon spamming group by about 5 hours. I didnt really stick with the diet above, but I probably wouldnt go through that depressing shit again
---
Gj blizz
---
this is the perfect example of people never being happy lol, we get the whole old world back and you complain there's no grizzly hills ....damn
---
This is awesome, Hopefully this means they will fix the strafing animation bug as well because that looks horrendous. ALso give 1.12 skeletons/corpse mechanics
---
Why in the fuck would a 12 year old even want to be "good guy" It's the most edgy of ages...
---
your pushing it and those high level guilds are just farming the content a little faster
---
Im going prot warrior for my main and mage for my alt. That's a good idea with rested. I could occasionally level my mage with enchanting sending over greens to be salvaged for the mats to sell on AH. I'm trying to get enough gold as to where i\['ll be able to afford both mounts upon hitting the respected levels
---
My preperation is flying to thailand end of August, bang all n8elf woman i can find there and come back rested 3 weeks later. Then my journey begins. :D
---
It is like it was in later vanilla, you have to time to stand up while you get hit.
---
With good timing and a bit of luck you can do it without fail 4 times in a row, but not all the time.
---
So I would say its not reliable enough to be used that often, just a gimmick to have fun ones in a while.
---
and nobody is going to be able to avoid them. If they go with less server and more layers all the server are going to have streamers on it.
---
Doesn't matter to me, such a overblown non issue
---
About streamer servers
---
I was watching a guy stream while waiting for WSG this weekend.  Chat asks him when he quit BFA.
---
He says “A few weeks after Uldir when......”
---
He didn’t finish the answer.  Because the answer was “When RDR2 came out” 
---
Beware streamer servers if you like population.
---
I thiiiiink it may be time...
---
'They'll all be mine...in the end'
---
...traveller
---
Oh yea deff a healthy diet. I'd go into detail but basically what you listed but im bout to head to sleep.. Gonna head to trader joes and buy a lot of food from there
---
I tested leveling a lock with lots of early shadow power gear and it didn't feel like it's worth sinking a lot of money into it is barely noticeable since a lot of your damage is wand damage for the earlier levels and dots need a lot of shadow power to even do +1-2 damage per tick which might not even make a difference. 
---
I feel like if you see a cheap piece of shadow power gear go for it but don't blow all your money on them unnecessarily. The priority should be getting wands although most of them come from quests and dungeons.
---
Also int/stam/spirit are all very valuable for leveling it might not be worth getting say +5 damage over a good stated item.
---
tried the durnholde challenge series quests in hillsbrad? they're pretty tough solo :D! Doable, but you have to use every trick you have!
---
&gt; Buccaneers Den
---
Holy!!!, I totally forgot about that. Damn that was incredible back in the day. They designed that system flawlessly.
---
Get a british shorthair. the perfect indoor apartment cat. cute as buttons too
---
This makes the thread of how everyone who plays Hunters will "shoot them selves in foot" look even more ridicilous than it already was.
---
Talking about paladins my man. Warlocks get instant mount through talents
---
Mumble added 2-4 seconds on my boot time when I installed it back in Wrath, so that piece of software is banned from my pc.
---
While you’re right, wow got shit on for years for being an easy-mode MMO. Now people are longing for its ‘slower paced’ play style. My, have times changed.
---
"if you play hunter you will literally have the worst time in your entire life ever" - This subreddit
---
I used scroll up+ down and mouse 3( squeeze the mouse button down) for three different bindings. Also gaming mouses provide at least 2 extra buttons at the side( mmo mouses have something like a calculator on the side, if you get used to it it helps a lot) .
---
My guild leader on US Silver Hand. Kernhoof. Tauren Warrior who got exalted with the Bloodsail Buccaneers and also friendly with the Steamwheedle cartel by killing the one mob that would raise your Steamwheedle rep without lowering your Bloodsail rep like 10,000 times.
---
He and most of the guild migrated to the Scryers after BC launched to get away from the insane faction imbalance Silver Hand had. I stayed, but later moved to Moon Guard. Always missed Kern, though.
---
I believe his nickname was the Hugginator, he was always /hug-ing people.
---
Ironforge
---
Also because I haven't played Alliance in a long time
---
Being able to wear everything up to your gear tier is just another small thing that makes Classic, well, Classic.
---
Not only gives your more freedom at end-game as a plate or mail character, it made itemization easier for devs at the time.
---
Also there's just something about being a Hunter and your first shoulders at lvl 23 are some pink clothie scuffed pauldrons but hey those +3 stamina are just to good to throw away, know what I mean?
---
Clear all raiding content through Naxx.  This wasn’t a goal I really had in vanilla at all as I never totally grasped the full idea of progressive raiding.  I always just assumed purple gear was purple gear... the idea that T2 was better purple gear than T1 never occurred to me.  After I got into that scene in TBC I had a bit of regret that I didn’t experience it in more depth during vanilla.  
---
A big part of not getting into it in Vanilla was the fact that my PC couldn’t handle 40 man raids though...

Seriously, last night I was so bummed out because the old “ghostly glide” was still gone. I was convinced they were going to ignore it.  It really changes the “feel” of sneaking up on people, imo. I’m so happy now :)

---
The friend who will likely play with me wants to go horde while I want to go alliance.
---
But he knows that I'm the one who's more excited about the game and more likely to stick with it, so he'll go alliance with me.
---
If it was the other way around, I'd do the same for him. I've played horde before and it's not like I couldn't stand it.
---
In the given situation with the history you descriebed ,I'd say that you and your more reliable friend should play what you prefer. Especially if you really don't like the aesthetics of horde.
---
according to this comment bfa leveling sounds like fun?
---
I have to improvise!
---
Pretty sure you will be well rested, cause I'm sorry to say there are no nightelfs in Thailand.
---
They do
---
Depends who it is. Asmon, for instance, almost never plays any other game besides WoW. He's on record multiple times saying he doesn't really enjoy other games, especially single player ones. If you were to roll on this server it would be a pretty safe bet that he will continually play the game.
---
 I haven't played the beta so I am just going on what people that has have reported.
---
 Some quotes from this thread for example: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c49ipo/does_melee_leeway_effect_hamstring_kiting_when/
---
 "I haven't been able to get hamstring to work on the beta outside of escaping death by running away"
---
"I tried it on the stress test and it sucked dick with leeway"
---
"It's still possible to hamstring kite, it's just less effective"
---
 However after googling it now it seems there actually is a way to make it work but it sounds absolutely idiotic:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0z7kh/melee_leeway_is_a_classbreaking_mechanic/
---
"Just backpedal. I watched Tribe hamstring a mob and backpedal and the mob couldn't hit him. He also duelled perplexity (I think it was him) and perplexity back-pedalled and tribe couldn't hit him unless he was literally standing on top of him lol. Backpedal = new meta. Which means more people should want to play hunter..."
---
 So basically if we backpedal instead of strafe it works. I want it gone anyway because backpedaling doesn't make for fluid gameplay. strafing is much more fluid and feels better.
---
Absolutely yes. The game was designed with new players in mind and the systems should be easy to understand and you have the opportunity to learn your class during leveling.
---
I agree, retail does a great job at story telling. I mean, the actual story content might debatably not be the best, but the telling of it is done quite well.
---
Yet, I have an issue with it. It is a great story telling, but it is not an MMORPG storytelling. It is the kind I'd love to have in a single player game, but not in a game where I try to immerse myself into my own character and into a big open world. On retail I feel like Jaina and Co. (or whomever the current xpac chooses to follow) are the ones that raid something. I feel like I'm just there, just because there need to be some gameplay otherwise it's not really a game. I feel kind of out of the whole thing. Yes yes, they talk to the "champion" now and then, but honestly I don't feel like I'm part of the world. I'm a camera placed to watch Blizzard chosen characters.
---
In vanilla on the other hand, when we raid something I feel like me and my guild are the ones going after a villain. I feel like it is an open world where we, the adventurers, choose to do something about an evil. On retail Jaina choose to do something about an evil and we are just kind of watching that like you watch a movie.
---
Essentially, I think retail took way too much of the focus away from the players, from the RPG part and then put it onto their own characters. This philosophy is seen a lot in retail, where Blizzard seem lik they want to "control" what and how content is experienced. This is just directly against the open world RPG philosophy.
---
Vanilla, as mentioned, does lack lore on the other hand. I think a middle way would be good. In TBC you had more of an idea about what happened. You understood that they were trying to bring KJ into the world in the Sunwell and you were to stop it. You saw Maiev and Akama, two core figures in the Illidan story. In WotLK they also did it well, making sure you knew and feared the Lich King throughout leveling and dungeons, you understood the different organizations and groups in Northrend and you knew what was happening. Yet, it was still the player that was in focus, not some character Blizzard made.
---
Fd/scatter trap and fd in pvp duals works, didn't try bg yet. Scatter still drs trap making it only last 5 seconds ish
---
You make 0 sense, you are claiming that blizzard left a bug on purpose for months that could have been fixed overnight but never did so untill a fuckin reddit post lol.
---
God damn. Blizzard give me so much faith for a while now. Looks like at least the team working for Classic really cares for the product and understands the goals they themselves have set before them. I can't wait for August 27th. : )
---
Its hard to comment because this is all over the place. Id have to pick through every ability, but overall, very poor choices.
---
There isnt, did you ACTUALLY play Hunter in vanilla? A lot of these bugs were present in vanilla.
---
Pvp talents in sub, increased speed in stealth.  Not worth it imo unless you are leveling on a server with a trollish guild opposite faction.
---
The impact is much much stronger on warrior because they are the most gear dependant class. A bis warrior will top dps, a casual warrior will be last (even below hybrids).
---
I actually never even bothered with paladin until WotLK. I couldn't stand their playstyle and the whole holy light theme was never a big selling point to me. In WotLK I learned what potential such a class could have and started to enjoy it and the whole light to smite your enemies theme became much cooler to me.
---
You'll probably need the  Talisman of Binding Shard too.
---
Just be the first one to get it again in Classic.
---
Change it to a murloc and I’ll allow it.
---
I screenshoted this. Thanks
---
the sword is way better as a weapon then the wood log, it should be really hard for the tauren to get a good hit on the footman, since the log its heavy, dull, hard to move and facing a steel shield+armor, while its comparably easier for the footman to cut/stab the "naked" body of the tauren
---
Right? I’m an adult and will be gaming the proper way: at work on a 3rd monitor that’s hooked up to my gaming PC I brought in. 
---
8am-4pm are my gaming hours.
---
Who knew not bothering to gear ur character would mean low dps
---
Damn glad I couldnt work out that one
---
Gives us an example of a bug that have persisted for 4 expansions, or are you just saying things?
---
He's saying your friend needs to suck it up, as it's 2v1 in favor of Alliance.
---
Whaaaat! Im pretty sure many woman there are beautiful like n8elfs.
---
Total bullshit.  They're not the most gear dependent.  They're the most broken.  They do fine in mediocre gear, and then scale to fuck you levels.
---
Oh, that makes sense; Dalaran shall now be called "The Happy Place."
---
:)
---
 This might be really dumb.   
---
Yes
---
Probably "Well met"
---
Probably going to be stealing all these for our [Discord countdown](https://imgur.com/mKJZ4G7).
---
Similar plan of my guild. I joined it ahead of time to stress over the wait with but getting a bunch of like-minded people ahead of time will always be a good move. Even if some level slower or fall off, it's a solid starting point.
---
They’re actually incredibly boring and not very effective in BG’s. Had a druid and rogue at 60 during retail vanilla and the Druid was 100x more fun than the rogue in PvP.
---
Dps is boring too if you just stand there casting shadow bolt etc. Sure you're doing your job well enough but there are good dps and bad dps - its the same for healers.
---
The fun is in being a good healer who keeps every raid member alive - not just keeping enough people alive to finish the encounter.
---
Healers more than any other role have to think ahead to what the boss is going to be doing for the next minute, the next 3 minutes. How much mana can you afford to use? How many times does that rude dps have to die and insult you before he realises you're deliberately letting him die because sticks and stones may break my bones but eat a turd heres a repair bill you smug douche? So many choices to make.
---
Uhm, I guess #nochanges, but the "correct" animation is jsut plain worse, looks like ice skating.
---
C'thun's whispers in Ahn'Qiraj.
---
rets ok in dead stuff instances
---
Doubt the tanks will let you have that.
---
The leveling- and preraid-bis gear for most healers is cloth. So druid-, shaman- and paladin-healers would have a really hard time... And everyone else who wants to join a dungeon aswell because having a non-priest as a healer would mean you'd have someone with maybe half of the manapool required to do the job.
---
Stranger to the twinking world, what's the fisherhat all about?
---
Gnome levelling in Tirisfal Glades? Now that’s brave
---
And BG’s would simply not pop any time he was doing an event or certain zones would be unplayable.

This right here is the answer to every question on this sub. Just copy and paste.

These people should be reported and banned.

I'd be highly surprised if that got added back in...

Only half?

The water missing around VC's ship is on the known bug list at least.

God I’m a kid again!
---
In Classic is easier to find right community because it is the oly way how you can play there but it is worse in almost everything else because there are no other options  how to play and no content at all, after few weeks you will realize you have nothing to do, ppl will start to go back to modern WoW.
---
This happened to me too... tried to fire up an old account and was told it was banned and it wouldn’t be over turned.  I quit playing completely in Cata and unsubbed with my account in good standing.  No idea what could have possibly happened to have had the account banned.  Really not that concerned about it as I have absolutely no desire to ever play retail WoW again.
---
Doesn’t matter.
---
Fucking A man.
---
I was all decided on what to play, too. Now it's up in the air again. :)
---
 Can't decide if this is a serious post or not but whatever floats your boat. Just seems pretty insane.
---
 Personally I am pumped for classic even though I have played on private servers. Most recent one about a year ago. Going to play alliance which I don't have that much experience with. Was thinking that I perhaps should go on a private server and get more familiar with the quests, vendor locations, plan everything out etc but figured it would be more fun to just go in blind. Everything is not about efficiency for me. If it was I would play horde again. Literally know every single quest inside and out for horde. But seems like a missed opportunity to not experiencing something new.
---
 For sure will play a lot but I will never prioritize gaming before my workout schedule and real life stuff. It's just not worth it. No matter how fun it is to play a game it will come a time when the game means nothing to you and you just uninstall it without second thought.
---
If you hit 60 in two weeks I don’t think you’re going to struggle to find a guild that raids when you’re online... since you’re already playing 8 hours a day.
---
Good luck getting that kind of threat without a thinderfury
---
The logical side of me tells me to roll mage for the sweets dps and utility but another side of me thinks I won't enjoy the play style all that much. Tried leveling a ret pally because I love the lore/feel but got bored by Westfall. The struggle is real
---
Skullcrusher
---
Kazzar / Patagonia - Kazzar the orc warlock who sat outside org whooping everybody in duels while wearing a farmers outfit with a fiery enchanted grey broomstick weapon. He was unstoppable... I never saw him lose. Patagonia was his warrior.
---
Same situation, but i have 2 month male new patry member. We will have to plan raids and dungeons carefully d=).
---
Because I want something good for the game makes me obsessed with streamers? Damn holy shit mind blown that’s logical as fuck!
---
I'll no-life to 60 with my friends and probably see the options on the way, maybe if i play with other nolifers that already have a guild I'll join them.
---
I plan on playing a warlock which should always be in very high demand regardless of faction or server so I'm not that worried.
---
I couldn’t give two flying fuckaroos if I got into beta. I’m fine playing other servers until Classic is out lol
---
&gt;**WoD**: the old writers fucked up let's go back and change it

More like
---
**WoD**: the old writers did an amazing job with establishing worldbuilding and background story, let's copy it and do it again!
---
Mobs aren't hard in Classic, many mobs are.
---
I think there were some pirate murlocs with the south sea raiders. Memory might be foggy though.
---
Unless you spec into Holy Nova (that doesnt really do damage though) priest does not have an AOE damage ability.
---
Same for TBC - they got their AOE ability "Mind Sear" in WotLk ... like for example rogue got Fan of Knives.
---
You need to not talk about things you don't know anything about.
---
Your mom spent 10k on your machine? Wowzies, bestbuy huh?
---
Imagine getting burned out by playing a beta...
---
Imaging getting banned for testing something in a beta.
---
Yeah :) It's easier when kid start to sleep all nights. Much easier :D
---
My priest in retail is 48.  Can’t wait to get to Outland and northrend.
---
&gt; healthy and stealthed 
---
Missed opportunity to type stealthy instead of stealthed.
---
Test my ass...  They're just exploiting a bug.
---
It’s a no brainer lol. Yes...
---
There is an add-on called Immersion for retail that does a really nice job of improving quest interaction. I dont know if they are going to port it but you can check it out. Doesnt change the game or speed anything up either.
---
What Lothric said, although WoW is obviously a medieval 'fantasy' it still used to cling to the common tropes of that period. The Warsong Clan are infamously hard to control, Thrall's situation wasn't an easy one because he has to choose between looking weak, alienating his own people and causing bigger conflict or looking the other way during border skirmishes so his people can have much needed resources. I personally wouldn't have put a big lumber camp in game but otherwise it works.
---
The Arathi basin is a little more one sided, you have the humans of Stromgarde (League of Arathor) vs Forsaken from Lordaeron that want to steal the land of a crippled nation. The only reason they're getting away with it is because the Alliance at the time was a shiny apple with a rotten core. Bureaucratic corruption and malevolent forces from within (like Onxyia) have essentially crippled each nations ability to function, hence why places like Westfall the breadbasket of Stormwind are left barren and undefended.
---
Alterac Valley is morally ambiguous if you want to be fair minded, you have the dwarves that have always (legally speaking) had claim and then you have the Frostwolves that moved in some time after the they were exiled when the orcs first invaded Azeroth. It was the frostwolf clan that attacked the dwarf scouts that were excavating on what the Frostwolves said was 'sacred' ground, now given they had only been there for a relatively small time it could hardly be sacred to them but you have some NPCs that say it was a Frostwolf graveyard. It's not entirely clear cut.
---
I can guarantee that the issue described in the original post will not happen in phase 1.
---
Believe I was in the 7 days played range when I hit 60 on my first character in retail vanilla which was a rogue.  Was not at all focused on leveling speed although it was what I ‘worked’ on doing most of the time.
---
truth be told I think the struggle is to fill 40 man not picking x amount of rogues. especially early on I bet they fill as much rogue as possible since they are good to go.

well... i mean... It would be nice to actually be able to log in to confirm this sort of stuff.  Unfortunately the only information non-wow subscribers can even get is from this sub or official channels.
---
I'm all for having a long beta period, but I'm not subbing just for the chance at it.  Thanks for clearing it up though for us.
---
You mean Blizz is actually working on stuff? Wow!
---
That's the best idea ever.
---
I’m in exactly the same situation.  Druids were passable on p-servers if you put in extra work and I was looking forward to playing one in Classic.  Just not worth it to me if all that extra work still leaves you shitting the bed compared to other classes.  Luckily I have in interest in plenty of other classes as well.
---
May still roll a druid alt at some point, just won’t be my main.
---
The more it grows, the more it fills up with toxicity. Even though Blizz have shown themselves to listen for a lot of things with Classic, you got a very vocal minority that responds to everything with "pfft as if they care, blizzo wants muh monies"
---
Enrage does proc from sitting, LOL. It’s just a different timing in Classic.
---
Sooo those are old models then? Will there be an option to use newer, more beautiful assets?
---
Glyphs were on release, Dual Spec came a bit later. Ulduar, I think?
---
I'm coming back to vanilla for sure after not having played since wotlk, but man I will miss some things, Death knights, ice lance, cloak of shadows, etc

---
That game was great in Alpha. Sucked on release :/
---
I think the two who are not tanking can switch off between cat-forming and healing. So somebody is always regenning mana.
---
Generally you would use different gear as a druid depending on your role. So like, the guy in healing gear is not going to cat form very well and the guy in cat gear is not going to heal very well. But it might work if you used mixed gear or later on hybrid gear (like the pvp gear). I don't know.
---
I think it would be interesting. You would have advantages outside of instances, for sure (3x stealth, 3x fish form, 3x travel form, 3x healers, etc).
---
One thing that's missing is: cleansing magic and disease debuffs. I think there are a couple of instances (Stratholme is the only one that comes to mind, but there might be others) where there are long duration debuffs that will make it much more difficult to finish the dungeon if you can't get rid of them.
---
I don't know. I think the strong part of this idea is more like pvp and world questing/etc than dungeons. But the dungeons would be hilarious.
---
I dunno, maybe we can be positive for a bit. That'd be nice.
---
agreed, TOTC was such a let down after ulduar
---
Nope, just beta testers posting vids that show the changes.
---
Yes. They also have zero mana
---
Happy to help. Let me know if there’s anything you’d like me to check out.
---
No, there was numerically impossible raids, items and talents had too many variations so good players had to know them, preparation for raids, mount, anything valuable was far far far tedious and some classes were huge pain in the ass in pvp. Now everything is similar, loot lotteries literally give loot for almost nothing and if your eyes function, there are addons to tell you what to do even in pvp.
---
I'll chip in a Blessing of Freedom.
---
&gt; Less than 90 hours /played to 60 is the new meta.
---
For scrubs maybe.  If you aren't doing it in under 80, then you are trash.
---
they were okish after patch 1.6, for the first half of the game they were a joke and only brought for innervate.
---
Yes but they're looking for any excuse to go back to private servers because they hate Blizzard and don't want to play their game(s)
---
Does that mean I get paid?
---
I usually keyboard turned while hearthing.
---
I don't know, maybe one of the other 100 bugs that are still left?
---
Inquietes-toi pas d'avoir l'air retrograde. Les commentaires anglos le sont pas mal plu.
---
Did you just sit in high sec the whole time?
---
I think there's quite a few that are posting 'this is broken..' threads without even having access to the beta.
---
Unsure why. Karma? Attention?
---
&gt; However, on the other hand, with so much I have achieved (I don't mind to start from ground zero) and knowing where it will lead me in the end, I feel a bit meaningless and emptiness to play again. It's like reading a book a second time with knowing the ending. 
---
Maybe I misunderstand what you wrote but if some of what you are feeling is that you would throw away all you had accomplished if you retired your main character for a vanilla one that's not a thing. I mean eventually you are going to stop playing WoW. A character you have geared up in a game might feel important but there will come a time when you care zero about that toon and the game. You will just uninstall the game. So with this in mind just play what you think you would enjoy the most.
---
Last time I played retail about a year ago I went solo in that dungeon in OG (don't know the English name for it) at level 11. One Run with a little kiting and I was level 16 I think. It's just to easy. 
---
I played vanilla when I was 12 and I remember dying so often in the open world by normal mobs. There was a challenge in leveling.
---
This sounds great fun, defo jealous. I'd be tempted to run a Moonkin/Resto (as their gear would work for both) rather than a Resto/Feral. 
---
I am sooo jealous actually, wish I knew people who were planning to play to set up something like this. I need better siblings.
---
Sounds like a dumb idea. But don't let me stop you.
---
Chill legs fine, work out.
---
I am very concerned about bugs and leftover stuff from the modern client. I have just seen that the combat text, the stealth animation and the turning animation have been fixed. I do not have access to the beta but it seems like Blizzard is fixing these issues. Thanks to Blizzard for listening and to the community for being vocal about these issues. Make sure to continue being stubborn about wanting an experience as close to the retail vanilla experience as possible and also make sure to express joy for the fixes.
---
Hell yea

Good joke moved out of home

Boy someone jelly af

I hardly think any of them would actually be bad enough to keep us in check for the next 60 days.
---
Skeleton thing is the most important thing of all the "minor" things imo
---
Damn, nice. Living the dream: early 30s with no wife/girlfriend.
---
Mages auto lose warlock + priest.
---
Mages are skillmatchup versus rogues/shaman
---
Mages lose hunter in wpvp/BG's.
---
No idea how paladins are versus mages, mostly bc ret is meme. Warrior is obviously an easy win.
---
Mages are amazing for group pvp and stuff, but alone in the world you aren't some crazy 1v1 machine.
---
Would it really be authentic if half our class *wasn't* broken in the beginning?
---
leveling was always the worst part of this game.
---
My fiancé is sitting right next to me but solid effort :)
---
Wow a whole 2 launches, you must be an effin' expert.
---
How many launches with layering have you played?
---
&gt;You can't ever catch up, because of how the honor system works.
---
What better gear can you get though honor that you can't get from Naxxramas?
---
Then blizzard will see somebody has logged on for 5 days straight surely and take action because nobody could possibly play for that long
---
If you ever had issue leveling in WoW at all you might not have a brain to begin with.
---
For some ideas check out Brian Kopp's leveling guide (very outdated though). I'd still recommend mostly darkshore as a secondary zone, but from there on out the routes all vary massively.
---
Express gratitude for the fixes and keep being stubborn about wanting every detail to be as close to vanilla as possible. There is still a lot to fix.
---
Because the footsteps doesn't match the walking speed? Yeah it might not be "realistic", but it's what I associate with stealth. 
---
Whomever thought realism, whether it being animations, reactions or graphics, is a vital feature that determines fun in video games was fired from EA long ago. Video games don't need to be realistic, on the contrary I enjoy weird and quirky things like this because it's unique.
---
Pathing, leeway &amp; batching is still scuffed as fuck.
---
It would wreck fury warriors first and foremost. They use so many leather and mail pieces!
---
Already found one. But it's really 100% what I was looking for and I met someone again by pure chance. 
---
We plan on leveling the first week as a team.
---
I feel like I got double lucky.
---
Remember, patience...discipline
---
Hemo can work.
---
Sword until 30 and then switch to dagger build CAN work, but it's kinda risky. If you don't have enough damage to kill mobs with ambush gouge backstab evis, then you are really weak in leveling.
---
so glad! not even gonna be playing rogue, but I am so happy they listened!
---
A ray of hope ! 
---
I played ret, paladin was my 2nd char in vanilla. I really loved the playstyle, being a hybrid and atleast in PVP i think ret is a fun and solid support if you spend 20 points in holy. I grinded rank 13 pre x-realm, rank 14 was out of my grasp since i basically had to quit school to go for it. 
---
I still think rank 13 gear with Zin'rokh and mixed raidgear was a solid setup vs most classes,  deal good burst damage and having the excellent paladin PvP toolkit with BoF, BoP, heals and CC.
---
Totem quests, the water one in particular was like a right of passage to becoming a real Shaman ;)
---
The raids were impossible due to hard to reach gear checks. But is "grinding long enough to get the gear to kill something" really considered... hard? Its a tedious grind. But its not mechanically difficult. 
---
And Addons were actually much more powerful in vanilla. You had castsequence macros. You had healbot, which was an actual heal bot. That healed manaefficient for you and even canceled heal spells when it saw that someone else already healed the target. 
---
that something like DBM didnt exist in vanilla was because it wasnt needed. What should DBM told you back then? "DPS the boss until its dead"? 
---
The creation of DBM and other addons was the answer to the increase difficulty in raid encounters. 
---
And how is retail a loot lottery? In vanilla loot was so rare that you actually had to cross your fingers to get loot. Now you are much more often rewarded for the content that you do. In vanilla, you could have raided 2 weeks without getting an item.
---
If you think that raiding was actually hard in vanilla, then watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br1hXGXJ7Tg&amp;
---
Heres what happens:

The rogue delays his DPS to not pull aggro, then he stand there doing afk dps for two and a half minute. That means he used sinister strike and eviscerate all the time and used faint now and then to reset aggro. 
---
At 2:51 he moves for the first time to go to the adds and kill them. He then goes back to ragnaros and afk dps him again until he dies.
---
What is that? just a straight dps and gear check. You just had to grind long enough to get the gear and consumables that you needed to kill something. 
---
In todays wow, even LFR encounter have more mechanics to play. You can just ignore them for the most part because they are scaled down. But as soon as you move into a harder difficulty, raids become much much more challenging. 
---
Same goes for dungeons. On Easy Mode, Retail dungeons are scaled down so you cant die. On Hard Mode, most trash packs have more and harder mechanics than most vanilla raid bosses. The difference in difficulty between retail trash packs and vanilla raid encounters is, that the difficulty from retail trash packs comes from the mechanics and vanilla raid bosses difficulty comes from the gear check.
---
It really makes the BFA look good doesn't it? 
---
/s
---
Did he offer to blow you, that why you are so white knighting him ?
---
He said fresh servers, 2007, and not launch. People absolutely get to MC within a month on any fresh server. Easy to miss but totally changes the meaning of his comment.
---
I was getting so anxious about all the BFA animations that hadn't been addressed yet, but I see now that they were focusing on hard gameplay fixes first.
---
All glory to the classic team.  If this layering thing can get adjusted to an acceptable place, I will have literally zero concerns left about the game.  Just amazing work imo.
---
Sich das Info?
---
Pretty much.
---
It happened at least once during the first stress test when someone died and then got layered and/or disconnected due to a layer crashing.
---
I always wanted the undead to be its own faction, alliance &amp; horde then the option to play any race as its "undead" version.

What ever floats your boat. A discussion seems pointless as you fail to comprehend.

Former vanilla mage here. Cleared through AQ40. Looking for a guild with early-ish raid times. Would like to be done by 10pm on weekdays.
---
I can literally play any class. Honestly tell me what you need because I cannot decide what to play. I just want a group of people who will be active and help each other out. 
---
I'm very commited and willing to help. Not looking for any server firsts but wouldn't mind clearing it all eventually.

Just shoot me a message.

---
You don't have any fun abilities when leveling until you're in the 30s.
---
They're gear dependent - so early 60 is not so great in pvp.
---
But once you get sort of low end epic gear (MC weapons or rank 10 pvp set or TUF etc), they're a huge amount of fun.
---
I think tanking is fun, too.
---

Strafing looks horrible atm

Tuning the batching should be a priority now

---
Pug group....obviously need🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
Obviously needing, not gonna pass on a chance for a free mount, even if it's nothing special if I'm playing horde.
---
Love how you are literally going at every comment that says anything even remotely negative about your waifu streamer. Care to explain how do you know what I play ? (Hint, you are totally wrong).
---
Instead of insulting me and making it personal how about you come up with some actual arguments and focus on the topic not on me ?
---
Nope, you may want to read my reply again.
---
Why would you not roll need? You are just asking for it to be ninjaed by the last guy who realized everyone rolled greed.
---
I would /p "everybody need" and I'm fine with it. No point in going greed, because you can bet there is at least one person who will press need anyway.
---
Look at all these ninja looters hitting need.
---
From a programming standpoint there is nothing to fix. As you said this is the fixed version.
---
What people want would mean to reanimate and remodel the whole thing to match the old one. Which obviously they won't do.
---
The majority of this subreddit is CONSTANTLY bitching that Blizzard isnt fixing any bugs. Its disgusting, the cynicism
---
Maybe - but what would you like them to do?
---
They def took the idea for mythic + from diablo. Just the idea though- although I enjoyed them I think raider II being required is dumb or the run program for gear optimization. I don’t wanna do that... at all. D3 was doomed from the start it’s an actiblizz creation. Hopefully one day they can allow a team all the time they need and resources too create a stellar game. 
---
I was saying World of (Starcraft/Diablo) created in the image of a vanilla wow experience and stay that way or take retail and go in that direction with the next expansion.
---
Classic is more about the group and not individual gameplay. When it comes to raids it rly fun to heal in my opinion. You have to decide which downranked spell to use to avoid overheal and save mana. It‘s definitely more fun than playing mage in MC where you basically only press one button. In the end its always your fault if your group wipes (not in reality but thats what the dps classes think). Go for it I liked healing as a priest back in classic
---
Most classes rely on engineering for AoE.
---
Priest can also multi-dot but shadow word pain alone is not a whole lot of damage.
---
No servers is completely empty. There is always enough people for a pug now and then
---
Love the classic team!!
---
&gt; You all already have bought your epic mounts
---
Well, then greed obviously.
---
This is why I truly hope that the vanilla experiment will be a success and we'll have TBC servers too! Classes were much more fun to play in tbc imho
---
You need it so you need on it.
---
Probably Asmongold watching youtube videos.
---
Someone else want to name money as reason, maybe?
---
Maybe. But the art shows the tauren about to swing and the human about to try and block it. Even if his shield survives that's going to be a massive impact, easily a broken arm at least. Shields don't magically stop any and all force that hits them.
---
I'm pretty sure the post is tongue-in-cheek
---
Always need on that shit. It has been the rule for ages now since it's is the only way to keep it fair.
---
There is a obvious need for something like that. The last person would always roll need if everyone did greed so better all roll need
---
Gotta agree with the other poster.
---
You are clueless.
---
Paladins can easily solo AOE farm WPL pulling 6-10 mobs per pull.
---
(Without being in full prot spec or gear)
---
And anyone actually capable of thinking understands what he means by thorns after reading his post. 
---
You are literally nit-picking on bullshit because you have nothing of value to say.
---
Whining about right click reporting I suppose. Definitely needs changing as the potential autoban is so crap..
---
IMHO when you right click &gt; report a player it should just bring up the report form with the name already filled in.. Especially as we're going to have EU servers with funky names etc. I don't want to use a website to lookup codes just to report a player called æÍýÈ

I think there is only hydramist so far who has been showing speedrunning to 30 with several attempts using a priest. He is aiming for 20 but his 3 attempts were in the range of 23.

40 at 40 hours is doable following that speed but you better know where exactly to go and when.

If you want to shave time, consider getting an addon to auto validate and auto accept quests. Autoloot is already in.

WoWs flavour of super dry dad sarcasm is just timeless.
---
I hear a lot of people talking about wanting to spec for pvp as a rogue while leveling. Truth is that even a sword spec rogue can be just as threatening as any other spec while leveling. Swords are a lot more common, and finding an upgrade is usually easier, and once you reach the end of combat tree you can demolish similarly leveled players with adrenaline rush after a kidney shot.
---
Update classic with new content. New raids,  minor improvement in equipment to make it worth upgrading but not make old content worthless.
---
It would definitely affect gameplay. Fury warriors would be heavily nerfed with a lot of their good items especially early game being removed. 
---
For healers it also impacts the plate/mail/leather wearers. Big nerf to everyone that's not a priest especially in prebis. 
---
It gets better over time with more tier gear being useful and there being a good amount of items to choose from.
---
Would it be a good idea? Hell no, even with the items fixed, being able to pick lesser armor items for better stats is a cool thing and adds to the game. Being forced to wear full plate doesn't make sense and doesn't add anything to the game yet blizzard still basically added it when they gave a bonus for wearing full leather/mail/plate.
---
Give taunt to bear and prot pally. Make the meme clases scale better with gear. Buff healing or make it scale better for resto druid and shaman. Buff spriest dmg, lock, feral , boomkin and ele shaman to be equal at the top 3 dps. Make hunter a viable dps too
---
He wrote thorns, I and others took the assumption that yano he meant the spell. Rather than "Oh yeah, no sorry it's this he goes full on Reddit REEEEE" and then links a video that actually goes against his arguments (being unsure if blessing of sanctuary and needing no prot gear, both are evident in the video)
---
That's trash... I really hope in the future blizz whitelist certain add-ons and just removes the rest.
---
a and b.  TBC is a far superior game to vanilla wow.
---
First duplicate the server, then just rename one of them classic, and let the other progress into TBC.  Also, make some new classic servers for people that want to start all over again for some weird reason.
---
I don't know how to begin to type it, but the fucked up donald duck noise imps make when you summon them.
---
Aah but now I think about it, I'll miss all the snarky quips demons made, can't remember when they got added, post vanilla though I think. I'm guessing they are gone anyway.
---
&gt; Whining about right click reporting I suppose. 
---
Right-click is removed from beta.
---
For me it would be very fun if there were fresh servers that got released from time to time. To start over from level 1( when everyone else is level 1 as well)  is fun. Just everything about it, leveling with tons of people doing lowbie content, getting to know people as you level, trying to find ways of making gold for your mount etc. 
---
 Burning Crusade could be fun as well but I would not like it if the server I am playing on converts into a burning crusade one. Would have to be optional if you wanted to transfer your character to a specific Burning Crusade server.
---
Well, there's the sinews (blue -for the quiver- and black) but they can be traded. Blue drops of Azuregos (it drops of WS drakes as well, quite low drop rate, though), while black is an Onyxia drop.
---
Except there are still tons of issues that require testing and who knows what bug we haven't found yet.
---
Imagine going into classic with wrong animations, sounds, pet ai, spell batching, leeway, missing textures etc.
---
Truefaith Vestments.
---
Not having to level tailoring by 57 for this, just to drop and level something else after, would be a huge boon in terms of gold and time.
---
Finally, a real beta post, thank you for these finds!
---

The typical story he tells is that he himself was not great at convincing others but adham was a great listener and so he was able to convince adham who, because he was cofounder if the company, was able to convince anyone of anything. So for PvP, Kevin tells a story where he argues this whole big point to adham, convinces adham, then adham convinces everyone else. At the time, PvP was only associated with severe griefing behavior in mmos. No other developer wanted it.
---
Wait.. wtf?! They extended the dead zone?! Well, guess I need to choose a new main..

Same for me as Croat, there was never online game that has Croatian server/realm or language support to begin with(World of Tanks has croatian lang support though), so I find this fascinating how brits, germs, baugettes and carhalos are bitching and moaning about country specific server
---
Hiring people seems pointless when people will do it for free in the beta and for some it's more important than just a job you get paid for.
---
The free publicity and marketing is a huge plus too.
---
&gt;Mages auto lose warlock + priest.
---
if the warlock is SL + double pet sac + HS, sure 
---
priest is 90/10 in favor of mage once you're out of greens
---
&gt;Mages are skill match up versus rogues/shaman
---
mage shits on shaman, rogue is a skill match up 
---
&gt;Mages lose hunter in wpvp/BG's.
---
if you start 100 yards away the hunter maybe has a chance, if not the mage is extremely extremely favored 
---
realistically mage shits on everything besides really good rogues and SL warlocks who have full cds
---
Same here. I’ll probably pug some dungeons while leveling and maybe I find a nice social guild on the way.
---
Target yourself, press ritual of summoning, two others press the summon, you get the summon, hs to town and repair/sell before the timer runs out. Press the summon and you are back to where you were.
---
Not always true.
---
SPriests are just the Anti-warrior. 
---
Warriors have an empty resource bar out of combat and fill it up quickly in combat and SPriest have a full bar ooc and empty it quickly. 
---
So they clearly have mana at some point
---
So you think leaving the game with tons of gamebreaking issues is good for the game?
---
Took long enough, lot of stories about the abuse which is not cool even if it mostly worked as intended.
---
They can only focus on one thing at a time, so Johnny 10-boxer is controlling 2/3 of your team to capture one flag.  MAYBE they get in to the enemy base and own the respawn point, but that won’t do any good if the enemy isn’t getting killed because you effectively left 5 people to take out the enemy team that isn’t in their base.
---
" This beautiful animal, once followed by the owner to the battlefield, will become a fierce and cruel bloody weapon, especially in the hands of the beastmaster Hunter. Once the legal profession is attacked by it, all kinds of reading skills will be delayed."

Might have something to do with advertising. The Chinese version doesn't even have skeletons.

Wasn’t this in vanilla? I remember A LOT of people use to do this
---
Right? I feel like yesterday there were 4 posts about its doomsday for hunters...blizzard was like...hold my beer.
---
My guess it has to do with the gold mining bots. 
---
I remember standing in Org and you’d see a line of newbie characters running into the city, then stop in the middle of an empty area, and all at once be flung up into the air then fall straight back down and die in a pattern on the ground with their bones spelling out something like: BuyWoWGold.com
---
Because even with dynamic spawning. Its hard to tag kobolds when there are 50 people fighting over 20 kobold spawns. And that was with layering. 
---
Without layering, it will be more like 150 fighting over those spawns
---
Are you trying to gatekeep the version of wow people want to play... on the classic wow subreddit? You're awful
---
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!! IM SO HAPPY
---
Everything being public and having video records makes it possible for people to point out bugs even if they aren't on the beta.
---
Tbh, why do you need an entire month off? I'll go one week after I've reached 40-45 for the last few levels. The reason I'm not taking days off at launch is, that there will be problems, and even with all that layering stuff going on, there will be crowds of people. With 3-4h a day I'll still be able to play well.
---
On my vacation I've planed to play about 12-14h a day. Which leaves 8h for sleep and 2-4h for other activties. 
---
I don't know how much sleep you need but I'm more focused if I sleep 8h. This always worked out on every MMO I started at release day. Was even faster in leveling than the guys who didn't sleep for 24h because they lost focus after 18h. And after 24h they needed to sleep for 10-12h.
---
This might work for WoW-Expansions because you usually dont need more than 24h to reach the new cap but wont work for a fresh start.
---
As a holy reck paladin I really enjoy it, especially in pvp.  With the build you can do pretty much everything.  Healing in the tides of battle and honestly knowing that YOU are the reason your team can keep pushing forward is a legit adrenaline rush for me.  And people definitely remember the really good healers over the others because damage is a dime a dozen.
---
Everyone is to need roll so no one can ninja it.
---
Everyone needing is the same as everyone greeding, with the exception that it's now 100% ninja proof.
---
Premade groups spamming SM runs will level through the 30s faster than solo players questing, but pugging dungeons is definitely subpar yes.
---
sure buddy.
---
The way i look at the encounter is boss HP vs healer mana. The tank is an enabler, and DPS is just a catalyst. So, yeah, healing is rewarding.
---
Might be possible, our Guild leader was originally alliance before going Horde.
---
Nope. Classic is classic.
---
Mana mana!

min/maxers: wait that's illegal
---
After a while you get ressness sickness. so unless you want to stop playing wouldnt suggest doing this on higher levels.
---
Yeah, if the batch window was around half as long, that'd solve most of the batching issues IMO. Similar with leeway, just reduce leeway by a third and it'd be alright.
---
But are the animations vanilla like? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXdAtukRSG4
---
Then warriors should probably get shafted too since enrage is used in the same way, and while we're at it have a look at the other classes with the same mechanic.
---
Medivh's dildo.
---
Do what we do best. Pretend we always knew blizzard was gonna fix it and that we never once had any doubt.
---
i cant fathom how you'd even lose to a shadow priest, you have frostbolt on your bar right? you can pretty much press it until they die
---

I guess you greed if you don't actually care for it, but 99% of people will need
---
Different timing is everything. It means it's not as easy to pull off. In classic it's an effect caused by spell batching while on vanilla private servers it was poorly scripted.
---

---
Realistically it's taken pserver devs over 10 years to reverse engineer the game to a playable state. Blizzard has way more resources but also lack the devoted passion that pserver devs have. Realistically there are gonna be some bugs in classic, and probably atleast a few nasty ones. I'm confident they'll get fixed but backporting a game is way more difficult then creating a new game from scratch.
---
Seeing as Warcraft 3 ended, it makes more sense for WoW to not have any factions. Also, nobody would be butthurt about high/blood elves.
---
Won't be. Already been rehashed over and over again on Blizzard forums.  You'll just have to deal with it.
---
This is really solid advice. I just want to add; it will feel weird at first but if you stick with it while leveling, you'll have it nailed when you max the character. 
---
Add each new spell you get while leveling because you'll basically have a couple levels to learn each binding before you have to add another one.
---
No, many PvP servers were completely unbalanced or became that way because of a dominate faction.
---
Any ranged class can kite this boss she stops and casts a long spell like every 10 seconds lol.
---
I actually liked "suggest invite". :O
---
Think you need to look up the words majority and constantly.
---
Looks like Hallow's End will be the first event we get to experience then?
---
What a shit reply. There could very well be an option down the road. Classic is the fundamental gameplay. Vanilla was vanilla. Classic is a recreation of vanilla with some perks to it - such as the flight path cancel button. Never say never.
---
Now we just need the distract mob reaction fixed as well! :)
---
Good luck, mained rogue on and off for 15 years and I'm definitely not dealing with that struggle in vanilla again. You get some laughs being able to gank someone while they're drinking or fighting mobs early on, then as you slowly get to 60 you realize your PvP potential is dwindling as most classes can ghost you unless you really know what you're doing (pray that you do by that point), or they really *don't* know what they're doing. Rogues are also not the greatest in group PvP as there are a ton of things flying around to destealth you. Being able to pick targets and maybe take out a healer is nice though.
---
This time around it's either paladin or warlock. Free mounts and tons of utility for the group. Also both pretty damn good in BGs.

I think he needed a comma, but regardless.
---
I rather doubt it, Blizzard themselves has expressed doubt that Classic will be much more than a "niche" game. The project that spurred the large petition (which I will not name here) expressed that they would rather see Blizzard themselves implement Classic servers, and they will (theoretically) be much better in terms of quality + stability.
---
Until someone makes an emulation project that seriously competes with Classic, I don't see Blizzard doing much more than what they have been doing already.
---
You have to buy bfa. The sub allows for up to legion

Holy/Prot spec Paladin in BGs will make you one of the most hated people horde-side and it is GLORIOUS :D
---
Hmmm. So thats where the fight club is.
---
“Fuckin’ A” is short for fucking awesome.
---
There's lots of reasons why a pserver is inaccurate, but neither of these are good reasons.
---
Dynamic respawn is dynamic, which means that if you are all alone the spawn timer is blizzlike. It is possible that a dynamic respawn system could help a person get out of the "zerg" faster but that is ultimately only a couple of hours gameplay. 
---
All of the record that OP talked about I know about, and all of them were done after the TBC exp fix. 
---
But like I said there's plenty of things that these records abused that aren't blizzlike, and I doubt we would see the same time.
---
weapon skill is worthless in pvp, higher int gives more proc crits!

* If the player is [dead](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dead), it will return them to the [graveyard](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Graveyard) closest to their corpse.

* If the player is alive, and their [hearthstone](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Hearthstone) is in their [inventory](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Inventory), and their hearthstone is cooled down, it will activate their hearthstone. The 30 minute hearthstone cooldown is activated as usual.
---
* If the player is alive, but their hearthstone is either not in their inventory (e.g. in the bank) or their hearthstone is on cooldown, then the game will try to "nudge" the player in a seemingly random direction (though more often than not it will be in the direction they are facing). This "spell" is called "Stuck", has a 10 second cast time and a 5 minute cooldown.
---
Pre Second Age UO us still my favorite MMO. Still have my cloth map and everything.
---
The chance of Blizz making new content is extremely small. As it would mean basically running a separate team to work on a separate game.
---
No sarcasm, good work. Leeway, spell batching, layering are the other major ones plus a bunch of minor ones. I’m actually semi optimistic now.
---
I've never read people stacking world buffs in the real vanilla, only private server bullshit.
---
&gt;   At the time,  PvP was only associated with severe griefing behavior in mmos.
---
How is it different from WoW? Tarrens Mill, Lakeshire, Gadgetzan, etc. are all reasons why I won't roll on PVP servers. People grief and thereby steal your playtime. World PVP is basically one shoting lowbies 99% of the time. Let us not forget all the dead auctioneers, flight masters and quest givers.
---
I can't find any other associations. Sure there are those fun moments, where people gather in raids and have a nice fight. But most of the time it's about people stealing subscription time from others, by not letting them enjoy the game.
---
I think in that context ot would be more like "fuckin' ayy" or "fuckin' eh" due to the sound.

your example of "gouging from behind" is while you're channeling arcane missiles, which makes you face your target, that just looks like a visual issue

---
What I can't stand in healing is using low rank spells. Your skill bar is full enough without duplicated spells. How is this fun? If you are more experienced healer how your spell can be worse than lvl 1 healer? I just internally disagree with that concept. And it's boring to have multiple version of same spell. Yuck.
---
But that hasn’t been communicated anywhere so far. I wish it were the case but there’s no indication of such.
---
No one knows yet, still unconfirmed. People are more nervous now since Blizzard announcing no nation-specific EU servers.

Everyone rolls Need. And state that in party. If someone doesn't want it for some reason, they can pass, but everyone rolling need removes the chance one guy will roll need after everyone rolls greed.
---
God dammit not only is there streamer privilege but now we have to contend with SUB REDDIT MOD PRIVILEGE?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! ^^/s
---
I had someone say that if i undersold something by more than one copper i was "ruining the economy"
---
The average person is going to take 200-240 hours played to just get to 60. The people who play a LOT and/or daily certainly will clear raids very quickly after each phase. The majority of people won’t even be 60 until like December or later. I think a vocal minority play a lot but many people (myself included) have a family, work and other interests that would prohibit flying to 60 like I did 14-15 years ago. I wouldn’t worry about the game being dead until after maybe a year, when even causal players have raided mc/bwl
---
Thank you, I was about to say this. It's disappointing how many people still see the issue as "man, why are blizzard would mean?!"
---
WoW! And I thought I hated rap before I saw this!
---
My understanding was this was a side effect of melee leeway which basically created double the attack range for melee, which then extended hunter melee which extended their deadzone. Supposedly this is gone already.
---
So much yelling
---
I'm done with PVP, but have just started streaming and I really approve of this.  I like it.
---
What times are you intending to raid?
---
Hearthstone is one hour cooldown.
---
yes it does seem that way but I also saw a lot of posts on blizzard's forums of people who are against classic saying that classic will be big at first but then 90% of people will go back to BFA making classic realms waste of resources and so on
---
The people who will stay with classic the most probably won't be playing retail.
---
You will have people casually playing both keeping number up too.
---
There was a semi recent study on private server concurrent numbers putting it at 100k concurrent players. That is crazy. Concurrent.
---
I have no fears classic will lack players at all, the only thing that will happen is the game will start with loads of people trying it out and discovering the grind isn't for them, so there will be a big dropoff and maybe layer/server merges.
---
After a while it will settle down though. I think the amount of people first picking it up will be bonkers though.
---
Yeah I was getting 200+ on stress test...
---
Gonna suck ass if they make us play on US servers :/
---
This is a problem that 1% will deal with and no, it wont ruin the game for the rest of the millions of players. Stop panicking with everything 😀
---
The culture has completely changed. When I went to highschool computers and technology was nerdy. Nowadays every kid has a smartphone and atleast one gaming console in their house. The gaming nerds are the cool kids now.
---
server: blackrock. Name: Oldbarman. First rogue in 9/9 t3 on server and played dwarf male making the name amazing. Used to hang outside IF and duel in his down time. Eminence were an incredible guild.
---
Tribalism is hugely important to the human pysche.  Politics, religions, sports team fanbases, etc. - people want to belong and they want to have someone to oppose.
---
On this sub shit gets down voted because its easier than typing a constructive comment.
---
All special drops should be needed on in a pug by everyone. Also if something like a flask of the titans drop in a pug run I would say everyone should need on it as well. Doesn't matter if someone is an alchemist or claims to be one. Drops that are worth such incredible amounts of gold should be needed on by every player. Same if some epic BoE gear dropped. I'm going to play a human warrior but I would never expect a pug to pass or greed if say Krol Blade dropped even though it would be preraid BiS for me.
---
Chinglish the aussie streamer confirmed them at Blizzcon, depends how much you believe him.
---
Server: Draenor
---
Player: Armani
---
Class: Mage
---
Reason: Those who were on the server know exactly why this legend deserves a mention. Selling basic tailoring cloths for ridiculous prices on the sole purpose that his marketing strategy revolves around wonderfully ambiguous stories about how his clothing line was the best and how you can one shot ANYTHING as long as you were wearing an Armani Brown Shirt. Probably the richest person on the server back the .
---
And that's why, kids, you don't chill in battlegrounds.
---
Because Hunter's were completely bugfree on '04 launch :-).
---
League is a free to play game. Apples to oranges.
---
I'm sure the people who wanted it to stay the same will.be apologizing soon.
---
oh wait no they'll just latch onto the next thing to use to ruin the project.
---
really? Got a V.O.D? 
---
I don’t see a reason for him to lie about it
---
I have no such fears, most people will not go back to Bfa. Classic is just a better game if you are into mmoRPGs. Simple as that.
---
lol an email isnt a written notice. U need to send an actual letter and sign for it. Atleast where I live
---
The nice thing about this game being around long term is we hopefully have enough time to level a few alts. Embrace the altoholicism :-)
---
A couple of things to consider lets talk about some mandatory talents for leveling. "Precision" hands down, no mater what spec you go you can't skip this. If you urge is Big Ambushes, "Remorseless Attacks" is also mandatory. I don't think i could stomach leveling like this but respecing this [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZG0VZV0gs0h](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZG0VZV0gs0h) at 40 might not be so bad. After your big juicy ambush, use a macro to switch back to a sword to finish off the mob and restart.
---
I’d like to run a 40-Druid MC and BWL raid if I could gather enough cows
---
Thats bullshit. Here is how group goes in trade chat. 
---
LFG SFK, LFM SM. Tell me what country is that language from?
---
How hard it is to wait to play for all of the plebs like myself that can’t get into the beta? BLIZZARD!!! I JUST WANT TO GET MURDERED BY ENDLESS HORDES OF MURLOCS AGAIN!
---
Vanilla had a lengthy, interconnected plot, that wove back on itself and tied in with the events of previous games.
---
A lot of the early horde levelling experience dealt with establishing themselves in the world, the issues that arose as they displaced existing entities and disturbed the status quo. 
---
The early alliance levelling dealt with the fallout from having mobilised so heavily and expended so much military materiel and manpower that the structures on which entire civilisations were build had destabilised and needed propping up and repair.
---
As you moved through the game, different threats and plots emerged that needed dealing with, often as a result of previous events (both in-game and in previous lore). The corruption of the Quillboars in RFD and RFK, the events in Maraudon tended to follow this tack; likewise the Sunken Temple.
---
Once you reached the start of end game there were three or four major paths that the story took, but they weren't linear and tended to weave into each other.
---
The war of the Three Hammers led to the dark iron dwarves opening a portal to the plane of fire and summoning Ragnaros, posing an existential threat to Azeroth. This story was told throughout the game but culminated in BRD, with the death of Thaurissan and eventually MC, with the newly crowned/widowed Queen Bronzebeard of the Dark Irons sending an army of mercenaries to banish the firelord.
---
Blackrock mountain continued to be a source of trouble for both the horde and the alliance, as the Blackrock Orcs of the Original horde, under the control of the Black Dragonflight sought to destabilise both major powers. Either through questioning the legitimacy of Thrall's horde, or through intrigue striking at the very heart of Stormwind with Lady Prestor. The fight was taken to Rend's horde in Blackrock Spire, then the masterminds of the Black Dragonflight hunted down and killed in Onyxia's Lair and Blackwing Lair, where the true horror of Nefarian's experiments on the other Dragonflights was revealed.
---
The Silithids, the ancient insectoid race that battled the Troll Empires for dominance thousands of years ago, arose once again to threaten the Night Elf empire before being contained by the combination of that military juggernaut supported by the combined Dragonflights, once again emerged into the light; first encountered in the Barrens then throughout southern Kalimdor they threatened the newly established horde settlements, while the Night Elves who had previously fought them once again mobilised to contain the threat. The fight culminated in Silithus, eliminating doom cultists before venturing first into the Ruins of Ahn'quiraj and then the Temple of Ahn'quiraj to defeat the enemy in its stronghold.
---
Finally, the Scourge invasion in Warcraft 3 had left much of northern Azeroth (now called the Old Kingdoms) in plague covered ruin, littered with corpses and infested with Undead, a constant threat was simmering under the surface. Both the alliance and horde's interests were threatened. From the early interactions with the Scarlet Crusade, to their stronghold in Stratholme the true manipulation of people's fears and hatreds by the Dreadlords of the Burning Legion was revealed. The full extent to which the curse of undeath had spread was explored as Andorhal was fought over, Scholomance was cleared and eventually Baron Rivendare was killed in Stratholme. But the reach of Arthas Menethil, the Lich King was not truly understood until the Dread Citadel Naxxramas over the Eastern Plaguelands, opened its gates and the Scourge invasion began in earnest, with undead multiple Necropoli appearing and disgorging legions of undead, threatening both Horde and Alliance. With the forces of the Argent Crusade putting aside petty differences to lead the Assault into Naxx itself, eventually the Lich Kel Thuzad was defeated and the Scourge forces forced back to Northrend.
---
Amongst these you also has the stories of Zul Gurub (I almost want to load up retail to see, how my Paladin who is exalted with the Zandalar tribe, is handled in BFA...) and the Gurubashi trolls, the corruption in Dire Maul, the corruption of the Emerald Dream and the Nightmare Dragons and the demonic invasion through the Dark Portal to contend with.
---
So yeah, not much of a plot at all really.
---
Obviously you need it if you don't have it already, in which case you greed.
---
You greed random shit you don't need that would be vendor or DE junk.
---
It's a beta.. that's what a beta is for.. they will fix everything.. /s
---
Except you can't trade in wow on the "trial" or whisper, etc. So it's not really
---
I mean it might nobody knows what will happen after people have played it for a while but I feel there will be enough support to at least keep it going and show that it was a good idea. 
---
I'm certain that will lose steam over time but I don't think to the point where it will be shut down or be viewed as a failure
---
Will do!
---
bfa is a ghost town, sharding ruined it for everyone. So yes it will affect gameplay experience. People will exploit sharding/layering for node, devilsaur, rare mob, pvp escape.
---
Oh you poor innocent child.
---
We will never run out of things to complain about.
---
It's really hard for me to say. TBC is the expansion I played the least in, and I'd love to experience raids like Karazhan. On the other hand, TBC servers would last a few years, before going on to Wrath. Meanwhile Classic's own content could become like OSRS and last for a very long time.
---
You doubt our power?
---
Harambe in the picture made me cry..
---
I hear hype is fun to talk about.
---
Depends on how long you pick to sub for at a time, if you decide to, it's optional. Sounds like you're hurt, and I'm sorry I hurt you.
---
The eye has around 3% droprate so one out of 33 guilds should get one each week on average. There's a chance you might see it drop week 1 or not at all for 2 years though, it's not something you can plan on getting with playing a lot it's pure luck. 
---
I cleared Rag first in the summer of 2005 and then probably almost every week until TBC and didn't see it drop once, but there was a guild on my server who had 2 if I remember correctly.
---
I'm curious to see how this behaves of there's another stress test. Nobody but OP confirmed it but I'm very hopeful.
---
Horde has way cooler races in my opinion. Horde is a brotherhood meanwhile alliance is an army. Stormwind is claustrophobic and feels like maze, but that is just me not being used to it I guess. Ironforge is nice.
---
Now the thing why I love horde cities is because they are under a sky except undercity. Also I am chilling in the city for the people not for the city aesthetics.
---
Never seen n8elf Nate elf. Wtf lol
---
It's a nelf.
---
Why isn't that rogue getting knocked in the air though? Am I remembering that wrong?
---
Ok so first you're overlooking the fact that multiboxers pay for their subs with gold not cash. The whole point is that you are doing it to get extra gold and free play time. You think anyone actually spends $50 a month on subs? The only people doing that are gold sellers who bot until they get banned and they don't give a damn about ganking you because its all about maximising profit.
---
Secondly: 'Dave' the 35 year old still working at McDonalds definitely works as hard as a company director in your mind?
---
It's probably not his fault he's never found success right, he just went to the wrong school in a poor area, and failed classes because of his bad teachers?
---
A lot of the time 'the poorest people' are just those who have given up. I'm not saying they haven't had reason fall into apathy / depression, but hard work and career aspirations are probably the last thing on their minds. They just show up to school or their minimum wage job and do the bare minimum to get by because they hate their situation at work or home and struggle to find passion.
---
Don't vilify someone just because they haven't faced crippling adversity, and have found success through their efforts. It doesn't diminish what they have achieved, and your assumptions only make you look ignorant and/or jealous.
---
I don't know why I'm trying to change your mind, your name is literally 'assburgers' and you apparently think that's okay...
---
Welcome to current WoW. The only relevant content is the latest content, i.e. expansion.
---
When an expansion launches, everything prior to that becomes irrelevant, same applies for patches.
---
I call that shit implementation, Blizzard calls it game design.
---
Eversong woods was the starting zone for Blood Elves, which only were released in TBC, not vanilla.
---
That is exactly what I am saying. I didnt say you have to spec Prot. I'm saying that if you roll warrior you should be tanking your 5 mans.
---
Yup, certain people want that slow pace, it's not for everyone of course, I guess it all depends on what you've played in the past. If you can't from eq classic was a walk in the park
---
If Blizzard doesn't think Germany can muster up enough players to fill a couple of realms, I doubt they believe that y'all down there will be able to, sorry.
---
Fellow Aussie here... fingers crossed! If I'm forced to play on US server it's really going to limit my class choices...
---
I mean..there are people who seem to prefer modern wow than the classic one
---
Since a subscription covers both you'll likely see a lot of people rotate with the patches.
---
I sure hope so \^\^
---
That's a great summary which I will be happy to share with my friend, but it's not really "a plot". It's not "the plot of vanilla". It's a whole army of plots, or, as people are saying, more of a world than a movie.
---
Let's unite the Classic community against the chaotic EU Realms they give, and I think our game will be 100% fixed and ready to deliver tons of fun, directly in our bloodstream. :)
---
Speaking of content, before the demo, etc, this subreddit used to be a lot about Nostalgia, 2005 comics, videos and memes.
---
I'd be glad to see these coming back.
---
Thats the thing about retail.
---
Boost, or grind a toon to max lol with quests and dungeon finder then play in the new zone.
---
Or you can wait till the end of august and explore an entire world.
---
You could never iceblock with the flag still equipped
---
Wow made GAMING mainstream now, oof.
---
They absolutely have to do something to stop the bullshit stacking exploit meta on the pirated realms.   That will destroy Classic's pve.
---
Can you link the Hunter Discord please?
---
I'm planning to play mainly on prime time to meet a lot of people, add them to my friend list and find a guild. 
---
I prepare myself for classic by playing Warcraft 3 again, because many places, NPCs and quests in Classic refer to Warcraft 3.
---
And I watch old wow machinemas back from the day:
---
https://youtu.be/Chc9DwDkWn0
---
https://youtu.be/6kXA7-XoQTA
---
He's speaking figuratively.
---
i just dont know where to start so much things, like wow classic in a few moths,  what is it all about
---
Chill, out work fine legs.
---
The only content that is relevant is the lastest patch form the latest expansions, each patch they basically do a soft reset on your progress. You dont lose that progress but its all meaningless post each patch.
---
I might be wrong but isn't layering only supposed to be in classic for the first few weeks and only the starting zones.
---
DKP is the fairest imo and my preferred preference
---
fucking spam
---
Disappearing Skeletons!
---
Be SEEing you!
---
Wasn’t this just fixed in the past 24 hours? IIRC that video was posted a bit ago, and only recently posted on Reddit.
---
I mean we can still be happy it's not set to 2-3 person layers. There's been a lot of very rude responses inferring a great deal.
---
There are people that prefer fortnite, and i rather not have those in classic.
---
Lootcouncil is better for good and trusted guilds. It has the ultimate freedom of the officers choosing the exact parameters that should be rewarded, and gives natural prioritization for biggest loot progression. 
---
DKP is a very simple and good system. If you want to go with a point based system then DKP does the job just fine without going into complicated system. It is important that it has decay though, or dkp hoarding can get bad. Also DKP naturally gives you freedom to choose what items you get. Lootcouncil can do that, but naturally not as well.

Go with this:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/050531104-053201330301551](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/050531104-053201330301551)   
---
Go with  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=2243](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2243)  and  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18168](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18168) for the armor tier 1 is fine.  
---
If you don't want to put so much money on FRD get  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=1168](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1168) put a spike and done  
---
Holy shield stacks with FRD albeit it is a bit expensive, if you farm the fuck out of it you will always trash one to get 2 and so forth.  
---
Holy shield is worth, specially if you want to tank bosses...  
---
This spec is the best to farm/tank, as you can 2 man a lot of content, and you can pvp (pretty damn good 1v1 vs all melee, you basically one shot rogues)  
---
That holy build is for healers. You don't want to put so many points in holy if you aint getting at least reckoning.
---
pretty obvious that they'll have this fixed before launch.
---
Just for fun, here is your big daddy ambush build. [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMxZGxV00xZV0eshho](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMxZGxV00xZV0eshho), 95% Base crit rate for Ambush.
---
One could argue somewhere along the lines of "People didn't play this way in vanilla so we should force people to play this way in classic". But that's insane. I'm not going to be a clicker watching only the ground in Org so I can get over 6fps either.
---
The reality with this is: only the super tryhard guilds will go over the top with this. Some less try hard guilds will try stacking world buffs but after a while realize it's not for them. This just wont matter to most.
---
Same boat but 11 month old. Gonna go my own pace and enjoy things, hope my friends don't get too far ahead but hey they can't get any further than 60!
---
I get too distracted gathering and fishing anyway...find your own fun!
---
its a lie, they always lie lol
---
Well, yes, but the op claimed biggest game, not biggest game with monthly subscription (in that case it might be one of the biggest since it's a model rarely used).
---
Question from someone with no beta access: does the beta client have the infamous mouse bug? (Sometimes when you use the left or right mouse button your cursor will jump to the center of your screen and mess up your camera or character movement.)
---
I can hardly play on the actual 1.12 client because of the constant mouse cursor jumping.
---
Yea its garbage, ignore it.
---
You should read about QA job before spreading false info. Quality and effectiveness is not even comparable to the horde of bored neckbeards no matter how hyped and passionate they are.
---
How many worthless bug reports did Blizzard employees had to read and delete? Bugs that are actual Classic features, trolls trying to be funny in their own minds and 10k reports talking about the same bug for a month.
---
You might save money as a company but the game will be worse quality wise in terms of bugs and exploits.
---
If you want ease to jump into and be able to play any class (they all work very similarly) then go for retail. You will have a lot more quality of life things like automatic group finders and the like.
---
If you want more of an RPG experience with a community of players. A longer grind but more feeling of a big world (everyone isn't just flying everywhere and actually rides around on mounts). And real feeling of reward when you finish something, go classic. It's also simpler in some regards as there are fewer spells and raid encounters have fewer mechanics as they aren't designed to be run with advisory add-ons.
---
I have played since vanilla with breaks here and there and I have never been more excited for a game than classic wow. I can't see myself going back to retail wow for any extended period.
---
[Gottem!](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/oh-just-get-a-job.jpg)
---
You mean enh shaman?
---
Loot Council sounds horrible unless you're super close to the people in that council. Favoritism BAD. I can't wait to see the drama that explodes out of that shit. 
---
DKP at least rewards you with points for merely showing up even if a raid doesn't happen. I don't know if every DKP guild went to that extent, but they should. I forget precisely how the bidding works, but I at least remember eventually you can guarantee a drop for yourself with enough points and otherwise with low points could still win a bid on an item.. sometimes even at just 2 dkp. What sucks is there is a lot of bookkeeping behind it.
---
Any system is prone to corruption, or could magically have the right people in place to make that system not suck. Good luck, whatever your preference.
---
You will most likely need to overlevel or overgear dungeons to do it but certainly possible.
---
I have no idea what spec he played but my buddy back in college was Grand Marshall on his human paladin Tgcid, and he would march back and forth from one flag room to the other while the whole enemy team beat on him, totally unkillable (obviously with others healing him as well). He eventually refilled warrior but I know for a bit there he was a pvp god as a paladin, in wsg anyway.
---
&gt; Fury Warriors are amazing DPS 
---
*with gear.
---
Expectation: I will get epic weapons first week and be a machine
---
Reality: I will be competing with 12 other people for MH weapon drops which are rare in the first place
---
Fury's fantastic if you're in it for the long game.  It's about the bell curves.  I don't know where the "average geared warrior" stands against the "average geared mage" but it's something to consider, because your gear has a high probability of being average, or even sub-par, for a long time.
---
Wow classic is the re-release of the original version of world of warcraft from the early 2000s following years of fan petitions/begging/demanding.
---
It is nothing like BFA. Harder if you ask me as there is less direction (have to read the quests) and grouping up is almost a necessity. Though in some ways that makes it better than BFA.
---
In my opinion, whatever system is chosen will work as long as the people using it have common sense and try to get along.
---
I.e. if your guild is progressing, chances are people need to accept that the main tank should get most of the major tank upgrades early on, even if that Fury War in the group has 1 more dkp and just suddenly wants it for a tanking set.
---
Both systems can have flaws, but again if the people in the guild seem to have a good head on their shoulders then you'll enjoy the raiding experience with whatever they use. Just be consistent showing up, know your class and people will notice.
---
fair point
---
I just hate it while leveling too, especially because im going to be tanking at 60 for my guild. I am not worried about raising 2h skills.
---
Serafin, undead priest. Solo kited all razorgore trash until eggs were down. The first time I saw it I thought he was hacking.
---
Did you utilize lots of rest exp? Joana was also server first.
---
I don't want to tank bosses.  This is to farm gold with as I raid.
---
Loot council is used in good guilds, dkp works for random sperg guilds i guess.
---
When I raided it made it through Aq and most of naxx. We had a dkp system in our guild and I thought it worked out pretty well. You have to be strategic with how you spend the points, some times you get lucky when most people are waiting for a specific item and get something on the cheap. Other times it’s an all out bidding war and you use all your points. I think it adds an extra layer to the game that encourages guild members to want to participate in guild raids. If you have a consistent raid group then in my experience it works well. If you have casual players that hold onto points then come in a night that you down a boss you been wiping on all week and they get an item off that boss then that sucks. I’ve seen that happen but the gm and officers very rarely can veto that if it betters the guild for progression purposes. 
---
I’ve never been a part of loot council so I can’t speak much on it. I just really like the idea of always having a shot at a piece of gear if you have dkp in place
---
I'm a simple man, I see TotalBiscuit
---
I upvote
---
Well that depends, people underestimate paladins, if you're prepared with consumes and engineering you're gonna own some people for sure. Dispense some divine justice upon those horde criminals! :D
---
Damn cheers, well hopefully he isn't talking shit!
---
And do you have evidence that it's a lie? Or is this a "post something everyone is bitching about for the karma" post?
---
Agreed. Before gearscore and LFD I think Wrath was the best expansion. I wish they could have held off on ever introducing those two things and the game could have kept its prime.
---
Honestly, the best part about being a healer for me is when I'm out in the world.
---
Say I go into this cave for a quest, and I come across a lone warrior struggling with 3 mobs he didn't mean to pull. On his side of the screen I imagine he's quickly shuffling through his bags hoping he has a health potion he forgot about; something to save himself. He's probably resigned to his death, or maybe he tries to run away from them to try to live. Then I come along and get him back to full health in 2 seconds. He can keep fighting, he doesn't have to run back to his corpse, and he's (usually) very grateful for the assist.
---
It's a lovely feeling to be able to help someone and maybe even make someone's day.
---
Multiboxers roll almost exclusively on PvE servers. They are doing it to farm gold 5x quicker, even one character dying to PvP slows down your ability to make profit substantially.
---
thnx for your answere but what would you recommend to a newbie wow player to start with :p
---
[Relevant ](https://youtu.be/WPlnHw7MfME)
---
The only profession that matters is engineering.
---
Ele shaman burst is much scarier. One of the reasons ele is good in PVP and not elsewhere is the full mana you get back when you die.
---
*Mr. Samir Naga... Naga... Naga... Not gonna work here anymore, anyway.*
---
Missing 2 dps means having them would triple your damage output especially since druid isn't exactly the strongest dps.
---
Having longer fights means the healer can go oom and you can't use innervate on every pull.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN\_Cn2L2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN_Cn2L2A) 
---
15% stats  + 15% melee haste &amp; 10MP5 is a huge advantage on this world first. It's was really know and abuse by few guilds in Vanilla while in Classic, now that we know how powerfull they are, it's gonna be common.
---
Your friend has no patience. He will not last in classic, go alliance.
---
Tell him you really want to play with him and hope he can find interest in another class but you both need to be alliance.
---
How people earn the money is irrelevant. It's a question of an unfair advantage solely based on who pays more money, rather than dedication to the game and skill. The very definition of pay to win. I do not think it should be allowed, that's my standpoint.
---
All the power to you my brother - I'll be lucky to play 1-3 hours per day. 
---
You'll need enough sleep or you'll simply be unable to function, making all that time you asked off for irrelevant. What good does it to go strong for a week straight if you have to crash for 2 days after? I say maintain a healthier or at least more manageable daily routine. That'll put you ahead in the end. Really, if you play for 14 hours per day, every day, you are going to be the top 1 percent. 
---
I agree with going for a run. Who said it had to be 30 minutes? A 15 minute run for most people is at or near a mile, depending on your fitness level, which is perfectly fine. Maybe halfway through your session for the day you can knock out some pushups and situps too. I always liked the 'pushups during flightpath' strategy.
---
#nochanges /s :)
---
&gt; P.S For example I remember that when Firestorm (private server) launched their vanilla realm, they shut it down after a month because all people quit. And it scared me that wow classic might end up same way.
---
This is why layering exists.   People are dumb though, and can't seem to understand that simple fact though.
---
Yeaahh!!! So awesome!!!
---
People really need to get off of this world buff band wagon.
---
1. Private server don't implement the cooldown that are part of actual wow. (some cool downs are a week or longer)
---
2. Private servers don't implement the lockouts that are part of actual wow. Certain buffs share timer with other buffs so you can't have both.
---
3. World bosses don't come into play until phase 2.
---
Can we at least if something is broken before we all cry about changes, that don't mean anything to 95% of the population.
---
Before saying #NoChanges you should give proof on how were working world buff in Vanilla. 
---
Else you are not a true #NoChangers and don't know what you talk about.
---
I'd like to reiterate; "hugely popular". All the sheep are getting themselves and each other stirred up.
---
Healing in a 5/10/15 man is a lot of fun for me personally because I feel like I use my whole toolkit over the course of a dungeon but 40 man healing is a lot less compelling. I'm not making snap triage decisions, I'm just playing mana-efficient whack-a-mole.
---
It's honestly no different than any other toolkit in any expansion they've had. You end up with small fast heals and slow casting big heals and then somewhere in between. In Wrath I believe it was, for druids, that was Regrowth, Healing touch, and Nourish. Very much the same things just different names and icons.
---
:crab: STEALTH IS FIXED :crab:
---
It takes like a full second for loot tables to show up and I blame spell batching for it. You don't even have to wait to see the loot to actually receive the items so it feels like really bad lag even if you're around 30-50ms. 
---
Been like that on all the stress tests and it's jarring, not to mention annoying, playing with simulated lag when private servers aren't bothered by this issue.
---
I remember this love story: I surrender 
---
https://youtu.be/cIWY8Sr82Pk
---
woah buddy careful now
---
we dont use logic here
---
only rage and complaining
---
&gt; Dynamic respawn is dynamic, which means that if you are all alone the spawn timer is blizzlike.
---
In my experience, dynamic respawns on private servers aren't this advanced. I've been alone in areas where I couldn't even progress because of the spawn rate, and I've watched people stream their speed leveling where they're AoEing very fast respawning packs while being ahead of the curve.
---
It's almost like this is a 15 year old game and it's not abnormal to expect a game to actually be fully functional on release now, unlike 2004
---
of course i did :P
---
I noticed on the stress test that strafe then stopping to cast seemed delayed. Maybe it was just me, but it seemed like for a second after I stopped strafe it would still say can’t cast while moving. Anyone else?
---
I wouldn't go that far.
---
I'm undead main but I'll need it aswell. Its not just the looks its the prestige feeling if having it.
---
Well it was like that back in the day and blizzard knew about it.. + you get crit so its not like you arent punished for it in some way...
---
They won't affect your gameplay in any way shape or form. The entitlement from the people on these forums amazes me.
---
As a hunter, I would roll need. Deathcharger is a hunter weapon.
---
Staggered itemization should prevent this. For half a year.
---
It might be easier to grasp the concepts if you buy BFA and start a character from level 1, but that will make playing classic a little hard because things wont be the same.
---
For example, currently for cooking skills you can just place a campfire. In classic you have to carry around wood and flint to make a campfire (or just go somewhere that already has a fire). 2 slots for a cooking profession early on is serious when your starting bag is only 16 slots.
---
Also, quests in BFA point where to go on the map and show where to search for things and have sparkle effects for quest relevant items. Classic has none of that. You have to read the quest to figure out where to go.
---
wait for classic. there's a reason we all jumped ship from retail.
---
I think the put some QoL that weren't in Vanilla into Classic to prevent something or they just forgot to remove some functionalities
---
Rabble rabble layering rabble rabble!
---
If it's a pet or mount you don't have, you roll need, if you already have it you roll greed.
---
Yeah ele is better utility imo and overall dps/healing. But those wtf moments are definitely from enh shamans. What you mean full mana when you die?
---
ele?
---
I mean, it's been 10+ years, but I remember getting 1-shotted by 2h enh more than ele.
---
I don't think that's true. Could you point toward the talent?
---
PVP was really awesome as paladin, you felt so invincible. I especially loved walking around healing in hybrid gear and then occasionally switching to TuF and critting unsuspecting people for 1k+ lol. Once you have enough gear for a shockadin it truely gets nuts.
---
Thank fuck it had been 5 whole minutes.
---
Yeah i guess that's true, Blizzard trying to play the long game hopefully it'll work out and we can have what we want.
---
Yeah, these 3 things are quite important.
---
I am just assuming that with the speed they are fixing stuff, they will do it quite soon with leeway, pathing and batchspelling.
---
And my post is not actually about what is left to be fixed...is more about HOW MUCH was fixed and changed and removed by Blizzard to deliver a very good Classic WoW.
---
Feral druids are going to be incomplete in Classic as well. They don't even get weapons until the later phases. :(
---
This was absolutely happening during that big Asmon battle in Arathi a while back - its gonna be super interesting on launch.
---
Even if it was, it's for the purpose of a beta. We're not on live, people are not treating this as a work in progress, it's insane...
---
You will need to put in a lot of extra effort and farm pummelers and learn how to powershift, with that it can even be beneficial to the raid to take a feral because of the 3% crit aura.
---
Prot Warrior and Holy Priest husband/wife combo looking for Horde guild on PVP server which will do high end PVE content. Preference is for raiding times friday/saturday nights. Both in our 30's.
---
If this sub could stop sniffing its ass for a split second or two and start a serious discussion about how gnomes commit 50% of the ninja looting despite making up just 13% of the alliance then we could make some actual progress..
---
Ret paladins can be pretty painful in PvP. Their big weakness is lack of charge though.
---
Dicks out buddy, dicks out...
---
Honestly I would've left right click report in, just for the sake of quicker reporting gold sellers
---
Because everyone knows a game company can only make 1 game. Ever.
---
They do fix bugs, but there are some (Hunter Pet) that needs fixing after years, that's the one they talk about. Let's see if they do the same here, if they do, well they won't be able to say shit after that.
---
Current plan is 7-11 CET as we have members ranging from -1 to +2 timezones
---
Wednesday / Sunday
---
Its not set in stone yet
---
DKP requires a good deal of finagling to work acceptably.  
---
It encourages hoarding dkp, and passing on upgrades.   I saw lots of good stuff get de'd.
---
It also encourages people to show up farm nights above progression nights.   
---
New recruits are sort of fucked, and they never get anything except the scraps that no one else wants. 
---
Loot council's primary problem is that the people in charge of it have to be trustworthy, which you have NO clue as to whether or not they are.
---
"then 90% of people will go back to BFA"
---
90% of 100 BfA people isn't a whole lot compared to the hundreds of thousands of Classic players ;). I hope anyone who plays BfA and doens't like Classic, goes back. That'll be a whopping 25% Classic playerbase at the absolute most IMO, going back to BfA. Don't like it? Don't play it. Very simple concept. Especially when a Sub pays for both and either choice is available at all times.
---
Classic will have so many players, that no one will notice or care if BfA players bounce. Most of the Classic players are people who currently don't play WoW anyways due to the direction it's gone over time. I personally stopped after WotLK. 
---
Whoever is spouting that crap that you mentioned, sounds incredibly biased and jealous af. People also hate what they fear, fyi. Very common human instinct, sadly.
---
I certainly dont share your concern because there is a lot more to do at 60 than in BfA. And even if there wasnt anything to do i wouldnt go back to retail before the next expansion anyway. My friends feel the same way
---
A lot of people on this sub dont play retail anymore though.
---
I've always found getting back into Retail somewhat difficult on a new expansion and heavily relied on friends to tell me what the deal is, then gradually I get dragged in and I find myself knowing way too much about the game than I really need to know. My point is that the initial learning curve can be somewhat off putting, from Artifact Weapons to Azerite Gear etc, theres always something new you need to learn along with the zones and the class changes. Honestly I would recommend Classic above Retail personally and the main reason is that above all else its the simplest form of the game, it has the lowest amount of dungeons to learn the least amounts of classes to learn and so on.
---
I also think that Classic is a better MMO Experience but that is incredibly subjective and my personal opinion.
---
For leveling i like to be tailoring, there are a lot of nice useful items you can make yourself while leveling with it. If you do that i suggest tailor/skinnner or tailor, herb/mining if you intend of having engineering later go mining that way you will already be able to have that profession leveled up so you can then swap to it. But ideally if you are a mage or warlock engy/tailor is a good bet at max level for your robes and eventually bloodvine.
---
No headless horseman :(
---
Honestly aside from tanking no role is really rewarding in PvE. Most casters cast a single spell, maybe two if there's aoe. Most melee's rely on their auto attacks. Druids have a very engaging rotation, but it's very very reliant on farming certain places for mats. Rogues rotation is a bit more complicated, but again it's pretty auto pilot. Most the fun I remember from vanilla is the experience of the raids and the fun had with the people, not the perfect rotations and oh-shit awesome plays.
---
Yes, and again we're allowed to be happy it's back to normal. Stop treating anything anyone in the beta says as if we're ignorant if the purpose of the beta. We're still allowed to be annoyed by stuff necessary or not. 
---
We don't need to be shouted down with the same tired phrases that we already know. We're back to having fun which is ALSO something we're allowed to do.
---
Back in the day ele wasn’t appreciated as much as it is now.
---
Anyone that buses this should be reported and banned.   I will be reporting anyone in my guild that I see doing this.
---
That’s because at least in PvE individually there really isn’t much exciting at all. Classes are extremely simple to play, some are even literal one button specs, so you’re not playing PvE because you want this super difficult experience where you really challenge yourself and become the better player. It’s really all about the group effort and preparation, where the fun lies. When you get 40 people to all do their jobs so everything just flows like water is a pretty nice feeling.
---
Nah, Ele is pretty hardcore and reliable. Enhance needs to roll quite a few dice to oneshot you
---
I hope new animations too because I am absolutely confused how people think this is better other than bUt It WaS iN vAnILlA
---
I'm already in your boat fella. It's seriously going to be fine and even better than fine, as long as they keep to their word.
---
The fear-baiting mongrels and trolls aren't in the same boat though. :P
---
Whoa now that you mention it yeah that was pretty obvious while playing the beta.
---
Buses eh? Bit rude to hate on people using public transport.
---
Probably only a German and a French realm. Everything else would make too much sense for Blizzard.
---
Your bot is malfunctioning. This is a 10 day old comment on a video game subreddit.

Hey, it seems like &lt;Super Best Friends&gt; may fill some of those requests. We are a casual, family style guild with mostly working class people. However, we are EST, but if you find yourself unhappy with your PST choices come check us out. We have a post under the alliance pve area
---
This is why I am quite confident that layering will have minimum impact on Classic live, and layer hoping will be drastically hampered, compared to beta.
---
I mean, beta is underpopulated (like 300 players per faction) and hoping a layer is easy...because of how few players are and because layers are TESTED.
---
There is a HIGH chance that in Classic live, you might end up in the SAME LAYER you are, when joining a party that you ASSUME it's on another layer...because there are much more players in live and the layers are EXACTLY the number they were supposed to be...unlike beta where layering was basically SHARDING, because so few people are playing it, and layering was tested on a very small number of people.
---
The problem with DKP is that it is guaranteed not what it says on the tin. That guild WILL reserve items, rhey WILL make extra rules for when raids other than Ony/MC exist, and they will honestly be just as corrupt as half of the LC guilds put there.
---
Put first and foremost finding a guild that is fun to play with and has a sense of fairness about them. The system isn't as impprtant, at least in my experience.
---
*  \- Will achieve level 60 within less than 14 days.  
---
There are other, imo beter systems.
---
&gt;The irony of course, is the game you are arguing had a dreadful, terrible launch   
---
&gt;went on to be the biggest MMO of all time  
---
&gt;.   That's right, the queues, in the end,   
---
&gt;didn't matter at all  
---
&gt;.  What mattered was the game.
---
every article mentions that. You apparently didnt read any of the sources. and WoW being the greatest MMO of all time doesn't mean it's good. It just means everything else is shit. and WoW is the main culprit as to why MMO's are shit. WoW was 1st mmo to remove negative progression, losing levels/gear/your character entirely. WoW was the 1st MMO to feature hand holding quest hubs. MMO's since then have tried to follow suit. WoW:BFA is literally a sliver of its former self. People hate what its has become.  If you think 3-6 hours queue's from classic launch. And queue's again that long or longer for Draenor launch don't impact people's desire to play the game? You are very wrong.
---
Bears already have taunt, aoe taunt also.
---
Think of it as communism vs capitalism. There are pros and cons to both systems
---
what about strafing?
---
You’re not going to survive one day out there, lmao
---
"fixed" by making it worse.
---
I know people here will be rabid at this but everyone who thinks this is better is just a fucking moron.
---
BuT vAnIlLa AuThEnCiTy
---
Looks damn cool to me. I get if you don't like it, but it's the correct animation and that's what we should strive for.
---
I'm glad blizzard changed it.
---
I've always dreamed of pally tank, balance/resto druid, and warlock. So many of the dmg return buffs!
---
Timelimit is only specified in so far that it will be gone when phase 2 hits, no one knows when that will be. And a layer will contain a whole continent, not only the starting zones. What the dude suggests that it is only going to affect 1% of the population is ridiculous. Everyone will see people disappear and appear sometimes while playing, bet on it.
---
Did they fix windfury?
---
Circlejerk about how streamers are ruining everything.
---
There's still 2 month, let's give them the benefit of the doubt for now since they seem to be working on it. Hopefully we don't have to shit on them in 2 month because of it.
---
name them!
---
In the Beta of a game where they're testing layering technology.. I mean, I know that you know that it's a beta but it just looks weird when you comment on how it "makes a server look dead" as if that might be the case when they release it.
---
There's still like 20+ Hunter class breaking bugs in the game though. I don't know how it is for other classes because I'm going to playing a Hunter so there's a lot of things to do!
---
Oh wow, so they just have to disable sharding and wuuuuusssshhhh subs are again at 10millions?
---
You should go and work at Blizzard, you will make them and you a lot of money.
---
Thanks, really helpful. Can engineering not support you on the levelling process, if you level the progression early and aggressively? Also some enchant and potions such as swift or FAP in your bag can help you get the upper hand?
---
Super Best Friends plans on raiding 6pm-10pm on wed/Thursday, not sure what style you are looking for but we are mostly wow veterans with casual, family playstyles due to most of us being working class people. Either way check out our post in alliance pve area.
---
BY FIRE BE PURGED!
---
And why do you think Paladin is a bad choice for pvp? Warriors are sitting ducks without their personal support.
---
A reckoning paladin is a terror in smaller scale pvp. You make an excellent offensive support in Warsong, you are great at protecting flags in arathi. And with decent gear, you can be as dangerous offensively as a warrior, as you are more self sufficent.
---
The warriors advantage is, that he scales much better with support behind him, but on your own, you are better off as a paladin.
---
Oh didn't knew that I've never played vanilla druid
---
You can work on spelling, “hopping.”
---
Ele shamans run out of mana really fast. Doesn't matter in pvp. Pop trinkets, nuke someone, repeat ad infinitum.
---
Having fun is alright if you don't drown the subreddit with illegitimate rage. Being annoyed by layering when it's currently being TESTED is unbelievably cringe.
---
Yeah how about no
---
Stances and certain abilities requiring a certain stance. Especially Charge and Intercept (as well as Intervene in TBC). I've heard some warriors complain that you can't use charge in combat in classic or that you need to be in battle stance, but I always loved that you used charge to open battle and to generate resources - and if you wanted to use it mid battle you had to create opportunities by kiting.
---
For me, Stances was the core of the warrior class; what made warriors warriors and not meele class template 4 (which they feel like now).
---
It does but there is a console command to fix it.
---
It escapes me right now but I'm sure a simple Google will find it.
---
Except it doesn't give advantages not in PvP/leveling/Endgame. You need advantages for it to be pay to win. Having multiple characters in game isn't a pay to win...
---
People are different, weird right.
---
I hate new model animations. They ruined UD male casting. It used to look so cool now it looks weak.
---
Not to mention dwarf running animation, humans too, tauren looking like they went soft and cuddly etc.
---
I just wish these were more vocal about it than the other part, cause that must ruin the devs' day when they read all that negativity...
---
this is so good, almost makes me want to switch to rogue for classic
---
How are you not banned yet you've had this removed a dozen times.
---
I agree. Now, pointing out that if layering is done in a certain way it would be bad is good feedback. Panicing because that is one option out of many doesnt seem very reasonable to me.
---
Hell yeah! Got our style back!
---
&gt;We cleared MC a week after it was opened on fresh launched server in 2007.

If you want to see some classic ele shaman one shits look up ioneye. Pretty much the shaman version of pom pyro 2 min mage.
---
Allowing a world buff stacking exploit is a change.  It's a change of what blizzards role is, which is to fix exploits.   Blizzard's stance is on things that trivialize raid encounters is crystal clear.
---
It's both, but you can easily get hit for 5 in in under 2 seconds from an ele shaman. WF is great and incredibly satisfying but for me ele was the bomb.

Hey there! Super Best Friends is gonna be raiding wed/Thurs 6-10pm est. It seems like your previous play resume is a lot like mine, although I only got up to twin emps as a mage. Either way we are a casual, family style guild. While mage does seem popular in our guild currently, we have a real "We'll make it work" attitude. If you interested send me a message and check out my post in pve alliance area for more details.
---
Give retail a try - maybe you like it more than classic! There is still millions of People really enjoying it :)
---
But after that come and Play Classic and give that a try too! I'm curious to see what you like more =P
---
Paying someone to do a job and expecting that job to be done on time isn't greed. If I pay a contractor to remodel my bathroom and that contractor slips their estimate, I'm not greedy for expecting either a) it will be done by the agreed upon time. Or b) the contractor will continue the work after the deadline free of charge and I won't be expected to cover their hourly cost.
---
I'm not greedy in this scenario. We have agreed upon a deal in good faith. The same thing holds true for these development studios. They made promises to the people who are paying "to keep the lights on." So they have two options, crunch time coding, or try and convince the investors that they need more time and hope that those people are willing to shell out more money. Just because money is exchanging hands doesn't just immediately make this a greed based thing. The fact is, the real customer paid for something to be done, and it either needs to be done time, or these studios can expect to be working for free until it is. It's more simple and less stressful to work long hours, than to dedicate 30-40 hours a week maintaining your real work schedule and not having a paycheck coming in
---
Someone on the forums pointed out in detail why they can’t actually fix Layer Hopping as easily as people think: 
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/were-not-making-enough-noise-about-layering/204620
---
So honestly it seems like layering IS what we’ll be spending the next several weeks and months discussing.
---
I'm really fucking high on heroin
---
They will probably raise the level cap to 50 within 3-4 weeks.
---
That will keep your sweet cheeks busy untill release ;)
---
People will split their time between BFA and Classic based on their interests. Most of us here, for example, will probably play Classic exclusively and dabble with BFA later. Ideally Classic's release will have a positive impact on BFA and future expansions. I plan on resubbing in the near future and trying BFA. 
---
I think Classic is an objectively much better mmorpg. Those who can do without the QoL improvements will find it to be more rewarding, engaging, etc.
---
The problem with Joana's guide its all quests. There are plenty of quests which are instant skip ones and better just grind out the exp. Especially when F R E S H and huge competition over quest mobs.
---
One point also taking into consederation is that hunter has least downtime of all classes when it comes to grinding and questing, thats why world record is made with that precise class.
---
Nevertheless its a solid quide especially if your not familliar with vanilla zones and hubs and if you gonna quest alot. I will use a similar route aswell, but tweaking it for some parts.

You don't seem to understand how multiboxing works at all. Oh so Johnny has 10 mages all casting frostbolt at the same target. Johnny slaves all his controls through one character. What happens when 3/10 of his mages die and respawn at mines? How about when 2 more die and respawn at blacksmith? Jonny boxer now has 1/3 of his team useless and that doesn't sound like its going to help him.

Can you explain the thinking behind not having 3/3 improved gouge? Are you also aware of the primary benefit of using the hemo attack? Can you explain it to me? I'd like to test your understanding of why a hemo build is so powerful.
---
\&gt;(I've started prioritizing Spirit before Stamina while leveling

I would really like you to rethink this opinion.

&gt; The reality with this is: only the super tryhard guilds will go over the top with this.

You are fucking dreaming...

Horde side here, for Boulderfist EU!  I honestly remember CHN running rampant on the alliance side, so many large battles :D
---
His decision. If it was me, I would have played what faction I want and let others do the same. He need to chooze, what he loves most, playing with his friends, of playing shaman in a different faction. As simple as that. And what is the problem in playing different factions? In BC me and a few friends played alliance, and one of our friends played horde and it was constant jokes fuel with no seriousness or problems. Ask him, why he likes shaman so bad, perhaps he is just saw a few vids how OP shamans are and think this class is the best.
---
Chill fine, work legs out.
---
How's that any different to just dying to any nearby mob and spirit ressing?
---
I always remember dying to an undead (mage I think?) named DangerDave as an alliance on Skullcrusher.
---
Yesterday I had an Argument with someone saying that the hunter bugs are never gonna be fixed. I would be delusional for thinking Blizzard is actually going to fix anything in the coming two months... Just pointless to argue with some People sometimes. 
---
The worst Thing is when they don't even have a clue what they are talking about xD
---
It's not like Blizzard is just chilling and thinking the game is perfect as it is right now :d 
---
Thanks for the post! Some People should really listen to this..
---
If people can find a way to complain about missing trees then imagine the reaction when the next "big" bug/complaint arises - and with even less time to fix it! People will always yearn and salivate for Classic while simultaneously holding the company making it in contention and have no faith in them.

Also, all of the PvE content in vanilla is a joke with or without the buffs, if you dont agree with that buffs &amp; gear arent where i would start improving.
---
I see what you mean with Precision.. Everyone seems to love that talent :p
---
Ur a moron
---
Why wouldn't BIS be force reflective disk?
---
Naughty secrets.
---
So, they had 2 of 7 world buffs?  Not 7/7, and this was the final boss of Naxx.   I think this kind of disproves your case.
---
I don't see how it's 95%? 45% + 5% + 40% = 90%  
---
Where's the last 5%?
---
My guild will be using a LC format but we have a spreadsheet where we plug you in. So we have myself and my two buddies managing it so i for instance am in charge of handling all the tank loot and the physical dps loot. We are going to base your loot eligibility based on attendance, performance, and attitude. If you show up every raid day ready to raid do your job you are going to do well in chances of loot. Each raid tier members will  give their respective LC leader their top 5 items that they would want to receive.  IE: MC loot, 1. Strikers Mark, 2. Flameguard Gauntlets, 3. Onslaught Girdle so on and so forth. Then i will look at the other physical dps players and rank the players and the items that they wanted to get. After doing so it will be placed into the spreadsheet so that people can see when exactly they will receive an item. It works really well and it is fully open to all eyes for any types of discussion.
---
Yup, my thoughts exactly. Reports are fine, not only reasonable but necessary, but panic and rage is so very not.
---
I hope spy doesn't  make it to classic because it would ruin the way pvp interactions work in the world, even though I loved it on retail. That is one add on I hope blizzard breaks.
---
I think leeway is the biggest sin out of these three. Personally, I could live with batching as long as the other two are addressed.
---
Yep. I think by virtue of being more reasonable/mature, that also can mean much less vocal.
---
New animations are shite.
---
WTF I was just about to comment this!
---
healing is super fun, unless you manage to get in a guild with poor management and stupid leaders that think that topping healing meters is a good measurement for being a good healer.
---
ive seen way to many examples of players misunderstanding this very simple subject.
---
Actually its not 4% per week since _someone_ will get it, and that same person next week wont be rolling on that item if it drops again
---
It’s ok, stay confused.
---
Since I don’t play BfA now, I am not likely to ‘go back’ to it. You have this possibility with any new game launch though. 
---
I thought SWTOR would be big, pre-purchased 6 months and everything. Old guild mates from SWG were all excited. It died. 
---
A bunch of us were excited about Age of Conan. It died.
---
It just isn’t something you can worry about, since you can’t do anything about it. Create your toon(s), play your game, and we’ll see how this goes. For my part, I’m not one that will go back to retail, ever again.
---
I've been having fun theory crafting this one. I call it the Farmadin build.

Other than that stack spell power. Don't worry about all the 2h ret stuff, that's for when i'm not AOE farming.

Give us the keyring! But seriously, great work from Blizzard.
---
Cringe video
---
Me and a buddy do this during raids. He the main tank and me the off tank. We get in guild discord together. And have it set push to talk. And then call eachother on skype and have it open. So we can talk to eachother at all times but still be able to communicate to the raid.
---
Yeah I mean what do they think, that the beta is just a preview? :') And then some people still consider it okay to be annoyed by things that are being tested, it's mind boggling! Let's hope this sub gets a bit more positive
---
Dude.. BfA did nothing right. The story is so fucking atrocious its sad. Its quite literally the worst story Blizzard has ever told.
---
You are gas lighting like a mother fucker, and trying to twist what was said.   He said they were designed to stack, and it was intended for you to use them to get over humps in progression.  It was not intended for you to stack all 7 and trivialize raid content.
---
So literally?
---
There is nothing wrong with layering
---
EU Servers.
---
&gt; I DON'T CARE IF BLIZZARD SAID THEY'RE GOING TO STOP LAYERING BLIZZARD ARE LIARS ION LIES ALL THE TIME I HATE THIS COMPANY BUT CAN'T WAIT TO PAY THEM FOR CLASSIC REEEEEEE WHERE'S MOMMY I NEED GOOD BOY POINTS TENDIES
---
We seem to be talking past each other here. Hamstring isn't a tool to dump extra rage, it's a tool to generate rage. Windfury, Sword Spec, HoJ etc. Can use pvp gloves to make Hamstring cost 7, the excess rage is spent on Heroic Strike.
---
But even more important than that: 2h fury is an Alliance build so you shouldn't even be comparing it to a Horde build in the first place. If you truly believe 2h fury belongs on the Horde side, then go ahead lol.
---
[This video explains everything you need to know about 2h fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI8FzDYk2ro) and he's already telling you it's Alliance only in the beginning.
---
Lots wrong if im honest,  
---
Holy  
---
ImP SoR - Great for tank and anyone not levelling Ret also amazing for reckbombs and Spll Pwr builds - should be "OK" not bad  
---
Consecrate - should be good - too many uses - rank 1 for popping stealth rogues or with + spll dmg for example  
---
Imp SoL - should be white atleast in a raid setting its great  
---
Prot  
---
Precision should be green. For holy spam in not great but for leveling and every other builds its a top pick  
---
Imp Dev aura, maybe white as som1 usually specs it for raids  
---
Imp Conc - i would put as white - Spiritual focus is normally a  must take which gives you the 100% interupt and the 15% on silence effects is good but not reliable enough for me to be green  
---
Imp righeous fury should be green - Yes if your not tanking its meh and you would never take it... but for the job its meant to do its the best talent in the tree.  
---
There my main gripes, we would disagree on a few other but i suspect thats down to build paths  / roles we like to play
---
I think you may have replied to the wrong person.
---
There shouldve been Horde and Alliance, and then Neutral playable races like NE, BE, Forsaken, etc.
---
Ohh my you are so good lil pirated server warrior.
---
sigh, a man can dream
---
Always can be better. We will find what about to moan:d
---
Yo Bro :D Did you see the bug fixes hitting the beta today? :) Sounds like they are actually Fixing things :O Was Kind of delusional to think they wouldn't do it - right? :P
---
And like i said above, the vanilla raids are a joke with or without the buffs, all they do is turn a 1 hour bwl into a 30 min clear.
---
#~~Classic is dead~~
---
No wait it's back on, folks!
---
But honestly I haven't really played anything other than Vanilla and some BC, so actually everything gives me nostalgia.
---
I'm going back to school full-time to finish my undergrad (also working full-time, like most adults who go back to school). My college semester starts the 26th.
---
FML
---
U good?
---
leave it to blizzard to release a game in 2019 with shitty graphics.
---
From what I've seen, in PvE you get cheap combo points and still pretty good damage if you've got decent damage on your main hand together with the slight damage increase from the debuff on every hit. In PvP it enables stunlocking together with Dirty Deeds, which seems great but for grinding it doesn't deal enough damage to be really effective. That's all that I've heard, if I happen to be wrong/have missed something completely, please enlighten me :) That's why I'm here after all.
---
Tailoring end game for hit rating set thats bis until Aq40///naxx
---
I have a friend that sometimes tries to get me to play Horde. I did try a bit on an alt, but disliked the aesthetic. For me.. nope, Alliance all the way.
---
He’s a shitty friend just make alliance characters and hel get over it
---
I did it all back in 05/06 aswell
---
Agreed, the old one makes zero sense
---
You act as if vanilla also incredibly bursty and that druids/shaman scant also cure poison with aoe/over time.
---
The biggest thing going. For paladins isn't that they are extremely mana efficient in PvP (fights don't last that long) its that they have a button to break out of any cc/stun, be totally invinceble for ~10 seconds and spam heals. It's divine protection that makes them so good in PvP. They have a regular use "oh shit" button that requires no skill, but is on the verge of game breaking.
---
On the flip side, if you can lock down a paladin or force them to waste their bubble early, they are actually useless. Shamans have mana problems because they would be op if they had longevity. Its the tradeoff of high (referencing elemental ) damage, and heals. Paladins just have damage type immunitees and heals, so naturally they are the best at the only thing they can do.
---
Paladins are incredibly powerful support class, no doubt there. They are not however unbeatable and do require counterplay. The counterplay coming from shamans purging their shit and able to easily burst them down from half HP at range at any time. Horde however doesn't always have an Ele shaman around to even out the playing field.
---
and in August we will chase some more dragons
---
Yeah, that's very true. You don't react immediatly, you sit there and think about it, and then wonder if it's of any use to react at all since the other party is filled with baboons... Bah, at least I hope the dev team sees the positive feedback as well, and there is a lot of positive after all since people are having a lot of fun overal
---
A second character is cheaper and more efficient?
---
We  are on the same page there ;)
---
Maybe some guilds paid for their tank to respec... but not that I know of. Essentially, there is no such thing as weekly respecs in vanilla, it's just way too expensive.
---
That would not work as you're giving a few races a HUGE advantage. What if I want to play human, but want to be neutral? Too bad
---
Then they could make neutral faction optional for all races, but then everyone would *obviously* (as we're human) choose that advantage.
---
Restrictions are necessary and good for an MMORPG, and there should NOT be an option to opt out of some restrictions.
---
Layering is trash
---
And like I said, that's a retarded argument.
---
I subbed these past two days because I like the discussion about mechanics and bugs. Hopefully it stays that way until the next stress test.
---
Summary for Others; Same stuff you've been seeing on Reddit. Exactly the same. Opinion based, paranoid, only focusing on negatives. Nothing new here, please move along folks.
---
How is it sad? You just relog and play retail... Seriously.
---
I personally would love to see them add more/expand upon the current ones in the game.
---
My main was a pally, and my alt was a rogue.
---
I’d do dungeon stealth runs to pick chests and they’d always have mana pots.
---
I had a 2 full banks worth at my peak lol
---
Indeed - they are bound to develop something at some point - so why not go in that direction, if Classic becomes a succes?
---
Also depends if youre rich ingame or not, i havent paid a single $ in years, doesn’t mean it’s free to play fucking braindead monkey.
---
I got 7 days first time playing vanilla on pserver as a warrior while being completely stuck in a 15k zerg.
---
&gt; This is why I am quite confident that layering will have minimum impact on Classic live
---
Really? Of all things, an underpopulated beta realm toggling layering off for a moment is what gives you confident?
---
Also why are you capitalizing random words in every sentence? Really annoying to read tbh.
---
that's cool, but there's bigger issues with engine itself, things like strafing to gain extra range on melee (and abilities...) needs to get fixed or you'll see tauren warriors autoing you from 12y away
---
Don't skip leg day
---
TBC sure did a great job balancing
---
Someone linked said post 2 days ago and it really hasn't improved so far. My response from the other thread:
---
&gt;There's nothing "perfect" about it. OP assumes the hype is not enough to clog the servers, and believes the only "fix" is a cooldown on switching layers. The often talked about "only switch layers in inns/main cities" is a really good solution and ignored by him. He says queues and dynamic respawns are enough, but that wont stop dead servers from people leaving the game.  
---
&gt;Layering deserves criticism, but that thread is bad.
---
I mean, how can you honestly believe that the starting areas on launch are not the time the server is the most flooded? And how can you miss the thousands of ideas on how to fix layering? I mean:
---
&gt; You cannot fix the abuse of layering without removing or fundamentally changing the system period. 
---
That's so god damn wrong.
---
Instead of his bad layer-switch cooldown idea, the best idea I've seen so far is restricting layer switches to rested areas (or even main cities) and keeping your layer between logins. That would solve like 99% of the abuse cases.
---
This is definitely a move in the right direction, but there are still a laundry list of hunter bugs, some of them gamebreaking, and without blue confirmation, there's really no reason to assume that RCR wasn't just disabled by mistake or disabled for the beta.  The last official word on RCR was something akin to "It's happening, so shut up and accept it."  Not to mention, only level 1-40 has even been tested.  There are still plenty of zones and plenty of abilities that have bug potential.
---
It's definitely a pleasing sign that they're fixing bugs, but that's what the beta is supposed to be for.  You don't get medals and accolades for doing the bare minimum expected in your job description, or providing the bare minimum service you've been paid to perform.
---
When blue makes a post on RCR or Layering that addresses the problems and confirms a change, then I'll praise them for listening to us.  If they fix anything less than all the bugs found by players during testing, it's not cause to celebrate Blizzard for trying hard.  There may have been individual workers who worked really hard, but the end result, in that case is that the game will be released with a ton of bugs because they didn't give themselves enough time for QA.
---
Listen, i hate world buffs, its aids to collect them every week and stay logged out on the main, but im still willing to do it again for one simple reason, authenticity of vanilla wow, no changes.
---
You have to understand that people played with dial up and looked at the floor and had 2 fps in Ironforge. Is that what Classic is about too? That experience? Cmon, this is obvious a change for the better, the old one looked stupid. Just like leeway, just like spell batching. There are a few tiny stupid things that should be changed.
---
Our guild payed only of you should change your main role in the raid for the good of the progression.
---
Respec cost was the same till WotLK (I stopped then).
---
They still need to add hit FX (sparks/blood) when you attack. They were in Retail Vanilla (something to do with /console ViolenceLevel or something, it was default set to 2).
---
This just outright doesn't work in Classic WoW which makes all melee attacks feel unimpactful and floaty.
---
I would say from a lore perspective it's [Barov Family Fortune](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=5341)
---
It perfectly encapsulated the Forsaken / Stormwind rivalry without going stupid with holocaust levels of villainy.
---
There's two brothers, the older is Forsaken, the younger is human, who claim the land. The Older says it's his land because he's not dead. The younger obviously disagrees because he has died. 
---
Oh and you get a cool trinket where 3 dudes attack enemies for 30 seconds.
---
Hardly. The post offers several unique reasons why layering is bad and does mention its positives. On the other hand your comment here does nothing to explain why any of the points presented are wrong, you’re just being negative for the sake of it, maybe getting some stress out that you have about other issues or something.
---
Since?
---
You dont alter the mona lisa, you respect history.
---
I don’t see the difference
---
If you are a Tauren it’s the only horde you can ride I think
---
I'm even worse. I'm one of those evil people that doesn't believe the game has to be EXACTLY like it was. I mean, I like the idea of being able to right click and suggest to add to group... It's not like you're getting mounts at lvl 20. 
---
I think there's a group of people out there combing through to find any difference so they can post it on here and be noticed on the internet.
---
I'm guessing there's somewhere between 1 and 500 layers if there are 500 players online. You know, for testing purposes. It's a beta, not an early access gameplay showcase.
---
Apparently you have no clue what you are talking about Machcia1 - what exactly is Blizzard's beta process then? I'm curious
---
Karazhan was great fun i TBC! Dailys where not...
---
240hrs is 10 days played. 
---
I played extremely casually on a private server which could be off a bit but my played at 60 was like 9.5 days. 
---
But, it took my like three months of real life time to accrue that much time.
---
I mean half the challenge of tier 1 and 2 was just filling spots with raid ready people.  Get Judgement and Ass Candy and go to town.
---
They expressed an opinion. Many others have. It's still in beta, we don't know what the final version will be.
---
Haha you crack me up. :) Someone camping another player with 
---
5 shadow priests for example isn't an advantage in PvP? Clearing dungeons and keeping all the stuff for yourself isn't an advantage in PvE? More characters are stronger and can do more things. If they weren't there would be no reason to multibox.
---
This just isn’t true. Any computer can’t run classic at max graphics and have zero FPS drops. Where did you pull that one from? The classic client hasn’t worked well on my high end laptop. I can run the vanilla client at a solid 60fps but classic client runs weird and the settings are much different. Something with adjusting the resolution and windowed modes is making it difficult. Wonder if anyone else has experienced this.
---
Yah, I caught that after I posted it, but I was hoping no one would see.  I didn't want to try to figure it out.  I think it would take like 4 months on avg.
---
Yeah, Blizzard keeps ruining community by fixing things too early, nothing new!
---
More than "half as good". I'd say the difference between a tryhard feral and a tryhard rogue is some 20-30%, depending on faction, fight, etc. I'd also say a tryhard feral can be on par with a tryhard hunter.
---
Further, ferals do bring extra utility.
---
Again, just saying.
---
You will still have fun and have a great experience:)
---
It is free, why are you so angry that it's free with members being optional. You can use bonds, that is just another way to not pay, that even better.
---
I can login and play just fine with any of my accounts that don't have members, and I can trade and chat, pvp.
---
Keep on getting red in the face though, about osrs, for some reason.
---
TIL it removed a different 3 out of 6 types of cc for each class.
---
&gt; queues
---
Not really, more servers solves that. But then everyone is spread out and in a month, you have dead servers when the tourists leave. Which is exactly what layering is meant to prevent.
---
What huge advantage? The advantage of being lore consistent? The neutral factions would be bound by a similar +rep -rep system. There can be advantages to each side like there js now. You want a paladin? Only Alliance has those in Humans and Dwarves. You want a shaman? Only Horde has them. Etc. see, still have restrictions. I think with enough brainstorming we’d come to agree
---
"Exactly" - I fixed your spelling error. It's the same old crap regardless of if he had 1% positives; Also I did mention "some constructive criticism" which would include negatives and positives in it. It's weird that you assume otherwise, then again judging by the weird support-boner for this post... I guess it makes sense for you.
---
You're doing a really weird projection right now. I'm sorry you feel so poorly. Maybe you're the one with stress?? Either way, I wish you a good day and I hope you work that out fella.
---
haha Grimgore actually has a montage where he kills me and Electron, who was going for GM at the time. I only managed rank 9 I didn't have time for the grind as a young highschooler
---
I don't see a problem.
---
If anything, it's the whiny, patronizing threads like this that make the sub worse.
---
What's wrong with batching? Is it different from vanilla?
---
Never seen such a bullshit comment :P How would they not be able to fix this in 2 Month's? xD Do you even know anything they are doing right now? Do you even know how far their internal build is? It might be fixed for the most part we just don't know yet... Well - we do now a Little bit. A lot has been fixed today.
---
But please don't spread such negtivity when you have got no clue what you are talking about because People will read it and believe it like sheeps do...
---
Speaking of smaller bugs, sure there is time to fix those.
---
When people complain and want to see a change in the layering system for example, 2 months is pretty much nothing in the game dev world and not enough time to come up with alternate systems or a big overhaul at all.
---
Especially with layering, since that has to be ready when we launch. You cant change the server division after with a hotfix.
---
Hey don't ruin my tantrum throwing
---
Maxed out. I literally built an entire new gaming PC for this. lol.
---
Altohilic, but no trouble with figuring out what to play. I love tanking, and will main a warrior. Mage will be the primary alt, largely so she (my casters are always female, thanks WoT!) can make bags for everyone. In fact, though the main will be the warrior, the toon I will work on first is the mage so I can get bags for the other toons. I know it seems silly and inefficient, but part of the fun for me is making my own stuff. Priest healer for dungeon groups and fun, and the alchemist. Healing pots for the leveling warrior! Hunter as my explorer, quester (I do all quests in all zones) and mats-for-gold farmer.
---
I think that vanilla loot worked the same way.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHfetq38xNI
---
watch it
---
Really? As a rogue in nost I hated running into mages and loved running into warriors 😅
---
"tHe lAcK oF cOmMeNt fRoM BlIzZaRd iS wOrRiSoMe"
---
We can still ask for Beta invites and be mad at Streamers.
---
Quite literally the _only_ reason Im not 100% set on a Paladin. Shit, I want to be a Holy Pally too lol. But man..that dress stuff is so killer for class fantasy.
---
You're misunderstanding. I'm not saying that 2 days ago, people should have ignored layering issues. I explicitly said they complained that "Blizzard will never fix it", and in TWO  DAYS they seem to have made some adjustments for the better.
---
Really? Ill have to look it up its on youtube im assuming? Yeah, I was a 12 year old Night Elf rogue raiding for gear and mainly doing wpvp/ganking. Didn't do many bgs for PVP.
---
dear classic wow dev,
---
you're breathtaking
---
godspeed
---
Except it wasn't done in vanilla, so you are changing shit.  Also, this game is wildly different from vanilla already, so no changes is nonsensical position to start with.
---
Batching looks fucking horrific, watch someone heal a dungeon and you see peoples health update a half-to-full second after a heal has gone off. It just doesn't feel responsive at all, which is one thing people praise about healing in vanilla - its tactile feel.
---
Shaman is awesome. I so wanna play it. but also edgelord rogue etc etc
---
I forgot where this is from?
---
Insane click bait.
---
Yes it is abnormal to expect this.  This is not a 15 year old game, it's a brand new game which simulates a 15 year old game in a totally new client, totally new server infrastructure that didn't exist 15 years ago.
---
It is absolutely abnormal to expect that this be bug free at launch.
---
I just don't see the point in getting a new chance in making everything right you ignore that chance.
---
The way to keep everyone happy is leaving classic servers without new content and to experience the new things you copy your character to a classic+ server
---
5 daggers, 5 base, 5 Malice, 40 remorseless , 45 Imp Ambush. I forgot the 5% base actually, so its 100% but if i remember right cap is something like 95% due to dodge. so a better build might be [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGxbZGxVZV0eshho](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGxbZGxVZV0eshho) for 2% extra damage on most targets and a bigger evis finisher.
---
This is a bad reprint with the corner torn off...
---
Because it breaks every 30min and that’s not efficient farming
---
It’s too cluttered. Two factions is marketable, and dead easy for new players to understand. If I were to play a new MMO and saw three factions, I’d already be overwhelmed and annoyed. 
---
They hit the nail on the head with two factions, fueling the innate human tribalistic instinct and helping keeping the game alive for 15 years. And it’s hella marketable and easy to understand
---
Another one that missed the point.
---
Suggest invite needs to come back. Especially with language barrier on EU. Having a group of three and a group of two fucking sucks when you want to invite for a mob that has a long spawn and you have to ask them to invite X and Y. It takes ages. Would be easier if you could invite another group and just merge them if the combined number of people doesn't exceed 5
---
I still get your point, tho. Youre right about that
---
Lost me at “60 man raid group.”
---
This is really interesting. Does the higher ranked player always get preference? For example, perhaps a good player already received item 1 on their list, then item 2 drops. Do they get preference over a lesser ranked player with the same item on their 'wish' list who hasn't yet received loot?
---
Well first of all, that wont be possible after the beta.
---
Second, reporting a Player for testing stuff out in a BETA is just dumb. Better have that "exploits" found in the beta than the actual game.
---
Playing Paladin is the best thing ever. I love playing a pure Support. Saving someone with BoP feels great, so does putting BoF on a Warrior who fights a Mage or something.
---
You did not stack all the world buffs in vanilla wow.
---
Layering is being tested as we speak since they apparently tuned it down, they tested it during the last stress test as well, and there are more to come. The overhaul you're talking about was done already, layering IS that new system, and now it's being tested, it's not done as it is...
---
Alright.
---
&gt; Well first of all, that wont be possible after the beta.
---
Why not?
---
Ony quest line for horde.
---
Ah I completely missed Dagger Spec, my bad!
---
Really? Pretty sure we did at some point in naxx
---
Did they fix strafing with a target yet?
---
No, but you could iceblock to remove debuffs and repick flag without the 3 second flag debuff
---
If you can't clear MC within a week after having 3 weeks to level and prep you're not in any sort of decent guild.
---
Even private server cleared MC within a week after server launch these days with zero time gates.
---
I’m with you. I think it’s a slippery slope. I’m relieved they’re seemingly doing no changes at all, because I’d love to play 1.12 with upgraded graphics, flight cancellation and auto looting and a variety of other QoL enhancements, but I also recognize that they might suddenly consider LFD/gearscore in the same category, so I can accept just going barebones back to the original.
---
Do you want an answer or did you just want to vent?
---
^
---
Fuck that noise. Fear ward is good but its not necessary. Be who you want to be.
---
If you don't see the problem you might be part of it, cause the negativity is everywhere on this sub, even though the work is being done. Patronizing, maybe. But still true af, and there's no good way of telling people to calm down over here... People will always find something to whine about just like you did
---
ZG set requires 300 tailoring for the set bonus
---
You also need it for robe if the void
---
Raiding is a numbers game. You're using/casting rotations to either maximise damage or healing. Once you're focusing on the number outputs, you don't really focus much on what you're actually doing, especially as a dps.
---
Personally, I mained a warrior from bc to legion and in 25man+ you're kind of one of many and again imo it gets boring fast. Healing is more engaging as you're directly responsible for keeping someone alive. For that reason I like to think of healers as demi-gods. Ones that holds its' allies lives' in its hands. You're much more important, appreciated and loved. All these things play into the class fantasy of a paladin which is why I am looking forward to playing a paladin healer, with BS as my professions to make some decent weapons for pvp etc. Whether that is optimal for vanilla idk but thankfully vanilla is designed for fun first, optimisation second.
---
It sounds to me like a funny gimmick that would get boring pretty fast. There are better games then Classic for that kind of single-player experience.
---
I can’t imagine paying for multiple subs to avoid having to interact with other people in an MMO, but to each their own
---
Going horde because I've been playing alliance for 12 years. The highest i ever got a horde character was to lvl 70 during wrath. So i'm looking forward to experiencing zones that i have never seen before.
---
I'm not in beta so I can't tell for sure but it certainly made a difference back in the day as I initially started playing on US servers then moved to EU servers when they launched.  The difference back then was more like 200 ping vs 40 ping but still - it was very noticeable back then.
---
The new animation, especially while sprinting, looks hideous. That doesn't look even slightly stealthy. The old animation has a proper stealthy movement, but slides because you just can't move that fast properly while being stealthy. The old animation just feels way better.
---
If they make one of the realms Anachronos-EU that'll be by realm I don't even care what type it is or which streamer is on it
---
What he's trying to say is that, if you ice block while having the flag, you get a 3 sec debuff that prevents you from picking the flag up again.
---
I mean I found it really strange that he was testing how characters moved from "vanilla" as he did in beta. I mean everything was mirrored except for the details he was pointing out that were wrong. Also the vanilla recording was pretty decent quality. Most old vanilla videos are complete shit quality.
---
I agree with you, the join group option doesn't bother me for example! But tiny details like the gryphon animation bothered me a lot so I made a big post about it, but I didn't just whine about it, I waited for it to get fixed or not, and it was fixed. But yeah, I think those are the people around, trying to get that karma eh
---
Haha!!
---
They're still very good with their blue +hit gear
---
Dude it’s the first levels of the game. However you get to level 10 does not matter. You don’t need to do quests, you don’t need to do everything the same way. There will be dynamic spawns, there will be kill quests, there will be RFC grinding, there is plenty of ways. Everyone is expecting open season for themselves and that’s just not going to happen. Suck it up and deal with it for a week. This is what makes wpvp the best. When both factions fight over a questing spot for the mobs. You would rather people get layered and avoid any sort of competition. People like you are what’s going to ruin the essence of vanilla wow and don’t even know it.
---
4chan isnt a source
---
I also remember vanilla looting being slow and buggy yes   
---
/me moves through an instance completely crouched the whole time
---
Tailoring and Enchanting go together pretty well, since eventually you use some of those disenchanted materials in your tailoring. You can do this from start to finish or not. Bags are always a hot commodity and can sell very well, depending. Personally, as a rogue and hunter main this time around, I plan on getting gathering professions with both of them(works great for guilds) and probably giving creation professions with alts(works great for me or guilds). Although there is the consideration of going Engineering and Mining at some point with one or both, but man that really outs you from being in any way a team player with a guild, besides Mining. No one else can use your engineered stuff from what I recall.. unless I'm thinking of TBC. I don't recall if there are any Bind on Pickup recipes, but if there are then... having a create and gather profession may be a better goal.
---
Hahaha. If anyone did a 20-40 man multibox, I wouldn't even be mad. I'd just be impressed.
---
But unlike Vanilla, TBC was all about Illidan and his minions?
---
It used to be a troll joke, but it was removed due to referencing  drugs.
---
Idk bout most played most pservers nowadays show that warriors and mage vastly outnumber rogues by a large margin

Has. Retail has just as many. Vanilla also has.
---
I have a very big suspicion there are going to be a fuck ton of awkward interactions between players in classic. One thing retail has done over the years is made social interaction not necessary to play the game. Now with classic coming and people actually needing to talk to other players to find groups. I see a rise in both one-sided conversations and people just straight up not knowing how to talk to other people. Hopefully that will go away in a few months time though.
---
I'd say a geared warrior shit on everything, esp bit later in the MC/BWL time.    
---
and as for group pvp, why would any premade take ret over mage/rogue? sure you can healbot your wait to high ranks but I'm know I'm not the healing kind.    
---
I know I had a blast before tho
---
The internet will always find something to complain about.
---
Troll /silly
---
Dude I know. We’re gonna start a semi casual guild on our server. He was a hunter main back then, and didn’t hesitate to run it again this time around. Meanwhile I was a hunter/dk in BC and wotlk and now I’m stuck between warrior, warlock, and rogue. Either way I’m hyped.
---
I haven't been able to play or see much of Classic so far. What is wrong with pathing? If it's anything like I remember from Classic, pet pathing was a total mess.
---
Maybe you watched a K3 stream where dynamic spawns was completely fucked and everyone who takes leveling semi serious didn't care about the times, but on all LH launches, dynamic means dynamic.
---
true, having slow/charge would be nice
---
I'm not doing the first thing, and the 2nd thing is a pretty dim view of things.
---
2-3 player layering is pretty much objectively annoying. It's necessary and being tested, but that doesn't mean it doesn't suck to test. A lot of us chose to help test it anyways. Being glad testing is resuming under normal circumstances is only natural.
---
Back then, death in other other MMOs was much harsher.  You lost experience and most of the time loot.  There was no ghost run back to your body.  Most MMOs your corpse run was your naked character spawns back at the city and had to manage to get your stuff off your old corpse before it despawned.  PvP grief camping was a LOT harsher.
---
In WoW, with out the harsher penalties of death, people could organize wpvp for fun.  They knew it was not for everyone so that's why there are both pve and pvp servers unlike some old MMOs.  Kinda genius for the time!
---
haha been there, done that. but I should be wiser now and know that warrior can do THAT and much more... at least until wotlk hits
---
I like fortnite and am very excited to quit and play Classic. Never understood the elitism of people hating another game. 
---
In all honesty fortnite prepares me for Wow In a great way. When I use to play I was a clicker, slow and not many keybinds. Fortnite has a lot of keybinds and in that sense has prepared me to go from a clicker to a more keybind player. Of course the games are completely different but you can translate some skills from game to game.
---
2 days ago it was "omg layering do broke Blizzard wont ever fix" and then "huh, it looks like they made layering changes".
---
It really doesn't sound like this is the case, but if it is, then that's fine, they definitely have done a lot
---
Consistent cast time, vs mobs slow attack's.
---
Yup, those people want to preserve their metas, thats all. Theyve chosen their OP class and want to keep it that way. You have the game Lead Class Designer and other top devs constantly mentioning how Pallies and Druids were meant to have 3 viable specs, _not equal_, but viable, I think Kevin Jordan mentioned something like within 10% of pure classes. Its a shame, Vanilla WoW world with _some_ TBC changes to classes/talents would be the best
---
Not surprised if true.
---
Everyone should need
---
I found that maybe 6 minutes was my longest queue time, although I probably only queued about 15 times so it’s not a HUGE sample size.
---
I remember an UD rogue on Emerald Dream called mortis with one of the letters doubles.  He used to hunt in Duskwood.  This was later in vanilla, but your story reminded me.
---
I'd say he was holy, but ofc tons of holy paladins took 2h after ranking was over and smashed skulls too! It's just you have to spend all the time being a healbot.
---
Mobs run through trees, ignore fences and so on.
---
Just level and heal as shadow.
---
Pre-BRD/UBRS/DM stuff is healable by spriests just fine.

So its canon human bitties put out.
---
Thots confirmed.
---
"Fuckin A man" is also a quote from Office Space. Please watch this masterpiece.
---
NO CHANGES REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Ah, okay so not the usual bad pathing.
---
One second delay sounds about right to me
---
Unfortunately it is..
---
ya that's loot lag which is a seperate issue to spell batching.  When the servers are highly stressed loot lag becomes a thing which is the crouching bug you're talking about.
---
Give people time and they'll come around. Vanilla WoW was great, don't get me wrong, but it was far from perfect and there's only so much content there. Once all of vanilla's content has rolled out and people are starting to yearn for more we can start to have real discussions about where the game should go.
---
Old vanilla model changer through mpqs ... I was a dumb kid. Original way similar to tmorph
---
interesting, but how about stealing bases in AB or murdering EFC in WSG? aint it the best job for the rogue? you are right that there is constant aoe going on and that 10v10 madness, the warrior would be a better choice.
---
Used world buffs in retail for loatheb/sapph/kt.  Not used as frequently as private servers do, but they were still used.
---
I know what it is and supposed to do, but Im defending people who complain about the system right now.
---
When you "chill out until two weeks prior to launch" as you said, its too late to do any meaningful changes.
---
Thats when a open "beta" happens which is pretty much a promotion and the game is being shipped to retailers.
---
If someone is not happy with a big game mechanic, now is the last time to complain
---
(and I mean complain in a constructive way, no one wants mindless spam and rage and drivel being posted)
---
no "fucking a man" will always be the correct sentence dont trip
---
or wotlk xD even better imo
---
You think you “don’t have to deal with people”. But i bet it’s people not having to deal with you.
---
    Yay! An online game with many social aspects! Can’t wait to never interact with anyone!
---
Damn I thought you mean after the server was open now I realize you mean after MC opened. My bad, sorry.
---
It can painful for casual players for sure. Generally speaking this (gridding/corpse camping) is a big incentive for joining a guild or leveling an alt, neither of which is an option for a casual player. By definition wow is the biggest commitment MMOs ever as far as time required, especially in the earliest iterations of the game it was simply not geared toward casual gamers. Blizzards attempt to make it so is what ruined it for the hardcore raiders and pvpers. So I say this lightly but, if getting griefed ruins wow for you, yeah, you have to play on different servers, because the pvp version of the game is brutal and not for casuals.
---
absolutely this.  
---
Need to farm? Farming Alt  
---
Need to PvP? PvP Alt  
---
Need to craft? Craft Alt
---
Need more storage? Bank Alt
---
Fool once, shame on your, fool me twice...
---
You can kind of understand to a certain degree
---
In dungeons? Absolutely.
---
In raids? As anything other than OT? Good luck my man.
---
&gt; layer hopping...not a major factor  
---
ehhhhh
---
I want option "C", but it is very unlikely likely to happen, especially the part about Blizzard learning from its old mistakes. You really trust them to do that? 
---
I wouldn't get your hopes up. What would be cool is instead of a full-blown additional expansion, there could be some incremental additions and tweeks. Perhaps even adding a zone or two, while keeping the fundamental mechanics the same. But I seriously doubt that would happen.
---
Unarmoured mounts in p1, hunter completely fixed &amp; layering until max lvl 20-30 and im happy.

---
I'd really beg to differ on what kind of caster we are talking about.
---
An AoE-grinding mage might have different preferences compared to a dungeon-chaining priest.
---
Holy shit this is uncomfortable to watch.... So much yelling by a bearded dude is strange.
---
&gt; Solo exp as a healer is going to be slow and a bit dull, unless you want to churn out money respeccing every day.
---
youre going to play it and its going to take over your life, dont fight it. just let the shame wash over you.
---
completely agree, I had "just"  BWL gear on my ret and it was a godlike mode, killing people left and right. but in premades, I don't feel like the ret is needed there when you can take a mage who does way more dps and can CC. support like BoF is cool, but you have holy paladins for that
---
Oh yeah.. seeing good pieces go to DE is just sad because people are waiting for their BiS. And then same people rage and wonder why progressing is hard. It's because you pass on straight up upgrades.
---
At least that finally got sorted out when people realized they could just arrange within the class who takes what non-BiS items and bid minimal amounts for them. And then people started to do that for even the BiS items, because who know, you might need that DKP against newcomers to the guild come next tier. And then someone breaks the agreements and you've got drama.
---
I have bad experiences with DKP. There are variations I think could work relatively well. It's not something I would run anymore.
---
 I'm going to be running Dungeons with a 5 man team through 60 at launch. I planned on this a while ago, but I'm hoping the dungeon elite info from beta is true. It will make my leveling experience that much easier/faster.
---
 If anyone else is looking to multibox, I'd love to have a chat with them on strategies and plans for classic... Also, I am joining a great guild that is pro multiboxing and I'd love to get more of us together so we can alt run raids together :)
---
Dwarf is the only real paladin ;)
---
This would be preferable to vanilla servers one day updating to bc
---
Getting a job is the begging for scraps part.  I have a job, fuckhead.
---
Did they fix blood and combat text?
---
They will raise level cap and streamers will get closer to end game and find more bugs.
---
Oh yehhh
---
Raider rank will always have priority over a trail. And it will work out that maybe both of them listed the same 5 items. So I will work it out so each person will have a different priority on things. I will be trying to make it so that someone won't be having like first priority on like 5 items at once because that doesn't look good but if we get a bunch of items and the one item they wanted first never drops so then other people who were ahead of them have already gotten it and now they have first priority on the item drops back to back they will get both. It will all will be publicly viewable though so there is always ability for people to know where they lie on loot and what is going to happen with what pieces.
---
Most of them will be on the exact same server, which would absolutely shape the dynamics of that one server.
---
The closest the people who claim that ever came to playing a healer, is blaming one. There was nothing responsive to Vanilla-healing, nothing at all.
---
maybe the server number just hit so few people that layering turned itself off
---
Go tell the people over on r/classicwowplus then.  
---
Barking up the wrong tree buddy.
---
Shadow priest, pve. Arms warrior, pve. Ret/prot in pve. Elemental shaman and boomkin, pve.

[Kevin fucking Jordan](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Kevin_Jordan), linked in case you haven't heard of him, on Countdown to Classic Podcast mentioning how Druid tanking and dpsing, along with Paladin tanking and dpsing was supposed to be viable (note I said viable, _not_ equal, he mentions within like 10-15% of pure dps classes). The "Hybrid Tax" was NOT supposed to be a thing.
---
Here's the episode you can listen to:
---
https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/05/08/episode-103-paladin-pve-rp-pvpers-state-their-case-podcasting-wow/
---
The EU realms, like you said. There are few hills I will die on, but this is one of them.
---
That's exactly how it works the entire purpose of layering is to prevent too many people in one area
---
In vanilla, I was once killed by two Mages who frost nova’d me and then spammed arcane explosion as they danced around me. That was just two, I stand in fear at the idea of five or more
---
I know I will, I've rolled alliance on private servers since TBC released. I was hoping to go back to horde as nostalgia for them is much stronger, as well as my semi-hatred for the alliance and humans specifically for all the terrible crap they did in WC3.
---
Layer Hopping isn't a major factor? lol.... we ain't ostriches with their head in sand around here are we  
---
Also a lot is not on par with retail Vanilla WoW, enough to talk about. I.e. Melee Leeway, Batching, Pathing (i.e. charge/gnomish net backfire/etc.), Keyring, World buffs, Spell modifiers, EU languages, Bad latency when there are 3 or more raidgroups on a map.   
---
There is a LOT to discuss and Blizzard needs help to fix this big private server.
---
Most of the top streamers have already said they're planning to roll on the same US PVP server.
---
Well to be blunt I don't agree, simply because you should keep in mind this is for the best. Sure it breaks immersion a bit but the goal is not for you to have the best experience, the goal is for you to test things out, report it, so that the live game is actually the best experience it can be. Expecting it to be "normal" or "ideal" makes zero sense whatsoever, it's just not the point. You'll have the smoothest experience after launch, until then it's all about testing, going with what's being tested, and that's it. I mean, stress testing is a pain cause you spend hours on the login screen, but that's for the best, complaining about it was met with "imagine complaining about testing stress on a stress test", well that works for the whole beta. Imagine complaining about being annoyed by bugs and test on a beta test. That said, each one his opinion, no biggie
---
I'm not sure how much I agree on PvP alt unless you're super super hardcore about tanking/raiding but for some reason can't be bothered to farm an hour for a respec. Although generally I'm not big on alts for real play. But everything else I can agree on.
---
I can feel it, you the kind of person that complained about everything in classic being correct and since this is blizzard there could be no wrong when people pointed out oddities.
---
Regardless, your whole post makes no sense. People are reporting bugs and keeping pressure so that blizzard actually fixes them before launch.
---
If your answer to that is ofc they will, i would like to point you towards BFA launch. Blizzard just deleted all bugs reported and feedback and released it then acted as if they were surprised by the community backlash when it turned out shit.
---
But sure we're the whiny kids and blizzard is the incarnation of ethics.... said no one in 2019
---
Is that an old saying from Kentucky?
---
Came here to ask this. Anyone?
---
Tanks usually get flasks and some other stuff from guild (like repair costs). Healers can do fine in their healing specc (especially priests once dire maul is out) and consumables are less expensive for healers.
---
I would love BC servers. I liked wotlk, but Dungeon finder was a really big hit to the RPG side of WoW. I would prefer BC over classic though.
---
I have to agree. I'm all for rational discussion but people get passionate about things they care about. This is not a crime.
---
I also don't lay awake at night worrying about the devs or Blizzard because they, just like the peeps who made your car or anything else aren't doing you a favor. They're in a money making venture. If what they produce meets our standards as a consumer, then we buy. Seems like a fair arrangement.
---
And BTW, companies spend loads of money trying to figure out what consumers want. Don't think that our "whining" isn't a gold mine for them.
---
there's usually way more skeletons than actual players.  like in your WSG example.  10v10 battle and there's what, 60 skeletons on the ground?  I can see why they would reduce it.  if you're wondering where players have recently died, it doesn't help to see someones skeleton from 6 days ago.  it's cool to see lots of skeletons, but its not really necessary.  I think it's subjective. I'm not saying it's better one way or the other, but I can see why they would change it.
---
This is why I want PVP RP, to avoid cringy edgy names of people begging for attention
---
The only time I remember my guild paying for a spec was when out MT had an emergency and we needed our most geared DPS war to respec so we could do a farm run.
---
Let's. All. Start. Separating. Our. Words. With. Periods.
---
I honestly think the closest you can get to a larger story would be the black dragon flight messing around with the world.  Or basically Blackrock Mountain’s multiple story chains.  This was more of the living in a world post Frozen Throne.  Vanilla was a lot of smaller stories wrapped together instead of one focused story that we started getting in future expansions.
---
Suggest invite is a good thing though
---
Hold up, that's not "fixing" things, that's changing things. Looting was that jarring back in Vanilla. So if you "fix" that the #nochanges-group will start complaining about it being changed. This never-ending loop will provide us with content for eternity! Some real IQ300-machinations going on.
---
Exactly!  Now let's get back to focusing on the things that matter, like complaining about streamers.  Anyone else thing that Asmongold has touch of the downs?
---
Blizzard needs to break free from the evil clutches of Activision. That company hasn't had a clue in the gaming industry in almost a decade now.
---
Group PvP and respeccing for PvP/PvE we’re the worst of it for me.
---
Get a macro “Rogue here, inv pls” that you can quickly press when you see ppl looking for pug dps and you’ll be fine for pugging dem 5 mans.

No problem, happy to pass on my vanilla knowledge to young padawan rogues!
---
So you are correct in saying that hemo awards cheap combo points and enables effective stunlocking in PVP. But I really want you to understand WHY this is, and how it occurs - it is due to the lower energy cost of hemo compared to sinister strike, and the complimentary talents that sit alongside it such as dirty deeds and improved gouge. This enables you to perform stunlocks that no other build allows. For a bread-and-butter hemo combo, here is an example : cheap shot - hemo - gouge - kidney shot - hemo - hemo. This basic opener can stop most opponents from using their character for the entire duration of the combo.
---
Improved gouge - it's such an important talent because by using it, you OBTAIN back more energy than you INVESTED. Energy is a resource, and energy management is a critical part of playing a rogue. 
---
\&gt;For backstabs I wouldn't use it until I have pooled enough energy to be able to instantly Backstab afterwards. If I use it beforehand I'll waste time by not dealing any damage while waiting for the energy to regen
---
This is a misunderstanding of the concept. This is PRECISELY what you would use 3/3 improved gouge for - to regen extra energy to allow another backstab. In PVE you cannot backstab mobs without it if you have aggro (because mobs auto face you and will not expose their back, and it also stops you taking damage from the mob) and it is equally crucial in PVP.
---
Basic gouge lasts 4 seconds, and costs 45 energy. 
---
3/3 improved gouge lasts 5.5 secons and costs 45 energy.
---
This extra 1.5 seconds is crucial for 2 reasons. 1.) It means, due to the way that ticks of energy regen for rogues, you will regen 20 extra energy. 2.) It allows combat to drop, meaning you can restealth for free off an improved gouge with no need to use vanish. This is huge in PVP. Both of these factors contribute
---
id make a small comment about shadow oil as a temporary weapon enchant since it seems more and more likely, especially considering it does not consume an ISB debuff on Classic.
---
What class should I play if I want to tank?
---
" I've always felt that vanilla wasn't as much about individual gameplay  experience as it was about the group gameplay experience. What I mean by  that is, what your class does individually isn't what is engaging about  the game. It's about how everyone comes together to use their strengths  to compliment each classes weakness. "

""
---
With that logic, you would also disagree with the farming alt.
---
Why have a dedicated farmer is you cant be bothered to do it with your main?
---
The idea is to cut costs in constant respec, by having other characters that do what you need. Even if that means PvP.
---
Just my thought.
---
I was so disappointed they gave priests mind sear and not "Prayer of Pain" in wotlk.
---
Why are you in classic wow subreddit asking about this, r/wow is where you want to ask, here you're just going to get shamed.
---
In a nutshell, it's worth it if you enjoy it and you can do all the older content, too.
---
 Should probably work on remaining of bugs on classes
---
 spell batching being scuffed as fuck
---
 leeway tuning/removal
---
 broken layering (really you are saying its not a major issue, a system that will ruin servers economy and is overall entirely againts what classic wow is all about ?)
---
 Fixing animations.
---
 Seriously people like you are exactly why companies can make shit games now, fix few bugs and you are completely satisfied and blind to obvious as fuck issues.
---
Considering people found an error with how melee crits were being generated over AV weekend, and a bunch of hunter bugs, we still need people doing the most mundane things to find whatever crazy, niche thing may be wrong. 
---
I still want them invite substantially more people. No sub needed NA and EU stress tests within 24hrs of each other.

My legs are OK

I'm not against the change, I ask out of ignorance but why was right click report removed?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#stEuZVRtc0uyo  Basically standard prot build except imp. conc aura instead of imp righetous fury, and spiritual focus instead of illumination.
---
Holy shield is excellent reflect damage, the 4 charges will last almost the entire CD period, even with 8-10 mobs hitting you. Use rank 1 as the damage difference to rank 3 isn't worth the mana increase.
---
Judge wisdom and use SOR - the holy damage from SOR means you get double mana back with good damage output.
---
Conc carefully with retri aura up, when you get around 40% health BOP and bandage, top up with holy light/fol depending on health and time left on BOP.
---
If mana gets low stop conc and just use rank 1 holy shield. Combined with judging wisdom and keeping SOR damage up you'll have enough sustain to keep going the entire fight whilst regaining more mana.
---
If fight is still ongoing you can bubble and bandage again (First aid CD should be off) Followed by downranked Holy Light if needed.
---
You spec/concept is... odd. Points in anticipation means you won't get redoubt procs farming lvl50-58 mobs in tanking gear (it rarely procs with tanking gear anyway)
---
Imp LOH is wasted for a farming spec - if you're having to use LOH then you're doing it wrong. Divine favour + illumination is nice for some mana return but you shouldn't need to heal more than a couple of times in one pull. Holy Power is nice but means you're missing out on much more beneficial prot talents.
---
I take strength &gt; intellect because strength affects your block, as well as the damage you're dealing out. Intellect ofc helps a bit with sustain but the benefit it barely felt.
---
Taking imp BoW and BoS is pointless, you're either using one or the other.
---
Ofc there's more than 1 way to AOE farming, but it seems your current spec sits on the fence of tanky prot farming and holy heal farming. Pick one and run with it.
---
Im salty as hell im from switzerland and there are no swiss servers i mean in switzerland live like 7 milion people isnt that enought for a server xD

Not respecs but tank repairs and tank/healer consumes were mostly paid for by our guild bank. Dkp for donations of herbs and such were introduced in AQ iirc. Nobody was respecting except a rogue going for r14.
---
have fun wasting 10 hours
---
You land-lubbers are tougher than I thought, I'll have to improvise!
---
you can make gold pretty well as a tank with just these two things:
---
1) sell dungeon runs/items/attunements. 
---
2) run strat live, reserve first orb for tank.
---
It is also not that slow to grind mobs as prot and you have very little down time!
---
Bugs are being fixed since the beginning of the beta, even flight path animations were fixed. Pointing out oddities is not the point of this. I precisely said to keep reporting but not whining about things not being ready yet. So your answer makes even less sense, regardless... There are good clues that the dev team is working hard on this, this isn't the BfA team, so you can keep the sarcasm up but my point still stands. This is a beta test &gt; things are being tested &gt; report and chill.
---
The last identical post.
---
On the one hand it's normal to have many pieces of gear that are 10 or more levels subpar while leveling. On the other, it is such a huge time investment to level that crafting profession that you arguably would have found an equivalent piece of gear by just leveling. 
---
Having said that, don't think that you can't level a crafting profession because it is it's own sort of satisfying. I often do when leveling for the pure enjoyment of making my own items, but each to their own.
---
Arms warriors are *amazing* in dungeons with sweeping strikes, whirlwind, cleave etc.
---
When grinding dungeons for newcomers I often was 45-55% DPS of the group as arms specced *tank*.
---
Elemental: awesome in PvE because you can go one spec and never look back unless doing serious progression. So everytime you beat new content, you can now stay in 31/0/20, heal for a bit or DPS in dungeons or the tier below the current one. 
---
What you and many others confuse is that you think raiding is all there is in vanilla, therefore you claim something is unviable, because it doesn't work in 20% of the game's content (raiding).
---
Welcome to reddit
---
I get the defiant attitude, but there are good clues this is being worked out, and there's still time, so we can all panic in a month, just not now.
---
Because Blizzard would totally tell one guy who works on one project about what they have going on across all their major IPs...
---
Even if they shifted someone around teams to say, make art assets. Their not going to tell them more then the bare minimum of what their looking for.
---
I take "Leak all the things" posts with a lethal dose of salt... This one even morso.
---
&gt;It's not like Blizzard is just chilling and thinking the game is perfect as it is right now
---
This isn't a an exclusive idea. They can be busting their asses off and be completely aware that the game isn't perfect and it still be possible that they are way behind and potentially won't fix a lot of the issues in time for release.
---
I can't wait for the release of Classic. I hope it is still as magical as it was back then. I have tried to play WoW several times after TBC, but never played it for long. It never was the same. I miss the long attunement quests.
---
Well said.
---
The last leak about Diablo 4 many months or years back said its some kind of fps hybrid aswell.
---
But then it said that it wasnt working out and they scrapped the whole idea and started new, hence the delay in the game.
---
I think the amount of players in the beta is way too small of a sample size to make any conclusions about how it will be once the game goes live.
---
I'd guess BG-queue times there mostly come from having to wait for enough players on either side to even warrant a new BG. Like if there's 2 AB's at once and only 80 players wanting to play BGs at all, you'll have to wait until one finishes so the people in it can requeue.
---
On live-servers it will depend mostly on overall faction-balance.
---
And according to the polls I've seen there's slightly more alliance (thanks to no bloodelves yet). This might be counteracted by slightly more pvp-oriented players playing horde though (mainly because of WoTF) so I'd expect relatively short queue-times for both-sides.
---
I just fired up another random private server because I couldn’t handle the itch any more.
---
AVAST, YE SWABS. REPEL THE INVADERS!
---
Honestly when it comes down to it there really is no hybrid in my opinion. You either have to live with not having a ton of PvP utility and leveling quickly, or full on PvP and not having the benefits of the combat tree. If your goal is to level quickly, especially with a friend who can toss a heal, full combat and chain pulling without using stealth will be the fastest. If you are concerned about getting into PvP skirmishes just go dagger PvP or hemo. I would not bother trying to do some kind of mix bag spec because you will just be gimping yourself on one end or the other. Also having a druid with you will mitigate some of the lack of utility you miss going full combat, so as long as you guys are good players you should still be able to win PvP fights regardless of which way you go. I would personally go combat leveling in your position unless PvP was going to be my primary focus and not really caring about the speed I level at all.
---
This.
---
Same thing that's happening with Teamfight Tactics right now. Lots of views due to the 30-hour queue for non-streamers.
---
Oh shit.  Gurubashi days
---
Is there a link with release or patch notes for those fixes? Where do you read about them?
---
&gt; I see a rise in both one-sided conversations and people just straight up not knowing how to talk to other people
---
If you think that retail WoW has completely removed people's social skills outside of the game I think you're being a bit silly.
---
That's exactly what I mean, constructive feedback is alright, but not the shitshow we're getting. Chilling out is about attitude, I'm not saying sit back and stop reporting bugs, reporting is alright, but the "omg there's no way they fix everything it time" attitude is plain dumb
---
Feign still does not drop combat in bgs
---
Yah, we didn't even have the bidding thing.   That's another layer of potential fuckery, which will cause drama.  We just had a set price on the items. 
---
  It was originally zero sum, but people stopped showing up for progression, so we had to change things.
---
They do it because it's fun, it makes multiple 60s. Its not however something that will do almost anything you said. It doesn't matter how many multi boxed priest the guy has, you just walk away from his camp. It doesn't matter what class you have, your not effective at doing dungeons. It's not even faster getting your class to 60 as a multibox....
---
I think that stacking world buff in Vanilla wasn't easy or was discovered only later in Vanilla and only by few players/guilds.
---
true
---
Start with classic. Much better game then retail and retail will het lonely once you start LFG spamming to level
---
&gt; it's a beta
---
I hate this phrase. I really do.
---
Sure, there are some whiny babies on this sub who wouldn't be happy if blizzard invented a time machine and took them back to the actual launch in 2004, but the reason a lot of us keep complaining is **because it is a beta**.
---
If we stay silent or gingerly whisper our complaints, nothing will get fixed. If we sit idly and say "Hey, it's just a beta. They will fix it in time." we will get WoD, Legion and BfA again. Do you know how I know this? Because every single expansion lately has had its feedback dialed down because of this exact, cursed phrase.
---
Keep talking. Loudly. Don't let "it's just a beta" stop you from speaking your mind. Do it for the good of the game, and the good of your own future enjoyment.
---
People have done it and people will do it. I think it isn't remotely worth it: playing with other people gives the game so much life!
---
Every time I make a dungeon group, even if it's just sfk, I tell the group "If a boe rare drops, I'm hitting need, you all should too". Because that translates into gold, and we all need gold.
---
If you're stupid and roll greed on an assassins blade, that's your own dam fault.
---
As for the deathcharger, the only reason not to roll need is of you pass because you already have it.
---
But layering only happens when you log in or change the continent
---
Do you seriously trust blizzard to change classic and not fuck it up in any way?
---
Its not useless, i think you over estimate tho the amount of green you will be wearing that comes from quests rewards at lvl 19-20. Half of your gear will still be gray items.
---
On fresh launch there will most likely not be any green for you to buy on the auction house and all mats will be dirt cheap because everyone tries to sell it. So you better off craft it yourself to get yourself some better armor rather than running around in gray.
---
Also you may be able to sell gear you craft in barren chat.
---
Appreciate the response man!
---
Making your own gear as you level is a huge part of the RPG element of crafting for me. It'll drain your resources as you level, but it feels great to make yourself a pair of Spidersilk Boots.
---
If you wonder why people meditate, this is it.
---
I want to play holy pala too. i don't think they are that unviable. they rock in late vanilla with good gear and can heal tonnes without ooming as quickly or being as squishy as the other healers.
---
Yeah, there are a few perks to being a rogue. Just as someone who knows the ins and outs of the rogue life pretty well it's by no means a cake walk as you progress. A lot of the time it's absolutely frustrating lol. 
---
Not to say they aren't fun to play though, there's a reason I always had my rogue leveled and geared up even if I was playing a different class. In the end the fun factor is what matters imo, vanilla can be a gigantic snoozefest if you're not enjoying the class you're playing.
---
Considering the historic death toll and misery communism spread vs whole nations lifted out of poverty through free markets I’d say that comparison is pretty flawed. Unless you decide to ignore or rewrite history which you can do of course.
---
I don’ know... maybe just grab a beer, go outside, lean back and chill in the sun. Don’t hype yourself up for the classic release, just calmly wait for it.
---
As long as I can quest with minimal bugs, and all my skills and talents are mostly the same as they were in vanilla, I'll be happy.
---
What kind of idiot boxes 10 mages?  You’d take at least 2 healers in that set up.
---
Just need german/french servers and I am happy. :)
---
Seemed plausible, until the DIABLO 4 info about it being a first person looter made in the overwatch engine. C'mon. People blew up about Diablo Immortal because they wanted Diablo 4, not a shitty spin-off.
---
This leak tells me they've still ignored their audience and intend to take Diablo 4 in a whole new direction that is not familiar with the Diablo franchise? There's no Blizzard is THAT ignorant.
---
I figure finding the Guild is good to do before finding the server. Every server will of course have your run of the mill super hardcore guild, semi-hc, very casual, etc. If you want something a bit more than that then it's worth looking around beforehand.
---
Personally I just decided to go ahead and make the Guild that I wanted to see.
---
Thanks man,  that's what I needed,  I just don't want horde que times to be 30 minutes and alliance 5 minutes and regret my decision going horde.
---
Human - "Good Tidings"
---
Came here to say this.  Druid gear is already so scarce it may take some time.
---
I hope that the gnomes steal all of the loot from paladins and priests - signed horde pvpers
---
This post reminds me of r/gameofthrones over the last 2 seasons of the show.
---
Naive faith and speculation stated as fact coupled with some thinly veiled, and some not so thinly veiled, insults for anyone with a differing opinion.
---
I know it looks weird on the surface. Making it look dead caused them to bleed a huge amount of beta testers though. Had they left it like that I'd be legitimately concerned about there being enough testers for instances at 50. 
---
Breakdown: If it went down to say 70 that's 10 of each class, and even 140 that's 20 of each. At the moment post layering 140-200 is where we're at. During layering it was roughly 100-120 you can check wowclassicpopulation. Only like 60-70% online are at 40 going by our guild (2nd largest). In this state even Esfand spent a large portion of last night talking in world chat just for an Ulda group.
---
Going on this trend if 70% (high est imo) of those people make 50 there will be very little ability to test ST and Mara. There could be as little as 30-40 runs per server in the whole beta. This is compared to probably 1000+ runs of SM....I personally submitted like 12 SM bugs. 
---
I already don't think 50-60 testing can happen without templated chars and/or invites due to losing so many. And there are a HUGE amount of those instances. 
---
So it's coming from a place of concern is what I'm getting at.
---
If you tank your own dungeon you reserve your gear. People will join anyways.
---
The real question, is this simulated lag true to the vanilla experience, and if so, should it be improved regardless?
---
Just because it's different on pservers doesn't mean it's correct.
---
Not true. Tauren can also ride kodos.
---
You do not.
---
EPGP or Suicide Kings
---
Get rid of busted ass cross server BGs
---
When you see it you see it
---
Well generally I’ll be raiding to get pvp gear as I simply will not have the time to invest in r14 so I guess that’s where my mentality of it comes from. I can fully understand having a hunter/mage alt for specific farming. But generally I’ve always made my money playing the ah so I’ve never had to have a farming alt.
---
Oh well yeah the people saying that didn't think it through. We were on 2-3 player layers no possible way that happens on live.
---
Buddy. A beta is about testing. So you test, and you report. THAT'S FINE, okay? But not going full shitshow mode saying this won't get fixed. This IS a beta. So we should be testing things out, reporting them and then leave it at that. The point is, yesterday people were whining about bugs not being fixed and today the patch hit the beta, so it was pointless to worry about those. Everything is being reported, they're working on it, you won't magically solve anything just by being loud enough about it. It's just chaos in this sub, and frankly it's disheartening.
---
I think the gap is purposeful to make you more likely to group up to kill higher level mobs in order to get the mats you need.
---
And its written in Electrum so its resource heavy, and they made it look like a child's toy.
---
You seem to be a very negative person.
---
You do not need to be this way - you have a real opportunity for growth and development. Your negativity only spreads seeds of further negativity, until that is all you are. It will consume you, and eventually you will drown in the weeds of your negative emotions, never to escape.
---
It does not need to be that way though, you can become mindful and reform the shape of your mind. You can become a better more insightful person. You have this opportunity now, I hope that you can take it.
---
Whats the point of improved concentration aura?
---
You still get wpvp with layering.
---
Also, I dont think you understand how leveling works with 3k+ people in the earlygame - you ever tried levelling on a fresh server with accelerated spawns? Its fucking dire, it takes hours to hit 10. Now imagine that with blizzlike spawns. Nobody finds that fun.
---
I get it, you've read reddit and dont have an opinion of your own. But layering doesn't affect anything you've talked about when its implemented correctly.
---
Dont they have a toggle on retail but it looks bad or something? I know my Tauren is permanently ruined
---
https://xkcd.com/330/
---
You also dont HAVE to go engineering for bombs.  There are Crystal Charges from Un'goro you can use as well. But once ZG comes out you can use the bloodvine goggles for more spell hit.
---
This. As it is right now, Spell Batching is nothing more than artificial +500ms latency. It just feels clunky and awkward.
---
&gt; I know it looks weird on the surface. Making it look dead caused them to bleed a huge amount of beta testers though. Had they left it like that I'd be legitimately concerned about there being enough testers for instances at 50. 
---
Your concern isn't really relevant though since Blizzard are the one calling the shots and they know very well that they can get 100k more beta testers by snapping their fingers. The reason they don't do that is because they don't want or need to.
---
What was broken with wind fury?
---
Did anyong have a report button during the shooting of the show? Any opinion mattering? Yeah, didn't think so. I'm not saying to sit down and relax, I'm saying to keep cool about it all because it's a work in progress. There's a time to panic about bugs, and it's definitely not now.
---
Agreed. That's where it took a big chunk of the World out and left me far less than interested in the game, albeit a very convenient feature.
---
We’re talking about how hard private servers are compared to beta, hun. Obviously that makes them different.
---
I quit wow at wotlk and started playing on classic priv. servern since then. Cant wait to play my beloved game on blizz servern again. :)
---
Thanks dad
---
Yes, and there is always different solutions for different problems.
---
I want to Tank in PvE, as its my favorite thing to do in WoW. But I don't want to PvP as a warrior. So I can make a PvP toon who's dedicated to PvP.
---
Sounds like a completely reliable source, and totally not like a 16-y/o angry troll.
---
Servers lagging and crashing and having downtime was also "the true vanilla experience". Should we have that too?
---
Just because it actually happened in 2005 doesn't mean it's correct either.
---
Remember when the 4chan "leak" about the last blizzcon turned out to be wrong on all counts.
---
It wasn’t, people make alts.
---
It’s not practical to respec every week.
---
Ah, layer *hopping*. Yeah layers will probably stay the same because they will eventually collapse them down to a single world after a few weeks.
---
It's a sign of the times really, people simply like to complain about every aspect of our lives and Reddit as a whole is just a huge outlet for that kind of bullshit. As we speak the top post on the frontpage is cheering because a religious despot who has arrested innumerable journalists, students, bloggers and sentenced them to corporal punishment and deprivation enough to kill a man because he insulted a president they don't like. 
---
People nowadays seem to go full retard when complaining about their perceived hardships.
---
However everything gets posted there. So yeah. Reddit isn’t a source by even more.
---
But panic is fun.
---
Yer all right son. 
---
Doing me proud.
---
By all means, let them have fun. I love to gang multi boxers with my pals!
---
Stopped reading that post where he says he disagrees that the servers will be flooded at launch. Dude has no idea what he’s talking about.
---
Except when I go back to my job from vacation, I can’t raid at 5pm like most guilds want to during the week. But yeah, I probably won’t have an issue
---
In the Classic WoW Beta so far, the things that have gotten the most views have been:
---
\- PVP Tournaments (Even Soda got a new record of 114k+ viewers from the Horde one)
---
\- "World Firsts" (Asmon capitalized on this well in the beta)
---
\- Mass World PVP
---
\- Watching WoW YouTube videos.
---
Stuff that killed stream views:
---
\- Farming / leveling anything past launch
---
The worst part is that if you bring up the fixes, they'll simply start bitching about something else.
---
leap frog threat
---
I’m thinking there will be a Rag kill within 2-3 weeks.  You know there’s going to be a guild that no-lifes 40 people to 60 and then coordinates gearing and rep grinding waterlords.  If you plan it correctly, you can do the quest line for the quintessence in 1 lockout.  Just need 7 people to complete it.  
---
The mechanics of the fights are already well known so there won’t be any trial and error.  It will come down to which guild can level and gear out 40 people the fastest.  I saw a video where it was theoretically possible to do it week one.  Though I doubt that many people will forego sleeping to do it.
---
DKP only favors those who attend the raids thats it.
---
Loot council rewards also players who contribute to the guild outside the raid like farming mats for the guild bank etc.
---
You could also give dkp points in exchange of mats but usually create drama also since class that farm well can abuse it. While what we just really want to see is guildies help out.
---
So yeah in WoW Communism &gt; Capitalism
---
Not sure why you felt compelled to include profanity in your response,  but you finally answered my question.  You feel that in your 20's or 30's the risk of investing leveraged funds is worth it but in your 50's it is not.
---
Small bugs are fine, it will be fixed. It's the layering which really is making me uncertain about the state of the game.
---
Not sure what your point is. TBC was not just about Illidan and his minions, it was also about something completely different. I mean, the lore of the Sunwell raid was about trying to get KJ into Azeroth, which most certainly is directly against what Illidan wanted.
---
It is true that a lot of things in TBC focused on the "same" story, around Illidan, but that is probably more due to the fact that we went to Outland which was his "empire" at the time, so most significant enemies were somewhat underlings to him. Even so, several dungeons and zones were not under his control.
---
But my point was that it is fundamentally not different in Vanilla. Look through the raids of vanilla and each and everyone of them have a story, just like any expansion have. The difference is in how it was not so obviously shown in the game as it later was. This difference makes the experience to the player different, but there most certainly was a story throughout all we did in vanilla just like in modern WoW.
---
Yeah, I played on a horde-dominated-server before the introduction of battle-groups and it really sucked.
---
I even rerolled alliance partly because of that. By the time my character got to 60 it got merged into an alliance-dominated battle-group.
---
But it wasn't nearly as bad.
---
When BC and the bloodelfs came out I always had instant-invite as alliance.
---
It depends really, on what you want to get out of the game. Do YOU want to be the best player on the server? Like is that important to you? Or would you rather be part of the best guild on the server? DKP can reward individuals who are dedicated members of the guild but still want to improve themselves first. Loot council is more about improving the guild as a whole. (for the most part). I would personalyl prefer DKP because then you have control over your own destiny. 
---
I was in a guild in BC that used loot council in a very negative way. Bascially there was a click within the guild that i was on the outside of. The officers and guild master were the main members of this click. And when it came to raiding with Loot Council ofc they got the first choice at gear. To be fair they were the core important players, Main tank/off tank, Healers and most of the time top DPS. But something always struck me as off when they were replacing epics with better epics and i was still wearing dungeon blues. But it was always "for the good of the raid"
---
So with that horror story i will most likely only be apart of a DKP system in the future.
---
Asmongold is a selfish idiot
---
They really did take the modern WoW core and put it back into the old world, huh? Wow.
---
&gt; if this was a dodgy kebab 30 min gameplay server review
---
unless he got paid like $10 to sell out
---
Yeah like I can appreciate why people wanted it but personally I think the sliding effect of the old one looks ridiculous. The fast movement of the new one might look a little silly but less so than sliding through the world. But hey, no changes means no changes and better a sillier but original looking animation than arbitrarily deciding what is and isn't made original as possible.
---
And that's perfectly fine. I can 100% understand that!
---
Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia added into the OCE mix make it much larger that Germany.
---
Thank goodness. In my opinion it was absolutely absurd that layers were still being added to the beta server with how few people have been playing.
---
It was layering at 120 in every zone with layers of 2 or 3 people 4 days ago. Last night there was no 2nd layer we noticed with 200.
---
We can talk about how layering will ruin the immersion, economy, fun and pvp in classic.
---
Asking out of interest, since I know little on the subject. Why was suggest invite removed?
---
level 59s in greens can clear mc
---
I'll just go back to waiting for CP2077 and Starcitizen...
---
Or the Logitech G600 one, too.
---
Look at the front page, it got changed a few hours ago :D :D :D
---
It's not the damage at max level that's turning me off. 3-5% damage is actually quite a bit but I don't usually go feral at max level. Although I do use feral a bit in PvP.
---
The thing that's turning me off is the up to 30% less damage at lower levels. I guess it's technically not "lower" since it was higher than it should have been on PS. 
---
I shouldn't say it's sad that their damage is lower. It's not sad. It's actually pretty comical.
---
If you've somehow fucked up and used both BOP and Divine Shield and still need to heal, you have something like a 91% chance of avoiding interruption so you can quickly flick it on whilst you heal and then go back to retri.
---
It's optional really though, the 3 points need to be spent somewhere in that top part of the Prot Tree so you can put them where you like. Just avoid anticipation because you want the redoubt procs.
---
&gt;Did anyong have a report button during the shooting of the show? Any opinion mattering? Yeah, didn't think so.
---
I'm not sure what you are trying to convey here.
---
&gt;I'm not saying to sit down and relax, I'm saying to keep cool about it all because it's a work in progress.
---
These are like the same exact thing.
---
&gt;There's a time to panic about bugs, and it's definitely not now.
---
Subjectiveness that I completely disagree with. Layers, leeway, spellbatching...You seem to think 2 months is way longer than it is.
---
Pass. Dwarves are not supposed to ride Deathchargers.
---
So good
---
This, exactly this.
---
Thanks brother
---
Won't people just use mods to see gearscore?
---
DKP is for the casual guilds, it's an absolute disaster for progression raiding. Loot council for the more hardcore, and loot list/loot council for the progression style raiding top tier raiding. 
---
You tell a lot about a guild by how their looting is handled.
---
Star Citizen is never releasing dude...
---
Costs too much wont happen.
---
You won't clear naxx anyway so why are you worried? How are you going to do further tiers of content anyway lol
---
All multi bixers are pathetic anti social weebs who’ve got even less going for them in their lives than undead lv60 rogues repetitively ganking lowbies.
---
This!
---
Beans
---
exactly.  its hard to find 40 people who all are ok with a long, dragged out wipefest.  many of those 40 will go to green pastures
---
Like, even assuming they do go forward you’re going to sink down into the chair and then your arms/elbows are going to be resting up at damn near shoulder height which can’t be ergonomically ideal lol.
---
Honestly, no. I think the negative attitude of the sub is helping the devs stay on track. There isn't really any plausible explanation for layering having remained enabled on a server with 800 people playing on it. Without the literally dozens of posts about the 50+ bugs with hunters, Blizz probably wouldn't have known about it.
---
Guys, it's a beta, it's going to get fixed, don't panic. Look at how BFA turned out...
---
Keep the hype? The hype is gone (for beta, anyways). How to get it back? Easy, just invite more people to the damn beta. But they won't do that, for whatever reason. 
---
Right now it's more hurting the game's hype than helping it. They should close the beta for good OR open the floodgates. *And no, I'm not talking about stress tests...*
---
Guilds usually pay for tank repair costs and re-specs.
---
Mages level Hella fast on their own
---
I think they have a lot of character actions thrown into the batch window. IMO only combat should be included, but I have no idea how it actually worked in Vanilla.
---
Heroin is a helluva drug.
---
Chasing the Deathwing is a rush
---
Hunter is the easiest Solo leveling class by far. As long as you avoid Warrior, you'll have a good time. Warrior solo is by far the toughest from my experience.
---
Its something wveryone wants so everyone should need. I certainly will need and expect everyone else to do it too. If they dont well thats too bad for them
---
Why would you remove things like Right click report?
---
i have two level 60 warlocks.  i did the epic mount quest for the riding and purchased AV mounts to use.
---
Made me laugh
---
Look at everything they've actually done over the last few years and it makes a lot more sense they would just release whatever is the easiest to monetize, regardless of what fans actually want.
---
Well we are getting the 1.12 version of the game so the C'thun thing is irrelevant along with numerous other issues that were resolved by 1.12.  The only thing held back from 1.12 is content which is being released in phases.
---
&gt; Just because it actually happened in 2005 doesn't mean it's correct either.
---
Which is why I said "and if so, should it be improved regardless?"
---
&gt;Servers lagging and crashing and having downtime was also "the true vanilla experience".
---
And I bet we still will get that experience with classic too :)
---
That no one had a word to say to the writers during GoT, while we're here to report bugs through an in-game function. 
---
No they're not the same thing. You can still report and talk about it without panicking.
---
Subjectiveness? When they just fixed a bunch of bugs and are obviously working on the rest of these issues? Sorry buddy but you seem lost.
---
That wont happen.  Blizzard is over.

In pvp feign isn't about tricking the enemy it's for target drop plus trap lay.
---
The spell casting interrupt is crucial in close fights.
---
In WSG I run boar for extra kiting.
---
If pet happiness food costs too much you aren't bringing to pvp to be taken seriously.  A little meat every couple bgs is nothing.   I poo more faps and swift then meat.
---
But if you use boar you can feed bread from vendors.
---
So, if 3/3 improved concentration aura is 50%, and the spiritual focus is 70%.  How does the game do the math for 91%?
---
That one is fixed or was not really bugged.  Skeletons are disappearing when they apply a patch.
---
are they actually trying to fix shit or is this beta just to get free advertising ?
---
Honestly I would love to go a step further and have aoe looting as well. Feels like a quality of life thing to me, personally, but it's also not a priority right now with so many other things and I can understand why some people wouldn't want that in the game anyway.

Excuse me maybe you didn't get the memo, the only 2 opinions allowed in this sub are unrelenting adulation of blizzard, or endlessly crying and moaning about how awful everything is. Nuance and constructive criticism are not permitted. I'm going to need to see your shitposting license.
---
Spooky Scary Skeletons!
---
I would agree in most cases but not 100% of the time. The last rank of conjure water is worth like 1k gold but it would be pretty douchy to roll need on it if you have a mage in the group who needs it.
---
I particularly hate how my female human warrior turned into an evil witch cause of the graphic update. 
---
I do also like to see lots of things , like LFR or graphic updates on bosses, and probably anyone can make some fine arguments about why their proposals are better. 
---
The thing is if we start making changes, then where do we stop ?
---
Blizzard best come through then!

WoW was extremely casual for an MMO. Compare the abundance of quests and the ability to solo your way to max level to games like Everquest or Dark Age of Camelot, where you simply had to group because soloing was either horrendously inefficient or simply not feasible because a single class did not have the toolkit necessary to take on mobs their own level. Add to that severe punishment on death (EQ/DAoC: loss of exp, EQ even had deleveling, in UO you dropped all items on your character to the ground as loot).
---
Older MMOs also had no instancing, so when your group held a spot in dungeons, no one else could claim that. Raid nights would take forever and drop almost no loot.
---
WoW was so casual at release that MMO veterans used to ridicule it because it catered to the Diablo kiddie market instead of the hardcore MMO crowd.
---
Posting for visibility. Blizzard NEED to fix this.
---
well if people can trust blizzard to remove layering...
---
But in actual retail vanilla, C'thun was bugged for a month and unkillable! If you fix this, it's a change and therefor bad and we shouldn't do it. :\^)
---
I dont know which patch, but one patch in classic removed reckoning and enrage being proccable by /sit crits. Therefore it was stated it wont be possible in classics release.
---
&gt;I seriously doubt this will be fixed.
---
Why wouldnt they? So far (besides the language Server thingy) everything is done correctly and even better than People would have imagined.
---
Again, ist a beta. Ist there to test things. May it be pathing, correct working quests, elite mob damage or /sit to get crit. Doesnt matter what. The more that gets found, the better. In the end, its all about the real release and not a beta. And testing the same Thing over and over again from different Scenarios is important there. Although its quite clear that reckoning is getting procced by /sit crits, it could be something completly different actually. Or its maybe only a human Pally Thing? Maybe it only procs with full mail gear, not on Cloth? Thats the stuff we dont know. And if more and more People test it - yea they kinda just wanna have fun with it for now, but who cares its still the beta - the outcome in the end will be better.
---
Exactly how would you enforce that rule?
---
If done correctly (letting the system work without overrule.) DKP is the best imo. dkp fails when people try to do dkp with "some lootcoincil oversight." My vanilla guild did dkp correctly and it absolutely NEVER felt unfair. Lootcouncil on the other hand is far too easily corrupted. Think of it this way the big complaint with DKP is people hoard their points for items they want and pass up upgrades. Then other people get shots at those upgrades. Hoarding generally didnt happen often in my experience but when it did why should that person not get the item they hoarded for? It's like your neighbor saving his irl money for a new car when he rides a bike. Sure he could buy a beater and it would be an upgrade but he has his eye on what he wants. In DKP system those arent just random points, they came from him showing up, prepared, without being a problem for long enough he EARNED said item. People who shit on dkp act like the points are given randomly or based on popularity and forget every point of dkp currency you have was worked for. And it's funny they act like the points are unfairly given but want a system like loot council where whoever has more popularity points rakes in more gear usually. I get that everyone is going to say "nuh uh" and give me anecdotal evidence of loot council working great, but there's way too much of it going bad too. If you want to work for gear go DKP. If you want to get more gear, get on a lootcouncil or start sucking up now.

*Game oooooon*
---
&gt;TBC is a far superior game to vanilla wow
---
Yeah... no.
---
Complaining about complaining.
---
Productive post, OP.
---
Yes, which I would say is better than 1 full server with a queue time, and 4 dead servers. Layers should collapse no matter what, and if people don't like the queue they can leave,though likely not enough will to turn the server into anything but "High" instead of full. This is close to what we would experience launch, as opposed to wonky left-over servers withering away because they didn't cleanly fit into the server cluster that got merged, or merging and still being low pop. It's a lot easier to justify collapsing layers, a tech internal to a realm, than it is to have 1 Full server, but still for some reason combining 4 low pop servers into it after some time passes. I mean really try selling that to a forum of fans "Hey you know that server you guys have a queue to enter? Well it's part of a group of servers that didn't do so great, so we're cram them into your server now." As opposed to layering, which we'll be aware of from the launch of the server, and have a cohesive understanding who is on our server, even if it means we don't see them every time we log in around launch. 
---
Far few logistical issues, fewer tough questions to answer (like handling naming once the servers merge, do you keep people having some sort of Connected-realm name? Like would there be Battlenub-Warsong1, and a Battlenub-Warsong2 if there was another guy with my name on one of the servers? It's just cleaner to not use servers that you plan on collapsing into each other later on.
---
Ever wonder why trolls greet you with “You come get ‘da Voodoo,” but then say “Stay away from ‘da Voodoo”? Make up your damn minds.
---
Guy below me said it better than I could. And no game is ever bugfree, regardless of it's age.
---
....this was a private server team with ONE server. ONE SERVER. ILL REPEAT ONE SERVER. Do you forget that vanilla wow had what looks like over 30 servers to choose from? Are you using your brain? Do you actually think I think a private server PROJECT had more players than BLIZZARD? No.....but their server had more players than any server that has ever existed in vanilla wow and it was the best experience in a game I’ve had. This is my point the entire time. Blizzard can easily have multiple servers of 5-6k population caps with no layering and be fine. There’s no major problems on the servers with more than this number. And it actually makes the auction house very good, because there’s so many items available to buy, as well as competitive prices.
---
10/10 I love how they are all level 1's but then its like a 40 NE rogue lol.
---
*goes back to delete old comments criticizing blizzard*
---
Typical reddit, jumping to conclusions before the beta is even halfway done. You guys need to think more and talk less.
---
The same way you enforce anything... Community reporting to an admin. Is that so out there?
---
This may as well be a complete fake, but aside from few very specific information there... We all know Blizz is going down really fast. No franchise is really alive at this point and Classic together with Diablo 4 are going to be their last try, before fading into obscurity.
---
And since the main goal is always to "make money"... Guess which games are going to be monetized the most? And don't tell me Classic will never get more than 15 dollas from people... Because in the end, it's not us or even devs calling the shots, when it comes to money.
---
Hopefully, we're gonna get at least 2 peaceful years, before they destroy it as well. Most people will walk away and "NOCHANGES" will die in eternal Reeee.

Anyone test if they fixed the mob spawning bugs? Details outlined here:

---
&gt; I did it. 2-piece "of the Fang" had no effect on poisons. Acidic Walkers (and a few other spell damage gear) had no effect on poisons.
---
Both of those only give a very small amount of +nature and +spell damage, respectively. If the scaling coefficient on Poisons is around 7%, you would only get a +1 damage when you reach +10 spell/nature dam. Is it possible you dipped below this number in your testing, or simply didn't notice that the damage range was hitting at +1 damage from before?
---
GearScore in Wrath was an add-on you had to have, Blizz didn't implement it until later.
---
Oh shit, I guess I have to watch CNN to get real classic news.
---
They don't, that is why this forum is 80% people bitching about layering.
---
&gt; thing is I know the ret is way worse than say war/rogue for pvp
---
Well this just isn't true. Ret is like a goddamn wrecking ball with the right gear. Hand of Rag + HoJ + Seal of Command + Darkmoon Maelstrom is a big ole proc cock that makes shaman windfury look like a joke. The other difference being better armor and available gear, blessing of freedom, and increased move speed to actually get close to people. Ret can be pretty insane, especially if you go dwarf.
---
On private server world buffs fade when you enter the I stance for the first month. So when clearing naxx I've not done any bosses with a world buff on.
---
Their technical explanation about why a 5-30 minute layer cooldown would lag the server is completely false.  I don't know if they are a programmer or not, but there is no reason that reserving a spot on a layer would cause lag or clog servers.  It is as simple as maintaining a list and checking against that list during login.
---
Fucking Amen brother, this sub-reddit has become a cesspool of negative, angry and entitled man children who collectively complain about every little aspect (whether it be bugged or non bugged aspects) of wow classic and don’t come up with any real solutions to issues whilst always spouting #nochanges #notmywow and also crusading against streamers and how they are going to ruin the game. It’s crazy, blizzard do take notice and they do read in game reports that beta testers have sent, so please for the sake of your own (and my own) sanity just calm down.
---
It's impossible to grant and they'd never do this anyways. Streamers = Publicity for them, easily. There are a ton of streamers anyways. It almost feels like 25% of the people I encounter in games, stream. Almost 1 in every type of party I join. I have paired up with some streamers though, that are total dicks because they're in "acting" mode of some sort that isn't always polite or fun.
---
&gt;  It's all vain or toxic.  
---
Well that's just pure false. There is at least a handful(whatever that amounts to) of chill, cooperative, and nice streamers out there. Large and Small.

Spunky - Night Elf hunter, this dude basically taught a young me how to play and introduced me to PvP, I remember watching him win duels against people like 10 levels above him and just being in awe.
---
Giancarlo - This guy was also a human warrior and we were super tight; learning how to play together, one of the best wow friends I've ever had, I remember rolling horde with him at the start of TBC; both of us playing blood elf pally and just farming AB for weeks, always at stables lol.

Sphink - Gnome mage and my guild leader. He helped me get my level 40 mount and was just an awesome dude.

Would blizzard have overthought their plans with Diablo Immortal if there were no people like the aprils fool guy and the trailer being ripped to shreds with dislikes etc?
---
They tried to silence the disappointment by sweeping it under the rug, kind of like here where posts about layering or eu servers get deleted instantly even with constructive alternatives in it, just because we already have a post about it somewhere when you scroll down for 3 minutes thats not pinned.
---
Layering is a dark evil
---
Wow they fixed a bug, they did their job congrats.
---
You people instantly dismissing this are just as obtuse as anyone who instantly believes it's true. 4chan had an accurate Pokémon S/S leak just *weeks* ago. At the same time, it's had plenty of fake ones. The trick is deciding what sounds plausible, and boy, does this sound plausible.

A touch? He’s full autismo and his friends are worse. I watched his stream for like 30 seconds one time and him and his friend on discord were losing their shit because of the blizzard message saying that they were shutting down the server to stress test more because not enough people were on in the middle of the day. They took that to mean that classic will be dead on arrival for not enough players. Que autistic rants/meltdown.
---
Lmfao see you on the battlefield friend ;)
---
I am not for AoE looting. It would change the gold farming meta from vanilla. #NoChanges
---
Farming low level dungeons such as Deadmines was not worth it becuase you had to loot one by one. Adding aoe looting would depress the price of lower level mats such as linen, wool and low level enchanting mats.
---
I'm not saying completely, of course you will be able to meet people and make friends. I'm saying there will be a hell of a lot of social awkwardness, far more than there is in retail wow. Lets be honest this game over the past decade has catered more and more to non social people. Group finder/dungeon finder/LFR have all made this game very easy to play solo.
---
What a useless comment.
---
Yep, I noticed this a little bit last night. Had a couple of fears that just crapped out after a second or 2. Had to sneak in a death coil to give me another shot at fear before a land giant pounded through my cloth.

---
When has this ever happened that you point out was "so often" ? Can you show at least .. idk.. 3 examples ? Even though that barely qualifies as "so often"  
---
You can't dictate the way someone will play, just roll on a different realm. For someone with no interest in streamers you sure do think a lot about them.
---
Prot Pally can't ever be viable for any fight that requires a taunt.
---
I would not choose a guild based on the loot rules they advertise. How the system is used is much more important than what system is used.
---
Loot council and DKP both, like any other system, can be abused by raid leaders and to some extent by raid team members. As others have noted, DKP can encourage hoarding points to snipe sought after items at the expense of taking meaningful but lesser upgrades.
---
Loot council is only as good as the people doing the distribution. It can be the best and fairest system for everyone, or a source of literally endless back stabbing wailing and gnashing of teeth. Either system may be better depending what the goals of the team are; usually loot council is optimal if the goal is fast progression for the team and the council has sound knowledge of all classes and accurately can judge who should get an item to most benefit the team.
---
DKP can work fine for encouraging and rewarding attendance as long as someone is willing to put in the time to track and maintain it (or whatever add on or data source is used for it), and if some adjustments are made as needed to counter the problems it can cause. But it can be manipulated for evil ends the same as any system and if applied blindly without regard to possible consequences it can be a disaster.
---
The more important thing with any loot system is the level of trust that the raid team has in each other and the integrity of the raid leader and loot council or DKP admin when it comes to dealing with problems. If everyone gets along and is honest and all trust each other any system will work fine. If the entire team is back stabbing lying selfish assholes then no system will prevent the inevitable train wreck.
---
Explain that to me. That'd be great to know. How is it vain to just invite people to a chat and game with someone playing a game? Not everyone is vain dude. If streaming itself is vain, then so is being social and literally every other human aspect, if we base it off of your logic. I guess video game companies shouldn't stream either? Shame on them right? Come on man.
---
I vote for mage for the following reason: You can't play as a gnome if you decide for hunter or paladin.

Honestly as a Warlock using just the leveling gear and spending on nothing unless you get really good deals is fine.  They’re just not gear dependent at all for leveling and if your idea is to be geared for a PvP match up you’re likely not gonna win against most equally skilled players in many early contested leveling brackets.  
---
By the time you get into 40s where you’re mostly getting stat gear you’re gonna be fine with just your pet and spells.  
---
+shadow damage gear will be king, but you’ll have to be ready to snipe it for cheap before someone else does.  I don’t know how many Shadoweave will exist by the time you get into late 30s and early 40s on a fresh realm anyways. 
---
Personally, as someone who’s 95% going Lock unless I can talk myself into Rogue, save every penny for late game stuff.  It’ll add up.

I can't speak on beta, but healing was about that responsive in Vanilla from what I remember. There was always a delay before a heal went through. Should be videos around to display that.

we will probably have to wait to find out how they implement a lot of things like this that people can only really speculate on currently

https://www.xkcd.com/386/
---
Lol. The bosses in retail WoW are 10x as mechanically challenging as the ones in Vanilla. Vanilla has like 4 different mechanics split across 15 bosses.
---
They didn't just multi box 1 class. They would run 5 different classes so they could get the most benefit out of everything that dropped.
---
So what you are saying is that we should  ignore the fact that it's a buggy mess and with layering and all that it's most likely going to be a inferior product.
---
All reasons are valid lol

If we chilled out, then you wouldn't have seen the fixes they applied so fast - release is 2 months away, stfu about "chilling out" already
---
The problems with loot council are worse than that though. EVEN if you find the magical totally fair and trustworthy loot council, every decision is still the arbitrary choice of some humans. This means that those who don't get drops are now free to imagine all sort of slights and drama, thus causing problems in the guild. Loot council really only works in guilds who are making such good progress that the flow of loot coming in is so high that people would rather deal with the drama they imagine in their heads than deal with a slower moving guild.
---
There's something to be said about cold, mechanical systems.
---
That being said, off-line loot council is often a very good compromise. Since loot tables are known, loot is divvied up and reserved before hand, so there's transparency in who is getting what next. There's no drama when DFT drops when everybody in the guild knows whose in line for the next DFT before the first pull.
---
It's the same argument which makes devs spit out crap game after crap game.

I think its the slope mentality.  If the "no changes" crowd were flexible and said ok to water graphic changes, and NE ear changes, then its a small step to player graphic changes because it only affects the visuals, then to weapon/gear looks because it only affects the way enchants and swing mechanics look, then barber shop comes in because it only changes the way my toon looks visually, then transmog because it only affects the way my characters equipment looks, and before long we have LFG and Flying.
---
No Changes isn't because they want it to be 2004 again, its because we have a rare opportunity to play a game before all those small tiny QOL changes turned Vanilla into BFA.
---
Some of my best fights in vanilla were on farm duty, holding out for backup.

Show me WoW examples of losing loot drop rolls that you claim happen so often, not over-spazzy battleroyale players that cater to a younger audience. You're intentionally lying, making up fantasy scenarios to push your "streamers are ruining my life" agenda. For someone "well-adjusted in his late 20's" you sure don't seem reasonable.

As much as I like aoe looting (and I thought about it just like you), I don't think it should be included. I remember having difficult times looting some corpses in dangerous areas, getting aggro from nearby mobs, etc. which is all part of the game. AoE looting makes it easy fest because you can loot from a safe distance.
---
Lol you are ridiculous. I’ve stated multiple times I’ve done launch servers, with zero problems each time. Obviously not the same experience, but it was fun. You know what you do? You just grind the dynamic spawns...find a spot and grind it, all you need is two mobs to play off of.
---
And now you think everyone’s opinion is someone else’s opinion? There’s two opinions, layering or no layering, but okay dude all I do is read reddit lol. And yes layering affects everything from questing, to gathering materials, to pvp, to meeting people. How do you implement it correctly? What if there’s a wide scale battle going on and then too many players are in one spot so the server layers them because they aren’t all in a party? There’s absolutely zero need for it, and you’re all sheep if you think it has anything to do with bettering the experience for you. This is activision, a company who’s stock is half of what it’s 52 week high was after suffering a HUGE fall. This is 100% profit driven. Get a clue pal.

There is a lot of downtime in WPvP.  You can get a couple of guys grabbing herbs or mining nodes, or maybe some high level questing, but you can sometimes have 10 minute gaps just asking guild, world, and local if they've seen anyone.  You might gank in Redridge hoping 60s come, but they never do.
---
I don't really watch streams much, or at all, but that would be pretty damn boring in my mind.  I think BGs with duels while in queue would be the most interesting.  What do retail streamers do?
---
If it were up to me, I'd be all for adding aoe-looting. /u/Droptoss brings up a valid point though the convenience of easier looting is worth way more than the economic impact on some low-level mats. The main problem is that you have to draw the line somewhere and "no changes" is a lot easier to sell than "some specific changes".  
---
It's one of the very few slippery slope arguments tbh.
---
Its not the greatest solo class if i remember correctly.
---
At least we have world PvP to pass the time by if it gets to crazy I suppose
---
Pass unless im on an undead or human character the mount looks dumb and out of place. If it's a pub part of me might say f it and roll need. With friends i would let an undead have it.
---
Who said anything about not interacting?  It’s not like you can’t drop down to 1 character.  It mostly saves on leveling headaches dealing with people going afk, people leaving early because they didn’t get their loot piece, people not understanding aggro mechanics, not having to wait for a tank or a healer to show up, not having to convince the group that it’s just WC you can tank the place with pets, no ninja looters, etc.  
---
Then once you hit 60, you’ve got a pocket posse for grabbing the instance loot you want, and a full set of characters for any role you may decide to PUG or that needs filled out in a guild run of whatever.
---
If you do not have a healer or strong leveling partner it’s a slow process. If you really enjoy leveling it’s not torture or anything, but hunter, mage or warlock would be more fun solo
---
Oh really? Did they post that somewhere?
---
Shadow priests do fine leveling and in world pvp, and can just drop shadowform and heal in any non-raid content perfectly fine.
---
Sabertooth human best human

My guild has some kind of mixture of Loot council/DKP. Since we were not serious progression raiders, silly things like our Bindings goung to a Hunter and Sulfuras goin g to our holy pally, but nobody was really mad at that. We cleared Bwl and MC just fine and even Aq40 till Huhuran and Spiderwing in naxx. I guess feeding your tanks loot and having them go into minus dkp really helped our rogues/offtanks to get some needed DPS gear so the 2 main tanks won't snag those away.
---
2Handers for instance were never a priority for anyone, as our mantra was:"You get 1handers for pvp and own noobs, so pay for it or get lost."
---
key word being pserver
---
Asking people to be a bit optimistic/positive is not whining. It's like the being intolerant of the intolerant paradox.
---
“/p let’s all roll greed”
---
And then I roll need
---
Hey.
---
Lesser healing wave got me from MC to AQ40.  I think after that they finally fixed chain heal?
---
Thanks Spurros!  
---
I definitely understand the importance of Gouge, especially in PvP. However because of the white damage and poison procs you'll still deal a significant amount of damage while pooling energy for Gouge + Backstab, right? If Gouge is used to pool energy we won't be able to deal **any** damage to the enemy, thus decreasing our DPS. If I would have trouble taking down mobs or problem with long downtimes, Improved Gouge would be a godsend for sure! But for pure grinding I don't see how 3 points in it would benefit me other than helping against ganks. Especially not if compared to, let's say 12% increased damage on that backstab.
---
Back in late BC me and a friend two-manned every dungeon at the appropriate level up to and including Slave Pens. 
---
Our first series of runs I played a Warrior Tank and he played a Resto Druid. That proved too easy so we did it again as Rogue/Mage. That required some creativity.
---
I'm sure they'll find something else to complain about.
---
Yeah you're entirely right, I too found that guys inability to understand basic maths hilarious.
---
I don't like the dudes content but it seems to me from the clips I've seen here and there that a lot of the complaining they do is to directly trigger people
---
Na, we got plenty to complain about. For example, why in hell haven't some of us gotten the chance to try classic yet?
---
I take it you were around when Vanilla was initially launched. Queue times are also bad for community driven/focused games.
---
I’m not going to worry about the raising issue for a while. I just enjoy hunters, especially the Classic ones with melee, ranged, ammo, etc. And shadowmeld makes me such a pain in PvP. Concussive shot EFC from some weird place they’re not expecting after I’ve laid traps, serpent sting everyone, then sic my pet on them while I run around CCing people and wrecking healers.
---
Just look at this thread. Kids are frothing at the mouth to defend the culture, but can't seem to comprehend that the only reason people stream is to be famous.
---
liar liar wrong side now you're on fire
---
The UI was very original. Older digital card games were mostly using the same solitaire style UI. Hearthstones is completely different from anything else out there.

&lt;Doggo Noir&gt; would be perfect for the both of you. We have set raid times of Tuesday/Thursdays at 7 pm est but considering we have a lot of parents and working adults we will be flexible with times. Good group of guys and we are still working on recruiting. I shot you a pm with a link to our application. Hope to hear from you soon!
---
But it is one of the best talents starting out. It's a lot of energy saved because of how much you use Sinister Strike from level 11 to level 30.
---
What about all the nations plunged into poverty by free markets?
---
For the Horde!!
---
The dud is this post, where you blatantly ignore the story and hidden lore of latter games just because you don’t like them.
---
I gave you examples of toxic streamer culture, I don't need to give more. 
---
&gt;Also, if you "fucking hate streamer culture" why THE FUCK are you on livestreamfail ??? Do you even realize the level of hypocrisy ?
---
Ok calm down there stream baby, but it makes sense that I'd watch videos of streaming failing... Because I don't agree with it. I also don't seek it, as it makes it to r/all readily.
---
The only thing worse than perfection is a lack of errors.
---
Iv played on several private servers during launch and played vanilla during long queues and crashes. Waiting a bit is better than splitting pop even if you pick the same realm. You simply cannot defend layering in a social game unless you care more about easy questing the first few days.
---
Deathwing,
---
Troll hunter named Headhunter. Basically owned the AH.
---
I had the same thought. Still rolling Shaman but Rogue is my plan B. They're bursty melee and have a rich class-fantasy with poisons, pick pocketing, lock picking.
---
No we can NOT chill in the slightest we MUST keep the pressure on Blizzard to get this right look at their track record if left alone with no pressure. I beg everyone to continue to pressure them every day to its 100% perfect Classic and we have separate language servers.
---
hence the title same fast "early game" traveling
---
Go back to retail, baby.
---
Also, this is hilarious:
---
&gt;You're intentionally lying, making up fantasy scenarios to push your "streamers are ruining my life" 
---
Because I never said that. Are you crying and writing this?
---
The main problem is how picky our community is. There is a significant number of us who'd love to see the blood plague making a return, but that was a bug as well. You can't ask Blizzard to fix the bugs except for a few bugs we thought were funny.  
---
I for one would love to be able to hop my way up to to the Stormwind walls by repeatedly jumping into a corner and then make my way underneath the city again but I wouldn't hold it against them if they fixed that.
---
Damage text doesn’t show up half the time and it considers each strike as seperate, instead one one proc all at once. It’s quite clear if you watch a stream of someone playing shaman on the beta.
---
If you're near a ledge, yes. You can just mind control people off.  
---
Otherwise... probably harder as a holy priest but not impossible. Keep heals up and wand people down, you'll either outlive or bore them to death, or maybe live long enough to have someone help you.
---
It’s not about crafting a full set of BIS for level x, it’s about plugging holes where you just aren’t getting drops/rewards, and the occasional blue item.  I wore plenty of self crafted leather stuff leveling my first hunter, and tailor will always be useful just for making bags.
---
Thinking of doing a druid, but hoping that there arent that many.  I remember there never being more than 1 maybe 2 druids in a raid, and them getting flooded with gear.   I healed as a shaman, and the idea of spirit actually working during combat is very tempting ;)  
---
What are the main druid raid heals in classic?  I really just went to hop around casting hots.
---
No, but we're slowly running out of things to bitch about.
---
Retail bad, classic good, upvotes to the left
---
I'm honestly very glad to see this. 
---
I was worried we get the 'BfA-treatment', where Blizzards wants all bugs and unbalances reported only to ship them with the release. I'm sure there's still alot to fix and to adjust, but at least this is a sign that they are actively working on things.
---
I always wanted a totem poll legendary weapon for them... never got it.
---
Has nothing to do with being negative. Saying something or someone is “negative” is really just a buzz word to demean the actual arguments.
---
Blizzard has a track record of not fixing stuff in their betas. This is the reality we live in. They are doing a great job with classic so far, but it’s important to keep banging on the internet doors. Any cause or issue we can bring light to, we should.
---
And we shall. 
---
Remember: It’s only beta guys they’ll fix it. Oh, it’s only launch they’ll fix it. Ahh they’ll get it by the .2 patch. Oh well guess we are waiting till next expansion...
---
would you spend 2 talents on 8 stamina? That would be a huge waste, boot enchant SAVES you 2 talents, but if the talent works while mounted and the boots don't you can justify taking it that way.(also justified if your spec needs filler)
---
I hope they also roll out ger/fr/en servers for EU. I don't wanna sound like a spoiled brat, but I played vanilla on a GER Server and I want to play on a GER server for classic. German online culture so vastly different than the rest of Europe, it would not feel the same.
---
&gt;That no one had a word to say to the writers during GoT, while we're here to report bugs through an in-game function.
---
lol you think our opinion matters 2 months before release? That is rich.
---
&gt;No they're not the same thing. You can still report and talk about it without panicking.
---
Sit down and relax and keep cool were the terms used. Changing the implication of what those words just makes you look silly.
---
&gt;Subjectiveness? When they just fixed a bunch of bugs and are obviously working on the rest of these issues?
---
Yes, It is the definition of subjective for you to say right now is definitely not the time to worry about bugs.The fact that they are moving forward doesn't mean that there isn't cause for concern. How do you not understand that? How do you not understand that just because they are working hard that doesn't mean they are gonna hit their mark?
---
I mean its green and my xp/hr went up and I also haven't had to stop to drink from healing so
---
Yeah, they’ll ban streamers but not multiboxers?  Highly doubtful.
---
Are they going to fix the wrong flightpath animations next?
---
&gt;Well, we can always post and discuss **facts** on Classic's superiority over retail.
---
FTFY
---
&gt;Are you crying and writing this?  
---
Yes I'm literally shaking right now.
---
No you buffoon I'm calling you out on your bullshitting and you're dodging the subject. "normal adjusted late 20 year old" my ass, get out of here kiddo, your favorite fortnite streamer just went live, go check out their latest highlights on livestreamfail too while you're at it.  
---
What a failed troll post.
---
LC and EPGP from my experience are the favored systems.  DKP had a lot of point hoarding and in one experience with the same points as a Boomkin on my warlock I lost a trinket to which because we had same points we did a regular /roll to determine.  I won the roll but the GM ninja'd it to the Boomkin who happened to be an IRL friend of his.
---
Posts like this are so fucking dumb. If people didn't bring up these bugs and complain about them, they would not be addressed.
---
Yeah, I figure with limited time and mostly for the purpose of fun and decompressing that a hunter or mage would be good picks. Warlock does sound fun also, but I have a friend who is picking up a warlock so I will try to grab a class no one has picked yet for the sake of diversity. The only thing I remember about paladin leveling is that I rarely died.
---
With daggers SS is pretty mediocre, and I'm interested in OPs thinking that imp gouge is kinda like energy generation since you buy an additional seconds worth. That being said optimizing for the level range and then respelling is probably the better way to play, I just don't like it for some reason.
---
So you're saying you *want* to wait in a queue for 3 hours every day for a week? You're crazy, man.
---
Username checks out? I know that Buddhists meditate, but I’m woefully ignorant of the Daoists.
---
NO CHANGES AND NO CHILL !
---
play tbc
---
I mean, any time someone is defending threads about low effort memes, complaining about streamers, bringing up the same complaint that's been posted 1000 times, people always say "Well what else are we supposed to talk about since we can't play and there isn't much to discuss." Imo there's much worst posts that make it to the front page daily than this. At the end of the day, if a post makes it out of new and you see it and don't like it, you're probably the minority so no point complaining about it.
---
Moderately casual guild - guild did not pay for anyone's respecs. Our MT mostly just stayed prot. Respecs are expensive as fuck in Vanilla, and guilds don't bring in THAT much gold, especially if you were going to do it for healers too. I think anyone expecting to respec twice a week is going to burn out fast. Most people wanted an alt anyway, and used it for farming, PvP, whatever. Early on you just deal with it. 
---
I do remember the guild paying for MT's repair bills sometimes, food/flasks for important boss attempts, and Thunderfury.
---
Isn't it "watch"?
---
Blizzard has a local data centre now, so almost definitely yes.
---
It'll be a big surprise if they don't.
---
Because 30 seconds of a 5/6 hour stream isn't taking something out of context... Ok. It's hard to believe he was doing anything other than trolling his more gullible viewers to get a rise out of them by saying classic will be DOA.
---
Yeah, it's hard to describe but I just love the feel of gliding over the world in stealth. It feels smooth, you know? I can understand the logic of why it's inaccurate as an animation, but I think turned out so good. Feels like your character is light on their feet. I suppose not everyone is going to feel that way though. That's the nature of feelings! I wish people wouldn't resort to name calling over feelings they can't comprehend are subjective, though.
---
You sound fun!
---
There's a few utility totems to use. Like capacitor totem which stuns nearby enemies after 2s or wind rush totem which gives your party a speed boost. Resto shamans have a healing stream totem.
---
Elemental shamans also have access to the Totem Mastery talent which is an active skill that drops four ability boosting totems at your location. But there's no decision making involved here. You just push the button at the start of each fight and again if the fight lasts long enough for them to expire.
---
Boxing in phase 2 will probably be a pretty decent way to rank up a few characters.
---
I still don't get it. Seems like you have two options.
---
1. Try to be positive while submitting bugs in the hopes that the game will going work out as you'd imagined.
---
2. Be a miserable fuck while submitting bugs and bitching online about how hopeless your situation is because the devs are trash and everything sucks and retail is terrible.
---
Why would you consciously pick option #2?
---
This is very good!
---
I kinda wish they would just ban it. Especially for stuff like world PvP.
---

Spell batching has been artificially recreated in Classic because it is different in the modern game than it was in Classic.

Send shivers down your spine
---
Some systems tailor that and once you get loot you kinda drop down the list allowing others to get gear as well.  This will it helps with group progression as opposed to just fully gearing out a few people.

Keep in mind that tailoring makes bags and that's great while leveling

Haha that's funny cause I did the exact same thing but moved to Burning Steppes!
---
IMO they should just remove Classic spell batching.
---
a nice idea but most people dont have the time and dont want their efforts/money split into 2.
---
Skype vs discord or make your own server with password protected sub channels
---
Okip !
---
When you say it like that, it sounds like it goes against the core aspects of the game.
---
I personally think they’re one of the better solo wpvp classes. 
---
As long as you can get your fear off, you’re golden. I’d say a hunter would wreck you though.
---
You have a good point. They should add more people to the beta then. I don’t think there’s enough right now
---
 My vote is remove layering completely, and implement dynamic respawns if they aren't already. We want two things, to be able to see and interact with other players, and to have mobs to kill. This solves both.
---
It blows my mind that anybody bothers to watch another person play World of Warcraft on “tv.”  Why is this a thing.
---
Sad to say, I was hoping for something ... extra.
---
Namely the Forsaken having legs rotating clockwise and the upper body rotating counter-clockwise...pivot at the hips, of course.
---
Three factions would've fit the mold for WoW very well when you consider the Illidan campaign in TFT. You could've had their starting areas on Outland.
---
It is helped along by the fact your character isn't the one and only hero to grace their land (with 3,500 other copies).  You're an adventurer that is building a name for yourself, not just as the game progresses but among your peers on the server.  Things like the limited amounts of Scarab riders, TF wielders, R14 PvPers, etc.  They and the people associated, like their guild and friends, have that recognition from the questline(s), the non-player characters, and the playerbase.
---
It's neat and feels very rewarding as an RPG.  Lots of games you build your character mechanically, but only a few do you build your reputation (like among strangers, not like "this guy can tank ok").
---
If you are "defending" in world-PvP, you are almost always at an unfair disadvantage.
---
You have aggro of a mob, they are two while you are one, they have a higher level then you... Class doesn't matter all that much.
---
Given there's a relatively fair situation, it mostly is about not being an appealing target. For that the most important factor is "How dangerous would this guy be to me when he retaliates and get's to open on me?"
---
A healing-priest probably is not terribly scary in that regard.
---
However, unless you are the one who wants to initiate the fights, I really wouldn't use viablility in solowpvp as the deciding factor on what to class to play.
---
You'll usually be able to avoid wPvP. As a healer you'll find instance-groups quite easily and spend a lot of time there.
---
Healing the nearly dead guy running away only to have all the mobs turn on you and see him run away laughing. 
---
The blurst of times.
---
Haha I played Horde on Blackrock, and I fucking hated those Eminence jerks cause they used to roll everyone and absolutely loved themselves and their bloody PvP premade groups. Think my mate Gnomerogue was in that guild for a bit
---
This sounds like the commie argument against being rich.
---
"You don't need five sports cars, that shouldn't be allowed."
---
"You don't need five mansions, that shouldn't be allowed."
---
"You don't need five WoW accounts, that shouldn't be allowed."
---
You just sound jelly.
---
How does anyone believe that post..
---
Imagine getting det one shot by 5 shadow melded hunters 😂
---
You are in for a shock as alliance has piss poor flight paths/traveling compared to horde. And usually the horde bases are in better spots. I always thought it was the opposite in Vanilla based on intuition.
---
Some people find ganking and camping fun, what's stopping a multiboxers from doing it? Nothing, that's not even an argument and just naive as hell.
---
Just walk away from the camp? It's easy to camp someone all day, have you ever played the game lmao? A 5 man multibox can clear dungeons very effectively, probably better than alot of dungeon groups.
---
Hey, thumbs up and thanks for uploading.
---
Similar things happen with Seal of Righteousness and Seal of Command. Interesting. I’ve reported it a few times on the beta
---
Let the drugs flow through you.
---
All I can say is I’m really excited to see Cairne Bloodhoof again.
---
Actually I agree with him. I think Classic will he flooded at launch yes, but I think the overall amount of players will be higher 6 months after release than at release as players who have long since quit and new players return slowly because Classic is back and it’s a much higher quality game.
---
Rank 11 raptor was rideable by Tauren in vanilla (Naxx patch I think).
---
But then you took an arrow to the knee?
---
It's different from Nostalrius which is a problem for some people. Other than that, not much, despite what people will tell you.
---
There's nothing wrong with not liking batching, but there *is* something wrong with arguing against batching because it's not "authentic". The batching implementation in Classic isn't perfect, but it's damn close and the majority of things people complain about wrt. batching are working as intended.
---
Arguing against it is fine, though, as long as you're honest about it and admit that maybe some things about vanilla should be changed. Spell batching turned into something of a monkey paw wish for the #NOCHANGES crowd.

Warrior is the only thing I can see myself playing.
---
Horde?  I played alliance and dont recognize the name.  I remember an orc hunter named Khaos (because I wanted the name lol) an UD rogue named Mortiis.  Alliance, dwarf paladin named Lavabeard, human mage named Prada.  Forgot so many others.
---
Recently, Blizzard announced that classic EU servers souls not be language specific (I.E Spanish, German etc.). Thid mad people furious, as the server they chose on launch as a Spaniard could potentially just turn into an unofficial German server a few weeks later.
---
Lmao you just compared streamers to being persecuted like th 7 million Jews who suffered through the Holocaust. Wowww
---
Yeah if the content remain trivial i think multiboxing might be great. 🤗
---
also depends on the daggers. Some daggers have a speed &gt;2.0 and they actually pack quite a punch with SS

How about you take your crypto bs somewhere else

Do you understand that reference?
---
For PC and MMOs maybe, but for gaming as a whole,  87.47 million Playstation 2s were sold by the end of 2005.    
---
There were many many more gamers playing PS2 and WoW in 2005.
---
Actually if you consistently have thorns OR warlock flameshield it kicks ass. Without those buffs it is very difficult but fun, with both buffs it is quite powerful and extremely fun.
---
Why report is removed? Its a great tool and it doesn't make any sense to take it away. Some of the changes just for the sake of "iT wAs LiKe ThIs iN VaNIlLAaA" doesn't make any fucking sense.
---
I appreciate the sentiment, and have tried the same before, but it won't help. This post will probably do fine and people will come out to back you up today in light of yesterday's debacle and the fixes patched today, but it wont last. The Reddit circle of life will happen and a few days from now the doomsayers will come out again with some new issue to make people want to bring out the pitchforks. 
---
There's a solid group here that want Classic to fail or just like drama and will meme on "Activision Blizzard" and how Blizzard can't be trusted to fix things due to them not listening to people during BfA beta and whatnot. I've learned to just let it go. These people either won't play Classic, or will move on after a month and will only come back when some streamer complains about something or a new issue arises down the road so that they can chime in with "I'm so glad I quit this shit game when I did" or something.

Its quickly looking all too similar to the OSRS subreddit, thankfully the mods here keep house a little cleaner.
---
Lol no worries man! Appreciate it!
---
I used to be an adventurer
---
Bugfixes they are actually fixing during the beta according to a few recent posts in this subreddit. So I agree with your feeling to keep our cool, my previous comment was snarky tbh.
---
Yeah I recall them sticking around for much longer
---
An ability available to one class. And one, which hits other classes much harder than a paladin. A warlock, priest, ele shaman or mage are nearly useless without mana. A ret paladin can still use SoC rank 1 and deal decent burst damage.
---
How many classes have slows and immobilizes, which are very hard for warriors to deal with?
---
I’m building a house right now and had a scheduled “pre-drywall walkthrough” where I could see the house half done, framework only before doing the insulation and walls. My mom was mad at me for weeks because there were so many incomplete aspects of the house that I wasn’t asking about.
---
I was weeks out from the pre drywall walkthrough, they were still building the damn house and I wasn’t even technically supposed to be seeing the house before the scheduled date. Of **course** there are incomplete aspects. They’re still building the damn house!!
---
This sub bounces back and forth between people like me and people like my mom.
---
Its all about how its being run, and the people who are trying to get the items.
---
I have seen guilds with DKP where upgrades were disenchanted because everyone who could equip it were hoarding. Ive seen guilds with lootcouncil in TBC where some people were full T6 and some people had no parts.
---
There's no perfect system, the imperfection is that its run by people. So chose the people, not the system.
---
Warcraft 3 sets up most of the important aspects of the WoW lore which is really just, how did we get here? 
---
Now that the world has been set up by all the different factions, we as the players in WoW get to experience what it’s like to explore through it.
---
I did a lot of stealth runs in vanilla and BC and it was a lot of fun.
---
That said, you really need a rogue for some spots, due to their CC and slow abilities. Some fights have extra mobs, so you needed a good rogue to sap, slow, stun, or kite, to let you concentrate on taking down one mob at a time.
---
Thus, I'd run with a 11/35/5 druid tank, 0/30/21 druid healer, and a rogue.
---
The coolest thing about this guy is that you can go to his youtube channel and see his progression as an artist. He starts out making really mediocre stuff and every new video you can see visible improvements in his methods.
---
Just seeing him grow and learn is so cool.
---
Suggest invite is a bad thing?
---
This sub will turn back into a giant meme. Bunch of what class should I play, bunch of hype for release, many battle station threads, maybe some pvp montages, pserver/vanilla screenshots... the usual
---
It’s an awful lot of info to not be made up.  It’s like a checklist of “I need to create rumors for every blizzard IP”.  Sounds legit, but this sort of thing requires corroboration.
---
Disappearing skeletons and my biggest beef, no RpPvP realms
---
It would affect the economy so it is more than just a quality of life change.  It also changes game play and more heavily favors classes that can AoE ie: the mage.
---
#WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
But ... layering
---
God you are the absolute worst kind of gamer. I wish people like you were banned from owning a pc / gaming system. 
---
  Woah, look at that, you don’t like the though of being banned from gaming but you’d like to ban someone else for something as stupid as this.
---
Na, the dragon asked me for tree fidy
---
Only useable if you have 300 engi
---
Bc it’s abuseable. 
---
Bc they’d rather remove it than create a toggle for both. Not a big deal you are playing an old game that was never supposed to have new animations so u shouldn’t really complain.
---
It's Disgusting i couldn't be happier
---
The point is you don't get fooled again
---
dwarf is not good for lv 19 pvp compared to other races.
---
These are great! It looks like a Night Elven ancient city. Thanks a lot for sharing!
---
What do you mean justify it. What justifies people to talk to smack about someone online and not to their face. He will do what he wants on his stream the same way people will post here, come on man... If people enjoy watching his content let them enjoy it. If you don't, move on. There's nothing worse than judging a group of people that are having fun because you think they are doing it wrong and/or shouldn't be. It should be celebrated, classic wow is coming out, people are hyped, what's the problem!
---
Don't hurt yourself in your confusion
---
What did they change with the Hunter pet movement?
---
We gonna need healers out there bud
---
Waddya mean? I've seen some concerns being voiced, but no doomsday mood? Most of the people here are happy with the base product and are just nitpicking on top of it. Maybe it comes out a bit harshly due to the nature of internet speak, but I mostly see happy faces aroun here.
---
I agree and there's tons of stuff they actually changed too. They are changing the UI a bit, updating the raid frames etc. They are updating some graphical things, and the way spells work. They had to mymic spell batching and leeway, but they aren't exactly the same. We will be leveling with 1.12 gear, talents, and abilities. 
---
I use druid as a good example of how much they changed. Two of their 31 point talents were rolled into their class abilities. Among a ton of other changes. So leveling one, won't be anywhere close to the way it was originally. Like not even close.
---
*Narrator:* Now we lie in wait, as we watch u/Kotomaru12 slowly come to the realization that he, too, is an any little man child. Let's watch.
---
Like a toggle to make things look like classic? I know you can't do that on retail because the skeletons are much more complex. 
---
Either way a toggle shouldn't mean anything is "permanently" ruined! That's the whole point of a toggle. Something must be wrong.
---
The thing that worries me about Layering is that technically, it's not broken. It works as intended.
---
They aren't fixing layering, they are changing the features of it. They really need to get this right. As of right now it's an immersion killer and threat to economy, and therefore biggest threat to Classic's success.

Name: Zethren ,Troll, Mage, Guild Leader of the Guild &lt;Trust me I'm a Doctor&gt; (He also had a legendary staff near the end idk if this was hard back in the days)
---
Progress Raiding for Heroic Rag arround start/mid July 2011.
---
It was a simplier time back then in germany. I never played "retail" wow just pservers (shortly after TBC release, but still buggy pservers). For me raiding was the same as clearing the content. I never wiped and never understood how it is possible. Either the content was super easy or the boss was bugged and did way too much dmg. I got the NA account from an american friend (in my hometown was an army barracks) who also paid for me. This guild took me in a lvl 85 goblin DK with the glorious name of "Nodk". I was a real noob, but these guys took the time to explain me always everything. It was amazing. I started hanging out in their vent. just to increase my english skills. And they were always making fun of that weird german kid staying up until 5 a.m his time, just to finish the raid. I never got any loot, but for me it was not about loot, it was the feeling that these people took me because of my bad funny german words and not because of my shitty dps. After about 5 weeks of having an amazing time, I got my first few items. I was so happy I instantly told my friend. He also applied for the guild but got rejected since we had enough DK's already. He was so pissed about that, because he had still better gear and a lot more knowledge. One day i took it one joke too far.... All i got was the char deletion screenshot and a changed password for that account. I was not even able to say goodbye or thank you or anything like that. This was the time I took a 2 year break from the game.
---
&gt;  especially while sprinting
---
So you have a problem with a character not going apparently slow enough but you don't have a problem with sprinting not breaking stealth? That's not very stealthy.
---
I re-checked how blizzcon demo stealth animation looked and it looks... just naturally stealthy.
---
Feel like they could've left suggest invite in, that's decent qol.
---
Dude just check Reddit after the 13th. Someone will make a post listing all the known streamers servers. This will be your best chance to avoid them. 
---
Streaming is part of Gaming now. Just because the server you start on doesn’t have one doesn’t mean someone from your server won’t start streaming. No way blizzard will police people that are promoting their game. Good luck avoiding the big streamers. No way of knowing who is going to be the next Swifty in Classic though. Could be you even.
---
what did the fix about rouge stealth, what was wrong
---
obviously, but the most serious bugs still remain so in many people's opinions there is nothing to be tongue-in-cheek about
---
anecdotally
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2z8oa/something_is_really_wrong_at_blizzard_either/
---
Looks like you’ve already got it covered, OP.
---
Very fixed, very cool! Thank you, Blizzard!
---
You're right about it all for sure... Guess we'll have to deal with it. But yeah, this whole Activision Blizzard mantra is kind of annoying...
---
Can anyone test if hunter is playable now?
---
&gt; I'd say a geared warrior shit on everything, esp bit later in the MC/BWL time. 
---
I don't see how. You'll never get close to a mage. You'll have a hard time sticking to a hunter. Shaman, druids, rogues also have many tools to keep a warrior away. Sure, you always the chance of just bursting somebody down in the few seconds you can get thanks to charge and intercept. Free action potions to deny opponents their control are the only avenue to allow you to beat many classes 1v1, but those aren't always up.
---
To be fair, the rest have Actiblizzards actions over the years have warranted that attitude.
---
I've been in two loot council guilds where I didn't know a single soul before joining. 
---
If they only gave loot to their friends then no one would stay in the guild and they would fall apart.
---
The irony is palpable.
---
So does this mean pet AI is fixed? I know you said hunter pets got fixed... but inquiring Warlocks must know.
---
Yeah, why are they removing it? Authenticity?
---
Streamers are why we have AIDS.
---
This sub is wild (entertaining though). I checked out the beta on stream for a couple of hours and was basically like "looks good, whens the release date again?" I'm sure that between now and them people will be losing their mind about real and imaginary bugs, layering, deciding what server to play on, trying to find new and unique ways to make bad specs not bad, endlessly debate casual vs. hardcore, addons vs none, the "feel" and "spririt" of vanilla, etc. but in the end we are all just gonna start playing. There will be bugs and some will get fixed, some won't. It's good enough.
---
Everyone had a chance to try it on the last stress test in NA. This is a company based in NA so that makes sense. They don’t have to let everyone try it yet, especially when it’s clear there’s a lot of bugs players are reporting. I’m sure they’ll let more people try it out in a month when they make more updates. I think they have plenty of issues to work with and don’t need new people submitting reports at the moment.
---
And you wear smelly pants on your head.
---
Bringing up is enough. Complaining is not constructive. Well constructed posts with videos, proof, are often fixed pretty quickly. Posts going "how the hell are they gonna do that in two months, there's no way, f blizz" is not helping at all, that's all.
---
No? I just compared disliking streamers for no apparent reason, to disliking jews for no apparent reason.
---
Right like even if this was a real leak, it would be *sooo* surprising that they eventually launch the 2 most successful expansions again?
---
Blizzard is just a company name. Most of the original devs are gone.   
---
I don't disagree with you, I hope they can split off too. I just tend to think it won't do as much as we all think it will.
---
it's about as credible as this sub
---
Okay buddy
---
I feel like it would probably cost less in time/money to sell your mats and then buy greens on the AH to plug any holes.
---
Vanilla healing is as much about predicting damage as reacting to it.
---
What an asinine thing to say.
---
Same thing as BoE epics. All roll need, avoid ninjas, and if you really really want to do NBG on BoEs...you can always have the conversation after the cash roll.
---
Probably wouldn't work great in early Phase 1 if they set a threshold because while people are leveling everyone is congested to the same handful of zones. If they were to do something like that it would have to be dynamic to zones. So 'If there are less than 200 people in a zone, collapse the layer.' But that would probably be pretty difficult to configure and maintain as it would cause multiple zone wide layer changes for hundreds of people all the time per zone. People would notice mobs disappearing and being phased multiple times an hour, not to talk about the internal bandwidth issues this would cause happening thousands of times an hour across all servers. The broadest implementation is probably the easiest and unnoticeable configuration possible for them to do.
---
Nah. If you're trying to gather as a streamer on a pve server, the "gank squads" will just camp every node instead. He can't play classic normally unless he quits his job. It's pretty sad, frankly. Even WoW GMs were able to play normally when WoW was their job.
---
6 hunter bugs fixed, over 40 still remaining.
---
Blizzard throws a crumb and you guys go *bonkers*. 
---
Numerous pages on the front page suddenly claiming everything will be fixed.
---
I think the people who are suddenly celebrating like this means everything will be fixed on launch are the ones who need to chill. 
---
There are still lots of major issues to be dealt with.
---
&lt;Doggo Noir&gt; checks all of your boxes mate! We are doing raids Tuesday/Thursday from 7-11pm est. We plan on doing world bosses when applicable.
---
Solid group of guys looking to fill out roster out currently. I'll shoot you a message with a link to our application (nothing serious). Hope to hear back from ya!
---
the transformation has already begun.
---
I agree there's been overreaction/doom about bugs. They'd had a pretty good track record so far with bugs and small individual items, and the latest patch hopefully strengthens that record in people's eyes.
---
However I think it's very reasonable to keep banging the war-drum about Layering.
---
We need to at least have a statement/blue-post from them with recognition there's issues, and that they're planning changes for launch. Even if they don't give us their ideas immediately.
---
I'd pay upwards of $100 for the ability to get an early start. 
---
Blizz please
---
People are so hysterically obsessed about Classic being 100% flawless and making everyone feel like they're 17 again that this community actually became 17 again.
---
&gt;Not every change is bad you daft pillocks.
---
This is how WOW got to where it is today.  Every change in a vacuum looks like a good idea.
---
 Don’t pick a streamer server ?
---
I can't wait to see what new thing is going to 100% destroy classic WoW despite anything the devs are doing. I'm calling its gonna be the intonation that murlocs have as they chase you. Their Mrgls will be slightly off and we'll need to complain about this game ruining bug until August
---
I know, right? Blacks are no longer slaves, you won. But now you're bitching about women not being able to vote? Fucking make up your mind!

#Pertento#
---
**Alliance | RP-PvP | EU**
---
*Semi-hardcore raiding with a social atmosphere*
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
*Note: We will play on a RP-PvP realm if it's made available to us, if not we will opt for a PvP realm.*
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to **vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**What we provide:**
---
- An active, well-organised, and strictly toxic-free Discord.
---
- Experienced leaders; with a history of hardcore raiding and PvP in vanilla.
---
- The possibility for Socials and PvPers to thrive in the guild too, through social raids and BG premades.
---
- RP events in between raids for those interested (meaning less raid logging!).
---
- Community-driven members, with initiatives such as Vanilla Friends made possible by us.
---
- IRL meetups.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Wed/Sun + Monday (for progression) 20:00 - 24:00 CET
---
Visit http://pertento.eu/ to apply!
---
&gt;Seems like you have two options.
---
Got more than that, chief.
---
You're merging my post with silly arguments made before. This ain't a hivemind pal: This is a beta, meaning this is the time to report bugs and see them being worked out. Live version is where it's gonna be done. I'm not gonna hop on live, see a bug and be like "oh well, next patch, give em time. I reported my share of bugs, and some that I considered big were fixed, like the flight paths animations. Live has to be clean af, but this ain't live.
---
oh look, a whiny socialist that uses bootlicker as an insult while refusing to do honest work.
---
stereotypical doesn't even begin to describe your behavior.
---
It is all your own fault.
---
Will this sub find something to complain about?
---
"/r/classicwow, uh... finds a way." 
---
-Jeff Goldblum
---
Multiboxers are Activision-Blizzard's wet dream.
---
&gt;It's actually shameful to imagine what the devs must think about our community.
---
Imagine working for years on new stuff for a piece of software only to receive feedback "bring back how it was 10 years ago". 
---
I'd definitely be grumbling about how ungrateful my users are and probably wind up in the bar a lot going on tirades about how they "have no vision!".
---
I imagine it's probably not a pleasant experience debugging 10 year old software thats been Frankenstein'd to work on current infrastructure. 
---
I think in reality the saying should be "We think they don't... We hope they don't... Fuck... They do..."
---
I think you are confused....you realize this is a job for big streamers, right? They either play games at a high level, entertain, or both.
---
To say it is vain to try and be a streamer is a little ignorant, it’s not overvaluing your self worth to pursue a career path you find appealing. There are vain people that are streamers, but not every streamer is vain.
---
Technically you could be successful as a streamer with 10 followers if your goal is to game, broadcast it, and hang out with whoever wants to watch and chat. But for many the goal is to make it their job.
---
Welcome to vanilla wow!
---
Keep fixing Hunter. Pet can be tamed higher than character level, FD is broken or massively delayed and doesn’t cleanly leave combat. Scatter shot and traps share DR. I’m sure there’s more.
---
Did you reply to the wrong comment?
---
2/3 improved conc and 4/5 spiritual focus brings you to 100% damage pushback immune.
---
Your biggest "con" is a two-part issue.
---
First, it costs money to respec and you can only do that at a trainer. This means you won't be able to, properly, swap roles mid-dungeon.
---
Second, you will have to carry multiple gear sets.  My son served as a healer/tank in our guild.  This required two sets of gear.  Had he worked in a feral role, it would have required a third set of gear.  While feral and protection have the same primary stat (agi) the secondary stats were very much different.
---
to be honest, more people are on there than on the blizzard beta through out the weekend and Monday night.  It was around 2-3 pages of players on horde on beta last three days.
---
&gt;It takes like a full second for loot tables to show up 
---
It's like this on BfA, it has nothing to do with spell batching
---
The BfA engine is just laggy like that
---
But if bugs are fixed what will people have to complain about ?!?!
---
He doesn't like them because they are vain and toxic, at least in his eyes. Is that no an apparent reason?
---
... well, this escalated quickly
---
6 hunter bugs fixed, over 40 still remain.
---
Let's stay in reality here - they still have loads of work to do.
---
Imagine being this mad at a game
---
Wow why did they make lightning bolt animation like chain lightning in retail? The best part of lightning bolt was sniping people with those slow projectiles and then roasting them with a chain lightning.
---
Rogue stealth animations, pet bugs apply to warlock, right click report is gone, and other stuff has been dealt with
---
Don't need XP at 60!
---
Furyswipes does it on a pserver.  You can see his stuff on YouTube.  It would be a lot harder in classic without all the LUA functions he uses though.  He manages to pull it off because he can smart target healing.  In retail practice it’s a lot harder.
---
Some things could use a bit of tweaking. Druid thorns is practically useless. Bears can't tank because of CB.
---
The DOT cap could be raised allowing Aff Locks some needed usefulness in raids.
---
I wouldn't mind dual spec, or a slight decrease in mount cost.
---
Losing what shit? Pretty sure I'm just asking questions on your very short answer to labeling "all streamers as vain". You're legit just generalizing the hell out of them for no reason then probably a few bad experiences. It's a very short view and closed minded look on things. I think you have picked up a tone from text that doesn't exist bud. Based on your same logic, I guess now asking for an explanation and questions in general is "losing your shit"? So everyone in the world is losing their shit I guess. &gt;_&gt;
---
&gt;You can easily do this in Blizz chat, discord, etc. Why do you need to broadcast it online?
---
Because it's FAR more fun, that's why. It's all about what's fun and entertaining for people, and otherwise making more internet friends to play games with and hang with. It's an opportunity to put higher end hardware to even more use. It's straight up fun to share so many various moments and laugh with people. You can also give people a live face and reactions, which is much more personal than putting a picture or video in a discord of blizzard chat. What century do you live in?
---
&gt;Why do people stream? How do you measure a streamers success? Do you know any successful streamers with less than 10 followers?
---
People stream as I stated above in the previous answer. Pretty straight forward. Some do it as a much more fun way of living without having to be stuck in a standard career, some just want people to chat and interact with, some just want to be a cold blooded murderhobo robot in FPS games and to have money come in, some people do it because they want to feel valid in existing or because they're lonely af, etc etc. Why is that so hard to think of on your own? Seriously, were you pulled from under a rock &lt;10 years ago? Maybe a 1930s nuclear shelter? So weird. What measures a streamers success, is whatever goal they set for themselves. Maybe globally and generally speaking, perhaps people view "successful" as anything making more than 40k a month and/or being commonly known/spoken of in various places all over the internet essentially being internet famous or infamous I guess. To me, successful is just having a lively chat, playing games with my chat, and saying and doing weird shit until we cry laughing, so long as it doesn't interfere with anyone in games or disrupt gameplay. How is that hard to conceive? Streaming is ENTIRELY subjective, and varies from person to person on what is "successful" or not. It's pretty easy to understand.
---
\&gt; you can't take away knowledge.
---
Lemme get my hammer and we'll see!
---
&gt;while refusing to do honest work
---
Get over yourself.  I work every day.  Go fuck yourself. Blocked.
---
I'm not playing an old game, I'm playing the remaster of an old game and they actually have required assets already made. By your logic they should give me WC3 remaster for free as I own the original.
---
Blizzard, I BEG you to let us copy our character of from a Vanilla server, so we do not have to make the decision of losing the good fun of playing vanilla over new content.
---
I can help you.
---
So the way it is on the Beta is as it was in patch 1.12? Got any source if so? :)
---
In classic Paladins were powerful, but had problems like most classes.
---
However I believe the biggest cause of whining from players with pally mains was exactly this... Expectation vs reality. I suspect many rolled a pally thinking they were Holy Warriors. So similar to warriors but trade some damage &amp; tanking ability for some heals/buffs/utility.
---
I get it, it looks random af, but I'd put $5 on Tracer's gf dying.
---
Rofl, or what?
---
Wasn't that not broken?
---
I thought they were disappearing due to the frequency of patches and hot fixes which trigger a despawn.
---
1) "free for retail players" - yeah, so when they run out of content 2 weeks after a retail patch they can just hop on over to classic and continue where they left off
---
3) "drop off rate in the past was quite high" - no?  by the end of thanksgiving weekend 2004 (like 5 days after release) wow had only sold 350k copies.  2005 Q1 sub numbers are 1.5m.  Q2 sub numbers are 3.5m.  that's like 9 months after release, no dropoff at all just a straight climb up and away
---
Fucking centaurs running right trough their tents.
---
Really... Why protest anything? Just send the government a letter, and let them work on fixing things. That's all you have to do. No need for being loud about it.
---
Which is what happens to a lot of loot council guilds...
---
See, shift+key doesn't feel very intuitive or comfortable to me to do while playing for some reason. The only shift+key combo I can do comfortably is shift+wheelup/down.
---
I think it has something to do with running around with WASD/mouse and trying to hit shift+2 or something at the same time...it just doesn't work easily. But I have pretty bad arthritis and tendinitis so that might be why.
---
all need.  That's kind of the protocol. 
---
Even for a very valuable BOE drop, you should all need because guaranteed someone will just try to ninja otherwise.  If someone would actually use it I would say if they lose the roll during "all need" they would have a case to say look I'm going to use that, and they should receive it.  But you should see them equip it as well so they don't just turn around and sell it.
---
But thorns has that 75% more damage talent! Actually since you can cast it on other people it's not exactly a terrible buff.
---
OH SNAP
---
An avatar post on /r/classicwow I'd thought I'd never get an excuse to post this.  Remember the time avatar challenged box to a 5v5 1000g match in stv arena, lost, and said the match was invalid because a priest mind visioned him?

Everyone should roll need. As they should whenever a Boe epic drops

Your name is fitting for your launch day experience...

I've watched a fair bit of Asmongold and while he is stupid in a general kind of way, it seems to me he was just being facetious and you missed the joke.
---
I'm not going to defend Asmon (or really any streamer for that matter) but he really does embrace the whole 'overreacting-streamer' personality when he's live... and it works. Just look at his viewers - Twitch loves him. Back when he only did Youtube, his 'online personality' was completely different, I mean, hell, he used to do tutorial videos and guides instead of just ranting and raving like a retard on Twitch.
---
TLDR: Twitch Asmon - Bad. Youtube Asmon - slightly less bad.
---
Honestly, I blame the Twitch community. A huge portion of them are literal autists that just feed into it. There's a few safe-haven streams out there, but its getting rarer every day.
---
There's also just Spanish / Portuguese / German / French / German people who don't speak English, so are now flat out excluded from Classic unless they learn the language.
---
That's a contended point, even the definition of meditation itself!
---
Some T0.5 is v good and better than T1
---
Yeah. :(
---
You take the good with the bad though.
---
Not at all, I don't know if you're reading another post and answering here but you're far from it. I'm saying we should report bugs like grown ass people, put comparison videos, find good sources, let it gain traction and wait for the result. Complaining doesn't help, saying it won't get fixed doesn't help. We're here to beta test, so let's beta test.
---
This guy heals.
---
I told those fudge packers I liked Michael Bolton’s music
---
Awesome. I'm gonna check that out!
---
WOW!  it is so easy!  they just changed one if statement and it works! they should do this with all the bugs in the game!
---
On the beta it seemed to reduce player interaction.
---
&gt; Stop being negative.
---
Well you stop being positive
---
An accurate description.
---
New expansions to classic. They should go the same route old school runescape took.
---
Anyone who takes Asmongold's stream persona seriously lacks braincells.
---
Ohhh - you are *that* person :)
---
Definitely the lowest level of comment I'm encountering today, wish there were ways to gild your comment with wood or something.
---
Who is mad? Im rolling on a pve realm now that it is finaly becoming an option again. No gank frustrations here
---
Broken hunters... there were 49 issues, 46 more to go
---
Then join a guild that plans on using vent?
---
Agreed but its allowed because it makes blizzard money
---
Options for farming as tank/healer
---
1. Herbing and/orb mining. If you know what your doing herbing is one of the best money makers in the game outside of stuff like playing the auction house.
---
2. Strat live runs. You can reserve the first orb as a tank for a pug or you can just form a full guild group and do multiple fast efficient runs. Dudes in my guild were running this shit almost every night we weren't raiding, when you get 5 people in pre-bis gear or better in voice comms you can get runs down to 20-30 minutes each. 
---
3. Just level a mage. It's honestly not that hard to level an alt in your off time and take advantage of rested experience. It's not viable early on but classic is going to be on a pretty slow release schedule.
---
Alright, this sounds fair, especially in Mulgore I seem to need to die a lot to get to a GY.
---
Didn't know about that one! TY, and keep these vids up, I like them!
---
I'm pretty sure this is according to their internal schedule. It wouldn't make sense to concentrate on animations before resolving stability concerns.
---
&lt;Doggo Noir&gt; Should be your next guild Moltencalf! We are a semi-hardcore guild that plans on making our way through content in a meaningful way without taking ourselves too serious. We all played vanilla through today. We currently have a need for warriors with expirence to match our own! I'll shoot you a message with a link to our guild application. Hope to hear from you soon!
---
Exactly, when I played on a private server I think we were the 20th ranked guild and we were using all worldbuffs, songflower etc. 
---
Guilds even lower than us were doing this as well, it's the fastest way to get burned out on Vanilla and people are supporting this, just mindblowing.
---
BGs were cross realm in 1.12.1 via "battle-groups", a cluster of realms that were tied together when it came to BG queues. This will be the case in Classic. I agree that queues should not be horrible across either faction, at least not earlier on while the population across all realms is booming.
---
You clearly haven't seen Blizzard's development over the last 3+ expansions. There are still bugs in BFA that were caught and reported constantly in ALPHA and BETA yet they're still not fixed.
---
2 months is not a long time.
---
Would love to get a guild of multiboxers going.
---
I don't play rogue so it doesn't really matter one way or another to me, but I actually prefer the incorrect version.
---
Roll Ele do both DPs and heal.
---
Except in raid pve formats, it's always better to do just 1 role. And as a healer there, you are under the most pressure as one missed heal = raid wipe.
---
Its very fun and you get to watch the fights as you play wack-a-mole healing those health bars back to green.
---
Puff the magic dragon?
---
Complaining produces results quickly
---
Why stop?
---
Lol imagine talking like a 1900s factory owner and thinking you’re in the right. 
---
Your whole comment is compete and utter bullshit. We’ve gone trough this whole thing before. This isn’t the first industry facing these issues and you’re not the first one making this dumb arguments. 
---
There is no deal in good faith you moron. It’s a release date.
---
Lmao, very true. I thought as much, imagine creating expansion after expansion only to see a beta for the legacy server doing 80% of the views on Twitch. And the frankenstein thing is pretty accurate, this was quite the stretch!
---
5-6k per server with how many in queue?  Are YOU using your brain? You wanna be able to actually play the game right? lmao
---
it's not that hard for people who know how to behave. socialists can't seem to get "acting like a human" right.
---
They are giving us Keyring it is just bugged currently.
---
Ya it's not amazing solo. The damage can slowly add up I guess... I mean with druid damage being 30% worse at lower levels than on private servers, thorns is going to be a lot better by comparison. Lol
---
Be seeing you!
---
Well met! (really anything by dwarves)
---
Taste the flames of Sulfuron!
---
FLAME! DEATH! DESTRUCTION!
---
No notes. Streamers post videos of the changes.
---
This is good for the classic
---
Got em
---
Also Philippines. Lots of young gamers there.
---
Yes and no. It's expensive to level crafting, especially on a new server where the only way to make gold is just grinding. But let me tell you, the first guys to get devilsaur patterns and start producing that, are not gonna have a problem getting epic mounts.
---
As someone who didn’t play classic (didn’t start til BC) and is new to the classic scene I’ve been having a really hard time figuring out how the classic community actually feels about the re-release as a whole. Every absolutely minuscule change appears to have some sort of life-or-death weight assigned to it. In a million years I never would have imagined something like right-click report or suggest invite to be some game-breaking experience to have. I know they’re *changes* but...it’s just been interesting to see what’s going on with this whole thing.
---
Oh God I forgot about that. Thanks for the memories
---
Ah, a man of culture
---
Not *every* detail.  I can live without a reenactment of slideshow lag in the capital cities. Nostalgia only runs so deep ;)
---
If you heal in BGs esp as a pally people will worship you.
---
definitely see both points of view.  must be really frustrating as a player to get the run around.  I just can easily see this thing that keeps falling to the bottom of the queue because of many other bigger "fish to fry".
---
Lord Hireek...  
---
Grant me WINGS OF VENGEANCE!
---
But dude, don't you read about it? Ion itself DID say it would be gone after 2-3 weeks, meaning far before Phase 2 for example. They said it would be something that'd be used for launch to lighten the load since people would come in to test the game and a lot of them would then leave. This is not planned as sharding or whatever, this is a temporary solution to have a cool launch and a stable population later on, they DID talk about this, a LOT. So how are people saying those kinds of things, like you are? I don't get it.
---
I too think the rested area is the best for fixing abuse.
---
Barely inconvenient for normal grouping too.
---
Don't bother replying, the type of person who screeches and refuses to read a technical information post because a non-related note it doesn't conform to his delusional nostalgia is not someone worth conversing with at all.
---
rip
---
Oh that's RIGHT! I remember hearing about how he had mutiple mind visions on him and his party haha!
---
I also remember there was a huge, I mean HUGE organized 2v2 tournament at the Gurubashi Arena, it was such a sight seeing the entire arena circle filled with people, and I remember us all being proud the spectators played nice (for the most part).
---
One of the 2v2 teams was (I believe) a Horde mage and a Human pally, and they did suprisingly well lol
---
Probably clicked on a link describing the fail and he was curious? Doesn't mean he lives on the site like you seem to think.
---
You seem pretty mad.
---
I hadnt looked at it like that
---
3 manning dungeons is a lot of fun, I've leveled up that way on private server. However we did mage dps for best aoe, cc and water, paladin healer for great mana efficient healing, powerful buffs, and amazing cooldowns, and druid tank for great threat, buffs, utility and survivability. 
---
We could even do higher level dungeons than us.
---
I wouldn't recommend 3 of the same class, as not only do you all share the same gear, but your buffs and even hots don't stack, meaning major bonuses of your class is essentially wasted for 2 of you. You will also lack the buffs, dispells and other utility from not having other classes.
---
However if you really want to make it work, I think it's doable, but not in the way you stated. Swapping forms is expensive and healing (especially when you don't have cc) is a full time job. You will not have the time or mana to do half half. However what you could do is, as soon as the healer is almost oom, have him go catform and the former dps goes healer while first healer regens mana back while catforming. Then swap back when second healer is oom. Probably stick to one tank and give him priority on non caster leather gear. Armor and stamina is very important. Rest of you should focus on spirit and int from cloth gear. Catform dps is not hugely gear dependant, but healing is.
---
I get 199ms consistently from Melbourne to NA West.
---
Need at least one Sydney server.
---
I expect you're young and have little to no clue how the software/gaming industry actually works. So this is pretty pointless for me. Gave a good one dude/dudette
---
Yeah but for some people it's a real argument, so I had to answer that
---
correct. i think for raids healing is the most challenging/rewarding thing to do, whereas for 5 mans I think it's tanking (although healing can be close behind, depending on how geared/good the tank is and how well the dps are behaving). Tanking raids is actually way less interesting than tanking 5 mans, in my experience. In raids you're usually just tanking a single mob/boss at a time, in 5 mans you could be pulling several mobs at a time and are in charge of keeping aggro on all of them, not to mention watching for pats, etc. etc.
---
&gt; Did you utilize lots of rest exp?
---
I'm ok with this as long as we let windfury be off internal cooldowns for a few months :)
---
So if you really want to min-max your power at max level your progression goes something like this;
---
1. Start with Engineering and Mining.
---
2. Drop Mining, get Tailoring and farm or buy the recipe for the epic robe.
---
3. (Optionally) Once you have crafted the robe you can drop Tailoring and pick up Herbalism/Mining for some extra income.
---
4. Once Phase 4 hits, you want to have Engineering and Tailoring for the Bloodvine set bonus.
---
5. Once you no longer need the Bloodvine set, you can drop Tailoring once more and pick up Herbalism/Mining.
---
Probably, and it's a good thing :)
---
In vanilla they walked and stepped in a slow way that is very different from in retail. There are a lot of videos comparing the difference on YouTube. Old way is much cooler and makes you feel like you are truly sneaking.
---
Or just learn to make cash in your raid spec?
---
What about wall jumping/terrain glitching, ecen on bgs?
---
Need unless you already have it.
---
Not sure if anyone has mentioned this.
---
In the beta stress tests mobs pathed around fences correctly, but on the live stress test they walked right through them. It made kiting much more difficult.
---
I get all my blizzard news from diablo 2 chat rooms.
---
We had a Paladin win Drillborer Disk.
---
Don't think any of the tanks actually followed through on their threats to quit the guild, but there were some icy relations for a while after that.
---
Why would you say it produces results? What makes you think it's the complaining and not the bug reports and well-constructed posts that did the trick? You think that there are 15 posts, 3k bug reports, nothing happens and then some guy rants on reddit "omg this is shit fuck acti blizz" and suddendly they get on it? Delusional...
---
If he's flaky just make an alt to play with him. He will quit by lvl 40 anyways.
---
This is fucking gold. Thank you for sharing.
---
More memes plz
---
Usually the MT got a lot of gear and money thrown at him and the main offtank got some help as well but beyond that it was mostly every man for himself. 
---
Goldbuying was rife back then especially if you wanted to rank in PVP as well.
---
Believing todays bug fixes are a result of the last few days of whining is like believing you god got you the job if you prayed for it.
---
Hurrah!
---
I wonder what it would look like if people weren't paying to help them test it.
---
If you want to level quickly, yes. 
---
If you prefer to waste time and money on getting slightly better gear, thereby making it easier then by all means.
---
&gt; There's always posts on Livestream fail
---
Implies he checks it from time to time, that is called reading comprehension.
---
On Nost I had a holy paladin alt which picked up some retri gear in BWL. Items like Ashkandi, cloak of draconic might etc. And after the raids I would spec reckadin, equip a goblin rocket helmet and charge in to wipe some poor world buffed mage on his way to raid. Then bubble hearth ofc. Was great fun!
---
Yes priests are fine in 1v1 even if you're not shadow.
---
There is a pvp/utility tri-spec that revolves around getting 11 (13 optional for fear cd) points in shadow for blackout stun + mind flay and then getting the defensive talents in the holy and disc trees.
---
It's one of the most versatile specs in the game, and amazingly fun. It won't cut it in bleeding edge raiding, but it's a spec that'll work just fine in dungeons and easier raids (as a healer) and pvp, both duels and bgs.
---
While leveling it might be a great idea to put 5 points in spirit tap, then 3 in blackout and 2 in improved sw:pain (at max level you go full blackout and skip spirit tap, get shadow focus instead), and finally 1 in mind flay. This is all you need to farm and fight from the shadow tree, it's plenty good.
---
Then you start pumping into the disc tree. You will hit inner focus at level 31. Congratulations, you're now super versatile, tough to kill and you have both improved shield and an "oh shit" button in inner focus. Inner focus is also supremely useful as a mana regeneration tool because you can cheat the 5sec rule with it (heal -&gt; renew -&gt; inner focus -&gt; heal -&gt; heal). You can heal any level appropriate instance with ease and you can pvp like a beast.
---
Now you can either pick up the very useful early holy talents (if you're doing a lot of world pvp you might wanna go 2 points in healing focus somewhere earlier), or you can pump a bit more into disc to grab improved inner fire or some mana management talents. You can figure it out from here.
---
The bottom line is this is a really, really versatile and fun spec to play around with.
---
Oh, and fakecast + learn what the other classes like to do. If you know they don't have an interrupt ready go nuts on the flashes, if they do have one shield and flay/blast them and hope they lock your shadow school, leaving you with holy.
---
fuck... I might just play a priest again.
---
I have, dude. This ain't the same team. There are stress tests, boss spawnings in Elwynn Forest and Orgrimmar, there is a huge Omar character following people on races, when have you seen that in BfA's beta?
---
Because it's very abusable.
---
To me i seem calm and collected.
---
My one guild was on a fresh server, and was originally PvP focused.
---
At some point they opened up transfers onto our server, and about 10 very highly geared raiders joined our PvP focused guild.
---
It took them about 2 weeks to sew discontent, lead a mutiny, splinter off, and take all the good players with them to start their new raiding guild, myself included.
---
It was actually one of the better coups I've ever seen.
---
..? this is literally the first pass of actual noticable changes theyve made
---
Sorry super long post.     
---
That is a question I would like to find the answer for as well, or rather I want to find the answer to an almost similar question.     
---
Is it worth leveling tailoring and leatherworking as you are leveling?     
---
First it depends on what class you are going to play, I plan to play priest and it could help me to have access to some tailoring recipe.   
---
Second it depends whether you plan to speedrun or just level as you play.  Each craft is a downtime, unless you very carefully plan around it and you use that downtime to regen some mana between pull using your spirit tap to regen which would require a lot of planing ahead.     
---
I would like to test doing it but I have not quite explore the subject yet.    
---
For a priest it is vital you get the two first enchanted wand asap. You can buy them at the AH but on a new server it might take some time before some shows up and overall it is probably more efficient to not spend a penny on the ah and save as much as possible to get the mount asap.    
---
Another possibility is to find someone willing to take tailoring and enchanting and put in common your linen cloth to boost his tailoring faster and get the wand faster.    
---
You need 58 linen cloth to get to tailoring 30 which unlock the first green you can disenchant to get to enchanting 10 and craft the first wand. 
---
I think you need about 180 linen cloth after that to get enough greens for getting your enchanting to 70 and craft the second wand (you might need a few more greens from quests and drops).    
---
Getting half of that alone should come to you easily but getting 240 linen cloth without waiting too long to get the wand asap, will require some dedicated grinding in specific zones.     
---
I have experimented trying to raise enchanting on my own as I am progressing further, I sort of come to the natural conclusion that it is not really sustainable. There are nice recipe in the 120 and further but it is a really big investment to get there and is not easily done at all.     
---
So I have been thinking now that I should drop enchanting when I get the wand (possibly crafting a few for profit at the AH first) and pick up leatherworking then to complement with tailoring.   
---
Leatherworking would be downtime between pulls, but again it is a downtime that might help you regen.  I have to test if it is easy to pick and get leatherworking going while you are already in a 13-14+ zone as you got the enchanting wand 70.     
---
Now the profession you really want to raise to enhance your speedrunning is first aid. Using a bandage on yourself between pull is a nice way to regen with spirit tap and stay in the 5s rule for more regen. From my testing, but not doing tailoring on the side, it is possible to get it going after getting the second wand but you might have trouble getting enough linen cloth as you are already getting some wool. If you only level up first aid with all the cloth you get, comes a time when you have an excess of silk and not much mageweave yet. For wool I am not sure.    
---
So the competition with first aid is something to keep in mind, the thing though is that you will eventually find yourself with some silk that is not going to raise your first aid, you can make bandages but you only need so many, so having tailoring using that excess would come very handy.      
---
Finally to answer you initial question. From what I see there are very few recipes to which you will have access  and worthwhile compared to what you get if you keep on progressing. 
---
With my route here are some relevant greens you will get from quests:  
---
* The pants from Protecting the Herd in dun morogh   
---
* The gloves or cape from Tharnariun's Hope    
---
* The off hand from The Sleeper Has Awakened    
---
* The bracers from WANTED: Murkdeep!    
---
* The belt from The Absent Minded Prospector    
---
* Technically the boots and rings WANTED: Chok'sul but since it is an elite quest it is probably not feasible solo    
---
* 10 slot bag from Digging Through the Ooze    
---
* next bis wand from Ormer's Revenge    
---
* The shoulders from Uncovering the Past    
---
* The ring from Howling in the Hills    
---
* 10 slot bag from The Night Watch    
---
and I am probably missing some and I have not made an exhaustive list after that    
---
For greens   
---
Of the owl is:    
---
At lvl 11 +1 spirit int  
---
At lvl 15 +1/2   
---
At lvl 18 +2/3   
---
At lvl 20 +4/5   
---
At lvl 25  +5/6    
---
At lvl 30 +6/7   
---
etc.... 
---
The Spidersilk Boots will be worth around 125 tailoring (I think) but they require a few special mat that you may or may not find along your way.     
---
Tailoring 150 gives you the 10 slot bags but you will probably be in your 30s by then and received 2 or 3 10 slot bags by questing.   
---
There are a few decent greens in the 120s, Heavy Woolen Pants heavy woolen cape woolen boots but you might have found better greens on your own that are either spirit int, or spirit stamina or more.     
---
Of the owl around lvl20 is +4/5 for spirit and int.    
---
Also the best item relative to your levels are always found from boss drops in dungeons or dungeon quests, if you plan on getting those quest chains and grouping for the dungeons then it will blow in the water whatever you can make with tailoring (granted you get it to drop).     
---
Same around 150 but items level 30, if they are of the owl, are usually +6/7 while crafting something here, like Lesser Wizard's Robe is +8 +5 so it is almost equivalent if you manage to get it to 150 in time.    
---
After all of that has been written and said the next question is how much would it help to get the lvl40 mount asap while selling your excess green.     
---
Like maybe it saves time to avoid profession but from my testing, getting to 100g on your own at lvl40 is not really feasible, even while vending greens you don't need. It might be feasible if you don't buy any spells you don't need and maybe price better your stuff on the ah. It might also be more profitable time wise to just skip tailoring and sell the cloth directly, I think a stack of linen is like 20, wool 50 and I assume silk might go to 1 gold but not sure what the prices are going to be at the server opening and how much volume and exchange there will be.     
---
So I would like to test tailoring while leveling fast solo and see if I can maintain it with my leveling curve and the mats I get while still leveling first aid, see if it can compete with random greens and see how much profit I make with the help of leatherworking for which I will sell excess of materials as well.
---
You mean conjure food :P
---
Ok thats the best place
---
Listen to classic cast 16. Kevin Jordan quite literally says that complaining gets stuff done.
---
It certainly doesn't matter, but let's not pretend your opinions are facts here. People can like different things.
---
You confuse fairness with exaggeration.
---
Had you considered that maybe that was the point of the test?
---
Obviously Blizzard is doing technical testing, but I'm sure they are also taking the opportunity to learn about their community for future decisions. It's one thing to make a post and sift through the garbage on forums and reddit, but it's another to actually see the behavior in action. Just like over-tuning layers can drive players away, under-tuning them can as well. I'm sure it's a great opportunity to find a good range that inspires as much activity as possible.
---
Honestly, I think there's a larger conversation about setting realistic expectations. I've been in software development for over 10 years now, and I and anyone else who has ever done engineering, QA, or design can tell you, there is no such thing as a bug free piece of software. I've been in the beta since the first few weeks, and if they were to ship the game in two weeks rather than two months, it would be fine for 99% of players. It feels great, and the gloom and doom in this sub originates from people who don't have beta access and are so bored and obsessed that all they do is over-analyze videos from clickbait streamers/youtubers who prey on negativity and outrage culture.   
---
The game is going to be fine. Read that sentence, take a deep breath, and say it with me. **"The game is going to be fine"**
---
Used to scale with spell power.  It was quickly nerfed into oblivion. 
---
Source: I had the first 8/8 set.
---
No not really.
---
There are 8 server-faction combos on Retail right now with less than 40 people seen online in the last 30 days.
---
Same. Loved using Penance on my Disc priest.
---
its all the /r/wowservers people bringing their cancer with them.
---
I played holy pala in a guild that did aq40 up to C'thun and like 1 boss in naxx. Back then you could make a macro that targeted the X lowest raid member and healed. So if you picked X to be something a tad higher than the other healers, you just set yourself to follow someone and lay in bed, watching TV, spamming the macro and end up as the most efficient healer on trash and farm runs. The few harder boss fights I tried were interesting though.
---
The best part was all the awesome loot for ret no one wanted. Ret pvp was so much fun :D
---
First character was a horde warlock. I saved DKP because I wanted azuresong mageblade really bad from MC. It finally dropped after 6 weeks of raiding that place. I put in my bid, had friends whisper me "grats" and it went to the guild leaders mage friend. I got pissed and gquit the moment it happened. Found a new guild and moved on. I think that guild ended up breaking up because of similar loot drama. Nepotism doesn't pay (if you aren't part of the clique.)
---
If your tanks go tanking with drillborer I don't want to raid with your guild.
---
Server: Sunstrider EU
---
I was alliance warrior (human) and there was this cocky NE warrior named Naia who had the arcanite reaper before anyone else. dont remember why but he/she was a big deal and i wanted him/her to craft the reaper for me just to have the "crafted by Naia" on it. but he/she got way too cocky and i ended up having it made (kinda late because it took me a while to get the mats) by someone else. still was so happy with the reaper.
---
Ud rogue: Coy. since back then we had forums separate forums most run by server community, we knew most people on the server from both horde and alliance. Coy was a fun hordie that we had picnics with sometimes
---
there are plenty more from guilds back then, don't remember their names but man i had fun.
---
also shout out to Exit guild from Chromaggus EU (horde).
---
Because the community in classic is self regulating and that dynamic breeds a healthy community. If someone is an asshole, or ninja loots, or kicks from group before boss etc. they will get a reputation for that.
---
Just right click reporting to taddle to the PC police can be abused so much. Just imagine when someone is camping a steamer how many fanboys will mass report the offender to the point that the algorithm gives them an autoban and then they need to petition to get unbanned. 
---
Many more reasons and more nuance but that is one basic reason.

[H][PvE / PvP]

I'll be rolling a UD Rogue, Combat Swords is the plan. I've got 2 friends who are going to be joining me who have minimal to no experience with WoW, currently they're looking at druid &amp; warlock respectively.
---
I live in the GMT+4 timezone so i'm ideally looking at raids starting at GMT 1700/1730 start and finishing at 2000/2100. I know it's a bit niche but maybe there are some others around in the same time situation. 
---
Anyway I digress. My friends will probably not be immediately raiding, but would make good social players until they're ready to get their feet wet with raiding. I'll be rolling a healer alt of some sort, haven't fully decided on which yet, but leaning towards a shaman.
---
I've got quite a bit of semi-hardcore/hardcore style raiding experience, but years down the line I'm more interested in a casual guild. Guild PvP isn't a priority, although it would be nice to have a guild that is open to premades from time to time. 
---
Please contact me by PM!
---
This entire story of classic being brought back and the lists they’ve done to players has been one of the most redemptive stories of a game company we’ve ever seen
---
Are you sure about the timing? I dont think I ever downloaded an addon, but maybe I did...? I remember I could see my gearscore in wrath before ICC was released, and I would get kicked from heroic groups for my low item level even though I had tanked the place 20+ times because "the tank's gear is too weak, kick him so we can get a real tank" and it was a big part of why I quit.
---
Of course, I'm just saying it was all simple enough that running 5 different classes is a viable way to play if you are multiboxing.
---
hes just not delusional and you are a retarded bootlicker
---
Private servers have a completely different demographic than classic though. The 20th ranked guild on a pserver could easily be the best guild or one of the best guilds on a classic server. There won't be like 40+ guilds clearing BWL/AQ40 first lockout in classic like they do on private servers.
---
Not according to realmpop numbers. The number of character on the german realms is 3x as many as OCE.
---
To encourage people to talk to each other in the world and work together socially. In the modern game you just Auto group with people and leave when the quest is finished, without ever saying a word to each other. Vanilla wasn't like that.
---
bring back classic Archage plz
---
There's an entire meme about one of the devs being Jesus. Pretty sure they are getting praise.
---
I don’t know, I played a hunter, found the rotation quite easy and relaxing. There is a bit of nuance to proper pet management &amp; weaving in melee attacks if you’re a real gamer. Kiting is easy but can be stressful. Yes there are more steps than a mage’s single target “rotation” but it doesn’t really make it any harder, as long as you have an auto shot timer. You get into a rhythm with it and it feels nice.
---
Yeah but it's command prompt based. You have to enter into DOS and input a complicated sequence that will allow you to strafe (in one direction only).
---
I spent a lot of time doing premade battlegrounds and in between queues we just dueled outside Orgrimmar.  I still remember good priests winning almost all their duels.  Dot them down, mana burn them down, kite with renew.  Fear and nuke when the time is right.  My favorite was watching the priests smack people with their benediction.  Really good 1v1 class
---
Yes they can. The record is 135 hours.
---
Amen.
---
"when they do this last thing"

Robe of power, then drop tailoring.  Otherwise yes.
---
I'm not saying this team isn't better, I'm just saying people have a reason to be cautious. I'd rather we over-complain and present our issues so that blizzard can see it and take action rather than say nothing and let things that need fixing slip by beta.
---
Nelf Milfs?
---
A man of culture
---
You do know that Blizz merged with Activision in 2008 not before 2004. It was part of Vivendi games from 1998 until 2008 - the Activision merger. Get your facts straight before you go on a rant buddy.
---
On the other hand I agree that since 2008 the standard of their games has been dropping, but then also you look at Legion and this “holy shit that expansion was awesome” so your argument really doesn’t hold
---
As for your classy remark about all the WoW expansions since, Blizzard is a business and needs money to grow, develop games, etc so yeah they will introduce little systems for people who don’t have 10 hours a day to raid or PvP or just aren’t interested in that. There’s nothing wrong with people enjoying pet battles or farming transmogs while you enjoy the end-game content. Also, the introduction of heroic and mythic raid difficulties, and mythic+ clearly shows Blizzard’s intent on engaging people into high-end play so again, your remark is wrong.
---
I’m starting to get really tired of people taking it so personally when Blizzard experiments with something and you don’t like it. I’m not saying BfA is good, I’m saying they gave it a shot and we didn’t like it. They didn’t attack you personally or try to make your life miserable, they’re trying to improve the game the best way they thing. Ion has said that pruning was intended to do this but they went to far and will now go back. They are listening to us. 
---
BUT the more you scream and call them assholes and disrespect them, the less likely they are to listen to *you* and what you think will make the game better. So calm down and try having a civil discussion and don’t take other people’s opinion that doesn’t match your own PERSONALLY.
---
Loot Council will be my choice. I dislike DKP hoarding, passing on semi good upgrades and all that playing the system people will do with DKP. 
---
LC has only one issue and thats corruption/favoritism but as long as you're in a decent guild and the goal is to get your raid stronger it usually works out.
---
You're totally right, I should have said it the first MMO for tons of players, and so it was way more commitment than most games people were accustomed to.
---
Better be some fking changes. Fk up the game once shame on us (we asked for things).
---
A really large collection of video gaming nerds in one sub / community will almost always result in elitism, panic and anti social posts. This is a fact.
---
And I never seen 40 people in a raid group all with the most optimal spec for PVE, full enchanted pre-bis or better gear and full consumes including flasks but it's what people do now when they want to push the game to it's limits cause it's they find it fun.
---
Worry not, they will come.
---
Probably the most replied Blue Post on EU Classic forums since Noe : 3.7k replies.
---
Classic content plan Blue Post comes on second, with 170 replies.
---
Blizzard will announce EU language based realms...because they have to.
---
I mean, most of them pay to get what they consider early access with a lvl 30 and now lvl 40 meta, I'm pretty sure testing is just a downtime occupation for most of the testers
---
Priest who already had his 40 atiesh splinters had been lagging / dcing all night.  We sat him for thaddius, but he really wanted the g3 helm.  Gquit and server transferred, not sure if he ever finished his staff.
---
In beta. Seeing people in a city is a huge deal, as I’ve barely seen 3-4 people in Org since layering started.
---
Retail's global subscriber base nearing less than 1 million and a huge community of players asking is why were getting Classic.  Streamers are literally the only factor making me consider NOT playing classic.
---
It's funny because that guy is getting massive amount of praise. People comparing him to Jesus. Apparently he comes on and only sees negativity tho. 🤔
---
Yes go call people young when they don’t suck corporate dick.
---
Sounds like you have no idea how unions and employee protection works. 
---
The gaming industry is notoriously horrible when it comes to the protraction of workers or ethical business practices I general. Not to mention hardcore anti union behavior by most big publishers.
---
No clue why the fuck you would stand up for them unless you yourself have a childlike understanding of the world and ethics in general.
---
Mining/skinning warrior.
---
Mining to level engineering later. Skinning for farming cash before raiding. Will swap to engineering when we start going into MC etc.
---
Your tinfoil hat fell on the floor, just fyi.
---
I think that improvements to the user-interface that could theorethically be done with an AddOn, really don't bother me.
---
I mean there are some more things like that... Like cooldown-counters in the icon-bars, new raidframes, auto-looting without having to hold a button.
---
Now after the removal of "suggest invite", I'm a bit afraid that things like that will also be removed.
---
I really don't see how something like that could ruin someone's experience.
---
Well yeah, that’s kind of my point. Gonna go warrior instead and hope to one day get thunder fury.
---
I hope they release it early unexpectedly so everyone who put in for time off can complain
---
Nice.
---
I kinda liked the new animations. Limb speed matched with travel speed on the ground instead of looking like it was sliding.
---
There was indeed, I'm refering to the recent events though
---
Already mentioned in the OP :)
---
dwarf priest, tailoring and herbalism, selling all them herbs and gotta make my truefaith vestments at 60
---
I'll raise you with an unpopular opinion for UO/Eve style games: I'd rather *have* factions in those. Factions is what ensures you always have strangers you can still trust to not kill you (helps to form new relationships), and enemies that you cannot befriend (helps to avoid a situation where no PvP occurs because everyone has formed one big coalition with non-aggression pacts).
---
In games where every player is a "potential friend or foe", what that actually means is that every player is a foe until proven otherwise (not even just a potential one). You will basically never meet a stranger out in the world and invite them to your party to run a couple of quests in Eve or even UO.
---
Right, and I don't like jews ^^^/s because of [insert nazi propaganda]
---
Well you can either craft the item now, or wait for your mats to sell and buy a green that may or may not be available.  Mat farming may be a better long term gold maker than crafting stuff, but that’s your choice.    
---
Buying off the AH feels like a bad idea though.  It wasn’t so much back when people didn’t really process if an item was good or not, but now anything with a good stat alignment will command a premium just because people looking for BIS at that second will pay it.
---
3-4 people? Sounds dreadful.
---
If it looks like it's ready, we're going to start bitching about early release. We'll to turn into BfA players at the start of a dungeon.
---
blizz go

This didn’t lead to the guild breaking up, but it was dicy for a while. I was an off tank for my guild and the MT was the co-guild leader. As time went by, the MT couldn’t log on as often and eventually had to take a month off to attend to RL issues. I temporarily took the MT roll and got pretty geared up during that month time running MC, ZG, etc. When the MT eventually came back he entered his roll again as MT and me as off tank. I was significantly more geared than him and he died on multiple Onyxia runs where I had to pull agro and take over tanking. This led to a mutiny in our healing class where all priests switched to shadow and performed a “holdout” until I was reinstated as MT. I felt awful for the guy, but everyone in the guild preferred me as the MT (probably because I was on 24/7 and prepared for every raid + gear helped).
---
He ended up stepping away from the game for another month and then quitting all together after that.
---
Enchanting and skinning because they require no investment and for the most part I remember crafting being an expensive waste of time in vanilla. Even things like engineering seemed very negligible and I feel like I could count the number of fights on one hand that were actually decided by my opponent having engineering gadgets.
---
I really love Alchemy and it can make a whole lot of money and I can make my own consumes, so I'll pick up herbs at 40 then level alch at 60 then drop herbs for Engineering since that is a must have for anyone that wants to min/max plus I like having engineering anyways, all of my characters had it from Vanilla to Cata when I quit. Even things that aren't for min/maxing are very useful to have like the teleporter.
---
The removal of it you mean?
---
I hope this was your intent :).
---
You're asking the wrong question.  
---
The system isn't important at all.  
---
Find a good decent guild and it wont matter.
---
I've always raided in Loot Council and it worked fine. The Council changed over the years i was part of it at one point and its not perfect but it was fair.  At the end of the day nobody left angry because of loot.  
---
No matter the system if the guild sucks you will get screwed out of loot no matter what. Find a good guild with fair people and you should be fine.
---
Damn u made me laugh so hard. Have an upvote
---
The fact here is this is called Classic WoW, so if the animations looks like they used to, then they are better.
---
TBC talents please.
---
I am sticking with Paladin. I've been ret since Cata on retail, so I'm excited to go back to Holy!
---
Point on the doll where the bad streamer touched you.
---
https://loadingartist.com/comic/waste-of-time/
---
RP-PvP realm
---
Will roll a warr. Skin/herb start just like you (tried mining in pserver but felt meh) and turn to blacksmith/engineering if I ever get some gold in my pockets
---
This is the correct answer.
---
How exactly does that work nowadays? You have 90% of one faction on the server, but do servers even matter anymore? As far as I understand the sharding system, the world is populated with players from many different servers, right? So does server imbalance even mean anything anymore in retail?
---
Too early to make any sort of determination. I know I'm beyond excited. Started playing a private server to quell my hype, but it's had the opposite effect. 
---
Side Note: Classic drops 8/27 and the first weekend is a holiday weekend because of Labor Day. Fuck yeah!
---
In terms of players dropping off at 60, I wouldn't necessarily be concerned about that. Classic really transforms and picks up at 55+. I think there will be a bigger drop off at 40 when people realize how much further they have to go still and realize they are broke and no where close to having the money for a mount. 
---
I have high hopes for Classic. Private Server is fun, but I'm always left with a feeling "who cares, this isn't legit". Classic won't have that issue because shit will be official!
---
I was horde. Not experienced with Classic paladins. Why was having a DBD on paladin tank a bad thing?
---
Skinning, Mining. Drop skinning @ 60 and train up Tailoring. Drop that after the class specific BoP epic, and then pick up engineering.
---
For a guy who capped a rogue in vanilla I will have to say that the old animation is MUCH cooler than the retail one. You are literally sneaking in classic. I was rolling a war because stealth was wrong. Now I'm back to rogue.
---
I'm not disagreeing but I think dynamic respawns are definitely a double edged sword. I have literally raged on private servers when I'm in the middle of a cave and respawns start to spawn on top of me and have already blocked the entrance because you can no longer predict how long they take to respawn. There are a LOT of caves in vanilla and this CONSTANTLY happens. Very frustrating. Not saying it's not the solution to replace layering but it is something to consider.
---
Do you use skinning simply for the sake of vendoring the leather, or selling it on the AH?
---
Welcome to vanilla. Preemptive healing and stop casting is a big thing.
---
TBC talents yes, but flying no thanks
---
Then I'd say it's down to moderation of this sub to keep posts from being repeated too much. If one post gets a lot of traction about a subject, say Stealth animations, then others shouldn't get through, especially if they're not constructive. Cause if they read this sub, it's more than enough to have them see well-made posts with proof, rather than going through people complaining when there's a fix coming right up
---
Vendor herbs or AH?
---
Hold my beer?
---
Priest is the strongest 1v1 class so it should be fine.
---
It’s almost like people are giving feedback for a beta. Wow!!
---
From experience as a Warrior, against 90% of players it goes something like this. Charge &gt; Blink &gt; Intercept &gt; Dead. Good players won't let that happen, but most players are not good and it is very intimidating to have a Warrior up in your grill Mortal Striking you for 3k.
---
So the guild master was married to one of the class leaders, another class leader got interested in the first class leader. Both class leaders got caught naked Skyping. 
---
*Popcorn, for daaayyyysssss*
---
If you're chasing server first kills, you just have to take the pain.
---
If you're not, just don't min/max your spec. Spend 5-10 talent points on making our life bearable while soloing.
---
A completely fresh server could give crafting a bit of potential, but yeah you're probably right.
---
A boomkin won our second Neltharion's Tear which caused a bit of a breakdown between the hardcore / casual branches of our guild at the time and eventually led to its death.
---
Dude that sub is always on r/all what are you talking about
---
&gt;the only reason people stream is to be famous.
---
The absurd level of arrogance right there folks
---
I disagree, better itemization is needed but the talent trees from TBC would be amazing, they were actually introduced late in classic leading up to the launch of TBC it wouldn't even be far off to have them in classic +
---
Here comes more delusional alternate history from the r/classicwow community
---
Thought this was already known?
---
They have a reference client. Reason they don't use it is all the security improvements thru the years.
---
I agree, im planning on doing a warlock, druid and dps paladin becous of this (dungeons) 
---
But the big problem is using this in the open world, you have problems like: other payers also killing mobs, casters/ranged, mobs being to spread out to be able to pull enough: i would say that if you cant pull, and aoe down 10 mobs at the time; it would probably be better to just go full single target dmg. It works on paper but not in reality (dungeons is different)
---
There is no way I'd believe that a majority of people aware of this issue support it. Have you seen the suggestion for Clusters? Similar to layering, but with static realm populations and aggressive merges when needed.
---
Clusters (21,000 active players) consist of various (3,000 active) Segments which all share a name pool for easy future merges. Dragontooth 1, Dragontooth 2, Dragontooth 3, Dragontooth 4, Dragontooth 5, Dragontooth 6, Dragontooth 7 comprise the Dragontooth Cluster.
---
You pick a segment to sign up on, just as though it were a server. It effectively is a server because the population never changes day to day on your cluster. Nobody comes in, nobody leaves, unless they started a new toon or quit.
---
Any two Segments with population drops can be merged together. Until then and after then, players on each segment log in every day to the same player base. Strangers become acquaintances become friends as they did in Vanilla and TBC. The downside will be the painful merge (or a few merges) to compensate for the expected population decline BUT, if population does not decline, Clusters have an advantage over layering in that they allow for Segments to stand on their own, never needing a merge.
---
Layering has too many issues for me: it's a megaserver that will feel similar to sharding: the person you quested with yesterday logged into a different layer today. Mobs, nodes, and people disappear upon group invite. People exploit it and you wonder if you should learn the exploit or just accept that the economy is getting more scuffed every minute. We've seen how exploitable it is in myriad videos. We haven't yet seen all the ways it can be manipulated. If the expected population decline doesn't happen on some servers then Layering will be around forever or they'll have to find a way of separating the population. Layering is rife with downsides and has only one advantage over Clusters: avoiding merges.
---
&gt;natural affinity to magic
---
Didn't the elves teach humans magic? That doesn't sound right to me.
---
It doesn't imply that at all. You're being presumptuous, which is not reading comprehension.
---
People are "always" posting fails and if you go to that site, I assume there are tons of posts. No need to check it from time to time to see the same shit day in and day out.
---
I’m NA, but I never considered different countries’ internet culture- how does it differ from others?
---
Why not alch on an alt so you dont have to spend gold on herbs later ? Or are you keen on your own consumers while leveling ? I really want engineering but the early gold sink is rough.
---
That's a decent grind Haha good luck.
---
I'm calling you young because it sounds as though you've never actually commissioned or hired a person to do a job, otherwise you'd understand these concepts. It has nothing to do with your opinion on crunch time. It's the fact that I don't think you actually understand what's happening here. 
---
So you can stand there on your high horse all you want and call these companies monsters for working the devs to the bone. I don't support having to do the work in a limited time, but it's a consequence of the job. I know, because this is exactly my job.
---
Cheers - I see people say skinning for money and assumed it was probably just because you can skin so many mobs you kill and have more items to sell, but I wasn’t certain.
---
This was my point, no need to check that site regularly. He's just mindlessly defending streamers...
---
You're ignoring the good sides of factions. They ensure you always have a pool of strangers you can trust not to kill you, which is tremendously important for forming parties and new relationships outside of your guild. They also ensure you always have a large pool of strangers you can *never* trust, which is important in avoiding a situation where everyone is in a non-aggression pact for optimal farming and no PvP occurs (a situation familiar to Eve players, no doubt).
---
Factions are legitimately a great feature. Sure, there's an argument to be made for three factions instead of two, but having *no* factions falls apart when players start playing (close to) optimally, because it will basically always result in losing the social interaction with strangers which is so very important to MMOs.
---
The problem is that engaging with idiots is a fruitless endeavor. They argue in bad faith (and don't realize it), and they hope to win every argument by outlasting you.
---
Grown ups aren't interested in wasting time with these people.
---
They said it during BlizzCon iirc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
We are all vocal about the other part when we pay our subs.
---
I agree with this. I believe that so long as subjective opinions have a clear context to compare against, there is nothing wrong with short handing them as objective ones. The key word is "clear" though. Plenty of this people are likely speaking about their minds from the perspective of the animation in a vacuum. If you're going to make a claim such as them being better for that reason, you should really explain the context you're speaking of too (as you just did here).
---
Vendor leather / scraps. Easy passive gold. Lots of beasts everywhere.
---
Loot council is good, but corruption is high.  It always starts good and fair but even if it is run well enough no one takes account for the fact that you won't have 40 raiders, you'll have 50-60, and not rotating in those guys that show up and sit, makes them leave, then you have shortages.  You end up with the powerful getting more powerful, like giving a rogue a MH weapon, despite the fact he got one yesterday, because he was topping the meters yesterday and is obviously topping today with the new weapon, and will be topping again with an even newer weapon.  But when your consistently top rogue also is picked last for MH weapons because Loot Council feels they don't need the weapon, it kind of sucks.  When it's finally their turn, you've got new raiders, your priorities shifted, the thing never drops, they're disadvantaged in PvP and PvE because they did too well, and eventually they can't keep up and they get sat on a progression night and it would have been avoided if they didn't eat so many consumables so early on.  It's a very hard balance to drive and requires a lot of communication.  Maybe if every class lead was on the council and all talked to their people well enough, it could work, but that doesn't happen enough.
---
DKP is just all around unfair, despite being the most fairly balanced.  It is the raider's right to hoard DKP if they really want an item, but decay, and saying your hunter that saved up can't get TF (because they shouldn't) is unfair within the system.  Not having decay puts newcomers on a shit list and is discouraging for anyone that picks up any piece of loot if they know they'll have that competition with the hoarder.  Bidding wars that happen when people do open bids is obviously going to be colluded within classes and you'd be stupid not to, but classes that have a lot of gear competition are going to get screwed.  For instance, every piece of rogue tier loot would be determined well in advance by the rogues for the minimum bid in the pre-selected order.  When that 1h drops, the fury warriors who have competed with hunters, shamans, rogues, potentially druids, and each other, have only alliances with themselves and may have had to piss away a lot of DKP on high bids since they're gear dependent.
---
Honestly, it's hard to have a fair system because it's hard to have 50-60 people that all get along, trust each other, and work together.  Also, instilling trust in a constant roster of new players as everyone moves around, takes breaks, has life obligations, etc.  I don't have an answer, but I've seen a lot of people get very upset in every system.  Not just the loot-hungry ones, good players that just want to experience content and be able to keep up.
---
Can I be neutral?
---
After taking a short break, I came back during the BWL patch. I forged a friendship with another smallish guild so we could get into MC to get up and raiding. We ended up killing Garr and Geddon are 2nd week, no problem, making decent progress and both bindings dropped, the MT at the time was given the bindings, but, we needed tons of mats from BWL to complete it obviously. 
---
This lead to some drama, the partnership fractured, since "if we can't even make the thing for him, why should he automatically get it?" MT got sad, after the thing broke apart and we didnt raid for 2 weeks after that, since we didnt have the bodies in our own guild. A few of us decided that we wanted to raid, not sit around and wait for something to happen, but the other leadership wasn't on board with recruiting "those type of players", so we left. We found a guild that wanted us, that was about the same level of progression and needing bodies, so we joined up with them, however they already had a pretty stout MT/OT roster, so our old MT, after a few weeks with thunderfury equipped, became a DPS warrior all the way through Naxx. I never saw another binding drop.
---
Bring back swirly ball!
---
Dude, as a MT that couldn’t get a shield to save my life I would have happily taken that shield. Not threatening to quit the guild though.
---
I will look for a guild as I'm leveling up most likely. The last thing I want to do is be in a guild where there's only like 9 people online. I want NUMBERS. It will help that Americans will actually play classic. Obviously my experience has been tainted by pservers where nobody is online when I play.
---
Things I will look for: 
---
1. I must like the guild name
---
2. No min/max (classic raids are easy, consumables should be for emergency use only and not required)
---
3. Raids on weekends!! I'm so sick of every guild raiding Tue/Wed. We aren't all neckbeards with no jobs
---
4. At least some interest in pvp
---
Things I would LOVE to find but am definitely not expecting to:
---
1. Alternate specs allowed, its not about meters, its about clearing content which will happen no matter what
---
2. No guaranteed raid spots. The first 40 people online at raid time get the invites assuming they meet some minimum raid criteria (some shuffling may need to occur to reach a minimum number on healers for example). Those who don't get a spot that night still get credit as if they did raid, as long as they remain online and ready to fill a raid spot at any time if needed. This one requires a mature player base. It may not be possible in WoW like it was in EQ but I can dream.
---
And of course, good leadership, friendly/mature players, all the normal stuff.
---
If I find a guild that is forming pre-release (not a streamer guild because I don't want to compete with 42,000 other apps) and a lot of the above is laid out, I'd definitely be interested. Otherwise, I'll see after release what's available.
---
So they get to learn english like everybody else in the EU, great!
---
Pserver guild story:
---
We had an arrogant east european GM who didn't recognize his own mistakes, blamed others for no reasons, he spoke pretty much exactly like the onyxia wipe animation thing funny enough.
---
Anyway at one point he kicked an officer because the officer wanted to be part of a raid instead of being benched for newcomers. At that point every just Gquit and reformed a new guild without him. He stole the guildbank worth a couple thousand gold and made a new guild. But the fun didn't stop there, we couldn't resist to constantly meme him, not always in a bad way, but just for fun. Even years after people still have soundboards(sound clips that they can play with keyboard commands) with him talking and try to have normal conversations with it. It felt a bit much and rude, but also so much fun.
---
No, back in vanilla folk had farming classes too. I knew several warriors who leveled hunter alts purely to grind/farm mats for their warriors.
---
Mage, tailoring for archmage robes at 60, then dropping it for alchemy. Herbalism will be picked alongside.
---
I feel classic is Blizzards last chance to pull WoW off proverbial lite support. BFA isn't bad...but it sure as hell aint good. 
---
I find myself having more fun leveling alts than doing 120 content to get my wow fix.
---
Something important to remember when the existence of streamers upsets you: 90% of their viewer base are under the age of 18. Streamers are literally entertainers for children. 
---
Plus, your complaining about Asmongold doesn’t change the fact that over a million children routinely watch how he reacts to stuff because they find it entertaining. You won’t convince a 13 year old that Asmongold is an idiot. And that is his target audience.
---
Nope, no changes, gimme kneeling down for minutes after looting.
---
So basically like every other major WoW sub. 
---
Got it.
---
I totally agree, the intial bull rush will be crazy but it will eventually settle down to the point it probably isn't worth it.
---
It's difficult to play the AH on new servers, simply because the economy isn't mature enough. 
---
This makes it more appealing to level a farming alt because you can't recoup respec costs as quickly, so you avoid it all together.
---
As an added bonus you're able to farm for more efficiently with a Hunter / Mage. Like all things there's a cost, in this case a significant time investment. 
---
I will say, having played many new servers, you can get away with farming level 30 shit early on until the core player base catches up on things.
---
there are people who literally go out of their way to make new accounts just to post "layering has killed classic, it's dead already" etc etc
---
In all honesty the times Blizzard failed to listen to players in Beta tell you otherwise then to "chill"
---
6 bugs in 2 days. That's 3 bugs a day. So at this rate hunters will be fixed in less than 2 weeks. Launch is 2 months away. So what you're saying is itll be all good, and people need to stop the extreme butthurt? Got it.
---
The audience who wants to play classic will be there at launch. This isnt an unknown game that will show up on peoples radar 3-6months down the line and draw in more players.
---
Quality is subjective. I know on the sub it's an echo chamber of how good the game is but fact is there is not a large audience for this kind of game. For most modern players this is not a game that will make them even bat an eye. To people on here this is a nostalgic game. A game they already know and are excited to play. For everyone outside this bubble classic is just older slower crappier wow. It looks ugly. It plays slow. It goes out of it's way to make you waste time and suffer Inconveniences. If you're not into that now that's not going to cha ge 6 months down the line.
---
That's freaking awesome lol. Just the name? Or from warfronts?
---
Lol what? Thinking someone is vain and toxic is a totally valid reason to dislike them, which you claimed he had no reason. Now you throw this garbage out? Who said that he "read" they were vain and toxic and now he believes that. Such a weak display of argument.
---
Chill Naggas!
---
I think it was MoP, or WoD but a prot warrior could solo just about every dungeon on leveling up to 60, Second wind was stupid if you killed down to one or two mobs you could go AFK for hours even 1 level below the mobs.
---
I hope we can evolve past it one day, however my cynicism says it'll be earth vs Mars one day, then Sol system vs. Vega. Milky way vs Andromeda. Oh well
---
maxxxxx
---
Never tanked in Vanilla - is it itemized worse than the Draconian Deflector that every tank seemed to have til Bullwark dropped?
---
As a counterpoint, I was in full greens after 3 RFC runs on the stress test. If you're worried about being geared dungeons seemed to drop a lot of greens. Like far more than I remember.
---
RemindMe! 2 months
---
In vanilla server ticks for actions between 2 units were processed in 400 ms windows server side due to technical limitations. 6.0 forward every action happens as soon as the server recieves it roughly 1-10ms depending on load. Classic being built on 8.0 had the modern netcode so they artificially batch spells into 400ms windows. This allows the high level pvp meta from vanilla to stay roughly the same. People are against recreating a solution to a problem that doesn't exist, but other people understand pvp balance will be completely shifted without the windows. Example: rogues can restealth off a gouge without spellbatching.
---
Trust the guys, you stillcan switch to ML afterwards, but rly make it clear first orb goes to tank, communication is the key
---
I mean there is a learning curve and certain general pvp playstyle, which may change depending on who and what you're facing; but yeah they're pretty solid overall for what you are wanting.
---
the average player is still going to take a long time to get 60 but slightly faster than back in the day.  Information is readily available and internet connections/pcs are 100x better
---
the top \~20% of players will get 60 A LOT faster than before - think of us nerds on here reading guides/pserves/addons etc. 
---
It's possible that the bottom 10-15% may be slower than before? demographic has aged (kids, work, school, adulting) etc and with that comes more rp type players that like to explore/chill/mess around.
---
Ah fair enough. Basically a sub-par tank taking a quality tanking upgrade from "real tanks"?
---
Using items/mounts as well, but yeah, interacting with objects/looting will not bring any advantage in combat (I might be misinformed?).
---
So basically you're a noob and you can't understand why people like playing a more difficult and rewarding game instead of being handed everything and getting bored and quitting after 2-3 months like every expansion since Wotlk
---
It's essentially a giant emulator.
---
Well... wait for 9.0 you may get get your wish.
---
LOL millionaires with personal armies and special treatment from game companies are victims
---
You using examples of bad implementation of loot system doesn't make the loot system bad.
---
Any LC with some backbone knows that DPS depends on gear aswell, and won't just blindly give the new weapon drop to the highest dps. 
---
It is not unfair that your hunter can't get TF just because he saved up the points. Obviously the rules should be stated in advance, but pure DKP is obviously bad to due to people miss using it for shit like this.
---
Tier gear alliances should be strictly forbidden as well, this is just basic DKP rules man...
---
Of course. Base my post on assumption that this was made very clear multiple times :)
---
Did a better job of destroying world pvp and bringing flying to remove any sense of a world experience
---
For me the gap is for you to trade : you're supposed to sell your production to lower lvl and buy from higher lvl.
---
But frankly, apart from few endgame pieces, crafting is mostly useless in Classic, you can get better gear in dungeons.
---
Yes, but the horde as a faction is waxing, where as the Alliance as a faction is waning - HARD. The Alliance is really on the strugglebus in Vanilla.
---
It is but they have strong accents
---
I suspect you're going to dislike the gear competition. But I can see this being fun.
---
Think I’ll duo box a mage and priest. Just so I can level 2 chars at once.
---
If those are the rules, you can enforce them however you see fit.
---
I can attest to that one as an old old hunter main; We were definitely problematic for priests in general.
---
I bet you have a streamer hate shrine in your closet lmao.
---
Um there are people who play in different time zones....they also don’t need hundreds of servers. You are massively overstating the demand for classic. And they could merge servers if anything was out of hand. This was never an issue in vanilla wow, did you play vanilla wow? Because it seems like you did not and have no idea how it went back in the day. You are clueless if you think queues are going to be anywhere near a private server queue. They can measure the demand for the game and act accordingly, they are a big corporation. They have people who specialize in this stuff using various data. 
---
I’ll ask you again are you using your brain? Are you just an uneducated person who only plays video games? Because you sure sound like one.
---
Well then, just trust them, you won‘t get disappointed in 90% of the cases 🙃
---
If this was back in 2005 then yes we'd be number 1 by a mile but times have changed.
---
The playerbase has aged a lot and people have less time so it will still be very popular among non-casual guilds. 30 minute MC or BWL instead of 2-3 hours is a lot more appealing on first sight.
---
Honestly if you’re gathering a group in Classic to do a dungeon you’re going to be communicating a lot more. It’s not like LFG where people are popping in and out. 
---
I think you could leave looting open for the most part. When it pops up just say “this is what I need” and you should be fine.
---
Shields are rough to get in Vanilla. I had the Draconian Deflector until BC was released. My guild didn’t get too far into raiding, mostly MC, ZG, and a little of AQ, but shields were stupid hard to get in Vanilla.
---
Though on the horde side you only have to battle against other warriors for shields.
---
FRD is great for a lot of things but you can never use it for too long or it breaks. Argent Defender works great anytime theres 7+ mobs
---
We also need to realize many bugs are in vanilla and don't get fixed.
---
Play Warcraft 3 and Warcraft 3 TFT. That will set your story straight for classic.
---
Hell I might play orcs and humans, tides of darkness, reign of chaos and the frozen throne on stream.
---
People may not notice but wow was at it's greatest when the storytelling was tying up loose ends from warcraft 3. Cataclysm was the first expansion to not deal directly with the fallout of the events of roc/tft.
---
Current wow is only about the endgame, not about a journey as it’ll be with Classic while you level. This means that once you reach max lvl, which is lvl 120 in BFA, you’ll be able to participate in what most of the playerbase in BFA is doing. 
---
It’s your choice to either wait for Classic which is a remade version of Vanilla WoW from 2004. 
---
I’d give BFA a try and see what version of the game suits your needs the most. Give Classic a try once it releases and experience the difference between the two. 
---
You’ll find friends in either games, but I’d say that Classic will include more interaction between players while leveling and whatnot. Items and lvls you earn in Classic will probably feel more achieving than in BFA (at least for me). You have to decide yourself and experience it to know what most of us means about this. 
---
I personally don’t play BFA during downtime. I’m in a guild with a few longtime online friends and irl friends, we currently subscribe when a new patch is launched - clear the content at HC, maybe do a few encounters at mythic, then unsubscribe and wait for the next “major” patch - which takes between 3-6months. This is because the game is centered, as I said earlier, around endgame and patches. 
---
A good example is my main in BFA which I quit playing in late February - he still has decent iLvl gear and hasn’t fallen behind those who have played the whole expansion and waited for the new patch that is coming this week.
---
I'm literally not defending anyone, I'm calling someone out on their bullshit. I have asked him to provide one instance of what he claimed happens so often and he's failed to do so, while also mentioning how he has seen those happening in a subreddit dedicated entirely to fans of streamers, which is incredibly ironic considering how he vehemently stated he "fucking hates streamer culture".  
---
I'm trying to reason with unreasonable people and that is ultimately my fault, asking a wall why he refuses to move, not only does it fall on deaf ears but he is also incapable (or unwilling) of thinking rationally.
---
That is probably because it wasn't in Vanilla. And in Classic, suggesting an invite is irrelevant, since the leader will not leave the city / area until the group is full.
---
And if there is a friend that should be invited that is not in the city / area, he will be on someone's list...and Classic players aren't lazy to actually type a name in a chat saying : "Inv xxLegolasxx".
---
Suggest invite would maybe save up 3 seconds. Which is irrelevant for a 2 hrs group forming/travel/dungeon clear, but it is a QoL that might lead to a slippery slope : if I can suggest an invite...why not have a tool whenre I can pick up relevant names for a suggest invite?
---
And that is DAMN CLOSE to LFD.
---
You people have the weirdest class requirementsi swear. Who can bother people more? Loser
---
it does
---
It shouldn't be too bad. I was just going to hord the excess (after first-aid) cloth I get while leveling (aside from a single turn-in for XP) and Mining mats. Sell the skins at the vendor/AH at high levels.
---
Panic being #1
---
I have seen him hit himself in the face and claim theres a bug nearby. the way he was hitting himself did not look like swatting a bug and he did it after losing a duel
---
That was at least how they saw it.
---
Maybe it was, I think it's very hard for any outsider to get even the slightest idea of what's going on.
---
And this is why I hate the culture!
---
Soooooo many clothies are going to be picking up tailoring just to dump it once they get their epic robe.
---
There's still the leeway issue, but I'm sure that's an easy fix and we have a couple months to go still
---
Dwarf Paladin. Mining/Blacksmithing. I love the idea of getting the chance to make my own gear and making some really powerful stuff at the end game.
---
Ouch! Hopefully with talents it’s much better
---
One of the things the expansion got right indeed. TBC balance was pretty much perfect, though I still prefer faction-locked Paladins and Shamans!
---
I AM a software developer they works on a large scale project and I completely 100% expect for classic to be completely bug ridden. 
---
Probably bugs that devs know about now will make it into launch. They will prioritize what needs to be done this sprint and a minor bug that doesn't really affect how the game functions might get pushed back. It's not that devs are lazy it's just that's how things go sometimes.
---
Carry on, sir.
---
Sure sure, that's not wrong. But look at what the Classic team, that is, you know, actually working on Classic, what are they doing? Listening to players and fixing shit.
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=streamer+fails
---
Need more rage.
---
People should obviously stay reasonable and civil but it is absolutely necessary that we stay on our toes and keep bringing up the things that need to be done to make Classic ready for launch. People shouldn't forget about the problems with layering, spellbatching or classes affected by a large amount of bugs like hunters. People should keep asking for language-specific servers in the EU and so on and so forth.
---
Just because Blizzard pushed some fixes to the beta doesn't mean we can calm down and rest assured everything will be alright. It's just that the community should not just keep Blizzard in check but itself as well.
---
I was in an all-tauren pvp-rp guild. Then the leader vanished. We recieved word and later confirmed he was a spoiled 15 year old kid who was failing out of school and his parents took away his computer forever.
---
The guild shattered into three all-tauren guilds but none of them lasted or did nearly as well. :(
---
I really appreciate your response. Based on your username, I'll take it as expert insight.
---
Do you have any advice on a Resto + Balance talent spec that might work well for us?
---
As it is in retail (preemptively healing anyway)
---
And the 10% you can just set to ML til next orb
---
As a warlock I also like baiting out CS with Dartol's Rod. I'll be like, "Oh no! My Arcane magic is locked! lol"
---
Enchanting isn't free, deing what you used to vendor is a loss.
---
Also unpopular opinion, but IMO PVP made WoW worse than it could have been. WoW is an Everquest clone, and EQ was never built for PvP with its heavy focus on gear based endgame progression.
---
Blizzard have then had to bend over backwards to balance both for PvE and PvP, which arguably has impacted the game in a rather negative way.
---
I’m going orc warrior and my brother is going undead priest. We have been grinding on the recent fresh pserver and I’m loving the combo obviously. Also has done great in WPvP situations.
---
I don't think you can get much more roleplay as a dwarf blacksmith whose also a paladin haha
---
a) If you have been around the pserver community for any length of time, you know how incredibly toxic and un-thankful people can be, particularly when it is a product that few people actually pay for. The fact that Classic requires a subscription opens then up to all forms of criticism, imo.
---
b) We are here to organize and point out the bugs, and hopefully avoid acting like whiny kids.
---
c) If you just want to appreciate them, go to the official forums with all the other ass-kissers.
---
Ah keep in mind, archivar drops always an orb if i‘m not mistaken, ML there also is a way
---
Hunters are still pretty bugged, but they have fixed a lot of good things in this patch and I'm told theres a lot more changes coming in the next one potentially.
---
I mean growing up won't fix that. Adults are pretty much just as guilty of that as children are. 
---
This isn't an echo chamber of hate and negativity tho. This Reddit had a lot of positive thread on it. Hell look at what happens when Omar shows up. Pretty sure I saw somebody say "OMAR the saviour! Please bless my children Omar. I beg you please"
---
I really hope I'm not proven wrong given the average gamer today, but during Vanilla people weren't really dicks and I never had any issues trusting anyone to follow whatever rules were layed out.
---
Before all of today's cross-server garbage your reputation actually meant something and would go along way when it came to you getting groups.
---
If someone ninja'ed loot it didn't take long for them to be blacklisted. So I would imagine the same thing will apply in Classic.
---
I dunno man, you are going to have the tank and dps battling over gear which will make things even slower. It sounds super fun though, as /u/weaponsonline mentioned, stealthing directly to the boss you need/past useless pats is super fun, but if you're trying to clear stuff, your original setup or something similar might be as good. 1 Cloth, 1 Mail/Plate, and 1 leather might be easier to divide up gear as you go, even if that means a shaman/paladin healer, cloth dps, and leather tank, whatever array splits up resources could be good.  
---
Godspeed, sounds rad.
---
No you are playing an old game. That’s the whole point of this project. To recreate the old game exactly on it was but on a new client. This isn’t world of Warcraft remastered.
---
Oh, my guild used to force it upon people if it was a known upgrade. It'd be a minimal DKP loss but would be a loss to people.
---
&gt;yesterday, this sub was in a doomsday mood, going "Blizz is never gonna fix this in time omg"
---
I just downvote these posts.
---
 I would pass on it, still if we are talking about a pug on a fresh server it's not so clear cut. The mage player could just as well take it but not use it and instead sell it to finance his epic mount. Banking on the idea that he could sell it for lots of gold. I assume a last rank conjure could be sold very expensively on a fresh server early on since there are not going to be many on the AH. 
---
  But yes I would give it to the mage but would not be surprised if he didn't use it and tried to sell it instead.
---
Don't get me wrong I want a D2 LoD remastered type game, but I'll play devils advocate here.  What if they did pull of an amazing online rpg first person looter game with the option to use some kind of next gen VR technology \~2021.  Doubt they'd be able to pull it off, but if it was done right that sounds fun as hell
---
While I'm all for everyone learning a common language, this isn't a very good way to go about it imo.
---
That's fair, I feel like you can make up that up pretty quick selling a few arcanite transmutations once people start to hit 60, though.
---
I had more DKP drama than LC drama and i've spent a fair bit in both.
---
NO
---
A girl in the guild would fly around the country and sleep with different people in the guild and it caused massive jealously and people to quit lol.
---
My nightmare is seeing 5 cats popping and transforming in Boomkins  and starsharding me !
---
Just imagine the sound of 5 Boomkins morphing, automatic PTSD !
---
If you've played a character for thousands of hours and plan on playing it for many more those little things can be important, even if they seem trivial to you.
---
For example if new models were mandatory I probably wouldn't play. Theoretically they can provide both options, but if they even begin to release new content then there's incentive for them to make upgrading mandatory so they don't have to work with 2 sets of models for new content etc.
---
I can't stand the mconnor dude or whatever his name is.  Human embodiment of how people see all of the negative stereotypes of gamers.
---
The amount of time I spend on this subreddit I would consider to be a bit on the high side, and yet I don't see the prevalence of the negative posts that seems to justify responses like this. Three or four times a week I'll see someone post either lamenting negativity, exhorting people to be more optimistic, or shaming people for 'whining too much'. Yet I never see the topics these posts seem to be alluding to.        
---
          
---
I've seen a lot of posts vocally denouncing bugs, but none have ever come across as whiny. I logged on here yesterday several times and never saw anything that gave me a 'doomsday' vibe - just passionate people being very vocal about what they feel are very important topics.          
---
Are those posts getting deleted? Downvoted off the front page? I don't know. What I *do* know is that posts like the OP always seem to do pretty well, garnering a few hundred upvotes almost every time. If I were  a conspiracy theorist, I might even begin to suspect that people have realized that 'taking the high road' and 'encouraging positivity' is guaranteed karma and visibility and, just like everywhere else on reddit, results in reposts where everyone piles in to agree how toxic everyone *else* is, and how enlightened their own stance on the issue is by comparison.         
---
             
---
But on the off-chance this isn't just the subreddit's semi-daily pandering, I would ask this question: OP  asserts that *now* is not the time to be loud and persistent about problems. So what *is* the official cut-off. When are we allowed to start being upset that something's not happening. Two months is too far out, apparently. Is it one month out? Three weeks out? Is it if the beta is taken down before the bugs or undesired features have been addressed? OP *seems* to agree that bugs that don't get remedied before the game goes live are a problem, and that 'they'll fix it in a patch or two' is not something they find acceptable...so do we have to wait until something makes it live and *then* start complaining about it, all the while having it be a reality in the game until they deign fit to fix it?         
---
            
---
For my part, I'm glad people are keeping these things  on the radar. I'm glad they're using hyperbolic expression to stress how important things are to them, and I don't view it as 'childish' to actively keep these topics alive in the public eye through constant complaint/"whining" to make sure people don't forget that something we feel strongly about isn't just going to go away.
---
definitely AH
---
They also changed macro structure and allowed auto-loots, which is something that couldn't be done with pickpocketing.  The macro change also allows you to use genuine mouseovers and not ghetto ones, meaning you don't have to actually change targets; therefore, you get to keep combo points for mouseover blind and kick (and if they hard-code to remove combo points, that would technically be a change too).  I mean, I appreciate the rogue buffs, but they're still changes.
---
There are scores of other changes as well.
---
* Why did you feel the need to comment and defend streaming? 
---
* Why can't you be ok with the fact someone doesn't want to risk being included in someone's stream, and would like to play privately without the chance of being broadcasted?
---
* Why can't I ask for a realm to play on, that won't be broadcast online publically without my consent?
---
Maybe it's not Candlejack, it could just be a sn
---
why aren't people simply playing vanilla on a private server if they want classic so bad lol
---
Just be careful you don't get hooked on anything heavier, like heading back into town and handing in like 8 quests at once.
---
Props for a 15 year old kid being the GL. Impressive.
---
Zalazane's shrink ability doesn't actually shrink you as intended. So go complain about that
---
There are servers with no streamers?
---
Announce mobile version hype
---
Itemization worse... eh debatable.
---
Deflector simply had a more crucial stat for that phase of raiding, FR was a huge deal for MC as well as highly useful for Ony and BWL.
---
If the first part of raiding wasn't so heavily reliant on Fire Resist then maybe DrillBore would have been a more sought after item.
---
Save it for your blog.
---
Oh I agree, I guess I feel most people on this subject are hardcore fanatics. Assumptions are always dangerous though lol
---
If you consider that someone is worthy or reporting...you fill up a ticket.
---
If someone is saying 'I love Trump" in barrens chat or 2...with right-click report he is DONE. And nobody will actually fill up a ticket saying that a player should be punished for saying " I love Trump".
---
Right-click report is a tool that works in Retail, a so-called game that have zero social aspect.
---
In Classic, such a tool would be abused for little things that are far from being worthy of 20 seconds of a player's time filling up a ticket.
---
Racism, personal attacks and other offenses are going to be reported manually, because it is a serious thing.
---
But political views, or social opinions should not.
---
*salivating*
---
&gt; You are massively overstating the demand for classic. And they could merge servers if anything was out of hand. This was never an issue in vanilla wow, did you play vanilla wow? Because it seems like you did not and have no idea how it went back in the day. You are clueless if you think queues are going to be anywhere near a private server queue
---
So fucking naive.  A million retail subs get the game for free.  A million more ex vanilla players like myself (yes i played vanilla), are returning and actually WANT to play the game.
---
Layering has a ton more pros than cons for the overall health of this game.  But i'm not gonna waste my time trying to explain it to someone who thinks they can just simply spin up a bunch of 5k pop servers and have no login queues, and have no issues when the game suffers a gigantic population launch.
---
From the moment I joined a few months back it was nothing but toxic negativity. Once the game comes out I cant really see myself coming around much :/
---
You can choose (sorta) - it's a "first in, last out" system.
---
Was guild chat in Taurahe to discover the outsiders?
---
I meant it figuratively, maturity not age.
---
It's not the worst echo chamber for it but it's pretty bad. Look at topics on layering from last week. People even entertaining the idea that Blizzard were working on it were lambasted, Hunters? Never getting fixed and don't be naive to think otherwise.
---
This can’t be true haha. What?
---
You’re ignoring a big part of my comment I really wonder why. 
---
Unions exist for a reason. Burnouts are a serious problem. Its not a consequence of the job it’s a consequence of management decisions....
---
And thankfully there are no achievements, so I don't feel compelled to do events I don't care about that only come up once a year.
---
I jist really needed that violet proto drake.
---
its not about chilling out about bug reporting and calling out things that need to be fixed, its about the people screaming doomsday and dead game because the beta has bugs still, definitely keep reporting bugs and discussing them but lets not start a mob for the devs that are obviously working hard
---
 [Yeah it's rewarding if you are that kind of person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTr7C54dUyI)
---
There's a comment at the top where I included it
---
It's hard to say - I will probably come back after I'm 60 and level stuff to 300.
---
I genuinely think we will have a runescape scenario, however classic will be the dominant force and retail will be a side project, they will in a way start asking fans how to move fort after classic 2 year mark. 
---
For me I will vote for tbc and wrath, but perhaps with keeping the level cap as is 
---
Make end game bigger and levelling in new zones quicker
---
Oh wow I didn't know that. I figured stuff like "focus target" would be implemented with mods just saving peoples names etc, but mouseovers saving combos is a pretty big one.
---
Yep, I got what you mean. 
---
What I said above means in the end I'll be lv60 lv 70, or in the end lv120，
---
Which I already had or I have it right now.
---
Then, It's kind of duplicated and turning into meaningless.
---
Why are you changing the means of accessing said content ? He has specifically said he saw those clips on /r/all, not by actively searching for them.  
---
Also, by actively searching content related to streamers, you are part of streamer culture, because you're offering them your time in the form of views or discussion which causes exposure.  
---
Can we think with some logic for a second here ?
---
Are there Giants in WoW?
---
The Blackrock Orcs side with the Black Dragon flight to destablise both the Ally and Horse. Ally through Onyxia and Horde by questioning Thralls legitimacy. Not really uncalled for imo
---
200+ is pretty good.  At launch mine never dropped below 450, and combined with the loot lag bug at the time, the game play was shit.
---
Crafting is not useless. There are plenty of very good items, even epics, from crafting.
---
The cooldowns actually make the problem worse. One of the big issues with world buffs is they encourage you not to play your character so you can keep as much duration on them until raid time. Putting long cooldowns on them magnifies the problem, and further discourages you from actually playing the game. There's more to the issue than just trivializing content.
---
If you aren't defending streaming, why do you care so much about this thread?
---
On a pserv last night we totally had some guy apply to be in our raid guild that asked, "So what's your guild's stance on layering for classic".  He was absolutely dead serious not trolling with this and utterly flipped out when we told him, "None really because we can't do anything about it either way."  This dude lost his shit that we "hadn't discussed such an absolutely important topic" and "how could we possibly be organized as a guild if we hadn't had a discussion about that".
---
Oh I bought a new desktop a few months ago to get back into wow. Glad to say I can run retail at ultra.
---
I think the “chill out” is directed mainly at the people saying “OMG EVERYTHING IS BROKEN CLASSIC IS DEAD BLIZZ DOESNT CARE ABOUT US THEYVE ALREADY GIVEN UP BECAUSE IT WILL FAIL.”
---
People freak out because they don’t see a blue post so they assume blizz is unaware or not doing anything. Some of the recent fixes show us that isn’t the case.
---
Some people think that because there are bugs on the beta something is wrong. That’s the purpose of a beta. 
---
It’s fine to bring awareness about bugs, nobody is bashing that. But to be honest I don’t think the first place they check for bugs is this subreddit. It would be highly inefficient on their part. It’s bug reports from beta, official forums, plus their own research into issues with the game.
---
&gt; Layer Hopping isn't a major factor? 
---
It is not a major factor. It is the most major that is left to be fixed, but in the grand scheme of things (Loot Trading, Phases, etc.) is not that major.
---
This is what I meant to say.
---
&gt; what are we going to talk for the next 2 months?
---
this is how Barrens chat became Barrens chat.
---
I dunno man, we're talking like two bytes per player here. Gonna break the memory budget for sure ^^/s
---
He didn't think an indivual is vain and toxic, he thinks an entire community of people are vain and toxic based of a few encounters and word of mouth.
---
You know what we call that? discrimination.
---
Well, we haven't been there yet :)
---
Exactly. I know this goes directly against the spirit of this post, but it irks me that a) people complained loud enough about these things to be heard and b) Bliz complied and removed them. Maybe they did it of their own accord and are firmly on the no changes bandwagon themselves, in which case, probably say goodbye to those other things you mentioned.
---
Heh heh! Glad I could help!
---
Mining/eng. i need to make my own ammo.
---
I would love wotlk server. My favorite xpan by far
---
Ya you're definitely right about all the layering threads. Some of them have suggestions but the vast majority are just complaining. 
---
I thought hunter pets are currently bugged on BfA as well. Some of the warlock pet bugs are pretty comical and will obviously be changed. The one where they just drop and forget all of their skills 😂
---
That's a great idea and definitely worth considering.
---
Only drawback is a lack of stealth for the Hunter (we're playing Horde, so no Shadowmeld).
---
The ps2 was a DVD player that played games.
---
It was literally the same price as your average dvd player but it played games. My mom never played a video game in her life and owned a ps2.
---
Also you did not need the internet to use it. It did not take a monthly sub fee (the biggest turn off of wow at the time). 
---
And it is console gaming vs pc gaming you are comparing. A more reasonable comparison would compare it to say the sales of final fantasy 10.
---
Which did 6 million in sales on the ps2 over 5 years. WOW dwarfs that number.
---
Yeah I agree, save this post for your blog. Chill out just meant stop with the negativity, that's all.
---
&gt; I watched his stream for like 30 seconds one time
---
Yep, that pretty much sums up most opinions on the internet.
---
I don't understand why Connivery neck is better than Tooth neck for Rogue.
---
Connivery -  **1% Hit Chance + 30 AGI**
---
Tooth - **1% Hit Chance + 1% Crit Chance + 12 AGI +9 STAM +10 Fire Res.**
---
Isn't 30 AGI = 1% crit?
---
so.. you kinda get more AGI by using tooth neck here.
---
Why is streaming suddenly a job? Most streamers don't make any money or bare to none. Just because there is a few that has it as their job, doesn't mean that streaming is a job. Do you think playing football is a job?
---
No. You’re a healer.
---
Dude, trust me, there will be plenty for people to bitch about. Haha they could get it 100% perfect and there will still be people saying it's not like the original in some way, just because they remembered it differently.
---
That's lame, they must not have the lesser duration in pvp like what is in vanilla. Pretty sure it is supposed to just last 8 seconds.
---
It was a strategy I would use (particularly against pallies and druids) to trap, get slightly out of range, and eat/drink while sending my pet in to keep the other player in combat. But I could only really get a couple ticks of food/water each time I trapped.
---
Good finds. Make sure to report these things in the game if you haven't already.
---
&gt; and without blue confirmation, there's really no reason to assume that RCR wasn't just disabled by mistake or disabled for the beta 
---
Yeah, but if we react like it is removed...Blizzard will LIKELY keep it out of Classic. They might not, and put it back in the beta...but hey, you know what this means, right? :D
---
In a way it is. It’s not the original code nor the original graphics.
---
My thoughts exactly. It's all for goofs anyways. We'll be playing on the weekends only, probably, so hitting 60 is going to take a lifetime anyways.
---
I think he’s joking
---
It hasn’t been advertised as a remaster at any point.
---
And pick it back up again for ZG set
---
He was joking too
---
not everything is about max efficiency my guy
---
On all the big pservers, usually you just vendor light/medium all the time.  You might find yourself destroying light stacks sometimes because of limited bag space and other stuff that is essential or more valuable.  Medium leather is better value-wise to vendor.  
---
heavy is often vendored but sometimes has a decent market on AH. 
---
Thick or rugged leather is always AH or often you can find someone that advertises to buy it COD, so you can save the auction house 5% cut and get a guaranteed good price.  Or hook up a guildy for good karma =P
---
I'm not ignoring any part of your comment other than the unions bit. I think you just don't see, care, or understand the answers. Burnout happens. Sucks. But this is not a consequence of management decisions. It's a consequence of the job and how releases happen. 
---
You sound like person who has zero clue about people's livlyhoods coming in and screaming about how it needs to be better. Yeah... It's not perfect. It's also something we sign up for and get paid well to deal with. That's why I'm not getting paid minimum wage to do a less stressful/strenuous thing.
---
Lol. 
---
Top post in past 24hrs: **5.4k**
---
Top post all time: **42.5k**
---
So is this where you come back and start calling yourself on bullshit ? Is that legal?
---
&gt;Also, just to bury the dead horse, the top post on /r/livestreamfail has around 5k upvotes, which barely makes it into the top 800 posts on /r/all. Not only would you have to browse 30 pages or close to 800 posts on /r/all before reaching the first livestreamfail post, you'd also have to see one related to classic wow in which the streamer is behaving like a brat (and those usually don't get many upvotes since classic is such a niche game to stream and has a comparatively small following )
---
Thanks for the detailed response!
---
As a warrior tank: Herb/Skinning until I'm level 20, then herb/alch. Then probably engi/alch after I get my epic mount.
---
I'll also have a bank alt that will have enchant/lw until my main is 20, then will switch to enchant/tailor. The enchanting is just to disenchant greens to make them more convenient to sell, and to make magic wands. LW is just to make greens to disenchant.
---
Never vendor anything, even peacebloom and silverleaf should be useful.  However, really early in a server's life you might have trouble actually selling them, so it might be better to find an alchemist buddy and trade them for potions or other items
---
Classic wow, is a great 30th bday present =P
---
Rank 3-4 healing touch for early vanilla, then possibly regrowth build once gear gets good enough
---
Because I hate people that incite to mindless hate by bringing up non-existant happenings, such as yourself.  
---
If you don't care about streamers, why do you care so much to attack them and their followers?
---
Arcanite is alchemy.
---
My main goal is end-game PVE.
---
This is my plan - *enchanting* \+ *tailoring* until I get my first wand (crucial for priest). Then dropping both and picking up *skinning* \+ *herb* whilst leveling to supplement my gold. Once at 60 I'll drop skinning for alch so I'll be self-sufficient for pots.
---
I mained a troll priest in Vanilla. Went to Onyxia once with a random group. At about 5% health remaining, all players were dead except the main tank and me. We made it to 1% with me DPSing with my wand and healing. We died because of two subsequent wand crits  = healer aggro. Whole raid was cheering for us nonetheless. One of my greatest experiences ever in a MMO.
---
What class you’re gonna play?
---
You underestimate the power of the female voice on ventrilo. I believe it.
---
They were breeding hybrid "chromatic" dragonkin (like Chromaggus).
---
This...
---
&gt; The idea is to rely on the versality of Druids to constantly switch roles and compensate for our lack of team members. 
---
If you have good tank, heal and dps, the other two don't matter. Just roll Warri, Priest, Warlock (to port them)
---
Having a viable excuse to use a Moonkin would definitely be awesome.
---
I think that might be the preferred route if we decide to attempt this.
---
I feel your sibling pain! If it's any consolation, we'll all be working full-time, so the all-nighter days are unfortunately over for us. It would take us years to reach 60 with this trio and schedule.
---
Blizz will never ban multiboxers because that's 2+ subscriptions worth of money every month they are making off of a singular person.
---
Cooking is profitable at all phases, once you get the +8 or +12 stam/spirit buffs.  The special ones like dragon chili or sagefish delight (mana/5) also are very sought after. 
---
Fishin helps a lot with cooking but is very tedious to level.  At least you can use the lures to help your skill though.  It's not for everyone (definitely not for me) but it is extremely profitable considering you basically put zero investment into it, only time.
---
They are putting in mini patches on beta
---
Rogue here. I’ll be leveling as skinning &amp; mining, vendoring ~70% of the leathers. I’ll bank all the mining resources and remaining leathers for future professions. 
---
At 60 I’ll drop skinning for leatherworking to get that sweet 3 day CD rockin for my guild’s fellow melee DPS. After I’m comfortable with my mining supplies I’ll switch to engineer since it’s BIS for profession slot.
---
Chill out. 
---
Vanilla had way more bugs on launch. 
---
Did you have particular dungeons you found useful to farm?
---
Yes ! So now because of me, you can report this ingame, if i'm the only one to report this, it will be never fixed
---
Ahh shit, good call, dunno why I thought that was enchanting.
---
You've hit the nail on the head. It's obvious that many people here have nothing to do with development in their day jobs, and that's fine, it's a small portion of people's day to day. But the armchair devs are ridiculous on this sub.
---
There's no way the devs are just slacking off between here and release. In fact they're probably working harder than they should. If the problems don't get fixed before launch I'd much rather blame whoever chose the release date than the people who are killing themselves to release the game on time and with as few problems as possible.
---
Just takes time to level to 35, but yeah alch on an alt is "best" as far as min/maxing.  Arc transmute is easy money
---
Definitely true in general but there is a decent amount of leather healing/int gear for druids, especially when you get into tier sets. Not sure if other healing hybrids have this happen with their tiers.
---
t1/2 are great at providing what you need to heal and possibly better at times than some 'BiS' pieces because of how much int they provide at that time
---
What server?  Not greymane by any chance?
---
Did they provide a reason why? I understand that a lot of people have been upset about this, but if Europe represents a tiny fraction of an already small expected player base, they’ll go with the most sensible option, which is to group you all together into fewer realms.
---
Are you also going to raid with your alt to get good gear for PvP?
---
Yeah, haha 
---
&gt; Fishin helps a lot with cooking but is very tedious to level. At least you can use the lures to help your skill though. It's not for everyone (definitely not for me) but it is extremely profitable considering you basically put zero investment into it, only time.
---
I remember the same thing.
---
Very profitable, very tedious, and definitely not for me.
---
Uh, not really. There are narratives all throughout the world in vanilla. Sure, not all of them connect in some way but there is plenty of lore behind each raid setting.
---
&gt;Top post in past 24hrs: 5.4k  
---
&gt; top post on /r/livestreamfail has around 5k upvotes
---
Where have I contradicted myself exactly ? Going by all time would mean I'd have to scroll to where /r/all reaches 42.5k upvotes, which would be comically far away from the front pages.
---
Can’t shamans use shields?
---
It's better than the Draconian Deflector.
---
You'll probably run out of bag space.  Might be better off just farming the linen, wool, silk, mageweave once you're 60 and can slaughter hordes of grey enemies for it, and save the bag space in the meantime
---
Always surprised they never made one as a Polearm.
---
INTEREST YA IN A PINT?!
---
I was referring to the artificial delay in information transfers. Ability batching specifically shouldn't affect non-combat actions AFAIK but I'm saying whatever is being done in the back end to increase the batch window size is potentially causing negative side effects.
---
Yes, but most don’t. Paladins always have a much higher chance of using a shield than shamans.
---
I'm with you on this. Finding a guild that raids from 8-11 PM PST would be perfect but it's proving hard to find.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOLS30iByp0
---
&gt;It’s fine to bring awareness about bugs, nobody is bashing that
---
Oh trust me friend, I've been seeing a common theme lately here where asshats are mocking people reporting issues "DoEsN'T aFfeCt GaMEplAY" "Lul YoU'Re ComplaInIng AbOuT tHat?" because they're shortsighted and have no reason to say that in the first. Every detail matters because it all adds up in the big picture.
---
&gt;to be honest I don’t think the first place they check for bugs is this subreddit. It would be highly inefficient on their part. It’s bug reports from beta, official forums, plus their own research into issues with the game.
---
I honestly think otherwise, I've read somewhere either here or on Discord that Blizzard is checking this subreddit frequently. It makes sense because a lot of people jumped ship on the forums ever since they changed them.
---
Excellent insight -- thank you.
---
Do you think it makes more sense to have the Resto druid spec into Balance (or perhaps go full Moonkin)?
---
Vanilla and retail are two completely different games. Yes they share universe and lore but as games they are completely different. Retail is more like modern mobile games. You log in, do your daily tasks and then you get out. Classic will be different. It's more like old school RPG game. You adventure in the world and try to make your character move powerful one piece of gear at time.
---
So which one fits more for you? I can't say. Try both. When you buy subscription you can play Classic WoW and also retail version up to latest expansion.
---
It was not, but pray do tell, we're all friends here!
---
GOD DAMNIT WOMAN NO WONDER WHY THAT DAMN MONSTER KEEPS COMIN AROUND! YOU KEEP GIVIN HIM TREE FIDDY!
---
I think around Thick and Rugged you can start to AH them, but yea, most of the early stuff you vendor.
---
I’ll be doing a similar thing to make a little money while leveling but still be able to focus on leveling.
---
Curious, how is this a problem?
---
No consecration?
---
where did you get 2 days? these bugs were reported weeks ago.
---
I'm saying let's be realistic, not overly happy because Blizz just announced some fixes.
---
This is the correct answer. DKP is simply for casual guilds. This debate bugs me because I think people just debate DKP vs Loot Council. These systems are for entirely different guilds and play-styles.
---
It will be fun ganking and corpse.camping these types of players.
---
I just hope realm forums return so I can watch from the shadows
---
Even with a balanced comp any deaths murders your ability to play effectively. It works with any comp of a multiboxer's.
---
actually what they probably are thinking is "and this is why you never show work in progress". Most people here have never seen a game in development before. This process is normal, but would seem scary to someone on the outside. I highly doubt blizzard cares about the doomsday threads and is more exx deeing
---
I hope, I really do.
---
&gt; You'll probably run out of bag space.    
---
Bank alt. As I replace my 6x slot bags I'll send them over there.
---
The biggest problem is you all share the same gear. If you ran warrior/rogue/priest you could all use different gear and make use of all of the drops a lot better.
---
Yeah, totally.  There's the water giant dude on the island near Booty Bay.  There's a bunch of his buddies on the coast in Ferelas.  There's the rock giant guy that wanders around Arathi, and his buddies in Maraudon.  Emulating these guys correctly is vitally important.
---
But this would be less of a problem if there were, say, 10 other people in the cave at the same time.
---
Having different gearsets is definitely awesome. We've done that before.
---
I'm trying to determine if the novelty is worth the downsides.
---
Why are you reducing all of PvE to just raiding?
---
Right now you can play the current version of WoW (we call it Retail) up to level 110 and excluding the Battle for Azeroth (BFA) content for $15 per month (USA) with no other purchase needed. If you get to level 110 and want to progress to 120 (the current level cap) and do the BFA zones then you need to pay for the upgrade to BFA.
---
On August 27th (26th in the USA) you'll be able to play Classic WoW as well for no additional charge, if you keep paying the $15 per month. There's no upgrade needed to play Classic.
---
There's very little knowledge that transfers between Retail and Classic. The character abilities and playstyles are completely different. The stories are different. The zones appear in the same places on the map but almost all of them are very different. Some are almost unrecognizable.
---
hope so! at least they'd be having fun then, quite reassuring!
---
Did you play in vanilla?
---
they have at this moment fixed 5 out of 49 hunter related bugs! lets just hope they up the pace.
---
This makes me so giddy. It's a different era with twitch in the mix and stuff like this is definitely going to be rampant. On some level, I hope to be able to avoid it, on the other hand, its going to make for epic battles.  
---
I have a noob question though: How do dishonorable kills work? Can lowbies sneak into the fray abd get AOE'd down and make us lose honor points, or are DK's strictly from NPC's?
---
They were cesspools of topics, stopped going near them towards the end.
---
Yeah I believe they have bugs on BfA (a common reason for complaint/belief they won't get fixed) but they're different bugs that were being reported as far as I know, I'm neither a retail hunter nor a wannabe classic hunter though so I don't know the whole story
---
I actually played the game in classic back in the day. It was incredibly easy to get away from a camp. The res at your body is longer than anyones attack range by 3-4 times so you just res up away from them and leave. Its a very basic trick on pvp servers.
---
Mmm, can feral druids use weapon enchants such as windfury buff and potions yet?
---
What about strafing?
---
Sir, you appear confused.
---
This is a sub-reddit for a Blizzard game.
---
Maybe its cuz a lot of these bugs are still to this day present in the retail version that ppl get "worried."
---
People just want to make sure there is focus on them.
---
Lol no you are naive to think BFA players are all going to play classic AND to have so many players returning to classic who played 14 years ago. News flash buddy, many of those people are MUCH older and don’t even play video games anymore, or simply don’t care. You are vastly overestimating the hype. 
---
And they had tons of servers back in the day yes 2004 with 2-3k pop caps, with zero issues and the game was flying with subs. There’s zero reason in 2019 they can’t do it better when a private server team of random dudes who use their free time we’re holding over 10k players with ease across two servers. 
---
And no that’s because you don’t think and I’m constantly breaking this down for you while you argue with me from a basement battlestation.
---
Cheat! Loved that show. That WoW episode is what first got me interested in the game
---
"wAKe uP sHEePLe"
---
100% agree, fuck chilling out. We have seen what "chilling out" does to WoW, it fucking ruins it. "It's just beta" "Wait for next patch" "They will fix it next expansion" rinse and repeat for the last 10 years. 
---
I have seen this exact thread every fucking expansion, if people don't make noise about problems they WILL NOT get fixed.
---
So the story would have actually been a proper and logical continuation of WC3?
---
Best part about Classic staying Classic. No need to rush the endgame.
---
Mines pretty short. We merged with a small guild that had about 4 good players. We accepted about 12 of them in. The guild was struggling in AQ40 progression and eventually the old leader in the small group convinced a portion of the guild he would be a better leader. About 30 people total followed. 10 quit. His new guild broke up 2 months later with the same struggle.
---
5/49. with that pace hunter is playable @ xmas.
---
Everything is awesome!
---
Not by our standards but in a fantasy world its believable.
---
Don't hide your action bars, just get an addon so they can be made clickthrough.
---
Axe spec doesn't do jack in pvp though.
---
Those TBC talents broke Classic in the last few weeks of it before TBC launched.
---
They weren't balanced around level 60. You had some ridiculous classes when they launched during the pre event
---
OSRC is the way to go
---
No but i think youtube has cuz i keep telling them i aint interested in ASMON REACTS TO USING A HEALTH POTION videos and they keep popping up, hate it.
---
Need 100% and i would hope the rest of the group does as well,
---
Wasn't it announced that worldbuffs would have cooldowns? I mean, GL keeping track and ninjaing buffs when half the fucking server is turning in heads.
---
No it doesn't matter anymore in retail. But one of the reasons for sharding and cross-realm battlegrounds was to fix server faction imbalance.
---
A close friend at the time became very close companions with the guild leader. They were often seen as a couple within the game. Something always seemed 'off' for me. 
---
They played together for 3 years, and we made distinctions within the guild that she had several family members in the guild as well, not an issue but it was easier to track them down, but we'll get to that in a moment. 
---
To give some bg, the guild leader, we'll call her Bosley, stated she was a young lady whom underwent throat surgery to explain why her voice sounded like someone who's been smoking for 300 years. 
---
My friend eventually went to visit her and she bailed last minute. He gave me some info and i tracked ger down through facebook (its scary what you can find with minimal info). 
---
Turns out shes a married grandmother and her 3-4 children live with her and they all play together. Well, she received a lot of love and attention, and my friend finally quit WoW.
---
&gt;Classic WoW is dead!
---
&gt;*Close the gates!*
---
&gt;No wait, they fixed the bugs!
---
&gt;*Open the gates!*
---
&gt;But there is still a lot of bugs in the Beta!
---
&gt;*Close the gates a little!*
---
This could have easily just been posted as a reply in the "chill out" thread. No real need for a whole separate post imo.
---
Keep crying about layering til it's gone. That shit reeks
---
You act as if that’s not common
---
We did warriors, tank druids, enh shaman, healers. But basicly that was, Raid lead, GM, Melee Class Lead, then thier GFs. I stopped at r11 once I got my mount
---
That's like saying the room is too hot while you're testing to see how hot the furnace can go. Well yea, I guess it is feedback, but it's not helpful because it's the wrong type of feedback. In my dumb example you'd complain about fire, or a smell, not the fact that it is hot.
---
Patch 1.13 !
---
Talioring and herbs
---
Talioring to make bags and some gear and the truefaith vestments

after that dropping it for alc

I ‘V E  G O T  T H E  F I N E S T  W A R E S  I N  T H E  L A N D
---
Man, I sure wish Shaman's enhancement spec could be solved by just getting BIS instead of being bad forever even when geared.
---
Everything is fixed, let's talk again about what class you should play and what's coming after Naxx :°
---
I myself have kept some things on the radar, but I didn't whine about it not being good yet. I just reported something that wasn't correct, then waited and guess what, it got fixed. For me, one month prior to release, most of it must be fixed and we should have communication about the state of layering. But right now, I think it's fair that not everything is fixed, don't you think? Clearly at launch I won't be defending the dev team if big concerns haven't been adressed, but right now all we should do is report and wait calmly, then adress it again properly later if nothing is being done, but this ain't the attitude I'm seeing now, that's all.
---
I remember the name, my friends and I thought it was hilarious back then (2008-2009). Iirc there was a duo and the other was called something like "Michelleollama"
---
I forgot WoW was bug free when it launched 🤦‍♂️🙄
---
Healing is easy. Healing optimally and being recognized as doing so feels great. Looking away for a second and the tank dies feels bad. Ups and downs for sure.
---
Yeah you get it, they do exactly what you just said except it lasts for 12 seconds everytime. So basically you have 15 seconds to kill the hunter between each time you get scattered or hes going to eat back 50% of his health again &gt;.&lt;
---
Brave takes for 600 Alex
---
I don't think it'll be possible to switch from NA to EU no, maybe we will get more info that later.
---
I would recommend EU most definitely.
---
Another big difference is just timezones. Peak hours is generally around 7-11 PM for the community. As a NA playing on EU this would be around noon to 2 pm, not so bad time to play videogames after all, compared to going the opposite way and most raids beginning at 2am at the earliest.
---
That's not how classic works. People won't stop playing just because they can't get a buff. Top guilds will STILL push and grind bosses, even without buffs.
---
2 hours is nothing. Even if you have MC on farm it takes like an hour to clear minimum. BWL longer. Top guilds might have multiple characters with buffs that are waiting, logged out, to replace people who die / when the buffs run out. But the top guilds always does that shit.
---
If she sounds hot... It means she must be hot... Right?
---
Ah yes, the neo nazi calling card and excuse down to the letter.
---
It was absolutely sarcasm. Asmongold basically thrives on it.
---
/u/Belmeez is the one missing a few chromosomes, methinks
---
In the manual it talks a little about "outlaws". I remember reading it so much while I was waiting to install the game that the first time I saw a rogue wearing a leather defias mask I figured he must be an outlaw lol
---
For the longest time when I heard "May your blades never dull" I was hearing "May your blades never die" which made absolutely no sense to me.
---
Take twice as long, too, if you're clearing the whole thing.  Balances out.
---
I think your ability to spot sarcasm and otherwise obvious jokes needs some work, man.
---
Where is the white carpet? 
---
This is clearly not camp nessy.
---
i'm certain they'll fix bugs. what i'm not certain about is whether they address layering and eu servers.
---
Just wondering, is there an update? I'm extremely interested in following this!
---
HAHAHA, I take it!
---
Yes the dps and healing rotations are super simple. On top of that the dungeon and early raid mechanics are very simple. I’m going to be multiboxing 40 characters through molten core/onyxia and maybe bwl if I have enough fingers to get past Razergore.
---
You’re being a bit aggressive about it, but you’re right. Multiple people in this thread have actually claimed that they can only roll Rogue now that the stealth animation is fixed. Picking an entirely different vanilla main because of a *stealth animation* is, while innocent, pretty much insane.
---
What do you mean by cheating the 5 sec with inner focus? Because you can wait longer before casting a heal with the 25% improved crit?
---
Keep calm and report.
---
That's not the point, indeed, but BEFORE they fixed it, complaining was useless, cause these were reported many times and were being worked out. This is all a work in progress, so the state of layering is a state of test, constantly being worked out, tried, tweaked. And minor bugs (minor in a sense of affecting only a spell or smth, not in a sense of importance) are being fixed one after the other. They won't work faster just cause people complain more...
---
Nice, was this only for rogues btw? Or did druids have wrong stealth animation too?
---
If you're unaware, /r/all changes.
---
I agree with not actively searching for content related to streamers, but you're asking for evidence disingenuously. There's plenty out there to those not blind to it.
---
Because people are used to the last decade of retail where that was the only relevant part of pve.
---
Enchanting definitely has an investment. Disenchanting your greens that you would have vendored or AH is a big loss of leveling income.
---
For a rogue, i tried this and the damn thing didn't work.  No idea why.  Would love some help.  Basically, i just want to cast blood fury on CD tying it in to my sinister strike spam. 
---
/cast Blood Fury
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
Did not work.  It would cast BF, but never the SS.  I have no idea why such a simple macro wouldn't work, but then i'm completely unfamiliar with the new macros as i quit the game mid way through WotLK.  I know the new macro system is better, i just don't know the ins and outs of it.
---
You can play on NA servers from Europe and vice versa. Though your characters won't transfer with you as they use different data centres. It sucks, especially if you travel a lot. I spent 2 years in NA then I'm back In EU for 4 years before heading either to Asia or back to NA for a few years. So I suggest you commit to one region. With retail I needed to buy a game licence for both regions. I guess you won't need to with classic as it's just subscription based.
---
I stand corrected. Quoting myself:
---
" Classic will be the unwanted, unloved adopted Child Blizzard HAS to keep but secretly hate it.
---
You're expecting fixes from a Team that decided to destroy the Economy of the Game straight from Day 1."
---
You may throw tomatoes and eggs at me now. - AFTER they removed layering tho (thats my last straw where i can blame Blizzard)
---
I *was* going to join Kevin Jordans guild but since his stream blew up from less than a hundred viewers to several THOUSAND, ive decided to find another guild.  I was hoping his community would stay low key but i dont want to be in a huge ass streamer guild and deal with the whole 4 different raid team compositions.  Wouldve been nice to play with the dude who built the game but time to move on.

# &lt;Quest Failed&gt; [EU] Alliance PVP Guild
---
Quest Failed is a hardcore PVP guild that is looking to recruit the **finest players of the alliance**. We aim to be the top PVP guild on our server by proving ourselves as a formidable force of highly skilled players. While PVP will be at the top of our agenda, **we also look to fill our ranks with raiders and casual players** as it is important to us that we provide a functional and pleasant community for all of our members.
---
Typical weekdays within Quest Failed will usually include:
---
* Raids (We will be using Suicide King DKP in order to provide the most fair distribution of loot)
---
* Contesting world bosses
---
* PVP nights
---
* Social farming nights
---
* Duelling tournaments
---
It doesn't matter if you are a veteran at Vanilla World of Warcraft, or if it is your first time playing. We are accepting people who are looking to dedicate themselves to the game and learn to play at the highest level while also creating a community of friendship.
---

So you're going by "bvbdev" now nerd? Haha whats up douche bag, it's Tessief from Kil’Jaeden. Remember me? Me and my pet used to give you a hard time while levelling. Sorry you were just an easy target lol. I can see not much has changed. Remember Sarah the night elf you had a crush on? Yeah we're married now. I make over 200k a year and drive a mustang GT. I guess some things never change huh loser? Nice catching up lol. Pathetic..
---
Yeah I watched that guy multibox some of molten core and he really seems like a big noob. If it wasn’t for his crazy scripting that plays the game for him there’s no way he’d every kill a boss.
---
asmongold loves this game probably more than many of us. but i'm not sure whether he's aware that his opinions aren't more important than anyone else's opinions.
---
&gt; Hard coding the factions was by far the best thing they did.
---
My response was to this. Sure there are some positive aspects to factions. 
---
That being said having no hardcoded factions doesn't automatically mean there are no factions. Guilds and communities create factions on their own.
---
McConnell does the contrarian troll persona so perfectly.
---
If I don't survive, tell my wife... "Hello"
---
Jeez username checks out. I never said I liked the current expansions. I was merely trying to understand why my classic experience differed from other people's.
---
Why? It's not an exploit. Its using the mechanics of the game (sitting guarantees you receiving a crit and crits triggering reckoning) for a positive result.
---
You wouldnt report someone for using engineering bombs in pvp would you?
---
How about using MC to drown someone?
---
Categorizing any dev team as "Blizzard" is just sad. This is another team, where a guy spent two weeks finding a way to just make this POSSIBLE. They literally put the original spell batching to show they care, and changed the Phases schedule to adress concerns. They do listen, cmon...
---
Counter-point: What about the servers with streamers? How will they remove layering? Blizz is overpacking the servers under the guise of layering. If blizz removes it on those servers they will have more population than nost and be unplayable. Those servers will have layering for life, won't they?
---
When we have the raids on farm and alts are being put through.
---
My favorite thing was they announce spell batching and everyones like “YES CLASSIC TEAM IS THE BEST I LOVE THEM THEY ARE GOLDEN GODS” and now the beta has been out and people are playing and now all i see is “SPELL BATCHING IS THE WORST PART OF THE BETA RIGHT NOW. ITS SO HORRIBLE. THEY NEED TO FIX IT” can you people make up your minds.
---
Read the first 4 words of my initial reply. Theres your answer.
---
Everyone? Who sees this shite posed 9 times a day when they'll choose the path of least financial resistance? TBC
---
Mark my words:  Within 6 months this sub will be nothing but memes and fan art
---
&gt;Ran into him much later at Burning Steppes, weeks/months later
---
This is one of the best parts about Vanilla and having a server-community specifically. You *remember* those people, good and bad, which makes a moment like this something that sticks with you forever.
---
He's been the same way for years, way before he was ever streaming. You think it's all an act?
---
He admits to, and looks like, he doesn’t shower for days. Admitting he sometimes just doesn’t brush his teeth and goes days between doing that, too. He also never washes his hair and doesn't bother with a haircut.
---
Wears the same clothes day after day, and admits to buying the cheapest clothes possible at thrift shops, then throwing away his old clothes instead of washing them.
---
Eats like absolute shit. Non-stop snack food and I even saw him smash a moth and lick if off his hand.
---
Lives in a shit-hole with trash all around himself. Jank 10+ year old computer chair, room is dark and dingy. 
---
Says he never checks his bank account, and that he could make a ton more cash if he claimed his own videos on YouTube and/or just made the clips himself. I can't imagine being so lazy that I purposely pass up free money from youtube.
---
If you think it's all an act then you seriously lack braincells. If you're putting on an 'act' for 12 hours a day for years, then sorry buddy that isn't an act anymore.
---
Maybe they are checking here, but I’m sure that’s on the mega thread. Not on individual doomsday posts people make about the same thing over and over.
---
I’ve seen the most pushback on reposts and “bug reports” that are in fact people saying the game is broken and will never be fixed. There will always be outliers being volatile on both ends, and the chill out is mainly for those people.
---
The current layering MUST be changed. This is critical. The best idea I've heard is a stopping it after reaching a certain level (lvl 20 or 30 at most)
---
Yeah I remember failing the quest 2-3 times lol.  
---
It was pretty fucked up too because if you let a soldier die they moaned and disappeared. Kinda fucked with my head when I was younger lol. "NOOOO I LET HIM DIE!"
---
A Troll priest named Fish who helped my mage, Zereth, in Desolace on Thunderlord (NA). We quested together for probably a couple of hours.
---
Just say 'All need' And then need.
---
Oughh.. So if your are correct in the above, even though i'm choosing EU-servers in NA, I won't be able to play my characters in EU when returning home?
---
lolwat
---
&gt;daft pillocks.
---
Ah, I see the problem.  You have terrible taste.  It must be a food thing.
---
I tried;
---
/cast Sinister Strike 
---
on the 2 day beta and it didn't work.  No idea why.  It would cast Blood Fury, but never moved on to SS.  Any advice?  I'd like to use the Riposte cast too, but i'm still undecided on if i'm going to get Riposte.  I know Riposte is fantastic from experience, but this will be my first time on a PVP server and i'm thinking that remove movement impairing effects on Sprint and the lower CD for Sprint and Evasion might be the better choice.
---
Leeway/Hunter deadzone
---
Hey there! We're not alliance, but we are EU PVE - and i think our guild seems to fit your description otherwise.
---
Have a look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c4kraw/looking_for_group_monday_june_24_2019/erx2us0/) if you want, and let me know if you're interested despite us being horde :)
---
He clearly did not.
---
It doesn't matter.  
---
If the raid works and bosses get downed there is loot for everyone.
---
If the raid sucks and loot is scarce then drama follows whatever system you choose.
---
it makes the next heal free. Free spells dont count towarda 5sec regen rule.
---
you do realise that most people don't complain, right? the ones that don't complain just report the bugs in silence without lashing out to reddit. that's why it deems like everyone's complaining.
---
On paper. It still has caused me countless deaths and near-deaths. It really is a problem that's hard to quantify until you experience it
---
I get that those players are a vocal minority, but even the more moderate ones are still going absolutely nuts about layering and refuse to see any other point of view and can't even imagine the need for it, even though there is no want. All I know is that I'll enjoy Classic regardless of layering. I have faith they'll implement limitations that will lead to minimum abuse.
---
Well put.
---
I'm in Europe and intending to play east coast America for language reasons. I figure being ahead of the day is fine being I often play to midnight or 1am, especially on weekends.

Hhhhhh huh hNB BNB h.    Hhj j.h.  Bjjhhjjj. Hj h  b
---
That could be said for 99% of the threads posted in this subreddit.
---
Retail is currently dead, classic won't be dead
---
It would almost definitely be a very bad idea to do that unless your only goal was to get 5 different classes to 60 and geared in blues to play solo.
---
I've always wished that raiding was cross-faction.  WC3 was about all the factions putting aside their differences to fight a greater enemy.  It would have made WPvP a bit more nuanced if the enemy were someone you raid with.
---
He "loves" it more because it's his source of income and pseudo-fame.  If he got more views playing retail or some other game, that what hed be doing.
---
Enchanting/herbs, rolling with with a group of 5 friends and told them I would do enchanting if they help funnel me items to DE. I’ve never done enchanting but since I am going lock I don’t need to save money for a mount like everyone else will. I don’t know if enchanting has much money making potential other than getting those few high level rare enchants, but I have always loved farming herbs and that makes damn good money at higher levels, stacks of dreamfoil, gromsblood, and plague bloom sell for 10-20g each. If at some point I get the tailoring recipe for the BoP robe I guess I’ll have to make the decision to tailor or not. 
---
Is enchanting beneficial while leveling?
---
Fuck do I intensely hate people like you. Such an intensely childish and selfish worldview I really don’t have much else to say to you. 
---
This same conversation has happened for centuries about different new sectors. 
---
Like I said you’re literally using arguments that factory owners used to defend child labor or 60 hour workweeks.

Have you seen this?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNidS5s4UFs
---
Maybe there was a bug on his desk?
---
Yeah true enough, can have 5 bank alts if you want.  I already am a pretty bad pack rat I make myself stop at one bank alt per server =P
---
Cloth is the one thing I feel is really easy to quickly farm.  Take that place in Hillsbrad with Syndicate mobs, all around level 20.  You can clear it out in no time at all and get several stacks of linen and wool in like.. 5 min
---
Mining/engi as I level, I really enjoy having the best gear I can as I level and engineering has a few pieces of gear that are BIS while leveling. When I max engi I'm going to drop mining for herbs and just go farm enough herbs to max alchemy, I know I'd be better off doing herb/mining until 60 but I love having engi and I'm taking my time to level
---
also I'm playing orc shaman.
---
Nah I don’t think so, what relevant info can they get here that they can’t get from the 3 beta discord’s , official forums and the report features?
---
&gt; and saying your hunter that saved up can't get TF (because they shouldn't) is unfair within the system.
---
not if loot priorities are set up before hand, so the hunter/rogue knows he can't hoard for TF because TF is tank priority.

I never took Screenshots when I played back then. Really wish I did. Thanks for posting these.
---
Agreed lets chill out boys, also lets make sure to let our loved ones and friends know they won't be seeing much of us for a while once Classic releases.
---
If there’s anything I’ve learned in gaming devs that are somehow linked to the big triple a studios you have stir shit up to even get a response. So if you want things to be fixed you should not shy away from stirring shit up
---
It isn't.
---
People would rather get to say 'LOL I KILLED THAT GUY IN THE LAST BG LOL!!1' than have smooth queues.
---
Then again. I miss the 4 hour AV queues. /s
---
Wotlk has the best talents and smoothest class gameplay, but introduced shit like DF. TBC the goat because of that.
---
Lmao @ pvp alt
---
I don't think it will make much of a difference to leveling speed - feral levels fast because it has 0 downtime. An extra global every few mobs will not slow down the leveling significantly, I think druid will still be one of the faster classes to level.
---
Heirlooms greatly speed up leveling speed. It's why I chose to not use them in an attempt to try the game as it's designed.
---
As a rogue in Goldshire.....yeah those murlocs wreck face in questing Grey's and maybe a green.
---
Shut your mouth !
---
They can't find any hooks big enough to tether the servers to the Earth.
---
Yes exactly, but I doubt they "dont care" as seems to be the opinion on this sub some times
---
like clockwork you got the idiots blindly defending it because MUH VANILLA PERFECT
---
Precisely.
---
You cast a greater heal and follow it up with the renew. The 5 second rule starts ticking at renew cast point (instead) and not at the end of the GCD (1.5 sec cd). So by starting your rest period with renew you've gained an additional 1.5 sec of non-casting time.
---
Next you activate your inner fire and use that for a big strong heal when needed, this will NOT break your 5 sec rule.
---
Then you close your 5sr window with a greater heal, because you don't break the 5 sec rule until at cast point, so the 2.5 sec windup time of the cast (or whatever it is) is also added to your window. You can even start casting and cancel if it's not needed to stay in the 5sr window.
---
I feel people here have forgotten.
---
Priest gets fucking owned by Rogue, Shaman, Druid, Warlock and Hunter in particular.
---
Anything else is 50:50 if you can pull off some fears and silences. 
---
They're a squishy class. Being in shadow will help a fair bit but doesn't even up the content enough really in my opinion.
---
&gt;Why can't you be ok with the fact someone doesn't want to risk being included in someone's stream, and would like to play privately without the chance of being broadcasted?
---
That's an intereting point actually, but you waive those rights when you sign the EULA for the game. That's why anyone can be in a steam no matter the game - Overwatch, Battlefield, etc.
---
eu servers
---
If the team keeps its word, then it's simple, those servers will lag out. And later people will start complaining and ask for layering cause they're indecisive bitches, at least that's my prediction
---
Word.
---
Yeah, that won't happen. What will happen is segregation.
---
Shill at its finest
---
So basiclly like mages, warlocks, rogues etc...
---
I played on Sargeras, Alliance Mage. Did the grind to Field Marshall
---
The players I remember most were Horde pvp players that were pretty sick:
---
Asylum: undead frost mage. Extremely good player. My idol lol. He was geared up to Warlord I think when I started the grind. Dude would fuck you up.
---
Heatmiza: hand of Rag enhancement shaman. Windfury procs
---
Kitch: shitlord tauren hunter. Good player
---
Is that still happening in the latest build? Seemed okay to me.
---
Well duh that is 100 percent how it works.
---
As a 16 year old guild leader of a raiding guild that always had a 'broken mic', it's a dirty business.
---
At the time my mother also got fed up with my WoW habit and banned me from playing.  She came downstairs one day while we were doing magmadar in MC and I was in the tranq shot rotation.  I turned my monitor off and speakers off and turned my computer chair mostly around to pretend like I wasn't playing on the computer, and slowly spammed the tranq shot button on my keyboard while looking at her in the eyes.
---
After she went back upstairs I turned my monitor back on and distributed loot.  Nobody ever knew.  The hunter afk auto shot thing was real.
---
We'll check that counter again in a month and see where's the pace at
---
Hey there!
---
I can totally understand having work prevent you from being on a reliable raiding schedule. It might be quite tough getting a raid spot.
---
We have a guild that would love to have more folks to play with, for dungeons, questing etc. We also raid - but alas our raids are on WED/FRI/SUN, not monday, so im not sure if you will be able to join us. We would however love to have more social people!

---
Layers have the potential of disrupting the community aspect of the server, disrupting the economy and other player shenanigans (not seeing anyone in a major city while everyone is on other layers).
---
It's pretty major in the context of what makes vanilla great.
---
No shit.
---
30% damage will slow them down significantly at the start when they don't have a lot of gear.
---
It may not have worked because they both incur a global cooldown.  You can do /castsequence Blood Fury, Sinister Strike; however you will probably be getting a lot of error messages and needing to spam that button.  I would suggest getting used to using Blood Fury situationally, it will pay off in the long run I'd think.
---
Sure you can but it was also never going to be implemented that way. I guess I can't say 100%, but it'd be pretty stupid. There's a lot of reasons to test the instantiation of different layers from server load per instance of a layer, load balancing on the server, communication between them, to collapsing them when populations shrink. Weird edge cases are hard to find in testing before it goes to a launch and you have millions playing.
---
Woo! This is great news.
---
But #nochanges amirite
---
On the latest major private server launch dynamic respawn wasn't working in caves correctly and I spent 15 minutes mob tagging my way to level 2 in the shadowglen cave then realised mobs were respawning instantly outside the cave but not inside.
---
Heya!
---
[Come check us out](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c4kraw/looking_for_group_monday_june_24_2019/erx2us0/), we're a guild that plans to raid on a UK evening schedule, and we could definetely use a druid healer. 
---
Let me know if you're interested!
---
Cheers
---
First guild lead was ex military and was used to playing a different game. That style didn't work with the WoW player base. He stepped down and replaced by another guy who was great. Membership fell a little and then skyrocketed. This lasted for 3 years I think...
---
Enter in girl. She wanted to be a class lead but was not good enough to be. Guild lead liked her though. Like, a lot. Decided to step down because he couldn't be fair and impartial. What a guy. I still miss him.
---
New lead comes in. Inherits a mess as chaos grew in the interim while people were in fighting and causing a lead to step away. Manages to calm things down with time. Eventually problematic people left or were kicked, I started to have less time to play and had to leave. Been back for one xpac (relapse), but I really needed to stop. It was all consuming.
---
Can we get TBC without flying mounts, and 20/40 man content vs 10/25?
---
I wish more streamers would make this choice.
---
With a team from which a guy spent two weeks figuring out a way to read old data with a new system, so I'm not sure we're talking about the same people. This team spawned Ragnaros at Northshire abbey during a stress test man.
---
No idea.
---
Man get off Blizzard's dick wow
---
&gt;WoW stopped being good a long time ago. 
---
I agree.  They stopped being good when quality of life changes became more important than gameplay and immersion to Blizzard.  They also had complete blindness or disregard as to the ramifications of changes.  Layering falls in both of those categories.
---
&gt;And queue's again that long or longer for Draenor launch don't impact people's desire to play the game? You are very wrong
---
I am not wrong.  NO ONE said "oh this queue for this game I just bought is long, I better quit".  No one quit from queues. Everyone will play the game they bought, and they know that queues only get shorter as time goes on, so it doesn't effect their desire to play the game.
---
I just don't understand how much paint everyone has to be huffing to suddenly think FUCKING QUEUES were detrimental to WoW at any point, and not Blizzard shitting on the gameplay and immersion with QoL "improvements" LIKE FUCKING LAYERING.
---
NO ONE GIVES A SHIT ABOUT QUEUES IN REALITY.  Either you will play the game because it's good, and sit your ass in the fucking queue, or you won't play the game because you don't enjoy it.
---
There was a girl in my guild that would get all the loot everytime for like 4 weeks straight. Later found out it was because she would trade nude for loot.
---
Go cry on the forums about it.
---
&gt; It is as simple as maintaining a list and checking against that list during login.
---
That right there can cause server lag, depending on how large that list is and how many logins are going on.
---
If not, it will be.
---
I’ll be playing whatever my friends play.  Undead male mage if Horde, human female mage if alliance, cuz casting animations. Would slightly prefer horde but ally is arguably better for raiding, at least early.
---
fact... Which is why I'll be Skinning/tailoring on my mage. AOE farm ftw.
---
&gt; It just doesn't feel responsive at all
---
It wasnt in vanilla, due to the batching and whatnot you had to pre-heal to be effective. Its exactly like it was back then. Private Servers never had this though, so all of their healing and spells never had this 'delay'. But thats not vanilla authentic /shrug
---
Blood fury takes a global in classic
---
&gt; How many times does that rude dps have to die and insult you before he realises you're deliberately letting him die because sticks and stones may break my bones but eat a turd heres a repair bill you smug douche?
---
I love this so much.
---
What exactly is the big deal with the very specific things you've listed? Hundreds of thousands of Americans live just like that, not that I condone eating like shit all the time but its their lives they can do what they want. Probably should just let him live his life no? Do you not like Asmongold? Why do you know all of this and watch his content if you don't like him? I watched his content and find it entertaining/enjoyable but I don't even pay attention as much as you do.
---
\[Alliance\]\[EU\]\[PVP/PVE\]  
---
Two friends looking to join a raiding guild as a rogue and Paladin. Rogue raided in Vanilla WoW up to 4 horseman and Paladin started playing later.  
---
Both committed to performing at a high level and seeing all the raid content. Can raid from 8-12 server time Mon-Fri and will be playing a lot at weekends too. Looking for some fun players who are also good at the game to get those good feelings back.
---
It's debatable how good consecration is in pvp, considering good rogues can avoid it. It's a huge mana drain and in pve it doesn't tick for much. Not every paladin needs longer SoW/SoL it's nice to have, though. I think the reason PoJ is white is because it depends on the build you wanna run, considering it doesn't stack with the speed enchant and you only need it in pvp to close gaps.
---
No, you can.
---
You just have to see it as two different games.
---
- Classic WoW Europe Version: Can be played from any country  but you will have higher ping if you are outside of Europe.
---
- Classic WoW US Version: Can be played from any country but you will have higher ping if you are outside of United States. 
---
So I suggest you choose the EU version. You will have higher ping in US (East coast you will not notice much, if you are West coast you will have some delays when pressing spells). Once you come back to Europe, you do not have to change anything and can keep playing the game. But with a low ping.
---
I'm sorry that you believe that you know better than someone who lives and works in the industry. Have a nice day =)
---
First 4 words: "So basically you're a"
---
I'm so offended. How dare you.
---
At least I can count.
---
Is it really stealing the guild bank if everyone voluntarily left?
---
Try this:
---
/castsequence reset=combat/10 Blood Fury, Sinister Strike
---
This will cast a sequence of Blood Fury into sinister strike and will reset upon leaving combat, or after 10 seconds (thats the number 10 after the /). I don't know the cooldown of Bloodfury, so you could adjust the number to the cooldown of BF.
---
Good luck :)
---
Asmon is cool but a bit of a pompous prick at times.
---
It annoys when he says how easy Classic is when he has an entire army of fanboy weirdos following him, giving him tons of gold, BiS items, potions, grenades and carrying him through red quests.
---
I’m not sure if he knows that’s not how classic is meant to be played.
---
Exactly.  And to think, it is something that would never have happened with layering.
---
This honestly wasn't that uncommon.
---
Coming from someone who is using the word 'Autismo' its 2019 guy probably not okay to use that.
---
Thats right it was sharding not layering they discussed for starter zones
---
Good enough.  That's how i used Riposte back in the day so it shouldn't be too hard to adjust.
---
😂😂
---
Layering will always be the topic of discussion
---
Well, it's not up to me, technically speaking. Played NElf once during vanilla, don't know if I want to go through that again.
---
Very firm downvote. No one is whining, we are trying to make the game the best it can be. If you don't like that then this sub and/or classic isn't for you. Also, how does Blizzard's dick taste? Extra salty?
---
Bookmarked.
---
No... you'll be able to play your characters wherever you want. But you should pick the server that aligns with your long-term timezone.
---
I'm 26. I should be on tonight to attempt RFK!
---
This is amazing.  First grandmother catfish scenario I've heard of.
---
Well I'm sure the community will continue being vigilant looking for discrepancies from original Classic.  The missing blood and skeleton effects for example.  Hopefully re-enabling that setting is an easy fix.
---
And of course there will always be "what should I play", and sharing of hilarious character and guild names and Chuck Norris jokes.
---
I would imagine there will be some bugs still around when it goes live. I don't see how that's such a big issue for people tho. There were tons of bugs in original classic. 
---
Some of the paladin talents just didn't do anything. One of the devs finally admitted they just didn't finish programing them. Then you have the whole 1 shot of a world boss. 
---
I played a bit in the original beta and at the start of classic. If it went live right now, it would be less buggy than originally. If the servers stayed up for a few hours straight its already way ahead.
---
Wasn't leeway in Vanilla though?
---
Yes, I am afraid that is exactly what will happen. I feel it may be beneficial to roll on low pop servers to minimize the affects and lifespan of layering.
---
The lack of official language specific realms. That's what anyone from the EU who wants decent server communities will be discussing.
---
Why is Consecration required for tanking? I'd imagine you're much more efficient (less downtime during a run) if you just pop holy shield+ret aura and hammer away with your SoR. Cons doesn't even tick for that much. Again, good rogues can evade the consecration ticks it's good in theory but not great in practice.
---
Using your numbers, 5 layers for 15k people, then you have on average 80% chance of changing layers on a party invite. Your logic is flawed.
---
Not everyone is able to realize when they’re exploited. Guess I have to live what that.
---
Thank you! Yes, the line art was afterwards (some parts I did a thin wash over.) I used Sakura Micron in sizes: 0.8, 0.2, and 0.05. I like those ones because you can use water once them (after they dry) and they don't bleed.
---
I picked up watercolouring last year in earnest, it's been a lot of fun!
---
It depends on how fast you are leveling, and how badly you want those upgrades. To get any decent upgrade will require a decent amount of effort to grind the specific mats that it requires. Or, you can just run a dungeon and get some decent Blues thay way - whatever is most fun for you, I guess. Gearing out through professions is gonna take some time.
---
Yeah I just want to go back to being hype as heck for the game. If I read another layering complaint / layering fix thread I'm going to go crazy.
---
"Dear family,
---
I'm going away for some time"
---
The RtR was removed part because some streamers misuse the function (Intentionally or not), having their fanbase mass-report players. And part because server reputation matters. It's up to the server to shun and punish players. Not the GMs.
---
Not really.  Depends on the individual battle.  Sure, IF they can separate your group to a bunch of different graveyards you have to spend time regrouping them, but that’s a big if and assumes the other side isn’t getting focused down in the mean time.  Losing one box doesn’t slow your killing that significantly, and there may even be the chance to Rez them if you wipe out the local enemy.  If you’re losing people, chances are you earned the ire of the other team and they’re stomping you 2:1, in which case your whole team is going down and you’ll all rez together anyway.  
---
All kind of moot at this point since follow isn’t coming back in BGs, but that was my experience.
---
Lol, no they weren't.
---
Looking for something specific?
---
For me most of them are just lines from when you interact with NPCs, not specific lines from dungeons or anything. I tend to like "What can I do for you?" that the shady human rogues say.
---
I check the classic countdown every single day just to see if I accidentally time traveled in my sleep. In reality, I know exactly how many days are left without looking.
---
Trump won 2016.
---
&gt; That will take like 5-10 mins if there's a shitload of people around.
---
Quest containers are near instant on Beta. It takes almost no time at all.
---
Not everyone recognizes when they are out of their depth, field of expertise, and talking out of their ass. I'll just have to accept that.
---
Says the guy that has mained a Warrior in Vanilla wow for 10 years.
---
awesome.  Thx man.  BF is a 2 minute CD which is why i figure casting it as much as possible is desirable.
---
We had a crazy dictator as GM. He never did anything during fights. All he did was write instructions in /RW, running around and checking if everyone was doing their part. If all went smooth he would throw a heal or two. 
---
He was so egosentric and strict. It was always his way or the highway. This caused a lot of drama, and eventually he disbanded the guild after we wiped a few times at Nefarian. People were shocked. An office made a new guild and everyone followed. The old GM transferred to another server and was never heard of again.
---
Mathematically ImpSoR isn't worth spending 5 points into it. Divine Strength actually yields more AP and because it's strength, the more you have on the better--additionally it also boosts the amount of damage you can block. Overall I'd take DS over ImpSoR any day.
---
You eventually get so much %hit gear you're not gonna benefit too much from Precision, but it depends in which phase you find yourself in.
---
I doubt it with patch 8.2 going live.
---
Retail is but the sum of a large amount of convenient additions.
---
what?
---
&gt; I dont know which patch, but one patch in classic removed reckoning and enrage being proccable by /sit crits. Therefore it was stated it wont be possible in classics release.
---
That's already in the beta.   What they're doing is standing up just before they get hit, so the game registers that they're both sitting and standing at the same time.
---
Yes. It only saves seconds. Which isn't a lot when you've been searching for people for an hour.
---
Suggest Invite is one of the evils that make retail so extremely dull to play. You click a box and then the leader clicks another box and then you got a group.
---
Instead of suggest inviting, people actually have to communicate, which is a big deal in classic.
---
Best video ever lol.
---
Absolutely ridiculous. I played Boomkin and had far more utility then any other hardcore raid member, and my emphasis was PVP. They would beg me to raid for 3% crit, curse dispell, innervate, and battle rez. More than a fair trade off for slightly worse DPS then a mage.
---
Telling people to join the classic warlock discord and not giving a link, smh...
---
LOL, I was mining in low sec within 15 days of starting eve.  I eventually joined faction war and got a shitload of kills/deaths in, but again only a fraction of the PvP happened that happened in Vanilla wow.  EVEs model made fighting less likely as people would only engage if they perceived they had an overwhelming advantage.
---
The biggest damage difference is at 10-20, at lvl 40 it decreases to around 15%. So I think it will slow down 10-30 noticeably then from 30 onwards is basically like one extra auto attack per mob in cat form. I stil expect druid to be in the top 3 fastest leveling classes despite this.
---
My focus is to improve by good constructive feedback, i will try to take yours into consideration. These videos are focused on quality also, i cutted out alot of things i have being told was annoying for the viewer. Like some people on this sub reddit. It will only continue to improve in the future.
---
I want to show these let's plays on here as longests there still is a support for them. However i will stop posting the stress test ones from classic release. As i know it will otherwise become spammy / irrelevant. Only what is relevant then i will post on here.
---
I hear what you saying tho, i appreciate the feedback.
---
That’s fair. I’m mostly thinking like...mindfulness meditation, I guess. Which I think is Buddhist in origin. What do Daoists consider meditation?
---
Someone never healed Patchwerk in classic. There's a reason why that encounter was pretty darn difficult in classic but would be trivial for modem raid groups on the modern client.
---
Yes, objectively it's inferior to current WoW but much of classic is recreating the bad crappy mechanics as much as it is reverting everything back 13+ years.
---
Looks terrible now. Gimme the current one back
---
Nah, definitely whining. You can accomplish what you're saying without whining, but the majority are just whining and bitching. I'm very thankful for the ones who are trying to make the game better in a non toxic way.
---
Generally your pinky should be resting on the shift key always, but I get that that isn't suitable for everyone. The best I can recommend in that case is getting a gaming mouse with 10+ buttons included on the mouse.
---
Keep it real!
---
Do you have a union? If not, why?
---
Of course man! Here it is: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WpyCgD3G1cSfTRv-C0d5Zw1nJ5ShRNXn/view
---
I think an argument could be made for rushing to Omen of Clarity in the balance tree and then resto from there. That would help you with mana issues if you stand in tauren form and auto attack whenever you're not healing, giving you chance for a free heal, as well as boosting your dps in form quite a bit. 
---
However I want to stress this - I wouldn't recommend any of the druids to use balance spells for damage. One of your greatest strengths as a druid and especially in such a combo is the fact that you can regen mana even while using abilities, given that you are in cat or bear form. You will go oom just from healing. If you start throwing balance spells in the mix, you are not only burning more mana, but also stopping your mana regen further. If you go almost oom but save mana for a cat form, simply jump cat form and start dps'ing properly and your mana will regen back pretty fast. This is where your second druid comes in, to take over the healing till he is oom (except saving enough mana for his cat form) while your original healer is getting back to full mana while proving good cat form dps. On a lot of fights you can keep this up indefinitely, just swapping forth and back allowing one of you to constantly regen mana while damaging in cat, and having the other heal in the meantime. Using the free regen is going to be the strongest part of your combo, making somewhat up for the fact that you lack cc, buffs and utility of other classes.
---
As such, your tank should focus on feral gear and feral tank talents, and the two remaining druids should build somewhat identical, focusing more on healing gear and picking talents with this healer-swap tactic in mind.
---
you're right, it had loads of layering bugs!
---
I am so glad that vent was never a thing here. It was pretty much only Teamspeak back in the day, now probably TS and Discord.
---
Very cool! I was really curious about the gnomes on hippogryphs in orgrimmar
---
Farmed MC more than I can remember and we got exactly 1 TF and one hand of rag.
---
This post is about the general toxicity of people on this sub and beyond. I think streamers like asmond who perpetuate this toxic attitude/trolling/entertaining whatever you call it is the major contributor to the toxicity. People are trying to justify his streams as entertainment.... they might be entertaining but they breed an environment that’s not healthy for the community it’s a new loss in my opinion and that’s what I meant by justification. Justification that the stream is a net positive for this community
---
Man, mana pots made me broke
---
Definitely not better than just bringing another mage.
---
People have become so used to betas being glorified demos, that an actual beta which has people conducting tests and reporting bugs (and said bugs getting fixed on the regular) is being treated as the final product. The sad part is that, even though people should know better by now, it is in the end the fault of companies which have caused this mindset, including Blizzard.
---
I'm sure the bugs that were being discussed yesterday had been fixed on their internal build. Releasing the patch today was probably a reactive move on blizzards part. More communication, specially so close to release, is definitely needed on their part.
---
Well basically. The french almost never talk english, germans are better at english, but I would still estimate that atleast 50% of FR and GER players can't speak english.
---
And that said, almost no native english speakers speak FR/GER.
---
I just think this will add segregation between the playerbases.
---
No. 
---
The way you get rated in Vanilla is by asserting ur dominance via wpvp and stomping people in premade bg groups while clearing raids every week with the fattest gear.
---
When I was on the stress test the map was not like the old map, right clicking a zone to zoom out your mouse has to be perfectly still and you can move normally while map is open. though maybe I'm misremembering or something since it's been a long time
---
Not sure why this guy is being downvoted. 
---
Joana has said on stream that he thinks mages that aoe are faster than hunters.
---
Alright. I also think the faster queue times in BGs sound much more interesting than seeing familiar faces, so I was wondering if there was more to it.
---
Been practicing on the newest " fresh server" and first time i am using joanas guide for the first time to see what its like (done a couple 60s just using db vanilla and my own pathing).  Im happy with the progress i made in the first 24hours but the few people that got ahead of me just seemed to steamroll 1-10 about double my speed and i felt like i was one of the first to leaving the starting zone.  Any tips for the first 10 levels?  Night elf hunter btw
---
I use riposte for leveling and early PvP.  I generally go up the combat tree until Riposte and reduced CD on sprint (for getting around).  At that point, if I'm seeing a lot of PvP from much higher levels after me, I put 10 points into Sub for MoD and Camo.  If I don't get ganked alot, I just run up the combat tree for more damage (hit, imp sprint, offhand, bf, sword spec, etc). After AR I go Assass if I was full combat or sub to imp sap if I had to go sub earlier.  
---
At 60 I would probably respec. Lots of people handle things differently.  Combat tree generally gives the best leveling, but everyone has different approaches to handling the PvP dangers they are up against. 
---
 There are many many ways to do it.
---
Doing the poison quest at 20 when the server starts or just leveling lockpick
---
I mean sure, his stream persona isn't completely manufactured. It certainly came from a place of reality. That doesn't mean he isn't bullshitting/trolling 80% of the time. He and the McConnell guy will literally plan out arguments in advance for content.
---
They used some sort of flight-path bug, they weren't hostile so we couldn't attack them (as if they were still on a flight-path). I still don't know how they did it!
---
Yikes, feel free to host a parade for every bug that gets fixed since you feel so adamant to white-knight Blizzard when they get criticized.
---
Activate your *inner focus
---
Wow!! Thx a lot that I'll make sure to get this talent asap that's a hidden treasure!! Do you have others general tips? I know for one that treat aggro is real with a priest Jesus. I'm tempted to get those 5 pts into treat reduction on holy spells...
---
Right, I forgot how massively tall the terrain gets on that southern border of felwood
---
Swiftness pots.
---
And how would that change with rated pvp? Didnt say it had to drop the best gear in the game but having a way for rated rbg groups to climb the ladder would be cool imo.
---
We actually started doing that too.   They got tier set items whether they were upgrades or not though.  lol
---
Almost none of those are useful in pve. At best you can use it on trash
---
Blizzard plans to screw over european realms hard.
---
This is a stats comparison of two posts on the official forums.. For what ever that is worth.
---
I really want to say yes but it’s difficult. You should be able to make a bit of gold early days selling wands and mage oil. The early enchants are minor but will be nice for your buddies especially if they’re funneling gear for d/e. 
---
Not taking tailor alongside enchant at early levels is a mistake imo. You can benefit from the crafted gear and d/e or sell the rest.
---
For skill level 100+ leatherworking what you will probably find is that there is going to be certain items you can craft which will vendor for more than what the total amount of materials cost in the AH( lots of players having skinning and flooding the AH driving down prices). So just buying all the mats, crafting the item and vendoring it you can make some silvers for each item. If you have the energy for it you should be able to make gold doing this. It's time however which you are logged in but not playing so it's a question if it's worth it. Up to you.
---
&gt; It's not an exploit
---
You guys are fucking loopy.  ROFL!
---
Travel forms are a good one! 
---
How do you manage between prowl vs dash, for instance? A modifier? I'd like to keep like alt+1234QER for healing spells, and use unmodified 1 for root/bash/something, 2 for moonfire/maul/claw, 3 for insect swarm/swipe/rake, etc. etc.
---
That I agree on, communication is key, and there's a silence now that can only hurt the hype... Agreeing with you on the glorified demo particularly, very true
---
Maybe the panic is a little excessive but in all honesty we’ve been hurt before by blizzard wow devs. 
---
Historically when a blizzard game or patch is only a few months away, what you see is what you get, without exception. I trust that wow devs want to fix everything and do it right, but I don’t always have confidence that management will give them the time and resources to do it properly.
---
Looks like some of those humans could see him for a second, but I guess that is to be expected with their racially superior stealth detection.
---
&gt; Give us the keyring! 
---
(laughs in rogue)
---
"Where is Mankrik's wife?"
---
Jesus. You could at least call him Hitler first. Hasn't your social justice curriculum taught you anything!?
---
I don't like Asmongold at all and think he's an immature jackass that attracts the worst type of Twitch viewers... but he's been streaming WoW for years, and for most of that time he didn't have many viewers. It was only recently that he blew up, because the edgelords on r/livestreamfail started posting his clips. He was streaming WoW for a long time before that though.
---
Once again, joana has literally stated on his stream that his record won’t hold and that he will likely be able to beat his original record, at least that’s his goal. He also doesn’t believe he will her world first 60 in classic as he will be sleeping every night, whereas some people will stay awake for several days on end.
---
Ya they will be fairly good at leveling still. Although clearly slower than on PS. There's other strange info coming out of the beta. Spells scale with your characters level. Or the skill you get for each spell school, which scales with your level. 
---
No private servers implemented that. I can't find any info about it actually being a classic thing either. I don't see why they would put so many ranks of spells in the game, then scale them with level. So other classes will level faster than we expect them to. I will admit the difference is rather small, but if you take 5-30% from one thing and add 1-5% to others, it could add up.
---
I'm glad you agree.  It then follows that your original comment is entirely unnecessary.  It's akin to posting 'haha this was funny' in the comments for a meme.
---
Wouldn't that macro just try to cast Blood Fury after Sinister Strike goes off the first time and then hang up because Blood Fury isn't off of CD?
---
Once you’re inside a raid, none of that utility carries over with the exception of kick.
---
I totally forgot about this one. I only remembered the one where they first show a netherdrake flying, I think it crushes or eats a gnome, and then there's a drunken dwarf... Frothbeard?
---
Plus it wouldn't even work. People would prefer to play with other Germans/Spanish etc and the realm would split into several seperate communities. This is obviously bad for the social aspect of classic wow.
---
It's also possible that people will discuss on the forums which realms will be the unofficial French/German etc servers. The bad part about that is that not everyone would know about these deals and they'd eventually come to a rough realization. They could either suck it up and keep playing, or start over elsewhere.
---
But we can avoid that unnecessary crap if blizz gives us language realms. I have hope that they will. It would make sense and I think everyone in EU is in agreement on this.
---
I would trade a toe for classic beta :(
---
This is well known by now. Simply rebooting the old client is basically impossible. Their only option was the rebuild it for their newest systems. Instead - they built an interface that interprets the old client into terms that the newer systems understand.
---
ahhh i see.  is it really a huge deal though?  even games like dota just have EU west and EU east.  if you were a Spanish WoW player you'd join a Spanish guild and speak English the rest of the time if you need to surely?
---
I do not. The reason that I do not is because I work in safe conditions, and am compensated according to my value. Therefore, I do not need to pay union dues or the like in order to ensure that my job is satisfactory. When my job goes poorly it is not because of my "greedy boss" it is because unforseen circumstances or my own abilities have limited my production.
---
If you leveled in TBC, leveling in classic will be very similar. The main difference in 2.0 would be the ability and talent revamp.
---
Heeeey, how ya doin'?
---
In high school, a classmate of mine I didn't really like kept boasting around how popular he was on his server and guild.
---
A friend of mine and I managed to get his credentials and login out of curiosity on this character. Just to find out in about 10 minutes, by all the whispers received, that he was pretending to be a girl to all his guildmates in order to call in favors.
---
We revealed him and logged off.
---
I don't know if that's a thing, but your screenshots look very much alive haha. Great ones!
---
we had a husband and wife combo (druid and priest respectively) who were bedrock members of the guild.  Both super nice.  The wife was quite flirty (well as flirtatious as you could be in Ventrillo anyway).  Turns out she was secretly, then not so secretly hooking up with a Paladin in our guild.  I don't even know how something like this happens, but needless to say it was incredibly awkward for everyone involved.  
---
The H&amp;W were officers and highly valued members of the team.  The Pally came later on.  As i recall wife and her paramour were eventually booted.
---
Imp sprint is primarily pvp focused. It has some uses in Pve, but the lions share is for chasing down frost-shock spamming shamans or frost mages. You won’t see much specific benefit of this while leveling, but it will be neat in those niche circumstances (I don’t know if in classic it will remove mob-induced daze, I don’t believe it did in vanilla) 
---
Endurance is better for leveling than imp sprint. Using your CDs more often is especially helpful for soloing, and pre-mount does help with travel much more than you may realize. 
---
Riposte is pretty great, I wouldn’t level without it. Even for world pvp, it can make the difference and provide an edge in a fight vs a war/rogue/pal. For pve leveling, it helps against all the weapon wielders, which again can be significant.
---
He's the prime example actually. Support or hate him, you get vitriol thrown your way.
---
Isn't that the very definition of rolling greed, though?
---
* You want to use it: Need
---
* You want to sell it: Greed
---
Why does the fact it's BOE change anything?
---
I agree. A ladder league wouldn't hurt anything about Classic.
---
I’ve done the AOE pally thing, only til the mid 40’s. I felt that holy shield was way more efficient than using consecration was. I would try to focus on humanoids, if they ran that was all the better and I used the Shatterer I think it was called, had a chance to disarm on hit. Any way pull like 6-8 mobs and swap between the mana and health regen seals depending on which was getting low and between ret aura blessing of sanctuary holy shield shield spike and dragon breath chili I would just let the reflect damage wear them all down. When I tried doing the same with consecration I found I went oom more often and died more, but would also sometimes kill things faster. With the holy shield spec I pretty much never died but the pace was slower, but I like that for pally farming so I didn’t mind.
---
While you arent wrong when it comes to speed leveling, if you get a jump ahead in the first 1-20 at that points its basically a dead server and you can quest and farm without competition.  It's why the first 10hours is the most important.  Once your. Beind your leveling time will continue to fall, but once you are ahead it just starts scaling out of control because no one is nearby.
---
European Union: unite European countries for a sense of collectivism and progress
---
Europeans: fuck that; I don't want to deal with those dirty French/Germans/Portuguese/Greeks/Romainians/{whatever other language people are complaining about}!
---
He refers to Blizzards bluepost, announcing that there will be no language-seperated servers for EU, just english/whatever servers, which is something most of the EU players dislike very much, since they were used to playing on german / french / english (spanish?) servers back in retail-classic.
---
Especially the RP-part will suffer a lot from this decision.
---
Like them or not, the Alliance and Horde faction divide I believe helped contribute significantly to WoW's popularity. Faction pride was something that players brought way beyond the game, for better or for worse.
---
&gt; a casual warrior will be last (even below hybrids).
---
Lies
---
yup. most class in vanilla can be dumbed down to 3 button or less in a raiding environment.
---
Did they fix griffons to be like vanilla instead of the robotic mess in retail yet?
---
Damn i can't count, you're right. But you'll always be a noob with that attitude.
---
I can finally go back to my previous topic : Druid or Shaman ?
---
Hey I plan on rolling a Troll mage. Heavy PvP focus sounds great, I would like to knock raids out though for that juicy gear. Tailoring/engineering end game profs. Haven’t played since 2014 so I have to get back into the swing of things for a bit, looking forward to classic. EST pretty good availability.
---
Honestly the "what class should I play" threads are more annoying than the complaint threads. It just shows that they completely ignored the weekly megathread about it.
---
I’m doing this pretty much also rolling Warrior main. Will drop skinning at max for BS instead of engineering. Will pick up engineering for mining when I get my Druid to max who will be my herb/miner. 
---
So my warrior late game will be BS/Engineer with a Druid alt for Mining/Herbalism. I have plans for the rest but don’t plan on really alting till Naxx. Going to level the Druid strictly for a farm toon.
---
its sad that the best response is often at the bottom in this sub
---
Amazing. I've got 2 friends going mage this expac so I cannot wait to try some dungeon farming shenanigans
---
Cause Blizzard is an american company who year 2019 doesnt understand the concept that Europe isnt linear its totally different countries and cultures. Scandinavians and nordic countries speak fluent English and share most values etc. doesnt work to mix them with french and spanish cause they will gate the server with their own language. Italians might not speak the best English overall but since they are a minority they adapt anyway. France and Spain is too big for not having their own servers. Just make spanish french and possibly german servers ffs.
---
&gt;delay in information transfers. 
---
Okay but again, looting has a delay in BfA. It's not spell batching.
---
Looting is instant on private servers because the architecture is completely different. On retail there's clearly much more processing going on, likely for logging and maybe even botting heuristics
---
I am currently leveling a rogue on a pserver and went with riposte and it has definitely saved my ass many times. A few things to consider is it only costs 10 energy, its off the GCD so you can use it immediately, you disarm mobs for a few seconds reducing the damage you're taking overall, and it does pretty decent damage.  On top of all that, it just adds another move to your bar which is honestly pretty bland for leveling as a combat rogue as you're just sinister striking most of yhe time. Its also worth noting that I was able to sneak improved sprint into my build also while having riposte, so really you would only be sacrificing endurance.
---
Wow vanilla plays between 2 big events. The battle of mount hyjal (wc3) and the reopening of the dark portal (tbc). It‘s more like a „cold war“ in this time with many regional conflicts and some threaths like ragnaros and naxxramas.
---
That’s just it too. I feel like, at least in Reddit, there’s much more hate. Everyone seems to think majority should govern the whole country even though a few select cities hold the majority of the population. Nothing wrong with how it is now.
---
Seems like you're the exception then.
---
Reminds me of asmongold telling his chat that if the tank is taking too long he will pull the next pack. What's missing from that convo is McConnell telling him "you DO realize that when you do that the healer is whispering the tank asking him if he should let the guy die?"
---
Because 1) it's true and 2) McConnell is often the voice of reason to asmon's terrible ideas

Ohh yah?  That's awesome.  I was on a certain realm that shall not be named recently, and it was bad.  You couldn't get to the 1st two boxes, because there were constant troll respawns.  Like maybe 5 seconds after you killed it.   You basically had to wait for someone to aggro them, then steal it and run away.
---
   Then the last one literally had a circle of 10 people standing around where the box spawned.
---
Yes. The macro would be a terrible idea.

I would be so fucking angry if a non Alchemist would roll need on the recipe, although I am Alchemist. Same goes for epic BoE, if somebody actually needs it, then he/she should have it.
---
&gt;Druid alt for Mining/Herbalism. 
---
I hope you remember that you can;t track both in classic. So while you can gather both, you can have either Herb tracking on minimap or the ore tracking, not both at same time.
---
LOL, this sub has become the classic barrens chat. Honestly its pretty much a circle-jerk holier-than-retail spasm or a complaint riddled neckbeard whine party.
---
It is. This and tanking.
---
Mana management (spell ranks usage), anticipation (pre-heal)... I also remember that PvE became boring once you were over geared though.
---
Sorry I should have clarified, as the poster above mentioned treat it as two separate games. Let's say you make an NA account in NA. You get your character to 60 raid etc then go back to Europe. You can still play with your level 60 on the NA servers albeit with higher ping. You cant however log onto an EU server to find your level 60 there waiting for you as it's a different game pretty much.

skull of impending doom nor Nifty stopwatch should drop the wsg flag.  i mean how you even gonna get out of flag room without skull :D  
---
blizzard, Cmonbruh, its like you got zero clue how vanilla was, and just hoping everything is right.
---
I was gonna take tailoring but a friend is and I figured herbs would be better than two tailors. He is gonna send me greens from leveling his tailoring and make bags and what not for the group. Not sure if there are any low level BoP from tailoring I’ll miss out on
---
What are layers? Is that like sharing with a new name?
---
I’ve personally met someone who never played modern wow but played through nostalrius up until gates opening , said there was nothing like it at all, is now super pumped for classic.  If one then probably many
---
&gt; That being said having no hardcoded factions doesn't automatically mean there are no factions. Guilds and communities create factions and alliances on their own.
---
Yeah and those have the exact problems I described. In a game with no factions (ie. free-for-all PvP), you will basically never invite a stranger into your group to do quests or dungeons with, because odds are they'll just kill you. This *might* be less of a problem if there's next to no reward for PvP, but for many people griefing is its own reward.
---
I wouldn't say hard-coding the factions was the *best* thing they did out of all the things, but it's up there. At the time factions were a fairly foreign concept.
---
It'll be particularly bad this time around with the advent of streamers.  Who in their right mind would roll Horde on Asmongold's server, for example?
---
Max, max and max. I’m here for the great gameplay, not the trash graphics!
---
You stop playing once you have the buff to preserve it until raid time. It's naive to assume people aren't going to do this when private servers have clearly illustrated the issues with world buffs for all types of raiding guilds. That's why this argument exists; contrary to what many believe it is not complaining for the sake of complaining.
---
The argument against them is pretty well laid out here: https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/06/19/episode-109-the-making-of-molten-core-the-games-battling-classic-for-your-attention-an-e3-breakdown-world-buffs-stream-sniping-part-two/ . Additionally, Kevin Jordan has acknowledged allowing them to stack was a mistake: 
---
"Were world buffs designed to be used all at once? Yes, though we discovered that was kind of.. kind of a mistake. It was just too much, you know. People can't turn down even the slightest advantage when it comes to progressing through difficult content so it established this feeling that you had to have all the buffs before you could even start, and collecting all the buffs was just too much. It was too much work."
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/440538861?t=0h21m12s
---
Finally, the buffs were changed to not work at all on players over level 63 in [patch 2.1](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.1.0). There's disagreement on how extensively they were used in vanilla, but this clearly shows Blizzard did not intend for them to be used for progression in Burning Crusade and beyond.
---
If you don't want them changed for the sake of #nochanges that's fine, but I have no interest in carrying on a discussion about it if you don't acknowledge the reality of the type of gameplay they create.
---
We know. Change takes time. Be patient. There is two months to go.
---
Good analogy, because the way european union id currently done is really bad for lot of people. Internationnal servers would be the same. You can't just force people to be happy together, you have to wait enougth bonding exist before, or you'll make people angry at eachother.
---
You realize OP was talking about playing on his own solo server right? Jesus, you're dense.
---
The only difference is the name of the spell, not the function. It gives good players more room to manipulate the use of their mana, which is far more engaging than having singular abilities.
---
I tend to agree with both of you.  
---
I know that its wise to get Blade Flurry and Adrenaline Rush ASAP, but one thing that has always made me wonder about Rogue guides is why people don't take Malice right off the bat.  5% crit is insane when you think about just how much it would be valued as an item stat.  
---
I've seen people suggest Remorseless Attacks for leveling which makes a ton of sense too.  But why not Malice?  I mean, yeah it will suck to be 5 levels behind on BF and AR, but isn't 5% crit worth it?
---
Ahahahah what do think went through her mind? You know she absolutely knew you were playing, right? That's hilarious. Way to think fast and do your duty.
---
&gt; Earth vs Mars
---
Maybe a little off topic, but have you seen (or read) The Expanse? Might be something you enjoy.
---
Swifty’s rank 14 attempt in phase 2 world pvp will probably be pretty cool
---
Do I spy a Wizzy (g) had on that human on the left?
---
Alliance being lame ... NOT FIXED

Im confident, i trust blizzard enough
---
TLDR  On failed guild merger, player swaps guilds and shows disloyalty.  Guild merger succeeds after all, upon the condition of the disloyal player getting fucked.  
---
Was in the top pvp guild for horde.  It was made up rerolled characters from a different server that had mostly rejected big raiding guilds early in the game.  I was only officer recruited in wow, but the rest of their core were originally a semi-pro wc3 clan.
---
Of course we got bored of pvp after people hit their target ranks, and started to toy with pve, but we only had about 20 people on during the same day, I think this was the ZG patch so after doing ZG we wanted to go back and do the 40 mans we had missed.  
---
We started talking to the then #3 pve guild on horde, and started some limited trials at raiding together, but it became clear that if were going to do more then alt runs together it required more of a merger.  Numbers wise it somehow worked out well, but 3 of our 6 officers in the pvp guild were dead set against it based on not wanting to dilute or fracture the group that had been together for 3-4 years at that point.  There were 6 or so members that clearly full on rejected the idea of raiding whatsoever and wanted us to focus on pvp still.  
---
We had previously committed to only doing pve, if we could get everyone in and get basically every officer to agree.  So it was looking bad.  Wake up one morning and our by no means best players had quit the guild, blasted some people in messages about how he was better then everyone else, and had jumped ship to this new guild.  
---
We were upset both with him and the GM of this pve guild for the betrayal, but turns out warrior had lied about the circumstances of him swapping over so the GM was going to gkick him as he didn't want to gear someone so disloyal.  This was enough to convince the remaining officers and we decided to guild merger, but instead of gkicking him, the condition was that loyalty was considered preeminent in the loot council.  AKA we let him raid for 3 months without giving him a single piece of good gear as a fuck you.  He eventually caught on and tried to jump to a different guild in AQ, but was rejected for lack of gear.  Raided with some shitters for awhile, but then quit.
---
Ok and you don’t understand that this is a lucky position and not even close to the norm?
---
Awesome, beautiful nostalgia here. will you be diving into wow classic at all?
---
I had a cleric that I rolled with him that was Obamasmama
---
Dwarves - "HEEY DARE"
---
We’re gonna y’all about all the fond memories we have of vanilla and how we look to re-create those memories in some way in classic.
---
You got retail for that.  
---
There have been a very dedicated group of players advocating for official vanilla servers for a decade. I understand that layering and some other aspects are not very vanilla-like. But can we just slow down on any additional classic WoW+ ideas for no other reason other than to respect the fact we might not be on the verge of official vanilla servers if not for their efforts and dedication?
---
They are patching a lot on beta.
---
Mark kern is the crazy bigot
---
But why would someone play a private 1.13 over the real thing?
---
Samesies. It seems like a lot of people have no faith in Blizzard. It sucks. I know they'll pull through. I think they know what this means to us.
---
Fishing. You don’t even need other professions. Survive off the land!
---
Yes thats it!
---
Rank 10+ should be inaccessible to most people. 
---
I would like BGs to balance more in favour of premade v premade which I believe they do, it just doesn't work very well on private servers.
---
MT I'm my guild was there every raid without fail, brought loads of mats for myself and others that I knew didn't have as much time to play as I did. We got a new tank 1 day as a "back up off tank" we spent a few raids gearing them up ready to be OT when needed
---
 Them suddenly it was announced that they were replacing me. Despite the fact k had better gear, more experience and helped coach every tank we had. Next raid I was not even invited as an OT so I gquit and found a new guild within the hour. Over the next week 90% of the guild had quit and joined my new one. I never really raided in any serious manner after that as k never wanted to get burned again
---
Almost every major leak (be it movie, TV, or game) comes from 4chan
---
Racials ofc.
---
I think it was added recently. I'm not sure if it was in vanilla. Either way it's not a healthy mechanic to have.
---
Purified, distilled essence of pain , suffering and loss.
---
Better to be wrong about making too few realms than it is to be wrong about making too many realms, no matter how many people you piss off 10 weeks before launch that are still going to subscribe anyway.
---
Fix the melee leeway or the game is still broken as fuck
---
https://i.imgur.com/6kGliTj.jpg
---
Still don't see how how some stop playing their character affects you?
---
Basically it sounds like you don't want to go through all the effort that the super try hards are willing to do, so you want it banned so no one can do something your not willing to.
---
Maybe maybe not, i don't rly know or care.
---
Doesn't seem fair that 1 guy gets all the money that a guild collected, just because people didn't like him.
---
It's not, both the top and last dps spot in the guild i was in are usually occupied by warriors (excluding tank off course), and we have a ret, an oomkin, a shadow priest, and multiple feral.
---
You're right, as Armkron covered.
---
Just keeping it short and sweet for the synopsis.
---
Pretty sure it was fixed in a matter of hours of him posting his evidence. 
---
Just not sure if it was a coincidence or a dev saw the post and realized it was a quick fix. Probably just a coincidence it was fixed shortly after he posted about it.
---
Found one! Get the bats bois!
---
Whoa, I'm not stopping him from living his life. I watch his stream all the time now and find him incredibly entertaining.
---
I'm just pointing out his life isn't an act, and that he pretty clearly has mental problem, but good on him for turning it into something entertaining.
---
 Lol, another "chasing butterflies" post. Blizz didnt have a good game in years and all we can see is shit, beta is in awful state and is so far away from original game it makes even worst private servers look good.
---
 Blizzard fixes few bugs and people start making positivity threads again lol, i mean ye they are actually doing something, at the pace of a turtle, i dont think anyone doubts that there are atleast some work being done with the game, but 2 months is nothing for a broken mmo. 
---
 People that are making threads like this gonna look real stupid in just over few months and will go to "they will fix it after launch" mode. 
---
 What if only there was a previous release by blizzard that followed exact pattern....
---
I hope they do things like that too, but I worry if they include them, the gear will basically be mandatory for those specs, and then what about upgrades? It’s the same problem as a level 40 helm being BiS for cats.
---
&gt; A Blue Post that is based on logic and understanding of EU social and language aspects...and not on cost cutting. 
---
the fucking irony in this statement
---
I'm positive that once there is nothing left to bitch about, players will complain about the Battle.net overlay since it wasn't part of Vanilla.
---
"They do fine in mediocre gear"  They don't.
---
How about they fix the leeway?
---
Yup, true... But hey that's why we gotta chill and wait what comes, while still reporting what's not intended
---
Because I could sell it and make my mount money off of one item, and I Need a mount.
---
To me need and greed has more to do with your spec.
---
If I'm a dps warrior and a nice bop shield drops, the tank needs it but I only greed it.
---
Boe drops are different because they are Money. Everybody needs money.
---
It is an exploit sitting forcing a proc was fixed in 1.10. Maybe it was working after that if you timed it right, but it was directly fixed in 1.10. So should definitely be considered an exploit regardless of timing it properly or not.
---
each layer is its own server. warsong 15 is layer 15. so all the "complications and issues" are bullshit.  
---
"4 dead servers" that's what the layering crowd wants though, they want to join a dead server do their quests then be in a full server when layering gets removed.   
---
all layering does is delay the inevitable(queue times) it just pushes them to when they matter (raid times), while fucking up core parts of the game, econ, professions, leveling in a mmo (all layers are dead, all shards are dead on retail, all layers were dead in the test), world pvp, even just grinding mobs having them phase and fuck you over because some guy in fuckin loch modan invited someone to your layer so you got shoved.
---
Consecration is a good way to get aggro and hold it. Also you might not always have 31 points in prot if you plan on tanking something. 
---
Evading Consecration ticks is far from easy and not guaranteed.
---
Most leaks (be it TV, movies, or games) come from 4chan. It is a source.
---
I am in the same boat. planning on playing warrior on launch and going for tanking asap.
---
Sure, but that community( and I have been part of it) should stop being so hyper defensive and realise that not all change is bad. As I said, release and through to naxx should stay as is but it should be possible to talk about what happens next without you pulling out the shieldwall and shoot every idea down.
---
Hopefully there will be a raider.io type site for bg rankings
---
I cleared everything except Naxx in vanilla, so yes I have. Were you even alive during vanilla?
---
I mean, it's not great, but they've already said that it will be gone by phase 2. I'm sure Blizz knows that anything longer than that will cause one hell of a shitstorm.
---
You want every detail to be exactly like vanilla? I'm just as excited as anyone for Classic but I can't get on board with that. Why wouldn't you want updated graphics or spec viability?
---
Location of servers, small changes, no subscription, ect. Ect.
---
BUT WHAT COMES AFTER NAXX?!?!?
---
Can someone explain to me what the significance of removing right click to report and suggest invite? Also what is suggest invite lol
---
You'll need Leatherworking, Tailoring, Enchanting, at a minimum.
---
Leatherworking because everyone's wearing leather. It'll be super useful.
---
Tailoring to make bags, lots and lots of bags. Druids run out of bag space all the time. Plus Tailoring lets you craft decent healing gear, as cloth is just fine for healing, and in many cases, the cloth healing item will be easier to make than the equivalent leather one.
---
Enchanting should be taken by your druid tank, specifically for the armor trinket, Smoking Heart of the Mountain, as it's one of those BOP profession crafted items.
---
Not all criticism is negativity. Criticism can create positive results. Don’t take someone criticizing a corporation personally.
---
Sure, rbg rewards could stop at the blue pvp sets and be for prestige mostly
---
Not in this extent at least
---
There are addons which remember where nodes are that you have hit, i generally just run loops in those places around the maps and the tracking becomes obsolete
---
Should have spent your DKP for the next item that dropped and /gquited after that instead ;-)
---
Not my guild, but a druid took the Eye of Sulfuras on Tichondrius and, well you can hear the fallout here:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvMK5KkLlZc
---
THEY TURKERJERBS!
---
What was the problem with strafing?
---
didn't you guys know  
---
reddit is full of managerial economists and understand business administration of multimedia companies because they've played many video games in the past
---
that's pretty neat!
---
It's kinda must have while leveling and a situational talent at 60.
---
Nelf asses
---
Yeah dude its disgusting and sad. He's like the pinnacle of what I always imagined the WoW stereotype player as. Total loser
---
I had been in this guild since before they could down a boss in ZG, by the time I left (which i'll get into here in a bit) we were on Rag and had ZG on farm. 
---
Anyway, this all started sometime in late Summer of 06. Our guild had been growing and attracting new members because we were making good progress raid wise but were still low enough that people didn't find us "intimidating". Due to how long we had been raiding some of our members who had been there a while had most if not all of the gear they wanted on their mains, so one of them started to bring their rogue alt. 
---
We had a new rogue (main) join a few days back and come to MC with us, but because he was new and the other guy had been with us for a while the new rogue couldn't afford any of the drops because they didn't have any DKP. I took issue with this and brought it up to several officers and the guild leader. I told them how this was a bad idea not only because it's inherently unfair, but because this has the potential to hurt the guild in the long run if gear is hoarded by one player as opposed to being distributed to people's mains. I was told "we'll take it under advisement" and it was dropped, until the next piece of gear dropped. 
---
The officers and I had gone back and forth a few days after that and things had only gotten worse, tension wise and finally i was told that basically nothing was going to be done about it, so I told them that if one more piece of gear was given to the persons alt I was leaving the guild. 
---
The final night of me being in the guild we raided Ony, knowing that I was leaving the guild I passed on the Bloodfang helm and we went to MC. I forget which boss it was, but a piece of Nightslayer armor dropped and was given to the alt instead of the main. Right when I saw the message I /gquit and hearthed. 
---
I got messages immediately and over the next few days asking what happened and all that. I explained what/why and all that and most people agreed with me but didn't want to find a new guild and all that. I did though, and went from a guild not being able to down rag to a guild that was up to Princess H in AQ40, and needless to say I got geared w/ them, fast, much to the chagrin of the rogue officer from my other guild who blocked me after he whispered that he got the Bloodfang helm and 2 pieces of other gear just for me to link him my BWL and AQ40 loot. 
---
"Good" times, but I don't think I'll be joining a guild that uses DKP when classic comes out.
---
Main hunter will be skinning/leather for devilsaur set and fire cloaks.
---
After leather stops being useful for me I'm switching to mining/engineering for ammo, nades, and jumper cables mostly.
---
Alt will mine enough to power smelt my main a bit.
---
It'll be busy for the first week, but I expect it'll drop off and then gradually gain in popularity over the next few months as more people start playing the game. Not to mention, not everyone wants to play on day one. A lot of people are more casual about it and don't mind starting in late September.
---
Thank you so much for jumping in to protect their fragile feelings.
---
I can test it when I get home.
---
Obvious dude... "REEEEE FUCK STREAMERS THEY'RE GONNA RUIN OUR EXPERIENCE !!!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
guess I never noticed
---
Ummm...what? Care to explain this?
---
it's honestly a better alternative to sharding. i play retail and its completely dead on a full server, i played the test it was completely dead despite /who saying there were tonnes of people.   
---
there are far better single player games than wow. there are no better mmo's than vanilla. why diminish the thing it was best at?
---
Same. I have a few but they are on my old computer I haven't turned on in 10 years lol...
---
RemindMe! 6 hours
---
Assuming you can speak English.
---
 Stop being toxic, seriously this community is the worst, cant you just be positive and have good vibes? They literally just now fixed like 5 bugs, can we have a POGGERS in the chat ? Rather than pointing out stupid lies like bugs lets just all focus on positivity and make appreciation threads for great Blizzard employees that are giving us classic out of their kindness and goodwill.
---
Im soon lvl 20 and it's by far playable. Delay on let is quite annoying but it's still playable.
---
Fix that and the rest are just small issues you won't notice.
---
Quick question:
---
Lots of shadow leveling guides (just watched one of Kala’s vids) fairly automatically get 2/2 imp SW:P right after spirit tap for leveling builds. 
---
Does imp sw:p also increase the damage done over the duration? If not, it seems counterintuitive to slow down the damage done by that spell when dots are already questionable while leveling because mobs often die before the full duration.
---
I know the other options at that tier aren’t super exciting, but blackout or shadow affinity would at least be a small positive change instead of potentially a negative one if imp sw:p doesn’t up dog.
---
You can never catch the dragon, Dad!!
---
Just wait for 27 I guess?
---
Looking for something shpecial??
---
Was in a raiding community that ran ZG and the like. Raid Leader/Master Looter ninja'd the raptor mount off Mandokir for his girlfriend (a mage in our raid) because she did not have an epic mount yet. It pretty much imploded right after that happened from what I remember. \^\^
---
Adapt or die, easy.
---
right? it could get really interesting.
---
there's a lot of comments like "dont you have anything better to do than harrass streamers all day?" well duh.  its not like i'm going to stream snipe 24/7 (if i even do it at all) im just saying its a new option for world pvp escalation.
---
there's already guilds focused on world pvp, people already get raid groups together to harass the other faction, assault quest hubs, block off zone entrances, etc.  this is just... one more option. 
---
if large-scale world pvp is a group's goal, and they KNOW that "player x" has the ability to very quickly call in a potentially huge group of players for a battle, it would absolutely be a considered option.
---
People think blizzard is a company with only 20 employees  working on ALL of their games at once.
---
My two cents is just that if you are geared you bring both healing, dispel, CC (repentence is good!) and lethal burst - which holy paladins kind of lack outside of trinket buffed holy shocks and judgement.
---
The sentiment i hear a lot is that ret is pointless, which I disagree with, there is room for true hybrids especially in settings with fewer people.
---
Yes. And?
---
I think the pre-AQ40, post-BWL stage is a good place to add more content - it seems that only a few hardcore guilds ever clear AQ40 because the content  is too  unforgiving and requires too much coordination for 80% of pug raids. However, AQ20 is always farmed with relative ease by the community and that would be a good point in the progression to add more gear &amp; raids without gating it behind other stuff that would be too difficult. It might be a good place to add additional gear that could add value to some over-looked specs so people could take stuff like Ret Paladin, Feral Druid, etc etc into higher content where the current gear does not permit some specs to shine.
---
No skin in this game as I'm unlikely to level a rogue anytime soon in Classic, I'm just here to point out that wowhead has a classic site up and running with talent calcs, raid composition tools, etc.  Mainly concerned with the talent calcs, as I notice a ton of people in this sub linking to vanilladb and the like, when we have a much better (loads faster, cleaner site UI, etc) option available.
---
Good luck with the dagger rogue!
---
You’re going to be disappointed if you think the right choice is not cross realm bg’s and 1.5 AV.
---
I was in a mid tier raid guild on my server in vanilla, and I wanted to take things to the next level so I put in an app on a more hardcore guild's forums. Next day I login for the mid tier guild's raid, type /g "ready for an invite!", and see "you are not in a guild." The hunter class leader whispered me like "you think you can apply to another guild and then get an invite to the raid. ridiculous!"
---
I didn't get into the hardcore guild but a few people splintered off from the mid tier guild to make a new guild because of officer drama, and we had fun raiding anyways. I joined the new guild's ventrillo for the first time and a guy says "what's up man it's \[character name here\]." He would pretend he was deaf in the other guild so he didn't have to talk LOL! I was so surprised. Good times.
---
I am also possibly looking for a new guild. How HC would you say you guys are? How many are hitting 60 in the first two weeks?
---
Leeroy?
---
Get yourself set up on a private server and practice for vanilla. That's what I'm doing, I couldn't wait the 2 months lol
---
spell-batching as been reproduced as the original mechanic, what are you on about? melee leeway is a problem though, indeed

---
The blood plague was a real historic moment in classic wow though. 
---
I hope it can come back xD
---
Totally agree. Increasing the pace and responsiveness of game play is a good thing.
---
They'd beg a druid to come raid? Sounds a bit reaching. I'd beg my friends to come if they were my friends, but not a druid.
---
They have no block or parry and rely on armor and dodge
---
Same tbh dude. I played ret all my wow life (4 years). I had 125k kills on it. But as you, I also want to actually win once in a while, and ret ain't doing it.
---
(Rogue stealth fixed how?)     
---
Well, there are still missing water parts. Teleporting mobs. No drops.
---
Weird stutter when crossing zones.     
---
Warrior charge but (I think) =D
---
Plan on running a ground spawn tracking add on. Will just switch between the 2 as I approach nodes.
---
No.  We must keep them on their toes.
---
But the thing is on a fresh server everyone actually need something like a flask of the titan recipe. It's simply worth so much gold that it will change everything for your endgame progression. A flask of the titan drop in reality is the same as 1000 gold dropped. It's not like whatever random alchemy recipe.
---
 Also like I have written I am talking about pugs. For a guildrun or run with friends of course I would pass it and also expect someone to pass something very valuable to me if I could use it. Could add as well that stuff like this is probably something I would make sure to be clear about right away someone joins. So well in advance before starting the instance tell everyone that we will roll need on general drakkisath flask drop. Anyone not cool with it can find another group. So it's not like big big surprise that creates drama.
---
Personally I plan on playing on a PvE server, because I don't like being griefed when I just want to quest in peace. Having BGs take 2 hours a pop because of server population imbalance is not my idea of fun.
---
I'd prefer the old AV, but the PvP tryhards will just never play it that way.
---
&gt; Can anything be done to improve this?
---
Buy better internet or move out of Antarctica.
---
Seems like you like to watch a lot of Asmon.
---
Why yes, bugs in a videogame sure are comparable to human rights...
---
I know there's no accounting for taste, but it's just flat-out more fun. Leveling is great. I love how things feel like a challenge. I love how things have resistances so I don't always deal max damage and my party members bring different things to the table. I love not having heirlooms and actually giving a shit about my gear. I love watching my damage slowly get higher and higher with each level or piece of gear. I loved socializing and making queues for busy quests, working as a community. I love the sense of faction pride. I love learning spells from trainers again. I love managing my money so not everything is handed to be effortlessly. I love spells ranks so I can choose to give low level heals when I don't need to go big. I love old Orgrimar. I love being forced to walk to new flight paths so I don't miss any action. I love old-style Orcs. I love Stoneclaw Totem. I like being afraid of groups of mobs. I love that grouping up is a necessity for some quests. I love WoW classic.
---
If by rivalrys you mean "Alliance always getting stomped by horde shamans and never being fun", then yes I remember that too.
---
At least then you're playing a faithful reproduction of the game for one hour. If you're able to avoid ganks in STV by vanishing into another layer you're actually playing classic for 0 hours.
---
Sounds like it is a local issue, I’ve never experienced this
---
It doesnt matter what is fixed, honestly. This sub has devolved into endless bitching and moaning. Blizz could fix/remove layering, but the masses would find something else to whine about.
---
I’m going heals for Classic. Was originally deadset on paladin, but as time goes by, I’m more interested in Priest. I’ve healed as a Pally in BC and onwards, and also a Resto Druid in a private server.
---
It depends on your group. It’s not rewarding if the people you’re playing with are causing more problems than necessary, like eating damage, not caring about line of sight, chain pulling when you’re OOM, and blaming you. 
---
But that really isn’t most groups. 80% of the time, I enjoy being the protector of the group. It’s a very backseat passive role for half of the time, but you still have to pay close attention. Damage can be *very spikey* in higher level dungeons. Meanwhile, you can’t just spam your heals without any thought. Every bit of overhealing is wasted mana, and you have to decide: Do I risk a small heal to save this DPS life, and have mana left, or so I throw my big boy heal on him and pray the tank has disarm ready. 
---
There’s just a lot of quick decisions you have to make as a healer, that DPS and even tanks don’t have in the same way. Tanking is way harder in Vanilla than any other expac, but it’s more of a tough performance, rather than healing which is a long list of decisions.
---
I'll relax when they acknowledge the EU server problem. Everything else is minor to me, even layering. Why? Because I played classic and it had way, way more bugs than currently, with only part of them being fixed at 1.12. Playing with bugs is, unironically, the real vanilla experience.
---
I can't say I know too much about U.S politics to throw my hat in the ring with how things work but in the U.K at least, London and the south east holds basically all the power which causes a lot of rifts.
---
I don’t think the community is hyper defensive per say, its just everyone proposes so many changes to a game that’s supposed to be the bare bones. I’m not gonna lie I read some of this stuff people post and I think “go back to bfa” while other times I’m like that’s not a bad idea even though I don’t think it should be implemented.the point of playing vanilla is to play vanilla. No sprinkles
---
Upvoted for the troll
---
Yeah, try adapting to an influx of players that doesn't talk english. It's more likely you'll have to learn french or German.
---
Please see my other reply for the answer to this, particularly the countdown to classic link. To put it short, it affects every raiding guild regardless of how serious they are.
---
Blade flurry and AD rush are great for leveling, but don’t come into play until you’re already well on your way to 60.
---
Regarding Malice—typically, for leveling imp SS and imp Evis are your first priorities. It does delay riposte slightly, but boosting your bread and butter skills is top priority.
---
I never specced Remorseless while I leveled—I know some people really dig it, but a single crit on your next mob (assuming little downtime such that you get to the next mob within 20s) is underwhelming compared to Malice (which’ll do for finishers), or other alternatives when there are so many great options for early rogue.
---
I would do malice and lethality after riposte, even if it delays BF/ADrush. I also don’t think these delays/options will make significant impact on your leveling.
---
Czzxxzgggg
---
Thanks for the info buddy! 😊
---
Obamallama here and this is one of the coolest things to wake up to
---
Can confrim back playing release and T2A UO.  Granted, at least in UO you had the "if your heart is true, don't attack blue" mantra that kept people honest.  
---
I think more that in UO, people wouldn't really care about preserving/helping someone.  Because their loss/death was likely your gain as you would loot their corpse and have a short criminal flag.  Then you recall out to your house and wait it out (or just hide in the corner of the room).
---
I still like the idea of sticking 100% lawless zones, where anything goes.  Something like the Dark Zone in The Division, where you don't trust anyone, but then you can be teaming up with the same people you were fighting with in the PvE world.
---
Those aussies are going to get the true #nochanges experience until they see the numbers that enough of them are playing to open up a dedicated server.
---
Having a server dedicated to a specific language and a server geographically close by are two completely different things. There is a data center in Sydney where all the blizzard servers are for all there other games, including retail wow. Wouldn’t make sense for there to not be at least one classic server on there too.
---
29 with an 8 year old, 2.5 year old, and a 1 week old, as well as a career that occasionally demands 80+ hour weeks.
---
Well see how much time I end up actually being able to devote to the game.  Really gonna try to get the 8 year old into it so he can farm for me.
---
Wait you realize we’re still talking about crunch times and excessive forced overtime right? We’re not talking about the regular 40 hour workweek we’ve been arguing about the widespread issue of forced overtime and heavy crunch times etc. 
---
Because it sounds like you’re confused about the topic at hand... I’m also confused why you’re high horsing about a pretty standard work situation and field lol
---
I was on alliance side, and we all knew him very well too. We would see him in world or bgs and be like "oh sh\*t!!"  Also, world first (legit) GM was on our server too, Kupcha the mage. He always sat in SW wearing his pink dress.
---
RBG, arenas, balancing, raids etc is something they can add at the end of Classic either as new content or as a completely new server.
---
My graphics card is AMD, not Nvidia. I assume that’s not a big deal, just want to check
---
Was batching really that bad in vanilla though? I played TBC and remember the game feeling very smooth.
---
Fix leeway and spell batching next.
---
I'm going to miss 5g respecs from pservers
---
He actually did :)

---
I noticed this too and I hope it gets fixed. I kept trying to reloot corpses during the stress tests because I'd walk away too fast, thinking I didn't loot, but then the game would update and the loot would be in my bags. It was pretty annoying for the first couple quests but then I got used to it. Not something I want to get used to though.
---
It's progress, but it's extremely small considering the insane amount of bugs people have found.
---
The beta started well over a month ago, and this is what they have to to show? There is no way they'll have the game ready by the end of August.
---
No. Do you think anything will get fixed otherwise?
---
INTRIST YA IN A PINT?
---
1. They don't have an earlier version of AV to work with and they're not going to spend time and resources re-developing content. Classic is all about "get what we have working and get it out the door".
---
2. There's only going to be 3 to 5 realms in your region or entire continent. You'll be able to build rivalries and friendships just fine.
---
“Have I got a deal for you!”
---
Yeah hurry you really need to choose a new main they are absolutely never going to fix this...
---
That’s a stretch
---
I'm going to go against the grain and warn you OP: Raid healing as a paladin was a whole lot of pally power. Not exciting stuff. Dungeons were more varied.  
---
Also, being a healer feels terrible on the open world. killing things takes forever.
---
And where do rbgs land? The "go back to bfa" argument is shit as it proposes that only a few things has changed since then.
---
Can confirm - this does happen. Never underestimate a thirsty incel with money and a predatory thot without shame. Nasty combo. I've seen it personally.
---
Submit feedback and learn what a stress test is
---
I am perfectly aware of what we are talking about. I'm trying to explain to you that you have seriously no clue what you're talking about. Are you a software engineer? Have you worked in this field, or even with this field before? Or is everything you've ever heard just horror stories and second hand information. Because i can tell you that 98 times out of 100, long hours are due to our failures as developers.... not our bosses.
---
If you have the spare money, look for food delivery services that prep frozen meals for you, most are pretty great now a days and let you pick your meals
---
Well I haven't played any private server or these classic betas, my memory is all from being a very active player back in 2005-2008.
---
The aggro thing isn't really that much of a problem if I remember correctly. Pre-shield so you can wait longer to begin healing. Position yourself at a safe distance so your tank or other party members have time to react before you go splat.
---
Remember that your job isn't to keep everyone at full health, it's to keep everyone alive. The less healing you do the less aggro you draw. Overhealing is inefficient and while it doesn't generate threat, you still generate less threat by healing someone missing 1000hp by 800 than by 1000.
---
Depending on the situation you can do stuff like waiting to fade until melee enemies have reached you before you fade, wasting their time running back and forth. Fade is only a temporary aggro reliever though, so if you have to fade, make sure something gets done about the situation before your fade fades.
---
But honestly, healer aggro is almost always just a problem with not enough cc-ing. You can't expect your tanks to AoE tank packs like they do on retail, make your dps step up. Off-tanking on a shaman or hunter pet or something is perfectly fine if you need to pull 3 un-cc'd mobs.
---
Dude, look at the german Classic Forum. The Realm Structure Thread already has 14.8k replies and 54.2k Views ;)
---
To me, Han came off as aloof, and detached. Not out of the realm of possibility for a bounty hunter that isn’t force attuned in the slightest.
---
The Jabba plot line was amazing. The Rancor fight, the brutal sacrifice of Oola, and the Sarlacc pit?? Written out??? I guess you could slaughter an elk and throw away the backstraps straight off, but you’d be denying yourself a hell of a meal.
---
The Empire lost because it was overconfident. It was really the only way they COULD lose. No other force in the galaxy could go toe-to-toe against them, much less a ragtag group of rebels. And that’s what costed them everything. 
---
They wrote off the Ewoks as teddy bears, and they paid the price. And history has shown that invaders often have a tough time, despite overwhelming numbers/technology (Vietnam, for example)
---
The Luke battle was amazing, we agree on that. I just loved Endor. The Ewoks, the speeder bike chases. Hell, I even enjoyed the Ewok movie as a kid.
---
&gt; You end up with the powerful getting more powerful, like giving a rogue a MH weapon, despite the fact he got one yesterday, because he was topping the meters yesterday and is obviously topping today with the new weapon, and will be topping again with an even newer weapon.
---
This is an atrocious example of a loot council and if this happens your raid leadership is incredibly bad. Find another guild.
---
I was a main tank through TBC who also enjoyed warrior PvP.  Grinding respec costs was by far the worse part of the game and what eventually caused me to quit.  Those daily quests got tedious quick.
---
Like how close to vanilla?
---
Where we can train a group of mobs into other players and then vanish or feign death? 
---
Or following someone around and tagging a mob a split second before them so they don't get any xp but they still pull agro? 
---
Having to click on a mining node three times to mine it and having someone else trying to click on it between your clicks?
---
It's little things like this I hope they don't bring back. I'm sure there are some others I can't think of.
---
Worst part of being mage is learning tairen warriors melee range will be the same as your arc explo and Nova range.
---
I played both beta and a lot of pservers. BETA runs a lot better.
---
Classic WoW starts with the top panel and ends with the bottom one.
---
A lot of our country is open land with not much going on. So much so that under a majority vote, the people living in most of the country would have no voice. So only those living in huge cities would be able to get their stuff heard, and most of the people out in rural areas aren’t as concerned with Facebook and stuff to begin with so their relatively silent.

Well... it's time to play Horde and make new friends! Blood and Thunder! Lok'tar ogar, for the Horde!
---
Yeah true! People today are more picky, even when they're after the original experience. I'm also super worried about the EU server problem, I just feel like they're debating as we speak, and we don't need to speak out before they answer to that. They gotta know it's a bad idea, I'm sure they'll come around, and if they don't I'll be the first to raise my fork and torch the weeks before launch
---
It’s crazy how good of a game WC3 is. I think a lot of people, including Blizzard, forgot how important WC3 was for the success of WoW.
---
Damn that sucks. Recommend anything to gather to make money? Going tailoring for bags and money making on my priest. Idk what to pair it with. Herb? Mining? Skinning?
---
Hmm off the top of my head, many years ago, you could get quite a ways into BRD and Scholomance.  Not all the way to the end but I remember farming the flame guy in BRD by the anvil, as well as stealthing through the bar for Heart of the Mountain runs.  I think there was an unavoidable fight with flameguards on the bridge before the bar though.
---
Could also do some of UBRS if you had the key but it was more dangerous as you had to take out the rune guys in each room very carefully and not attract friends.
---
There's also a way to jump off to the right before the first two molten giants in MC and evade-bug reset them.  Of course, actually killing anything in MC solo was out of the question at 60, but you could mine dark iron in a few key spots if you were very careful.
---
good job Blizzard (haven’t said that in a while lol)
---
Suicide Kings is straight terrible for progression tho. You might as well /roll
---
Damn I can't say I remember the names but I'd like to think we grouped at some point :)
---
That game was so great back in the day, before it became littered with bugs and devs that didn't know the coding.. back before the cash grab took over lol. One thing Rift did super well was the 10 man instances. Those were legit my favorite part of that game. Love me some 10 mans.

Yea I've been considering it, I already have a guild that is messing around on one, might check it out.
---
Fuck BiS haha. I take whatever upgrade I can get!
---
This is why DKP works really well, if you don’t really want it you just put in low bids.
---
Not likely.
---
About the Horde thing, you should mention that its only applicable if you have a shaman *in your specific group* (not just one in the raid) dropping windfury totem.  No shaman in group, or a resto not dropping windfury for some reason, then you'll want a MH poison as well.
---
What a funny looking animation though
---
The “go back to bfa” thing is me being like that’s a shit idea. Not an argument. I personally think that your idea is good since there is no arena in vanilla. But it shouldn’t be implemented because once again, no sprinkles
---
This is hardly white-knighting. The guy above is saying they don't even "acknowledge" the bugs, and by that logic they're not working on anything since they barely acknowledge any bug.
---
Do you have any specific goals for macros on your warrior?
---
Thank you for the advice.
---
I saw the leg animation thread pop-up and I thought it was weird because I specifically remember playing with emotes and animations and thinking it was so impressive that Blizz had departmentalized animations to different parts of the body so different full-body animations can be played at once, including turning in place. I don't think it was ever broken.
---
&gt; "4 dead servers" that's what the layering crowd wants though, they want to join a dead server do their quests then be in a full server when layering gets removed.
---
Except Layering can actually distribute populations to create populated layers, and dynamically remove themselves when they are no longer needed (until waiting, making an announcement, then making the connections happen). Realm selection pages cannot distribute populations. If you create a realm, people join until it reaches the population approximate to a full server. Then it creates a new layer and places more people on until it fills up and another is created. At most you have one low pop layer on any server. 
---
There will also still be queues, so that even with layering we know Blizzard will have limits on how many people they want to fit into a server, presumably setting a maximum amount of layers it will create. 
---
Also, I don't think you actually play retail if you think "all shards are dead" and act as if it that is what sharding is actually doing. Long before sharding all level zones were dead. That's a product of a game that was pushing people to end-game zones and reducing leveling time. Nothing to do with sharding. There would actually need to be a lot of players in those zones for sharding to need to split them up, but if that were the case you would see full shards at least some of the time. 
---
And I don't know what test you've been in, but not all layers are dead.
---
Hmm, that seems interesting.
---
You're probably right on that one. I did end up getting a chromaggus claw and 3/8 Nemesis with my next guild though so it all worked out. Then I betrayed everyone and rolled an alliance warrior for the remainder of the time I played the game (Pre-AQ --&gt; end of TBC.)
---
1.5 AV and server only bgs were the majority of classic. I know what is fun and what is not. Cxr  bgs were not as enjoyable as server side
---
There's also a steady mentality that more complaining = better end product.
---
They are begging for it as long as the boomkin stays in their group.
---
Aww thanks! I have quite a lot more but I picked the ones doing stuff I remembered being really fun or when I was really engaged with the game, things other people might vibe with too!
---
It’s human nature. Your parroted buzzwords can’t change it
---
1) you never needed a sub to get into the beta.
---
2) beta invites are over and chances are there will not be any more going out.

I wasn't sure whether I would but it looks like I'm booking the week off work now haha

As mage?
---
I've never had this issue in BfA nor did I have it in the Stress Tests. Sounds like it's on your end and is worth looking into or submitting a CS ticket.
---
So was not being able to kill C'thun, so were guilds disbanding over how hard Naxxramas initially was, so we're pets spazzing out and pulling an entire instance for no apparent reason when you jumped over a small hurdle or off a slightly steep incline.  
---
The game had millions of people, different things were iconic for different people. The realm I played on had duels going on on top of the Stormwind gates nearly 24/7 for instance, I (and presumably most other players from that realm) would genuinely miss that in Classic.  
---
So where do you draw the line? How iconic does something have to be to ignored. Or if you want to turn the tables, how "menial" does a bug have to be before it can be fixed?

I dont have to be a genius to see there are enough people to populate a national server.
---
Whats embarrassing is the excuse that blizz posted.
---
Just say its about cost or balancing effort and dont lie to your customers.
---
Yet there's still barely 1500 signatures on the change.org page for this. If anyone really cares about this they should vote.
---
Not anywhere near this, but I had a slightly spicy situation myself. 
---
A girl I had become friends with recently broke up with her BF who was in her guild (a guild I would eventually join for a little while before going back to my old one). We started talking more heavy and eventually were getting seriously into each other, which culminated with us meeting up for a weekend. It had to wait for her ex BF to move out as they had still been living together. She hid our conversatoins from him the whole time (which I should have seen as a red flag at the time). We did things and near the end of the trip she told me she didn't think us would be working out. Conversations petered out after that as should be expected. Before we stopped talking though, she mentioned getting back with him. Pretty much she planned this the whole time, she just wanted some exploration time with other dudes. 
---
All that was in Vanilla around early AQ times. Later in TBC, I ran into them both running a dungeon but on a new character. At first she has no idea it was me. I eventually dropped a few choice lines of text that made it obvious, and she went dead silent the rest of the run and left immediately when it was over. Still not sure why I didn't just let the cat out of the bag there.
---
I mean, honestly it's all in the names if you ask me. If you guys can all get bearmanpig/manbearpig/pigmanbear/pigbearman or whatever similar name together, then the druid plan is worth it.
---
How would my alt be worth pvping with if I can get Ashkandi as a tank with dkp.
---
He'll farming with a warrior isn't that bad in raiding gear anyway.
---
Ah yes. Harambe. 6 years young at the time. We miss you buddy.
---
Slippery slope arguments are lazy.
---
Classic isn’t perfect.
---
I get that you're joking and you know that you're making a cheap point, but the classic community seems to me to be getting more toxic as time goes by... ESPECIALLY on the Blizzard forums.
---
***HOWEVER***, this is how you know that the fan base is really excited about something Blizzard is doing. They complain about everything and nitpick constantly.
---
That is adorable!
---
Seeing the other thread on professions to pick on launch and other reply in this thread, I think my knowledge is still very out of date for the worth of tailoring. I had tailoring back in the days in vanilla but I really forgot the specifics.   
---
So overall,  the green from tailoring might be worth but it is unlikely. The blues would be worth but you might not have the mats.    
---
* Spidersilk boots (spidersilk and pearl)    
---
* Rober of power (arathi farm)    
---
* Dreamweaver gloves (skullspliter farm in ST and some mobs in swam of sorrow or ungaro?)     
---
* Dreamweaver circlet (same farm)   
---
* Runecloth bag to make money?     
---
Then I think  there are quite a few decent blue for 50+ but their accessibility and how they compare to the bis pre-raid you will seek, I cannot estimate.     Actually nevermind, most use mooncloth in quantity it would take you forever to acquire so it is forgettable.   
---
The epic robe truefaith vestment is worth but the pattern pretty hard to get.
---
Oh so the only reason they were disappearing was because they "updated" or "patched" the beta?
---
My man, do you remembered how they connect? I tried looking up on wowhead but finding nothing.
---
And root nor slow is one of them for rogues.
---
been through the tread twice.. still don't see how it affects me, if some other guild wants to try hard and spend time farming buffs.
---
I have no problem, being a healer, a buffer, bringing potions, flasks, buff foods and drinks, consumables, Enchanting guildies, Hell I'll even help them farm world bosses, but when they ask me to log out ... "fuck em, ain't going to happen."
---
I know the popular thing is to do "A friend" or what ever to save from self owning.. But I'll paint a scene. 
---
The year was 2008, TBC wasn't quite as fresh and the chaff guilds where finally trying SSC. A 23 year old me, had been out of the Navy for half a year, and still hadn't left the sketchy confines of the camping chair I had acquired for a computer desk. In my attempt to hold off getting a job, I was living off the 10K I had saved up during the war.
---
There, in the Pick Of Destiny on Peranolde US, was a cute sounding Night Elf chatting in TeamSpeak. We become friends, me, BillyBadAss the human prot warrior, Her, Lorriaine the keyboard turning damsel. I, immediately fall into gamer love. How could I not? She was silly, and flirty and an ELF! I took her under my wing and gently taught her how to play better, We did it all, Heroics, Rep Grinding, Kara!
---
Then, as one does, we learned each others names and locations. GASP! She lives a mere 2 hours away! 
---
Plans in motion, and balls blue as the deepest ocean dive, we meet up at a shady trucker hotel off of US 29 in Wisconsin.
---
I arrive, and there in all her beauty was this woman, 17 years my senior with as many chins as dimples on her thighs. 
---
We bang, and as the blue balls finally clear up, and the haze of pent up hornyness unclouded my eyes.. I realize, this was probably a bad call!
---
Needless to say, ghosting occured, and BillyBaddAss has never been logged into since.
---
&gt; said 
---
*is saying
---
Highly recommend it if you're excited like me. After the stress test I felt like an ex-crack addict back on the rock and I NEEDED more haha.
---
Oof, rough times. You did well holding your tongue on that run.
---
The more important problem with stealth is you can see the direction rogues are moving and their movement briefly after vanishing or stealthing.

I wouldn't say Master of Deception is mandatory. In fact, you will find most PvP dagger builds dont have it, because having points for both Opportunity and Master of Deception, while picking up all the other mandatory talents, is really difficult. You can get away with skipping Master of Deception. The only PvP build I always use it in is Hemo/CB, since you don't need Opportunity.
---
I think you mean constant winning.
---
No one *likes* the EU realm plans. It's like layering, no one likes it, some people just get why Blizzard thinks it's necessary / agree that it is necessary. In an ideal world there'd be a server of every type for every language. 
---
I get why Blizzard is doing what they are, and I know I don't have any kind of accurate estimation for long-term population to say I know better than Blizzard, and that they should make Language specific servers.
---
i dunno man, i used to make enough gold to respec and repair as MT. although, i didn't respec often. plus i had alts for farming if needed.
---
imagine disagreeing with someone irl and they start calling you retarded, moron and what not.
---
quick way to lose credebility lul
---
I consider myself a competitive pvper and I'd rather play AV all day everyday for the amount of fun stuff you can do. Play defense, back cap, go stealth and try to cap towers. Go for the mines etc. Once you play 1.5 AV , 1.12 AV is boring.
---
I've seen average hours played to max on some server and it was about 10 days, i did it in 10 days myself years ago. I think 10 days is about right
---
No criticism allowed! Now pick-up that can civilian.
---
&lt;Doggo Noir&gt; could be a great fit for you! We are currently working on filling our raid roster but do have a few people that plan on taking it easy on their way to level cap. We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday at 7pm-11pm est so if you have pre-raid his you could always jump in. I'll shoot you a message with a link to our application (nothing too serious). Hope to hear from you on there!
---
Sooo were they any major bugs?
---
Yes they do! I'm totally with you there. I just don't like people talking everything down... They are working and they have plenty of time to fix it. Please stop making people nervous
---
If it works like Retail always has, you won't be able to swap between. I can't imagine Classic will be any different.
---
Suicide Kings DKP system separately for set-items and other items is the best system in my opinion. Having it separately for set and other items prevents people for passing on good upgrades during a raid because they really want a specific set item.
---
It's hopping, dudd
---
And alliance have paladins which have lay on hands, bop, bubble, freedom and excellent healing and survival.  Ok
---
Yep. I remember those queue times. It was awful.
---
Please reply to the thread you are clearly addressing, instead of making another.

This is the most realistic mechanic. Also needs a frame limit of 18 fps that can't be changed.
---
We're scar'd by games like fallout 76 where it calls itself a beta but fixes very very very minor things or next to nothing at all. 
---
I believe in blizzards choices. While most things aren't to my liking they all make sense in what they're intended for. 
---
We're all an abused spouse who is finally being treated well by our new SO. It just takes time to accept it.
---
I was there back then. It was insane what all the dudes acted like to them. I liked to become friends with girls because I just got along better, but only one of them ever became anything. 
---
A few of them though took huge advantage of the female factor and it sucked.
---
Have you seen the PVP bugs, Feign Death, Ice Trap? Major bugs for PVP.
---
Ehh I considered it but they're local friends some of whom are from my DND group, and one is a roommate. I can't bail on them for such a small reason.
---
Probably Mining/Blacksmithing. Basic-bitch combo but Blacksmithing has some great leveling gear for the 30's-40's. Will be going armorsmith for resist gear / hoping for a lionheart helmet &amp; titanic legplate recipie.
---
That person would quickly have nobody left to argue with so there's that.
---
The “incorrect” animation looks much more fluid. I wish it would’ve stayed broken rather than getting a garbage animation.
---
Making every spec viable would be seen as a move towards a retail type classic hybrid, believe it or not a lot of players feel more connected to their class having noticeable strengths and weaknesses.
---
Honestly, if you don't use heirlooms, which new players don't have, you're not really that OP. You can pull a few more mobs, but it's not like it used to be before the leveling changes where you could pull 10 mobs and barely lose HP. Though obviously there are still some classes that can pull big groups.
---
Mod please pin this
---
From my memory the last batch of new launched servers before TBC had gated MC
---
Have to keep it in mind that raiding on eu will be happening in your afternoon on the east coast and when you play in the evening on the east coast it will be night on the server.
---
There are some trees missing in SW I think and something about the clock above Stockades isn’t there. We could still riot about this?
---
Yeah.
---
As much as I can't stand playing Alliance, I'd reroll without hesitation if it was a widespread problem across multiple Classic servers.  Shit, at the end of Wrath going into Cata, my friends and I faction changed all of our max level characters specifically because the BG queues were so horrendous for Horde on Stormstrike battlegroup.
---
If it ever came to that I'll probably raid on Horde and PvP on Alliance, we'll see how it all pans out.
---
People have promised something and then not kept with promises is all. Blizzards current track record is not good. Sometimes they flat out ignores the community.
---
**Region:** Americas
---
**Server Type:** PvE
---
**Faction:** Horde
---
Player seeking other players here, I joined during BC but always wanted to experience Vanilla. I'm excited for Classic! I'm just looking for some friends to play with, I'm a pretty casual player but I understand many of the basic concepts. If any more experienced players wanna take a n00b under their wing, or if any fellow n00bs are looking for a n00b homie hmu!
---
Remove the debuff limit.
---
Add in the 2nd tab for a talent off spec to easily swap to.
---
Was in a guild with Skarm, he couldn't stand not being MT or guild leader, because he wanted all of the loot. So he quit and made his own guild and poached members from the previous one. Soon after that, they start raiding and of course Skarm is  #1 loot prio for tank and DPS gear. He finally got all the loot he wanted.
---
Tl:dr Skarm is a POS
---
They won’t keep layering at that point because of world bosses. They don’t want multiple azuregos and Kazzak and emerald dragons. It won’t go past phase 1. I genuinely believe them about that. They have the data on how launches normally go.
---
NEED.
---
Exactly what I’m doing. Tailoring/Herbalism and will bank all my herbs to easily level Alchemy once I’ve made my Truefaith.
---
PRO:
---
-You will be invited to raids.
---
-You will get gear since there are not a lot of other healers in the raid.
---
-You can be a good healer without the best healing gear.
---
-You get to be a heal-slut and live a life of sexual fantasy.
---
-Sweet escape abilities (class dependent).
---
CON:
---
-Leveling will be harder when playing solo.
---
-Some people are going to blame you when your party wipes.
---
-Battlegrounds will be tougher if you're in healing gear. 
---
-You're gonna get ganked since you're "easy prey".
---
-Zealous tanks will make your job a nightmare.
---
REWARDS:
---
-You get a be a heal slut, if that's your thing.
---
-You get to hang your importance over everyone else in the raid.
---
-You will make friends.
---
-You're basically a fantasy doctor. That's sick. Why wouldn't you want to be a fantasy doctor?
---
Cross realm BG is "fine" since in your team you have everyone from the SAME server it's just the opponent team who may come from a different server.
---
Spazzing about EU servers, layering and leeway isn't amusing you? Wtf, do you even Classic?
---
Agreed. Yesterday I was on that hunter post along the lines of “waaa I’m a hunter main and there’s no way this class I haven’t even played yet will ever be fixed, I’m rerolling!”
---
It’s exhausting. Some things never change about the WoW community and whining/exaggerating is one of them.
---
Played on a  Pserver where only 1 talisman of the binding shard dropped. The guild leader gave the item to his Priest e-girlfriend. They broke up 3 months later and she deleted the character.
---
I've hooked up with more then a couple lady guildies in my day..  They defiantly always got spots in my 5 mans, over any one else.
---
I mean, it's probably just you/your internet or computer?  BfA and classic aren't on the same client.  One is 8.xx, the other is running off a modified version of 7.xx to give us 1.13x, aka, Classic.
---
I feel this is just people's emotional and boredom side kicking in. Some people here did not play beta, did not Stress Test, and are only on the bandwagon of what their friends or streamers are saying. Others have legit tested things and are worried it does not feel like a game they played 15 years ago and seem to have perfect memory of every system. 
---
I agree OP people do need to chill, however, it is only going to get worse as the game gets closer to launch.
---
Good on her, hustle it up
---
because it's a crap engine
---
i can at least confirm that the strafing bug was definitely a thing on the recent stress test
---
seems like blizz have fixed a lot of this stuff in the past 24 hours tho so i guess we'll see
---
&lt;Doggo Noir&gt; might be a solid home for you then bud. We aim to be a semi-hardcore guild that will be making our way through content at a steady, but reasonable pace.
---
We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursdays from 7pm-11pm Est. Though I hope it won't take us the full 4 hours to get through MC. 
---
I'll shoot you a message with a link to our application and we can start talking details there. Hope to talk to you soon!
---
Enhancement Shamans can literally one-shot people...
---
The best system in the game is already implemented. Need before greed. 
---
Dkp is stupid and loot council is an archaic form of MMO corruption. 40 of you went into the raid and everyone deserves whatever they can need on. It's up to the other players to spread the word if someone ninjas an item. As someone who 100% believes in everyone being able to roll on any item at any point but utilizing the dont be a dick rule, i think it's the best.
---
do you mean where the gryphon or wyvern does not tilt/lean during changes of direction? because this got fixed a few builds ago
---
Okay, I thought it was a card design from the Magic: The Gathering trading card game. Looks somewhat similar.
---
Not great at leveling, and not really wanted in raids.
---
Most hybrids are relegated to healz if things are being optimized at all.
---
17 year old me also wanted to create an all-Tauren guild dedicated to the protection of Thunder bluff on a PvP server. I got disillusioned pretty fast and gave up on the idea.
---
Another private server story here which I really hope won't even be possible on Classic. 
---
We didn't know  that we actually had not one but two GMs (game masters) in our guild. Now this is of course already primed for corruption and shady deals behind the back of the guild, but what made it even more juicy, is the introduction of a girl. Specifically one of our top mages' girlfriend. She did the big mistake of posting a picture of her. Not NSFW in any way, but these nolifer GMs started fighting over her. Every week she seemed to be in a pug where she got some pretty rare items. Before long she was the most geared priest in the guild which naturally raised a few eyebrows. Supposedly the GMs had let her know that they had GM powers and started offering items for "services". 
---
When the server eventually died someone leaked the in-game character names of some of the GMs and we instantly connected the dots and the TeamSpeak just blew up with these two GMs, the mage and his girlfriend. Lots of popcorn was eaten that day I can tell you what.
---
You don't respec, easy choice. Make a decision on your talents and stick with it. You can either make a hybrid spec that works well in PvP, PvE, and solo, or you can just deal with solo being harder/slower, or bring a friend, or farm on alts. There's a million options but there's a reason fewer played tanks and healers back in the day compared to now. Personally I much prefer being special because some people are impatient and want things the easy way. I love healing and always will, so if fewer play it because they can't dual spec on the spot for free, I'm good with that.
---
RL friend lives eats breathes wow. Real life basically dies wow becomes entire life. Starts raiding with a new guild. Guild masters are a middle aged married couple. RL friend is in early 20s. They "adopt him" call him son in vent, spend time together all the time. RL friend moves halfway across the country and moves in with them, no job nothing just wow. Out of the blue one day he moves back. No one heard about it. He's just back. The married couple are getting divorced and she's moving here. They get married and now he's married to an woman almost twice his age who used to call herself his mom and they stay home and play wow together 24/7.
---
Enhance, compared to other specs, is not great dps endgame. Most shaman end up healing
---
The problem with some #NoChangers is that they claim #NoChange everytime but can't give proofs on how it was during Vanilla.
---
People here go nuts if you mention anything about pserver strats or guideline.
---
Also got a lot of heat last time for mentioning that getting epic mount within 10-20 hour would be quite easily for mages and hunters.
---
They are pretty good levelers in my opinion.  You can dish out some decent melee damage without expending all your mana on lightning bolts.  They are really not desired at all endgame though.  Enhancement shamans in a raid are just going to run out of mana super fast and still fall short of other dps classes.
---
What about the vanish animation? Still BFA animation or is it fixed?
---
i loved leveling as a backstab rogue. was fun ganking squishies as i leveled. aggro should not be an issue for you. just hold off on opening up for like 2 seconds and feint or vanish liberally. usually save vanish for bosses.
---
&gt;a super fast and still fall short of other dps cla
---
Not wanted for WF totem?
---
Mediocre leveler, and probably the least wanted dps for endgame.
---
Taking this same path, especially as I'm going to slowly get to 60 with friends and supplement downtimes with cooking/fishing. Will have a lot of herbs banked by the time I get to 60 and need to be raid prepped. 
---
However I remember the 250-300 range of professional being brutal in Vanilla, and might be awhile til I ditch tailoring.
---
Just play what you want. If people think Vanilla raids are so hard that you need the most optimal raid comp possible they're fooling themselves.
---
If you guys all go Heart of the Wild, Nature's swiftness you will all be able to tank heal or cat dps based on gear
---
Come on man, you cant be this dense?
---
My guild was well on-the-way to getting one of the first Onyxia kills worldwide. There was the kill by the asian guild that was bugged, and I think there might have been another kill or two, but I honestly cannot recall.
---
It was the day before reset and we had a full raid, headed out for Onyxia, and we ended up having one of *those* runs where everything clicked. You all probably know how a kill feels when it's ticking down at 25, 20, 15, but then around 10% we suddenly had Onyxia Warders in the raid. *What the fuck?*
---
I'll never forget wiping at 2% as the warders fucked right through our healing and DPS. I'll never, ever forget the silence on vent, and then I'll never forget out raid leader asking succinctly, "Who the fuck pulled those?"
---
They were pulled as a joke by a hunter who thought we had it in the bag. 
---
GLC, if you're out there, I've never, ever, ever forgotten that you did this, you *assless bastard.*
---
That was the point I was making. Every guild I've been in had a variety of systems and every single one failed. Miserably and consistently.
---
Not looking for a position but that is a terrific take on loot council!
---
I'll be the opposite here and go: not looking forward to playing a class different than what I want, because it's absolutely horseshit. Talking about ret and RET specifically, yes I know holy is good.
---
Pretty disappointed that xrealm bgs are in from the start too. It’d be nice if they branch them in during the same timeline they did in vanilla (towards the end)
---
People were reporting, yelling, making a lot of complaints about BfA in the beta as well. So really the deciding factor is just what the project is, and who is working on it/overseeing it. Players on reddit and other forums have a large illusion of control every time they see someone posted a video of a bug, it isn't instantly hotfixed so everyone complains, then later it gets fixed. "Look guys! We did it, specifically us and our need to constantly repost about the same bug forever! Not the single report that was properly vetted and handled!"
---
"Hey bud, we're gonna sit you on this one since a laggy/DCd player on Thaddius is *reeeaalllyyy* bad, you mind hopping back on in like 10min?"
---
"Fuck this I'm out"
---
Honestly, if you're willing to wait the long-term to AH, store them on a bank ult until more people are raiding and therefore buying massive quantities of consumables. That will inflate the prices of herbs more than selling them too early when people are only using consumables they find while leveling.
---
Yes, always yes.
---
Yes, I can chill (:
---
Betraying the Horde is NOT a SMALL REASON!!! ;)
---
True, the point I was making is that goes against being a DKP system by that point. Pointing out that these systems are imperfect.
---
Mostly heals. If you get an unstoppable force or luck out and get a hand of rag, you can do good bursty damage with low sustain. Great in pvp for melting folks, not so great in long PVE fights.  Shamans provide more utility in raids by being resto / dropping totems for the melee group.
---
I was a warlock in a guild that did fairly well on our server (around the top-10 in raiding) in Wrath.  We had cleared Naxx and The Turning Tide dropped.  My current weapon was actually really low for that content and we simply used the need/greed rolls but we had to link the item we were replacing before we rolled.  My weapon was much lower than the 'Tide so, I linked what I had and needed the item, just like I was supposed to.  We had a mage in the guild who did have a weapon that was slightly lower than the Tide, so he announced and needed as well.  Cool.  Two people going for the same weapon.  No big deal.  I wasn't expecting to win it anyway since I rarely won things.
---
Of course, I won it and was truly happy that I got a great upgrade.  Awesome.  Happy me.
---
In comes the true fury of the punk of a mage (who would normally run OOM in every fight and scream "Innervate ME!!!!" Whenever he could).  He was screaming all over that it wasn't fair, he should have gotten the piece, etc, etc.  He actually (I have witnesses, too) accused me of using "dice hacks" because I'm a software developer.  Okay, whatever.
---
He continued to bitch for 30 minutes, decided to /gquit and took several of his friends with him.  They groaned for days afterwards and finally swapped factions to find a "more fair raiding guild" (they didn't do well after that).
---
The bad thing was, one of the friends was our main tank and that put such a damper on the raiding that people lost interest and the raiding fell to an afterthought and the guild splintered shortly afterwards.
---
The good thing is, my warlock still has the 'Tide for a transmog and I won it when the item was relevant.
---
Outside of the MT I don’t really think classic is hard enough to warrant the guild regulating who gets what loot too much. Have loot priorities, sure, but prioritising one DPS warrior over another for chromatically tempered sword is just going to cause unnecessary resentment and frustration.
---
A +1 system stops too much hoarding while still allowing people to just accept that they lost a roll, which they’re used to, and can’t blame on a human.
---
Classic feels laggy because of spell batching but this shouldn't be the case for BFA so it's probably something wrong on your end.
---
it's recommended, loch modan quests pretty bad
---
it's 2019 millennials and gen x can't handle opposition
---
The more excited the WoW community is about something, the more toxic they get. It's a special way to gauge player interest. Just look at how many players are complaining about stupid shit, and you'll know how much they like it.
---
Resto shamans can drop WF
---
What I wrote could apply to all kinds of PvE content really. It’s only the last part that’s about raiding.
---
Leveling doesn’t make your class more complex to play neither does doing dungeons but at least you get to use CC there. 
---
PvP is only as difficult as the opponents you play against so that at least has infinite possibilities.
---
That's fair. Thank you for the insight. I played during Wrath and didn't remember any sort of laggy looting during that time so I figured it had something to do with this reverse engineering process blizzard is doing.
---
The only people world buffs have relevance to are speed runners farming content, and pushes for world first kills.
---
People literally made fun of you back in the day if you used flasks and other consumables in raids.  The mentality has shifted so much since that point, but the content didn't get harder.  Vanilla raids stayed the same while the playerbase evolved.  Every boss in it's 1.12 state can be killed no problem with no world buffs, it's just a matter of having the gear and playing the game well.
---
If you're looking to seriously push world first kills, you're probably okay with logging off to preserve buff timers.  If you aren't seriously pushing world firsts, you're just putting undue stress on yourself for no reason.
---
A true love story right there!
---
Are you sure? Because other similar talents only improve the base damage of the skill before gear and other bonuses are applied.
---
yup of course everything was reported prior to making this video
---
That's the point I was making, the far end flaws that these systems have. Just because they can work doesn't mean they do. There is always an oversight.
---
lol, oh shit...thought that was specced.
---
The crowd pummelers only make your auto attacks faster. Something that will be very inconsistent in PvP. 
---
There's lots of other items you can use to compliment feral in PvP. Like medicine pouch etc. The better PvP specs for druid aren't feral tho.
---
I wish you are saying true, but math doesnt lie and 400ms delay is there
---
Have they fixed the annoying lag period between using an order to a pet and the pet actually doing it?
---
blizzard isn't talking to you and me. it's a more hopeful explanation than "yea, we're going to compromise on customer satisfaction because we're expected to cut losses where we can. investor expectations, you guys understand!!"
---
big companies can't get away with being real with its customers. they're expected to address issues publicly only when necessary and give explanations that ensure growth which means they won't necessarily be real with its customers. 
---
blizzard isn't to blame. board management is. blizzard is made up of hundreds of people who probably wish they could do anything to make us happy but as you go higher up the management mountain eventually you can't see the ground
---
Cool, have a real argument to make?
---
The updated graphics wouldn't bother me, but changing the spec viabilities to make more specs playable in raids would be inherently changing game mechanics and the way all classes function.  I want more or less the same game I played back in 2004-2006.  I'm ok with little changes here and there... especially if they are cosmetic only, but changing classes and specs to make them more viable is a definite no from me.
---
In the Vanilla era, they weren't highly wanted in raids. In Classic, I'd expect with all of the knowledge available that they would be highly wanted to pair with Melee users. Windfury is no joke when Fury Warriors and Rogues have it. The DPS increase for those 4 individuals more than compensates for the Shaman's less than viable DPS. I feel like most raids would only want to see 23 points in Enhancement at the most(improved windfury proc), and the rest in Resto. Resto Shaman would be a much higher demand I'd imagine.
---
Yea same here considering I called out of work and played for like 14 hours straight lol
---
I appreciate the comment! It is based off of the Onslaught method, but hopefully tuned down a bit for a more casual setting.
---
Im in the beta and I've been doing leatherworking . To me, it's worth it. Dungeons dont always drop the loot i want and i don't always win the gear i want. Leatherworking helps me keep my gear at least semi up to date and the armor kits further shorten that gap.
---
Nice reminder of the good work that has been done and the progress we’ve seen
---
YOU TAKE NO CANDLE
---
 I'm in Europe and intending to play east coast America for language reasons. I figure being ahead of the day is fine being I often play to midnight or 1am, especially on weekends.
---
A lot of people want to rank up solo. Rank 1 to 10 are perfectly achievable solo and it would be dumb if you were forced to play premade rbgs to get it.
---
Wow, me too! What a feeling! I'm so happy right now. Lol
---
I lost interest in the game just before Cataclysm dropped. It had changed too much from the game I loved in Vanilla, BC, and even WotLK. The guild pretty much disbanded then. We stayed as friends irl, and we're all excited for classic to drop so we can re-live the golden days.
---
I'm sorry but if you genuinely think Vanilla had harder content than retail then that's ridiculous. Tedium is not the same as difficulty. Vanilla took more time to do things, and getting 40 people together was tougher to do. It doesn't mean the content itself was harder though. 
---
Raiding immediately became more complex and challenging with TBC raids, and only evolved from there. Heroic raiding from Wrath-MoP, and then Mythic raiding after that are significantly more challenging than anything in Vanilla. Mythic+ dungeons are harder than any Vanilla 5 man.
---
Also addons in PvP don't immediately make you good, especially when everyone has them. The skill level in PvP is so much higher than it used to be. I didn't do any serious arenas in WoW since WotLK. When I decided to PvP in BFA, it took a lot of effort and improving to get back up above 2400. I was legit stuck at 1700 for a long time because the average players were so much better than they used to be. Things that were considered good plays back in the day were just basic shit I'd see in every match now.
---
You'll want a MH Shadow Oil if you don't have a Shaman, not a poison.
---
Dwarves don't even need to level in their starting zone. You could walk straight to Northshire and start there if you really wanted to. There might be a couple of issues for you, especially if you're a hunter, but it would work.
---
There is absolutely no problem with going to Westfall as any Alliance race.
---
"Artificially created?" That's how it was created originally...
---
Nothing to do with the game version. Beta is on US servers.
---
Collect 10 [Stringy Meat].
---
something untold, this period of the classic has gone through many retcon! Why not?
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but it sounds like you are saying, you can or are willing to do raid, pvp, and farm with your one toon?
---
If so, the constant cost to respec from pve to pvp, is the question brought up from the OP. A suggestion is having alts that have single functions. To cut out the cost of respec.
---
If not, then I do not know what your point is.
---
It's also caused massive problems because the game is a state of unstable equilibrium and pretty much every PVP server ended up as a failure with 9:1 faction ratios.
---
I also think the lack of friendly fire was a mistake.
---
It's not fair to blame it on millennials and gen X, they just have a wider sphere of influence and interaction. I know plenty 60 year olds who will shut down conversations opposing their views (Religious people of that age can be particularly bad) the big thing to blame is simply anonymous conversation's on the internet. As someone else said in a reply: Imagine disagreeing with someone irl and calling them retarded or a moron, it's a quick way to get shunned (words to that effect) and it's true, but when you go online to an anonymous forum such as this people don't give a fuck if "JoeBloggs481994" thinks they're a dick, they'd rather Joe didn't get away lightly with disagreeing with them no matter who is right.
---
emotional reaction sure. but doing that stoops you down to their level. Better to take the high road.
---
&gt;vanilla can be a gigantic snoozefest
---
so true, and autoattacking ret aint cutting it xD
---
Man, what a feeling! My friends will still bring up your names if we talk about wow, like: "Remember Obamallama and Obamasmama." Then we laugh. You rock!
---
Two different guilds raiding together. We were technically one guild but the other guild didn't want to disband because they were a part of an organization outside of wow. For that same reason we weren't allowed to join their guild. MT was a part of or guild OT was a part of their guild. MT was guild and raid leader. We were clearing BWL regularly but would occasionally do MC. Well what do you know bindings of the windseeker drop. A fierce debate erupts over which tank should get it. The OT DOESN'T  want it. The OT says MT should get it. Everyone else in the other guild is foaming at the mouth screaming about giving it to the OT. Again OT doesn't want it. MT takes it. Other guild loses their shit and they refuse to raid with us anymore and the whole guild falls apart.
---
This wasn't on a EU server was it?
---
I'm going to join a casual guild while I level to then bail once my buds and I are prepped for 60 content. Hopefully I'll meet some great people along the way to join in with the fun.
---
&gt; Stop being toxic
---
I use community toxicity to gauge how interested the players are in a particular feature or title.

It's like some kind of collective autism

The classic wow guilds is a great start or the LFG monday post on the top of the subreddit is also a good start as well.

Yeah you right. I was just being general and trolling kinda. But yeah its people it's people of all ages.
---
What’s the difference with the skeletons and corpses?
---
Probably just thought it was a nervous tick at the time lol
---
The other 45 hunter bugs among many others?
---
Why no right click report? I was looking forward to easily reporting.
---
Skinning/Engineering. Will go with it from the start and stick with it. For RP reasons mostly. Need to make my own guns and bullets on my dwarf with a bear.
---
Fuck this yelling mate, please put some warning on the beginning of the video.
---
Rose-colored glasses my friend. IIRC they had Spell Batching at the Vanilla setting until... WoD?
---
They are decent at leveling, for endgame you need a casual guild to tolerate them.
---
This isn't true. Have bugs made it through betas or ptrs before? Of course they have. Do blizz stop making changes 2 months before a launch "without exception"? Of course not.
---
Even if I ignore the "without exception" that's makes it really easy to invalidate your argument is say that if you look through the history of PTR updates and beta updates you'll see that they are usually updating the PTR up to the day of release.
---
Now if there is feedback that a class needs overhauled or a system needs to be redesigned during beta will blizz change that in the same beta. Of course not. Do you know how long it takes to overhaul a class, make sure it's balanced, and collect feedback on the new design. It isn't something that can realistically be done in a small time frame so they will, of course, launch what they have because they know what they have at least works.
---
Hard to tell sorry.
---
I've had 15 years to get so much better at the game than I used to be, I'm not so worried about leveling speed like I was back in the day.  It's not some insurmountable obstacle like I first thought it was, taking me 15 days of /played to get my first 60.
---
I'll do it now in 5 days /played and I can juggle rested XP on alts for max efficiency.
---
That being said, I did the same thing another person replied with, in that I did a bunch of 1-30 characters trying each class that I didn't play back then.  I've settled on Tauren Druid, and I'll likely have a Troll Hunter and Orc Warlock alts.  Possibly depending on how my real life schedule looks I may shoot for more alts, but for sure Druid main and Hunter alt, the exact opposite of what I had back in Vanilla.
---
Every BiS list should have a range of items imo, some items are literally direct side-grades and some items are incredibly rare/expensive
---
Our names are hardly memorable, compared to yours. Lol. I never tried rift. After we disbanded I migrated to console gaming, but I am so ready to come back now. Really looking forward to 40man raiding again, epic world PvP and all the other stuff XD
---
So passive aggressive about players anticipating the game. We have 2 months before the game comes, people are excited and all we can do is watch streams. We've already seen that some sters aren't there to "beta test" they are just there to play the beta. Just let people talk, and worry, and care about the outcome of this game.
---
They are needed as healers with wf
---
Russians don't like paying for games.

Here’s a fantastic guide created by Sinyou that we wanted to share with reddit. It’s got a lot of great information that really dives into the topic of gold making with a ton of different methods – something for every class and playstyle. If you have a guide, story, PvP montage, or anything else Classic WoW that you’d like to share, submit it on the site and we’ll be happy to help you with the process to make it look as good as possible.
---
It's not about raids being hard but if you have a choice between an 800 dps rogue or 400 dps shaman obviously rogue gets the priority.
---
And removing spell lagging, layering...
---
If you're powerleveling your only option is skinning and first aid. It's an incredible profession, vendoring every leather is equivalent of 60g/hr and will help with that level 40 mount grind.
---
Everything else will just slow you down. Unless you're extremely lucky with no competition, you'd outlevel herb and mining quite easily.
---
What did you do, fly them out to fuck you? Or did they just happen to live nearby? This seems like way too many extra steps

&gt; Retrodruid was the leader of a shitty guild named RoaR on tichondrius. They were a laughing stock of the server. She, being a resto druid, ended up taking the mats for Sulferas, Hand of Rag. When she looted the final stuff in MC, a shitstorm occured as half of the raid quit. Drama overflowed in ironforge.
---
&gt; Everyone would spit on retrodruid in IF. She was a kill on site for all horde. If she left anywhere, she was followed, ganked, and camped.
---
Holy shit. I kinda get why she was crying but it was deserved.
---
Awesome, thank you so much! I posted on the LFG Monday thread, but I'll check out Classic Wow Guilds too!
---
&lt;Doggo Noir&gt; Would be a good place for you Razkae. We are an semi-hardcore Alliance guild based off of the East coast. We plan on doing raids Tuesday and Thursday at 7-11pm EST. Our goal is to work our way through content at a meaningful but reasonable pace.
---
Being a new guild we are building our roster and would love to add your lock to the ranks. 
---
I'll shoot you a message with a link to our application and hope to talk to you there.
---
Great, thank you!!
---
Most end pve is raiding, world bosses (raiding + pvp), or just 5man dungeons (which are more dynamic than raids but don't scale past the phase 1 content for the most part).
---
&gt; They won’t keep layering at that point because of world bosses.
---
They may not want to, but if the population is too high, they absolutely will because they have no other option.
---
To be honest, I doubt Blizzard has any intention of removing layering. As soon as phase 2 rolls around, they already have a PERFECT excuse lined up for not removing it, and this subreddit will eat it up like cake. They already tried to deceive us by renaming sharding and half of the people here fell for it.
---
But like I said, even if they really do intend to remove it, that entirely depends on the population completely plummeting in the first few weeks. If that doesn't happen, they will have to keep layering. It's an enormous risk, and one that I would not be willing to take. To avoid this, they need to completely scrap layering and not include it for a single minute in the live game.
---
Age != maturity. When you tell someone grow up you're not telling them to literally age faster.
---
Corner out Flask of Supreme Power market. #profit
---
maybe they should have looted the guild bank, or not put all of their resources in the hands of an obviously unstable jackass..
---
No problemo, i know lots of good guilds are in that discord even mine &lt;Participation Totems&gt; Best of luck duder!
---
This is nothing compared to melee leeway
---
It was for the stress test
---
I'm pretty sure nothing will ever top the drama that happened in &lt;Deus Vox&gt;.
---
If you enjoy a good drama story and have been out of the loop for nearly a decade, this will be worth the read -  [https://www.scribd.com/document/49243598/I-am-posting-this-on-behalf-of-some-jabronie-from-DV](https://www.scribd.com/document/49243598/I-am-posting-this-on-behalf-of-some-jabronie-from-DV)
---
It’ll be back by the end of August. The stress test is already done.
---
Good call, I didn't play a rogue back then, just pointing out that lack of a windfury calls for applying something else to your MH!
---
I guess you dont sort by new?
---
Warrior was the example, I would happily respect pvp and pve. Which is what I'm argueing. A pvp spec warrior in good gear can grind no problem at all.
---
A fury warrior main could easily grind too.
---
Not to mention there are farming methods that don't require heavy solo combat competence.
---
If that was your daughter, would you be saying the same thing?
---
Strafe bug still not fixed?
---
Ok ill spell it out for you. Youre a healer, there are also other healers in the raid. You and another guy both get some world buffs. He logs out until raid night to keep the buffs, you dont. Then you do the raid, he absolutely smashes you in the meters because of his buffs. A peace of loot drops that you both need. Who gets it? The guy who tops the meters. This happens a couple of times. You realize : if i want gear i need world buffs. You start playing alts to keep world buffs on your raiding main. This happens in every single level of raiding, not just the hardcore. Its a butterfly effect, and since you have 40 different variables, aka 40 raid members, it starts real fucking easy
---
every warriors dream... to be able to always be in fury using thunderfury
---
The skins just vendor very well and one of the better gold/hr activity you can do. Light and medium are pretty crappy, but the latter ones are all vendor.
---
Numbers in the thousands or tens of thousands are nothing for a computer.  We're talking about a function that takes way less than a millisecond and only runs when logging in or partying up.  It will have zero affect.
---
Ya I'm just saying the term itself is silly. Most of the time it's used as just an insult. Like "growing up" is somehow going to prevent ignorance. It doesn't. It never did.
---
How do you hit 60 that fast? :-0 I had a hunter for 6 months that I only got to 55...
---
Wait, why are they removing bugs? If classic doesn’t launch with bugs, than it is not a true vanilla experience.
---
I demand some bugs!
---
Unless they are expected to take a boat load of damage off the bat, I wouldn't recommend pre-shielding a warrior or bear tank. They rely on damage taken to generate a portion of their rage, which absorbs do not grant.
---
And that's why I loved being a horde priest.  Manaburn for daysssss
---
Failures should be included in your 40 hour workweek. If that’s not calculated into your 40 hour workweek it’s a failure of management not doing their job. Crunch time has absolutely nothing to do with failures.
---
You’re pretending this issue is more complex than it really is.
---
I'm happy they are fixing bugs, but are we really going to praise them for just doing what they are expected to do?
---
The beta has been out for over a month and there's only two months left. The amount of large bugs they've fixed is minuscule in comparison to the amount of bugs left to go. It's progress, but not much. Definitely not enough to be excited about.
---
Mate, I think we both want to see this game launch successfully. But talking about the issues and keeping the spotlight on them helps dev's see the community cares and notices this stuff. If you want to bury your head in the sand so you don't have to "feel nervous" then feel free. But we are trying to be realistic here. Lots of issues still left and today's beta patch ameliorated was unfortunate in the sense that they only tackled a handful.
---
Gladiator as a clicker? Something doesn't add up here.
---
Anyway you don't need either a gaming mouse nor do you need to switch to esdf. I had 45 keybinds on my pally that I can name to this day.
---
1-7 (maybe up to 6 if your fingers aren't long), qertfgzxcvb + shift modifier for all of those including numbers already puts you at 36. Add in f1-f4 you're at 40. You won't need more in classic.
---
Is there? I don't personally notice any delay when playing BFA, but I'm playing in the EU region (if that matters.)
---
That sounds hard for my ADHD brain, xD.
---
You really seem to have trust issues. They’ve been fixing things constantly to make it as close to vanilla as possible. Not everyone is out to get you. We’re going to have to agree to disagree here.
---
sounds more like she was *flown* around the country and that caused a lot of discord... If the booty call was flying herself out, alright. But if you had to fly out the booty call...
---
I don't know about that. Having two static factions hurt the game and the PVP has never been great.
---
Apparently we have some computer science experts here who think it will.
---
&gt; asmongold boys
---
Cant take this post serious
---
Didn't ask for praise or excitement, just patience and constructive feedback
---
Does the epic robe not require tailoring to continue to equip?
---
I would not call myself an expert :)  
---
So i would go for a variation of the famous [moonglow](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0xcMxsZZxgcoxq) spec, one is for wrath spamming but starfire is much more fun.   
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0xcMEsoZxtcoxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0xcMEsoZxtcoxo)   
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0xcMtsxZxtcoxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0xcMtsxZxtcoxo)   
---
You should be alright but be open to getting more points into [nature's focus,](https://classicdb.ch/?search=nature%27s+f) ofc barkskin helps but since he might be running no threath reduction talents he might pull aggro quickly after the first few big heals and barkskin needs to be used pre fight to really be worth it as it takes both a global cooldown and another second on the spell cast. Packs with more then 4 mobs would be the biggest possibility for this to happen I belive.   
---
During leveling it would be quite more open, gear will especially in the early parts be much more impactfull, my partner leveled as balance and with great int+spirit gear getting the talent reflection after improved wrath and 15% manaregg during combat really helps with the high downtime so in your case if you always are together it will be highly valuable compared to , even if its quite a lot slower then feral  
---
It would certainly be possible for him to go feral aswell and try to do most dmg as a cat, taking natural shapeshifter before most feral talents is not a bad idea at all. Deep in the feral tree you find heart of the wild making feral druids in decurse gear having sometimes higher mana pool then resto druids. Something like this at 60  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxhxscbdxVvc0co](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxhxscbdxVvc0co)   is perhaps more what you talked about.   
---
Have you figured out your names yet?
---
I'd be fine with this scenario as long as she was bringing enough for the entire class.
---
I play both factions pretty regularly, but I would never base a character choice off of another player, even if they were a reliable person. It is a recipe for disaster.
---
Most retail dps rotation aren't much complicated, they generally follow a priority system.  But at least that gives you room to optimize how well you execute on top of how well you get geared.
---
Very smart. Build up a good working guild, be an absolute asshat so everyone leaves by their own, keep all the guild bank gold.
---
Nah, I'd spill it. Cheaters deserve to be outed at any chance.
---
&gt; I know what is fun and what is not
---
I didn't realize this was an objective matter.
---
This made it for me lol
---
Two static factions is very problematic and a lot of servers were ruined by it.
---
I'd bet my life that with the same gear, warrior or rogue would just shit on the ret AND be actualy usefull in BG-premades. I played ret and I know I killed a lot of people, but I also know that war/rogue/mage etc were much more useful than ret in our BG premades.
---
Did you know the vods are available during the stream too? Go to the videos tab and in "Past Broadcasts" you'll see the current stream.
---
It shouldn't DR trap though.
---
Is layering gone? No? So what did they "fix"?
---
Yah well I've been playing all week, helping guildies with whatever they needed..
---
If that ain't enough that guild don't need me, and I don't need them.
---
Working correctly so cant be fixed. 
---
They fixed aoe leeway though, it was increased by two yards.
---
Warsong server? Exacly the same thing happened on my guild.
---
And yet all the major bugs are still there. There is zero feedback.
---
Working correctly, or are you talking about aeo leeway? They fixed that, increased the leeway by two yards.
---
I don’t think there’s any advantages there, would be awesome to loot instantly
---
It's possible he was a really good player. Or they had a lot of mages as is.
---
What do u mean by hooking up? Were they coincidentally living near each other? Or were they skype-sexing or something? Or did they spend hundreds to fly to one another? I gotta know
---
I love hearing good patch news but can we be a bit realistic here, these bugs have existed for ages and loads of bugs still exist with hunter
---
&gt; implying the only fix for layering is to remove it
---
Not even going to entertain this my guy. Go find the posts on the sub about it.
---
That raid experience is honestly no different than what the DPS go through, pressing one button over and over.
---
While you do have a point about people and their obsession for complaining about minor, irrelevant shit, i dont blame the player base for being skeptical because blizzard has done all they can to prove that beta's arent really worth shit when it comes to fixing issues. I've played for 10 years and the last FOUR fucking expansions (BFA, Legion, WoD, MoP) have had multitudes of issues that should have been fixed during the beta period. 
---
People say shit like this all the time. 'Its just Beta, stop freaking out, blizz will fix it!!!!!"
---
When in reality it never does and the playerbase is ignored again.
---
&gt;thinking they were Holy Warriors
---
this, I expected less dmg but more healing. what I got in vanilla was gutted spec that had 70% spells removed right before release for some stupid ass reason and then it took them at least two expansions to get them on "even" ground.
---
&gt;I hate people that incite to mindless hate
---
Lol. Where did I "incite". The only one inciting anything here is you!
---
I just said I hate streaming. I didn't say other people should hate it.
---
He did it a couple of times with guilds along with various terrible MC runs with mats reserved. I don't think he actually did any real gold farming for the entire server. He just spend guild / reserved item for the whole thing.
---
Absolutely. If my daughter is a grown ass adult she can do what she wants.
---
If you were playing a build like fhat it is most certainly so that you can play solo.
---
You seriously have no idea what you're talking about right now. 
---
When a project comes down, my team lead, project manager, or director will ask me what I think a general timeline looks like to complete that task. We then use an equation called PERT which is an industry standard way to tell how long you need to budget for tasks/projects. That equation takes into account the fact that failures happen and adjusts based off of developer estimates. Those estimates are all tallied up and thats your development window. Sometimes you go over, but you still have a deadline you have to meet so you need to work extra to ensure that you meet those needs. My management didn't fail me, the job is just more complex than you understand.
---
I'm honestly done with this conversation. It's extremely evident that you have little to no idea how my industry works and therefore you can't even be considered to have an opinion worth entertaining as an alternative persepctive. Have a good day.
---
well i guess all the millions upon millions of people in Spain who play wow and can't speak any English will struggle
---
Yes but it’s common to do the kill quests in Loch Modan to grind to 12 before hitting Westfall
---
That's one thing from vanilla that was really common that will be a lot harder to get away with in 2019.
---
I definitely disagree. The wrong animation looks like he's rushing to the bathroom trying to hold in a shit. It completely lacks any smoothness.
---
It’s because classic wow has got the attention of retail players and turned this reddit into a gong show lol
---
No playing football isn't a job.
---
Playing foot ball and buying cameras and mics and streaming you playing football is complete different than that...
---
Lok'tar
---
Peace, friend
---
Nah mate just throw down a Rank 1 consecrate for rogues you're not using it for damage against a rogue.
---
Irrelevant, didn't you hear, Blizz did something, so we are all supposed to forget about the fact that 90% of bugs still remain and cheer!!!!
---
And that's why you bring 6 Shaman to every raid! And 4 Hunters.
---
You’re gonna be underleveled for a lot of Westfall if you go straight there after started zones.
---
All true except that is a new team that is focused on answering one demand: legacy servers. After what they communicated, what they conveyed on stress tests and spawning fun shit in major locations, I don't feel like they're the same people, so we shouldn't treat em like such
---
Way more important to me personally
---
Hard to compare, I was not clicking spells or keyboarturning back in vanilla and I was destroying pretty much everyone except naxx geared tanks (who also knew how to play) and rank14 rogues and warriors who just did way too much dmg compared to mine BWL asscandy ret. I'd argue that even more people will know how to counter/kite ret and since ret has literaly no gap closer, it is gg.     
---
Also one of the major points I don't want to roll paladin is the group pvp/rank14 push. Either I go holy or I won't get spot, simple as that.
---
My guild failed because of tbc prepatch not because of drama
---
Yeah football shoes comes for free!
---
True that she can do what she wants. That doesn’t mean a parent is not allowed to have an opinion? That’s what I’m asking here
---
&gt; 80% of them will get to level 25 after 3 weeks and reroll.
---
Most solo warriors I see this happening as they watch other classes fly past them. Even more so once they hit STV and cannot for the life of them get WW axe and just die to every class over and over again while struggling to single pull mobs in a massive shit fest of roaming animals that'll fuck your pulls up and kill you. I remember leveling a warrior in vanilla after I got my rogue to 60 and it was a nightmare. Although once I got sweeping strike, WW axe, and WW skill I cruised with semi twink gear, getting there was a slog and not having the ability to pump up your stats will be a pain.
---
I want to add that being knew to vanilla and only ever being invited to tank a dungeon and failing over and over again is quite the painful experience that a lot of retail players are going to have to go through.
---
Eh, I'm used to them by now. I'm just glad that they devs aren't caving in to the demands of retail fans and they are genuinely trying to keep is authentic.
---
invis pot + reckbomb = rogue ambush xD
---
We had a girl in my raiding guild in wotlk who slept with three guys from our 25 man. She wasn't great looking or anything but she was thin enough to be considered attractive. And I doubt she was the biggest ho on wow, so I believe this guy's story.
---
The Regulators and Vanquish breakup on Laughing Skull is legendary.
---
Two Alliance guilds that dominated world bosses like Kazakk and Azuregos.  A partnership that came to an end during a Nightmare Dragon attempt.
---
As a TR officer I had already stopped playing by then
---
Man half the fun or hilarity of Vanilla was the people interactions and drama you got to hear.  Had a buddy play a female night elf with a female sounding name and never dissuaded any thirsty dudes messaging him of his possibly being a lady, the free stuff they sent him was hilarious.  
---
Priest class lead during MC raiding kept seeming to be half afk during a boss fight, turns out she was having sex during the raid with her boyfriend and ended up pregnant, should of named the kid after the raid boss.  
---
Different guild in vanilla the priest class lead has his wife playing but lets her be class lead of hunters despite not knowing jack all and being a real B.  Well thankfully guild leader was a hunter and could over ride her more terrible ideas or loot calls for the hunters but that just pissed her off and her husband wasn't taking her side so one night in BWL she hulks out and chucks one of those old heavy tube monitors at his head during the raid, he is talking on vent at the time and we hear a loud crash and yelling.   That was the end of their raiding and her playing, think they divorced about 6 months later.  
---
So many ladies that were married or involved with someone who also played but sending their nudes to various members and pics ending up on the guild forums and it all going nuclear.  Was like a Jerry Springer show online. Funny times.
---
I like [MrVoletron's remix.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtWfhkC4A_A)

Signing a petition is not a vote.
---
Horde. Shaman really captures a nice fantasy for me. Paladin feels like...Youre a priest that WANTS to go warrior.
---
+ 1 to this, I remember when Asmongold was just a wee YouTube channel with like 80k subscribers, he really has put countless time into WoW because of how much he loves it. He has admitted himself that he ‘acts’ on twitch because that’s what gets views/subs/whatever, but he definitely cares. 
---
Now recently some of that power may have gone to his head, I don’t enjoy watching quite as much as when he was smaller and a bit more level headed. 
---
I think overall he is a positive influence on the direction of classic, but don’t play on the server he’s playing on.
---
he said artificially re-created. meaning it was re-created to exist when it didn't exist in their *current* architecture
---
Maxed everything with any increases to draw distance and mouse wheel zoom.  Not that I need to babe super zoomed out all the time, it's just a nice option to have.  But definitely maxed graphics and as much draw distance and the game will allow.
---
My computer was running the stress test at something absurd like 550 peak and ~430 average with the baseline settings cranked to 10/max.  I figure even with an addon/console command adding extra draw distance, as long as I stay over 150 steady FPS I'm good to go.
---
After seeing the game during the stress test and side by side comparing to private servers, I'm just so disappointed in what the private scene has to offer me until Classic release. I don't really care what Vanilla looked like back in the day, my computer could only handle so much back then and I'm glad for a "remastered" look this time around.
---
Your comment history shows you spamming this comment all over the sub and it's straight up wrong.
---
Hunters were not this glitchy bugged-up class you make them out to be, in fact I don't think they had any *major* bugs on release. 
---
Right now there are *major* bugs in the beta from laggy pet responsiveness to DR traps to leeway deadzone etc..
---
There is still an insane amount of work to be done and you're downplaying it.
---
Doesn't spell batching make it much easier to have a ton of people interacting?  I know in BFA if you get 100ish people together in the open world and start fighting each other it goes beyond lag.
---
The two Kruul screenshots 25 -&gt; 26 make for an awesome before and after
---
Here's an option, don't layer yourself out of PvP. And if someone layers out of your bank, then pretend that they went offline? Is ganking really that important to you?
---
People definitely used to pay the $500 to fly girls out. Some guys just have better game online and for some people talking on vent might be the only real conversations they had with women.
---
haha this is OP favorite screenshot because he was OBSSESSED with that priest on Frostwolf
---
Not to sound rude or sth, but I find this worse than a 3-year-olds recreation of Mona Lisa. Also it's not recoloured, it's just way too saturated. This is a mild insult to the original in my book.
---
1. They don't have the 1.5 AV data. That's it. Also &gt;Turning in quests or doing wolves/rams. AV lasting days, I loved that part of the classic and a lot of us have that nostalgia for it to return.
---
This is entirely possible on 1.12 as well.
---
2. Cross realm BG's secure a proper balanced pvp scene. You have plenty of time to get to know your opposite faction in phase and especially phase 2, and you will still see people on your server in BG's.
---
Another mage is competition for dps. Boomie helps pump their own numbers up.
---
I think rogues were made immune to damage after vanishing on purpose. It use to be that if Rogues vanished while a spell was in flight the spell would still hit and the rogue would be removed from stealth. The easiest fix was to make rogues immune for a small time so that any in air spell wouldn't cause them to fall out of stealth.
---
Even though I don't play Alliance the one city that has always held a spot of fascination in me was the Dwarven home of Ironforge.
---
Its frustrating because the tallents are in a "good place" its mainly the nonexistence of gear itemized the right way that prevents those specs from ever being viable.
---
They even got close to implementing enough gear with the right itemization in aq40 but they didn't quite commit hard enough.
---
Prot Pallies just needed some jewelery/set pieces with Stm, +defence, + spell damage, mp5 to tank.  But pallies were never able to get to the defense min while also having enough damage for threat or mana for abilities, so pallies were never viable as tanks.  
---
All ret or enhance or boomkin really needed was endgame two handers with a proc that returns a significant amount of mana.  And if the worry was that people would spec that to be a healer while using that weapon then they could have implemented any number of creative solutions like having the proc apply a -minus healing done debuff for a while after procing. 
---
We didn't discover it in Vanilla, but apparently feral will be viable in classic almost solely due to the lvl 40 helm that enables powershifting or that lvl 30 haste hammer from Gnomer.  Bliz could make a lvl 60 version of that helm with actual stats, or end game hammer with the same activated ability but no charge count.
---
Fire mages could have been viable if they had a quest to get a trinket that made their fire spells damage fire immune mobs.  Arcane could have gotten a trinket or something that gave arcane missiles a chance to proc a free presence of mind. 
---
Hunters could have played something besides marksman if only there was an alternative to Trueshot aura.   What Beastmaster or Survival hunters gave their group an attack  power buff whenever they activated beast within or Wyvren sting?  
---
Boomkins or Elemental or Shadow would be viable if they got a stacking mp5 buff from casting damaging spells.  A trinket that gave "a chance to gain +5 mp5 for 15 seconds" that stacks up to 5 stacks or whatever could go a very long way towards shoring up the whole reason these classes don't work: ele, shadow, and boomkin just don't have enough mana. I am sure the numbers could be tuned in such a way as to make shadow or boomkin viable but still not be useful for  healers.
---
it goes to show you how much this sub has changed. all the retail bois are in here now, and the moment they see Blizzard so much as release a tweet, they explode with joy. If you so much as utter a single negative word you get downvoted to oblivion here.
---
A Priest and Hunter in our guild were dating in real life.  Had been together for a few years.  The Priest was our guild's main healer and was always grouped with our Main Tank, so she and the MT hit it off.  Long story short, the MT and Priest start vibing on each other, eventually start camming (it was 2004...), Priest and Hunter break up, and then MT pays for the Priest to fly down and visit for a weekend.  They hook up, obviously.  Around the same time, MT's casual relationship with another girl (non-WoW related) starts transitioning from casual to serious.  MT goes cold-turkey on the Priest and basically ghosts her.
---
I think the Priest and Hunter got back together after that.  Not sure.
---
Are they hybrid resto specs? If so, can you still deal some decent damage?
---
The DPS in my party seem to think it is. Only reason I can imagine they are constantly doing it in combat.....
---
Except it was a 300 pound dude pulling nudes from the web
---
I absolutely agree with your point of view.
---
Still, as an European...I have REALLY hard time to applaud Blizzard's hard work until they do an 180 on EU language realms, because if their decision stay, Classic WoW in EU will be a mess, and shortly after launch, a significant amount of EU players will just go back to private servers, heavily impacting the EU realm population and the Classic WoW image in general.
---
So, yeah, props to Blizz for their hard work (actually, prop to Classic Team)...but their decision on EU realms is NOT A BUG, it is a worrisome decision, based on Blizzard's inability to understand 1/3rd of the Classic player base.
---
Why crop it though, the widescreen was great
---
It's called an analogy. You're saying you shouldn't complain about multiple things, and should be happy with a single victory, and I'm showing you that's stupid. The fact that you can't grasp an analogy just means you also think you're wrong, as you agree it's okay to complain about multiple things for some subjects, but not others, purely based on your own opinion of what is "worthy" of complaining about. If the world only cared about the things you cared about, it would be a terrible place. Thankfully, there are lots of people, caring about lots of different things.

Re : Right click to report 
---
* I don't believe this is being removed. 
---
* Rather , like other Betas and PTRs before it , it's simply disabled on beta. 
---
* In the Customer support panel you access via the ? button on the bottom button bar  Account Security , Report a Player and Open a Ticket are all greyed out and disabled
---
* These exact options are ALSO greyed out and disabled on the 8.2 PTR
---
* Those 3 options are commonly disabled on Betas for expansions as well as on most PTRs. Primarily as the  back end support systems don't cover anything on beta or PTR as that's QA's territory. Them pipes aren't even connected up.
---
* I honestly don't think they will disable the in game Account Security KB nor the ability to make a ticket in game or report a player on 8.2 once it's live
---
* Therefore I don't believe it's being removed for Classic
---
It's less whining and more taking a second to point out the ridiculous circlejerk this sub can be at times. Self-awareness is a valuable life skill.
---
No one cares.
---
According to your logic I can need everything. I can sell BoP items to a vendor, so they are also money and "I need money".
---
Sorry, but I find that reasoning/behavior unbelievably selfish. BoE or BoP, I don't care ... if you don't need the item itself, roll greed! You would instantly land on my ignore list
---
Great, now they can fix layering
---
oh yeah mate. hold my beer while I fix 2 out of 49 bugs, and fanboys will leap to blizzards defense
---
Then those warriors are absolutely clueless and have shit gear
---
As an adult? None of my business one way or another. But generally I am sex work positive. Why hate on someone, especially family, for getting paid what what they can give away for free?
---
actuallly, i only miss the office memes
---
What excuses? You made a claim that was proven false. 
---
You're literally clinging onto "you can't hate streamers because you actively (how do you know this btw? Are you in my bushes?) Seek out livestreamfail content."
---
So your first assumption is:
---
1. I do this often
---
2. I actively navigate to that sub
---
3. That since today's top post isn't on r/all, I couldn't have possibly ever seen a few livestream fail clips on r/all
---
4. That EVERYONE on r/livestreamfails loves streamers, and watches the shit on that sub because they support it.
---
Please let me know how you reached all those conclusions.
---
Stress test, which is now over.
---
Nah everyone else can login it’s just you.
---
I see

in an attempt to make it 4:3 CRT compatible.
---
Amazing
---
The main reason arms excels in 5 mans is sweeping strikes. But you better let your healer know you'll have agro from time to time. 2h tanking in 5 mans will still require a bit of good gear so it's not very viable at the start compared to.. lets say a mage, who can just aoe slow everything everything or CC and still do more ST damage. Even early when you're trying to build your pre-raid BiS fury is going to be meh because your hit chance will be dog shit. Mages with their free 6% hit chance excel at early 5 mans.
---
It's not one, it would be three servers (PVP, PVE and RP), at which point you could argue for the same for Germany, France and probably Italy too. Maybe I'm misunderstanding you but nobody said this was a technical problem. This is 100% about demand. 
---
They could probably host some layers in Sydney though.
---
"me not that kind of orc"
---
I watch as others go insane trying to decide on a class to main...and I'm sitting here thinking, "the choice is obvious."

Not a bug but intentional, and it is apparently working in the beta per responses I got in last Sunday's simple question thread.

lllooollll

Shaman(enh) mage or lock.

Solo leveling and mainly PvE semi-hardcore but want to sprinkle in a lot of PvP.

well said
---
That is actually gross, unless he paid those girls for thier services.
---
To be fair if I was a raid leader and one of my guild raiders was applying for other guilds to raid with I wouldn't want to give them any gear. I certainly wouldn't have gkicked you or been nasty about it, or even prevented you from joining the raid. But I don't think I'd let you roll on gear if your plan was to leave. Sounds like there was other stuff going on behind all of that but just a little outside perspective.

---
That you repost something and you don’t have the beta
---
Damn that lady is insane. She needs some help.
---
You can install the game, but no servers are open so you can’t log in.
---
Depends on what you think "decent" damage is. No druid spec does good damage in PvE. Could you do it anyway? Ya sure.
---
Yup, I use different modifiers for each. You can see a little bit of how I manage my spells in my post. My scheme is really similar, with a few caveats.
---
My regular abilities are on 1-5 in each form, but I always can full heal with mod:shift, rank 1 heal with mod:ctrl, or self heal with mod:alt. If I am targeting an enemy, the same scheme instead casts harmful spells. So in animal forms, holding a modifier makes my bar look like my caster form's bar.  
---
Originally, I tried including modifiers in my caster form's 1-5 to use animal abilities. The reason I didn't is the animal forms don't start with a full resource bar (even considering Furor). I can switch out of animal form and be a fully functional caster, but when I shift into animal form there are only a couple abilities I can even use.
---
But anyway, I'm going to post all this again in a couple days. I'm sure you'll see it then.
---
Le Source 
---
my memory
---
Not sure what you mean by "lw creating stuff for mount".
---
There were no leatherworking mounts in classic.
---
well good ret is better than shit mage/rogue so I kinda agree. thing is if you can pick the best players, you will pick a mage/warrior/rogue over ret, because healing and dispel = healers, repe = sheep is better and burst, well rogue/war says hi.     
---
your point with fewer people is true, 2v2 and I'd argue the ret/hybrids are the gods. Even 1v1 if equaly geared can be a 50:50 but in BGs, where people farm rank14, bit different story.
---
Ok thanks :D
---
No need to be an asshole...
---
That spell isnt ready yet.
---
Yep, definitely want to avoid streamers and the mindless horde of zombies that came with them.
---
If you're on a private server with GM powers, rank 14 is actually rank 18. They count not having a rank as one, then there is actually 3 negative ranks. Outlaw, Pariah, and Exiled (I forget the order)
---
The 1.12 client and many versions of wow don't utilize modern CPU cores.  1.12 runs on a single core of your processor..probably where the hiccups come in for you. Not sure if the new classic client utilizes the changes they made recently to use all cores.
---
The whole Misere/Apotheosis Gnomeregan drama shitfest?
---
All of those features are already present in the beta.
---
&gt;"Good" times, but I don't think I'll be joining a guild that uses DKP when classic comes out. 
---
Simple fix to to assign DKP per character instead of player.
---
100% agree.
---
People can have opposing informed opinions. What irks me is when people are in the echo chamber and won't even listen to an opposing view or take in any information that may run counter to their existing beliefs. Happens so often in web communities and game-specific subs tend to suffer from fan fanaticism.
---
druid own priests. lol
---
That's awesome, dude. As for me, I'm self-sufficient, but I can't save any money and my job is literally making me sick. Everyday I try to find that perfect situation where I can be independent AND happy. It's tough. I wish you the best of luck, friend.
---
Currently, ignoring today's maintenance, you can only play Classic if you were given access to the Beta Test by Blizzard. Everyone (in NA at least) was given access to Classic in the launcher so they could participate in last weeks stress test. The 
---
Unless you know you have Beta Test access you should not be able to access any servers. The 'no servers available" message is what I see. I don't have Beta access. For the moment you may as well uninstall that client data from the launcher. 
---
There is another stress test scheduled for July 19th/20th (IIRC) which you may or may not have access to. There's been no real word on that from Blizzard, except that EU players are supposed to have access to it (again IIRC).
---
Haha I know. Maybe I got carried by my awesome guildies and comps but I managed to get Glad in 5's and 3's in a couple seasons.
---
Murr - Dragonblight, I dont know if they have the seasons stats anywhere.
---
I did buy a x600 logitech but I think I'll use your keybinds on top, especially the shift modifiers.
---
Can you shift modify your 12 buttons on your mouse as well? I'm assuming yes.
---
I Love the Classic wow dev Team. For me they have restored a lot of faith in Blizzard
---
I for one wouldn't have minded keeping suggest invite in. Especially on EU servers where we'll be speaking 35 different languages.
---
Sorry for the delay. 
---
https://discord.gg/CTS26Zx
---
Or merely a trick of the light
---
&gt;Hearthstone - don’t even wanna think about it
---
Because it’s a good game and it being good doesn’t fill your agenda? We all love to shit on blizzard, but there’s been expansions that are good (BC WoTLk Legion) mediocre (MoP Cata BfA) and WoD.
---
We get it. You don’t like transmogs, you don’t like group finder, you don’t like the AP grind, you don’t like LFR. But the game is still competitive (mythic 1st, MDI, Arena Championship) and perfectly playable while ignoring the side stuff like pet-battles, WQs and so on. 
---
I have faith in Blizzard that 8.2 is going to bring bfa a cut above what it is now. I like classic, even though I wasn’t around for the real deal, but something that I don’t understand is this garbage mentality that “if i don’t like it then it surely must suck for everyone.”
---
I find the very concept pretty shitty as a whole tbh. Whether it's recipes, BoEs or anything where Need and Greed is clearly distinguishable. If you are going to use it: Need; If you are going to sell it: Greed
---
The problem with doing it in certain groups is that people will get used to it, thus making it all the more difficult to find any pugs that handle this differently.
---
Does this change the gameplay or feel weird?
---
Because I hate when run animations slide above the ground.  
---
For me it's about at the same trigger level as actors drinking from empty cups.  
---
It's just wrong.
---
(Yeah, blablabla no changes ... but you gotta stop at polishing.  
---
It's in now, but I don't get why you would want wrong animations🤔)
---
My guild leader got flak for taking the guild too seriously and ignoring his normal life. 
---
He was basically ostracized within the guild until we merged with another guild, thereby dissolving ours. I felt bad for him. He was a good guy.
---
pages?
---
Ya let’s assume she’s an adult. And sure, it’s their choice.
---
In this case the payment is is gaming pixels, I’m sure she wasn’t re selling those items some way or even her account. No monetary value here.
---
It’s not about hating, but wanting the best for your kids. It’s I crdibly dangerous for people to share such private photos with strangers. What’s to stop someone from posting that online for more people to see? Without her consent, that’s is something that could ruin her life.
---
Surprised how many ppl are asking this question. Shamans heal in PvE mate no two ways about it. If you play resto for a good guild they might let you go ehn when it’s on farm. 
---
Even in PvP ele is one of the hardest hitting specs in the game. Ehn in classic is like playing a slot machine hoping wind fury procs.
---
Looks like your reading skill was delayed lol.  
---
But yeah, no idea
---
Yeah,  just the time sink to level and gear 2 different toons would suck lol,  I'd go alliance tbh but gnomes you can't see their armour and humans ,  well I just think the gnomes facials are better,  but undead just looks good as a mage and WotF is awesome! That's the only reason I'm going horde
---
Man this has been reposted so many times it should actually be put under "comedy" at this point
---
Classic is gonna be so good, I cannot believe Blizzard went so many extra miles to make it amazing!
---
This looks very helpful, thank you!
---
Agreed!  Completely.  Good to know there's someone else of like mind out there.  All the guides tell you to go straight down the combat tree and it just feels like Malice (and Imp Evis as you mentioned come to think of it) will have more of a positive impact when leveling.
---
The "correct" way looks dumb imo. Ice skating vs actually sprinting.
---
herb/alch. black lotus will be piles of gold if you can find it, and flasks/consumables for raiding sell on the ah amazingly.
---
I'm EU and 100% aboard on your concern, this is an actually worrying problem, we should make a big post about this somehow, just to show the community is there and asking for it, this problem wasn't really linked to my post, I was talking about the actual bugs and all that are being worked out. However, I would say, I think they know this is a fucked up decision and they're probably debating it. If they don't 180 as you say, there will be forks and torches.
---
what is the BiS weap to use with this setup?  And isn't the AQ40 set slightly higher spelldamage/better stats?
---
Nope was alliance :)
---
Damn! I guess getting laid would be worth 500$ if it’s that or nothing. Funny thing is, you could just troll last call at your local dive, and still probably get some with minimal social skills and avoid buying someone else’s plane ticket.
---
Not super juicy but fucked up nonetheless. Also not during vanilla. But during wrath our guild leader mained a resto shaman. And as such claimed the legendary mace from Ulduar. So we spent all of our time in there farming for his mace. And one night we finally got it. Felt like a great accomplishment for the guild. We all logged off happy. Next day we logged on all guildless. The GM had kicked everyone from the guild took everything in the guild bank, probably around 400k gold and transfered servers. All over night.
---
I have doubts that they will raise the lvl cap in beta anytime soon.
---
If they will actually do it in the first place.
---
I might me wrong, but I don't see the beta being available for too long.
---
what did they change ?
---
I raided as a Holy Paladin in Vanilla.  I will be doing the same this time around, so obviously I found it rewarding.
---
Lol ok valid point. I've never played a shaman, or done hardcore pvp, but I see what you mean now
---
Remember, in group PvP that warrior is probably also chuggin free action pots/getting blessing of freedom/getting WF totem or other nonsense.
---
DKP kind of makes sense in a world where no one knows what gear is coming and most people don't quite know what gear is worth getting over others due to lack of experience or game knowledge. Outside of that limited context it's pretty terrible.

I never seen anything reserved up until wotlk, don’t know if I was just very lucky.
---
I'll be playing a Paladin and plan to have mining/blacksmithing--not sure yet if I'll level with mining/skinning for some extra cash. I plan to level a Hunter alt to have herbalism/alchemy for those sweet consumes (and arcanite transmute).
---
Idk I’m so excited I can’t play normal wow.
---
Shaman are raid healers, enh dps sucks.
---
Enh is the shaman leveling spec. Both Ele and Enh Shaman go OOM veryfast leveling, but you can at least conserve mana a lot more as Enh.
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler is more of a recent phenomenon - at least I was never aware of it during vanilla.  I played a feral druid and always just used The Unstoppable Force (for dps) or Unyielding Maul (for tanking).  Manual Crowd Pummeler may have a unique and "BiS" effect, but it isn't "necessary" in my opinion.
---
I used to be the main tank in a pretty hard core raiding guild. One night we where clearing hyjal and we where at the 4th boss cant think of his name right now. Anyways we finish clearing the trash waves and the boss is now coming straight for me and I had a priest healer that was dedicated to heal me, well instead of spam healing me she was just wanding the boss so of course i eat two giant hits in a matter of a second and end up dieing. The guild master instantly demoted her from office to raider. 
---
She stuck with the guild and continued to heal me in black temple. 
---
Guild was end effect on server anub'arak and I loved raiding with them. Miss you all.
---
Nothing you say excuses more than 40 hours of work a week. You’re really not getting my point so I agree it’s better we end this.

YOU CAN'T JUST REMOVES TREES FROM STORMWIND !!!
---
TREE PIXELS MATTER !
---
We could just all talk about how excited we are for classic :)
---
do you have a link?  I read up a lot on the development of the horde stuff back in the day, but haven't really read much alliance/pally specific
---
I liked healing, but an aspect that drove me crazy was bosses where the raid needed to spread out and the person I was told or wanted to heal/decurse/rez/innervate/whatever would be out of range and I would know where they were. Then I'd feel like an a useless fool because I wasn't completing the task I was asked or wanted to do. Maybe guild and raid leadership just wasn't organized enough - we didn't go much beyond BWL - but in those situations it felt as if I was doing something wrong, but didn't really know how to improve. I'm thinking about rolling Priest this time around, but I'm kind of dreading that feeling. Anyone have any tips for dealing with that?
---
HUNTER'S EPIC BOW.  i mean the one you get for killing the demons and turning in the sniue.  i had to wait being some idiot huntard that coldn't even kill the demons to get the sinue first even tho i had already killed all the demons. sigh. that person never did finish the quest chain.  so yea definelty the hunter epic bow. fuck waiting on huntard idiots and assholes despawning the demons for the quests.
---
Dunno, never needed it. Probably can.
---
Excuse my lack of knowledge, i was a dirty night elf in vanilla. Wouldnt raids have "enchantment shamans" with their melee but still tell them to heal instead of dps. I know all my guilds didn't really care what spec the healers were so long as they acted as healers during the raids. Our main tank healer (my dad) was 100% specced for protection all the way to naxx (we never down a naxx boss but TBC was a month out when we started trying so people didn't really care anymore.)
---
This comment just teleported me back to 2006
---
It exists in the current architecture, it is just a much tighter timing that you hardly ever see the previously common simultaneous actions.
---
The reason it was fixed was due to the ongoing pressure. So no, I doubt the community will 'chill out' until we receive a finished product. 
---
If this was just a hobby project that blizz wanted to revive for no profit, sure. But there are going to be millions subscribing, so a level of quality is expected.
---
They did say they will give Vanilla, but with Blizzard level of 'quality'....their words. 
---
The majority still wait patently, silently.
---
&gt;We are TWO months away from release day.
---
That is more than enough time to nerf paladins into the ground and break the class for the following 8 years.
---
The buff for increased attack power on windfury totem swings is 21-23 pts on the enhance tree

I leveled a sub hybrid in vanilla. I always just kept making rogues- and that’s how I did it. Slower? Hmm idk- it’s easy to ignore mobs to get quest items or into that back room. If you pull right you can dispatch enemies faster then combat.
---
Would you be kind and listing out your addons? I really like the layout and feel they provide.
---
I’m out of the loop. People have already said it was dead?
---
I trust the devs. I don't trust upper management who likely made the decision about adding layering. Blizzard has not proven themselves to be a very trustworthy company, it's not that I just blindly refuse to trust someone.
---
This is why F R E S H servers are so popular

what the fuck

I was co-gm to the biggest twink guild on the server, I was only 13ish around that time same as the GM, It ran for years till blizzard killed twinks

Also, Ill make sure she understands the first rule of the internet is to never show your face to people you don't trust.  Every one knows you never put your face in a nude shot, and while its kinda weird to think about having to teach my kids that idea, its no less weird then teaching them proper gun safety. Except sex is normal and nature, and firearms are by definition, a man made killing tool.
---
Pretty sure the summon system was added mid-TBC.
---
Will we know which servers are streamer servers so we can choose if we want to play on them or not?
---
So happy about this and I will happily rub it in the faces of those who said “it’s fine. it’s not big deal. the newer animation is just cool and updated.” No it was not fine. no changes.
---
While the stones where there in vanilla iirc, the ability to summon people using them wasn't introduced until TBC.
---
haha
---
Off topic, but due to your user name do you usually get private messages of private messages of a specific private message,  private messages of private messages of prime ministers, or private messages of pre-menstrual syndrome prime ministers?
---
&gt; HOWEVER, this is how you know that the fan base is really excited about something Blizzard is doing. They complain about everything and nitpick constantly.
---
Sort of, but not really. People _love_ tearing things down that others love/enjoy. People _love_ criticizing anyone and anything they can. There's equal parts people being anxious and nitpicky due to excitement and people just being dicks.
---
Meeting stones are some scuffed alpha version of LFG. It cannot be used to summon.
---
They were changed to summoning stones in TBC so they can be used to summon people to the dungeon.
---
This sub will invent something to bitch about, don't worry.
---
Most of these changes happened WAY AFTER tbc hit. (Wotlk pre patch)
---
Warlock, skipping professions except for first aid. Rush to 60 and then level up mining/engineering after I’m ahead of the curve. I’d rather not waste the half hour every couple hours to do professions and keep them relevant

fist of omokk!

Best leveling spec for shaman is enhance.  Figure out how to be efficient using mana and getting mostly full duration from your totems and you will easily grind through mobs, saving HP potions if you're going to die and always having an 'escape route' with earthbind-&gt; ghost wolf if needed. 
---
End game you can manage as enhance up through UBRS, but you should focus on acquiring a healing set of gear.  In 5 mans/UBRS, Enh is OK as an offtank, melee DPS and offhealer all kind of rolled into one.  Save your mana for totems and heals, or max rank earth shock if a squishy has aggro.  Be ready to put on a shield if you are taking hits.  You'll be an effective group member.  WF dps rivals other classes who are just trying to gear up, or you can even just go 1h+flametongue and wear a shield exclusively and be a lot beefier, tanking adds.   Someone did the math and 1h+flametongue is not too much worse than the regular 2h+windfury, a little bit less damage overall but VERY consistent so you aren't sitting there praying for procs. 
---
Enh PVP is fun but limited.  You can get 1-shots with a not-that great weapon like Unstoppable Force, but most of the time you are a prime CC target and will be focused by rogues, ms warriors and thus making it hard to get anything done. 
---
Raids won't take you as DPS for progression content unless they're short in spots.  For the 'serious' guilds in Classic you won't be able to get a spot as Enh, but shaman healers are in very high demand.
---
That’s horrible. I don’t see why people are confused about why layering is such a big deal to so many. I’d be really curious about anyone who doesn’t think that’s a massive problem. If I walk into a capital city and it’s empty when I know there are dozens/hundreds of players... that is NOT classic.
---
It originally existed for performance reasons, but the modern server architecture can dynamically adjust the interval, so it's always as short as possible. If there's tons of people around and processing takes a long time, the batching interval is adjusted upwards. If there's not a lot going on, it's much shorter, usually below 20 ms. This is going by what Blizzard said about it when they introduced the change in WoD.
---
To my understanding the reason BfA is so laggy is two-fold. First off they're running the server instances (because of phasing and sharding every zone is basically its own separate server) with minimal resources, because in the modern game you very rarely have a lot of people in the same place at the same time outside of capital cities.
---
Secondly the extra mechanical complexity in the modern game apparently makes it more expensive on the servers -- I've been told this was said by Ion in some interview a couple of months back, but I haven't been able to find said interview so it could be bollocks.
---
Check out this game called Battle for Azeroth
---
it means you have GM rights on the beta servers
---
Enh is by far the best shaman leveling spec.  Probably middle of the road or above average when compared to all classes leveling ability
---
Yeah thats what i thought. Cheers.
---
The Felwood one was based on the art of world of Warcraft book. Maybe the magic card uses that image? That's cool though.
---
11.000 replies on a freakin blue post. Imagine that and put it into comparison to not wanting to give us German servers...
---
"good enough"
---
At a certain point the numbers just got absolutely absurd.  I remember that people even managed to 3 man Onyxia in Naxx gear (before the TBC patch even dropped!)  
---
I never did get Tfury on my warrior, but even with BWL/Naxx/Aq40 mix gear I was able to "tank" ZG in berserker stance//fury spec just due to the fact that I had so much HP and armor that mitigation (and getting crit!) didn't matter, and  so much rage that I never dropped threat.
---
At level 40, on beta I've almost maxed out LW and cant use the majority of items I can create this is likely a product of level caps but, as you get to the upper levels it evens out.
---
&gt; Layers have the potential of disrupting the community aspect of the server, disrupting the economy, and other player population shenanigans (not seeing anyone in a major city while everyone is on different layers). Also avoiding world PvP by jumping layers. 
---
Yes...if it's permanent. Or stays for too long. But anyone that is not in a coma knows that layering will be removed at the end of Phase 1 , regardless, and it will probbaly be gone 2-3 weeks after launch, after tourists are gone, and everyone that is left enters "normal" playing mode (1 to 4 concurrent to total players ratio), instead "launch" playing mode (1 to 1 concurrent to total players ratio).
---
Same, I took 2 weeks off but my seasonal second job starts early Sept until start of Nov.  I will be crushing levels and gearing the first 2 weeks but then I will be almost inactive for 2 months.
---
Game sucks! I hate it! Gonna level to 60 and I’ll keep reminding that to everyone on barren’s chat.
---
NO CHILL!
---
So you don’t want the game to grow at all? Your ok with just having this content? I would love to see it grow in a way that is the opposite of the way current retail grew. Absolutely keep the core pace of the game in tune with vanilla but make all the classes more interesting and viable. This whole idea of underperforming specs in certain aspects of the game, in my opinion, hinders the gameplay experience. I don’t have the answers obviously, I’m not paid to, but to build on classic in the vanilla way is what I want this new blizzard strategy to become.
---
Yeah man personal fun is complete objective don’t you know?
---
And are you bringing 10 of them every night?
---
We want back the game we used to play. That’s what we asked Blizzard for and after years and years they finally agreed. Just because a bunch of you guys got pulled into the hype by Asmongold doesn’t mean you should be able to decide how the game gets remade by Blizzard.
---
if you're on a high pop server it may not necessarily be your fault. over time the servers get congested and the only way to fix this is by rebooting the servers, which typically occurs during scheduled maintenance windows. you could check by asking if other players are having the same issues
---
this place needs some xanax lmao
---
You mean they fixed that since the post about being able to run through a blizzard? I hope do. Or what does some leeway mean anyway?
---
I remember an add-on speeding it up, so yeah I think it was a big that was a part of the original release
---
I mained a priest and I found I was fine 1v1. You have a loot of good tools to deal with most situations. Against a lot of classes you can use mana burn to dry them out. Rogues and warriors were a bit harder but definitely do able unless there was a massive gear difference.
---
Oh my bad, I was speaking PvP! I'll probably heal PvE
---
I mean, they havent really done much to separate themselves from that stigma. It may be a different team, but its still Activision-Blizzard so that doesnt really inspire much faith. 
---
Yes, its important to recognize and appreciate the hard work the team has put into Classic, but lets not forget that the only reason Classic WoW is a thing is because the community collectively "forced" Blizz to make it. Also, call me pessimistic, but I don't feel legacy servers are a kindness extended from Blizz to the fans but rather an opportunity to save their slowly sinking ship (retail) and stabilize the player base.
---
MCP is a very recent development, and ferals (including myself) were raiding just find before its full potential was really tapped. It is perfectly possible to play without it, but the estimated damage increase is rumored to be massive (I've heard reports as high as 25% increase, although I'm doubtful that it's really that much). We can't possibly know for sure how all the math will work out until we are there in Classic, but it promises to be significant at the very least.
---
In a casual raiding setting, you should have no problems getting by without MCP. People have been doing it for years. If you with to be hardcore competitive as a feral druid, it will be 100% mandatory. 
---
In a PvP setting I don't predict MCP will be even remotely relevant. As other commentors pointed out, you aren't really after attack speed in that environment.
---
That's a relief to hear! Thank you!!
---
I'm running 1440p with 200% rendering.
---
Still doesn’t change what I said.
---
Just like those who will be disappointed if blizzard doesn’t remove layering.
---
If I were you I would prepare to either not play classic or be disappointed.
---
The assumption is that Blizzard only fixed it because of the insane amount of "pressure" from reddit/forums. It doesnt seem to cross the minds of some of these people that maybe Blizzard already knew about the issues, and was actively working on them. I get that we all want answers quickly. We want Blizzard to acknowledge the bugs and say "were aware of them, and actively working on them", but these panic threads on both reddit and the forums are getting out of hand. Not directed at you specifically, just a passing comment on what I have seen the last few days.
---
None of these changes happened in the WotLK pre-patch.
---
If you haven't taken the effort to farm Draconian deflector before you enter MC why should you deserve drillborer?
---
I pulled boss before Nef with Eye of Kilrogg and wiped the 40man because they gave a piece of loot to the warlock “class leader” instead of letting people roll. Hearthed and GQuit.
---
In 5 mans, Enhance shaman were great. Decent dps + an insane support toolkit. In "endgame" raiding, enhance is dogshit.
---
Thank you! This thread has given me hope lol
---
That means there will be 10 people in undercity. The game will feel dead af.
---
That kind of aggressive layering is a positive if you’re someone that wants to rush through content as fast as possible. Which is totally valid. But it’s completely antithetical to what Classic is supposed to be about, and imo, takes away from any prestige/satisfaction from being ahead of the pack. You just lucked out into an empty layer.
---
The attack on 1 &lt;3. nice Screenshot i wish i still had mine
---
Yes, it is a bad thing for Classic. It is a system that REMOVES player interaction. Instead of speaking / typing a request...you use a button.
---
It does not belong in Classic, where social interactions and the community are the pillars that sustain the game.
---
Yeah...Just swap dagger to sword after ambush via macro. Hemo with daggers was a hallmark of an inexperienced rogue. The whole point of hemo is fast cp generation. 
---
I leveled as sub more than once and never liked combat so you aren’t alone here. In fact, I think things were pretty well split but it was pvp server and power leveling wasn’t the only priority.
---
The amount of pragmatism in this post is making my head hurt. Stop it!!!!!!
---
The original question was how do people handle weekly respec costs (using prot warrior as an example).
---
You argue that you are okay with the weekly cost of repecing.
---
I argue that I am not, and offered/support a solution of using alts to do what you want.
---
Personally, I dont want to PvP as a warrior, so I am happy parking him as my raiding tank toon (my favorite pve role) and I level another class that I want to PvP with.
---
I also would have a toon for farming and crafting+Bank. Which together would give me an income source.
---
LOL omg I've never heard this before and this is amazing.  I'm dying listening to this.  The Ventrilo server voiceovers are taking me back, man.
---
Eye of Sulfuras drops. Guild LC wants to give it to the paladin class lead, who is ret, who is always there, and who literally everyone in the guild expects to get the mace.
---
Guild leader says, and I quote... "We do not raid with ret paladins"
---
And he gives the Eye of Sulfuras to a day 1 arms warrior in greens.
---
&gt; people just being dicks.
---
These people don't bother when nobody else is interested. They show up when there are people that can be trolled.
---
I absolutely stand by my statement that the more excited the Blizzard community gets about a particular thing, the more toxic it gets. Whether that's from a surge of trolls or from people generally being autistic at the devs is a detail that I won't debate here... but it definitely happens.
---
I've been discussing that I think a proper "outcast" faction would have been Forsaken, Blood Elves, and Naga. I know someone on the team wanted to release the game with Naga. Just feel like the first 2 are natural ones to be alienated by the Alliance, but for historical or ethical reasons don't mesh with the Horde.
---
A few come to mind.... 
---
Once listened to a guy get arrested over an open mic because he was smoking weed inside his dorm room and cops happened to walk by. 
---
A girl in the guild send the GM nudes and they went server-wide. She transferred servers instantly and never was heard from again.
---
But the craziest thing that ever happened, our Rogue stopped showing up to raids for weeks at a time. He was a quiet guy, never said much. A month later someone found a news article that he'd been arrested for allegedly trying to meet up with a minor that turned out to be a sting operation by the police. 
---
You never know people, you never know.
---
Seeing a handful of people in a capital city is a pretty huge deal. Doomed? Maybe that’s a bit far, but that’s really terrible compared to what Classic is supposed to be about.
---
Shrieking skulls will shock your soul
---
Gnomeregan is in phase one :P
---
This is great to hear. I think I'm going to give druid a shot now. I like the fact I can heal, melee, and have a couple ranged spells. I know I won't be the top dps, but it's such a vast toolkit that will help my team!
---
I think pictures in PMs are disabled but pre-menstrual syndrome prime minister's was **not** the intent.

Allows you to do dungeon tanking, healing and DPS while still being a good PVP build with all key talents. 
---
MCP is just one of those weird weapons that works in Cat form so it is kind of a must for Min/Max Cat DPS otherwise you are just not competitive at all. 
---
Unless you are pushing min/max it is unlikely you will raid as anything but Healer. You may need to go into 0/30/21 spec for that.
---
It's so nice to see someone sensible
---
Yeah if you wanna to shit DPS. There's a lot of timing to get down with CD's/consumables to maximize your DPS and knowing when to use the right moves. But yes you're right, it CAN be dumbed down to 3 button presses.
---
Playing enh shaman is all luck based.  Sometimes you kill a mob in one swing, sometimes it takes 15, nothing you do on your end changes it much.
---
That's assuming you are using 2h with wf
---
Problem is that shaman talents are really bad due to them not getting a real class refresh, and they are heavily dependent on dumping a lot of points in resto in order to be anything more than a mediocre chain heal spammer. Then you figure that Mana Tide is insane during progression and you see a strong amount of pressure for shaman to go deep resto.
---
\*nostalgic feels initiated\*
---
I know! Their character models are so pretty and have tons of incredible animations. Like tauren whose knees bend when they move, and female trolls who blink, resting bitch face human girls, and even the coolest race in the game, Dark Iron dwarves.
---
I think its a matter of "if you leave it in, people will ask to add more stuff in, and complain when their suggestions dont get added".
---
This way you just give a blanket "no new stuff" to everything, and its fair.
---
At least that's my thought. I personally wouldnt mind suggest invite either.
---
There is indeed an option available for you if you want to use the newer assets...
---
Hard to appreciate it without paying a subscription to play BFA lul
---
Yes, I believe this was technically possible in the beta, though no third "faction" was really developed. IIRC beta testers said they'd be able to manipulate their faction standings to buy opposite faction mounts. At another point you could do that with a Mind Control exploit.
---
And is up their for Imp Thunderclap as the most worthless talents in the game.
---
Heads up for warrior
---
 the [3/31/17](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LcZVxzmrxoVoebzox) spec picks up all the important stuff for tanking while only missing out on a little bit of damage.  You get bloodthirst and all the essential fury stuff, the 5% parry from arms, and last stand and improved  threat and the improved block from protection
---
Bagsibles. Every profession and some classes need extra bagsies so bagers will make money easily.
---
I wouldn't consider resto hybrid to do good damage. You end up slowly killing people with dots while running around. Balance resto hybrid is a bit better, but it's hard to get the spells off.
---
In my personal opinion "Suggest Invite" removes another reason to communicate. I believe suggest invite is a slippery slope to Group finder and so on.
---
look on eu forums people thinking its ded because they cant speak english lmao this entitlement gets out of hand
---
We're gonna keep getting more and more of these people, and you can't blame them. Particularly with the open beta the hype is gonna start growing among the current live population and the TBC-and-beyond population. Vanilla was unique in how worthless some specs are for raiding, can't really blame them for wanting to clarify.
---
I'd have to be at home and look at my settings to tell you what my render % is set to, that could make a huge difference.
---
&gt;They'd beg a druid to come raid? Sounds a bit reaching.
---
There are not a lot of raiding druids on pservers because almost nobody likes to play them. This happened late in vanilla raiding in 2005/6 as well, nobody wanted to play something so broken.
---
Fools! Our cause it righteous!
---
Good question. I wonder if gamers raised on the new generation of mmos and people without nostalgia pangs or a history in the game will have the patience to suffer through classic. 
---
I’m biased, but I think classic is the better place to start and possibly stay.
---
Yeah, people were crucifying me when I suggested that layering was being worked on.
---
When people started going on about their suggestions for "fixing" layering it got even worse. The infrastructure behind it is a lot more complex than a lot of people realize, but it's pointless to explain how things work when people are upset.
---
In my head this seems like the best idea.  I know I will need to be engineering and mining and build a fury set and farm annihilation and that other debuff axe.  I'm also thinking about being lazy af and just going mage and finding a guild beforehand....
---
No new stuff ... like layering and sharding?
---
These are arguably 10000x worse, people need to better chose where to make their stand
---
I like to fart in the tub.
---
Is it really terrible if it was just Blizzard testing layering on the beta server with a low population? Being all doom and gloom based on how the closed beta was and not the stress tests were is a bit odd.
---
You really shouldn’t be taking Sword Specialization until level 57.
---
Idk if id say that, its a decent raid dps buff for a shaman with 4 fury wars in the group, imp tclap is just aids
---
It's not bad. No pally spec has instant attacks except for deep holy so no matter what spec you level as, you will mainly just be auto attacking. Holy also gets consecration so you can aoe farm / tank dungeons.
---
As for all hybrids, just keep sets of gear for your different specs, no matter the class of armor.
---
Healing on a paladin at low levels is pretty awful. Holy light ooms you in like 3-5 casts and flash of light heals for near nothing. They become better when they get blessing of light.
---
Having the server list would be amazing.  I know of a few friends I might follow and some streamers I want to avoid.
---
GearScore was a mod at the time. LF ICC GS 5000!

---
Try both once Classic drops, it's all the same subscription and I'm pretty sure you can get your account upgraded to BfA pretty cheaply.
---
"You seek to draw the General of the Frostwolf legion out from his fortress? PREPOSTEROUS!"
---
Every time some dumb got aggro and ran.
---
Occasionally running into light crowding is not what I want to see in classic. I want there to be shitloads of people everywhere.
---
Making zones and capital cities feel “lightly crowded” so it’s easier to rush through content is going to increase how fast casual players get behind, and also just sounds like a wretched experience in general for anyone who actually wants to see a bunch of people in the world, which will be a unique experience. 
---
Classic isn’t like modern WoW where what you do at max level is all that matters. Super aggressive layering across entire continents is absolutely horrible.
---
Jesus that was a wild ride, well worth the read.
---
There was major server side lag during the stress test.
---
 I think all of these are known bugs. Dont think blizz sheep will care much, but rather downvote, focus on autistic shouting and keep making cringy memes xD
---
Av turns into a afk place and korrak wait really fast which is not enjoyable. Crossrealm bgs will prob allow que pops 24/7
---
Lol, of course you would
---
Tailoring is probably the easier one to lean on for using it as you go. You can make bags and as others have said, occasionally make some really good stuff along the way AND still make some decent end game pieces, whereas LW you will mostly benefit from the end game stuff more than the items along the way, without the bag benefit.
---
I thought they said no cross-realm battlegrounds?  Where did they say they are doing that?
---
Well each layer is supposed to hold about one servers' population. I don't know how many layers they'll use, but 10-15k people wouldn't surprise me considering they are expecting the population to drop and they don't want dead servers. They are hoping that the population drops down to around 3000ish in a few weeks, but there is no guarantee that will happen. If 10000k people are still around, they will have to keep layering.
---
During the back half of Vanilla, I was in a "notorious" progression guild called &lt;Exousia&gt; with a GM by the name of Kallozar, a human warrior. This guy was an absolute ass. Screamed all the time, narcissistic, racist and repulsive as hell.
---
Anywho. The guy was "dating" this priest, named Mia (IIRC) and Mia also had a son, a rogue, in the guild. There was another rogue officer, who was Kall's "Best Friend" in guild. A little backstory here, Kall and Mia dating long-distance, and to the best of my knowledge never actually met IRL. She was probably in her late 20s / early 30s with a pre-teen son, and Kall was perhaps 20-22.
---
One day I logged in and there was what looked like some larger-than-normal drama going on, with some people gquitting and talks about the guild bank being depleted. Come to find out, Mia's son was in Ventrillo talking to some of the guys and how it was pretty weird but cool that this *other* rogue officer was visiting him and his mother, Mia, IRL. Kallozar got wind of it, and was screaming his brain out over Ventrillo, telling the kid to go get Mia and get her on comms and/or answer her phone NOW. Kid said that his mom and this rogue officer were busy and they couldn't talk right now. They was straight fuckin', if it wasn't obvious enough.
---
Then, this rogue and Mia stole the guild bank and gquit.
---
Secretly, we all hated Kallozar and thought he was pathetic for e-dating this gold-digger in the first place, so we thought it was hilarious when the truth came to light.
---
&gt; People grief and thereby steal your playtime. 
---
A subjective notion, only relevant if I consider my "playtime" to mean me doing whatever I want, uninterrupted. I've always felt an MMO was about relinquishing control to some degree, and accepting that player behavior would dictate my experience online. That was a unique aspect of MMOs over RPG adventure games. Some days I'll log in and I'll be farming undead in EPL. Another day I'll log in and the enemy faction will be camping a critical spot, and my time will be spent dealing with them instead of NPCs. That just the type of experience I actually want to encounter. 
---
And of course that is why we have the 2 different server rulesets. I just don't see why you feel a need to poo-poo on one of them.
---
Wow this sub is really bad
---
It’s going to feel like a single player game in leveling zones unless they really cut back on how layering is implemented.
---
&gt;I really think ret is the single most wasted potential back in Vanilla. The general idea is really cool, they just needed a tiny bit more
---
I posted this to a different person in this thread  originally, and I totally agree:
---
All *ret* or *enhance* really needed was endgame two handers with a proc that returns a significant amount of mana.  Ret and Enhance always had the right kinda itemization in gear, they just never had the mana to maintain their dps.  And if the worry was that people would spec enhance/ret to use the mana returning weapon, then they could have implemented any number of creative solutions like having the proc apply a -minus healing done debuff for a while after procing. 
---
We didn't discover it in Vanilla, but apparently *feral dps* will be viable in classic almost solely due to the lvl 40 helm that enables powershifting and that lvl 30 haste hammer from Gnomer.  Bliz could make a lvl 60 version of that helm with actual stats, or end game hammer with the same activated ability but no charge count.  
---
*Feral tanks* would be viable if  only there was a staff that gave a boatload of +defense skill.   A single staff with like +5 Stamina, +70 defense skill (halfway to the "crit cap" necessary for tanking raid bosses) would have almost single handedly make feral tanking viable
---
*Fire mages* could have been viable in the first two raid tiers if they only had the option to do a quest to get a trinket that made their fire spells damage fire immune mobs.  *Arcane mages* could have gotten a trinket or something that gave arcane missiles a chance to proc a free presence of mind. 
---
*Hunters* could have played something besides marksman if only there was an alternative to Trueshot aura.   What if Beastmaster or Survival hunters gave their group an attack  power buff whenever they activated Beast Within or Wyvren Sting?  
---
*Boomkins* or *Elemental* or *Shadow* would be viable if they got a stacking mp5 buff from casting damaging spells.  A trinket that gave "a chance to gain +X mp5 for 15 seconds" that stacks up to 5 stacks or whatever could go a very long way towards shoring up the whole reason these classes don't work: ele, shadow, and boomkin just don't have enough mana. I am sure the numbers could be tuned in such a way as to make shadow or boomkin viable but still not be useful for  healers, or maybe another debuff that reduced  healing done.
---
I love Blizzart Entertainment, seriously.
---
a 10 man run with 2 ret paladins lol. was a different time. i went holy and never looked back shortly after this. was holy all the way through until i quit about a month into legion. with breaks during mop and wod too
---
Yeah, most of the "suggestions" for layering were just cesspools of complaining as well, and a bunch of the people there would get really angry about things they didn't understand. It was very disappointing, I really wish there was a sticky with all the links to where how layering works is explained so those types of topics wouldn't even pop up.
---
I really wish the pvp rewards were based in skill and not time played but hopefully if they release TBC it will be good again
---
It was fixed some time ago and now works ad you wrote it.
---
&gt; blizzard isn't to blame. board management is 
---
Well guess who we are addressing, the author of the corporate speak posts.
---
No one in their right mind would disrespect someone like omar.
---
He and others deserve all the love they get.
---
But as you said, thats not who makes the big decisions and writes in corporate speak.
---
In no way do most of the higher ups at acti or ea etc. deserve any respect, and you put them on a pedestal in your first post.
---
No they're not. Layering is a necessary evil, while suggest invite is not.
---
Same opinion, the broken stealth animation was legitimately enough to keep me from playing rogue but I will 100% be rolling one now that it's fixed. Who cares if you are "gliding" or "skating" or whatever word people want to come up with, the point is that you are moving slowly and not powerwalking around while "sneaking."
---
I've got a couple of mates who both do programming work for large game development companies (Not Blizz or Valve large, but people will know of their work if they've been gaming for more than a couple of years) so when it all came out I asked them about it and from their description of it, everything Blizzard was/have been doing in relation to layering seemed perfectly reasonable and in fact, probably the best course of action to take for it too.
---
heh.
---
2 months ago the classic zealot would've come up with all sort of fancy stuff in order to pretend classic classes were somehow complex.
---
guess they made a little progress since!
---
Massive +1
---
Cheer up emo kids
---
&gt;  Ion itself DID say it would be gone after 2-3 weeks
---
He absolutely did not. He said "a few weeks", and the rest is community speculation. Ion is really good at sweettalking. Infamous over at /r/wow for it.
---
Nope. Classic is the return of Vanilla wow as we asked for. That’s what Blizzard confirmed at blizzcon and is showing us now. You guys asking for “muh QoL” are what led blizzard to add in LFR and heirloom gear and transmogs and everything else that killed WoW.
---
Hows that gonna work if they're on a 100% mount and you're just running. Sounds like you've never encountered a real ganker/greifer, i guess that's lucky tho. Anyway i'm done discussing this now as i didn't get any good reason why multiboxers have no advantages compared to a normal player.
---
I started in vanilla and Wrath was an excellent expansion minus the completely overpowered DK's at the start.
---
They started allowing faction changes towards the end and I think that was the beginning of the end for PVP servers.
---
hunters who think they are funny are worse than spawn campers
---
I tried both specs on a private server recently. Riposte is way faster for leveling. You parry more than you think, it procs at least once per mob and it really speeds up your kill time and reduces down time because the mob is doing no damage to you.
---
Imp sprint is better for pvp peroid. Getting out of a root with sprint is a godsend. It helps you counter so many classes. Riposte can be nice against warriors but it's unreliable, imp sprint is just infinitely better for low level pvp. It helps with mobility immensely and the enemy never sees it coming.
---
Blizzard doesn’t really care about the virgin experience in Retail, nor should they. There isn’t enough of an untapped market of people that have never tried WoW to warrant game decisions for them.
---
It does not seem reasonable to say suggest invite is a slippery slope for group finder lol  
---
Its just a timesaver and it will promote grouping and interacting
---
Imagine how much easier coordinating for world bosses and finding jed would be
---
I don't really have a favorite single quest. The whole list of Rogue class quests is definitely my favorite.
---
Keep in mind all three roles with appropriate gear and knowing how to heal properly. Also 5 man only. If you are planing to do a raid you would have to go deeper into resto.
---
Its like saying "you dont like racism in America? Leave."
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's running on a modified 7.xx, giving us what we're referring to as 1.13x, is it not?
---
Basically what I'm doing.  I'm waiting to see where all the dink streamers go before I decide.
---
Or I might just decide to go on a PVE server, which would all but remove the streamer issue.
---
the list of hunter bugs, some very significant, is still 90% intact. i salute the progress though.
---
If you all really want the vanilla experience the game should be full of bugs, unstable, and crashing every other day for the first few weeks after release.
---
**You asked for it.**
---
How much should I post stacks of wool cloth for?  Gotta make that bank
---
Lol man, I’m not saying Classic is mechanically hard when it comes to raiding, because it’s really not. But if you wanna put in the time to prepare for raids and see real DPS increases by utilizing items/consumables/timing on CD’s, it’s very possible
---
did they fix the missing structure over the stockades in stormwind?
---
but what about no changes, slippery slope and etc?
---
As you want only the best for your child, posting nudes on the internet is asking for problems especiall which such software on the horizon:
---
[https://deepmindy.com/](https://deepmindy.com/)
---
And stuff along these lines get more sophisticated to put in your high school facebook crush's pic and see if she did some porn in the past years after leaving school.
---
Bottom line: posting nudes makes you incredibly blackmailable, because enough professional settings will take these posted nudes/puking party pics etc. seriously.
---
As I have experienced recently, enhance leveling is probably with the least down time of any of the specs. You use a staff a lot at lower levels and at mid levels. WF is nice but dmg in instances even twinked out is lower than other classes. Mostly due to you are waiting for wf procs. The second you begin casting spells you go oom really fast. 
---
I cant see them being looked for as dps endgame as the restoshaman brings the same totems.
---
I don’t think think this retort is really much better. People pick and choose which battles to fight.  Many are still fighting sharding/layering. Some have resigned to considering it an inevitability at this point. But to imply since layering is a thing you shouldn’t be opposed to any other minor features comes across as a shallow argument and more of an attempt at a gotcha statement.
---
Holy leveling is fine. Get as much +damage to spells as you can and you'll do decent damage.
---
You can tank dungeons pretty easily aswell since consecration.
---
thats gotta be the best link I received in the past decate.  Gotta be one hell of a retard to roll on any of their servers
---
This is why it’s important to be as vocal as possible about why layering feels terrible and ruins so many wonderful things about classic. Screaming and insulting people isn’t required for that, but the people acting like it’s no big deal are people who don’t understand what’s being lost if it’s not implemented right.
---
We are 2? Months away? 2? 2? 2?
---
Hey, I had a rabid thistle bear spawn inside a tree. I reported that because it scared the bojesus out of me when trying to pick an herb.
---
Undead priest.. I love healing, and priest seems the most versatile. Can anyone tell me, how priest is solo at 60? Quests, farming rep, and gold etc.
---
Shadow once they get their toolset are the best world pvpers.  
---
Like all specs/classes however, knowledge of your class, and using consumables and trinkets can give you a major edge.
---
&gt; The only reason the sundering happened is because of high elves which were their own faction then and currently members of the Horde.
---
Err not really. The High Elves were an off shoot of the Highborne mages that actually sided with the rest of the Kaldorei to fight Azshara and the Demons. Then they were basically told they had to convert, die, or leave. They chose to leave.
---
You're right about the rest lol, mostly. Sargeras would've kept finding ways to invade Azeroth ever since he lost all those years ago to Malfurion and the Elves. 
---
The guy you're responding to is a typical Horde fanboy.
---
stfu
---
TBH I'm too lazy to find any info on layering ATM lol been kind of ignoring classic for this first time in 3 years but 
---
&gt; If 10k people are still around, they will have to keep layering.
---
Why do you think this? There's no technical reason why they will have to keep layering since people will be spread out across the two continents instead of everyone mushed into the early zones.
---
What are you trying to hide?
---
Why do you say that?  I'm guessing you feel the extra swing proc isn't as impactful until end game?  But i'm curious as to why.
---
The French are ~4% of the active WoW playerbase and ~10% of the characters ever created in EU.
---
They won’t be overrunning anything.
---
Fun Fact: our main tank in this pic: Olgra... was the off tank from the famous "MC Raiders" song.... she transfered to raid with us in hopes to get scepter on our garbage server.
---
Just make sure they know that Classic takes much more time investment than Retail. I think that's important to point out.
---
Nope. No changes. It’s really not that hard to understand.
---
&gt; Do blizz stop making changes 2 months before a launch "without exception"?
---
Major changes? Yes, actually...
---
The push back on the issues in the beta are what get those issues fixed. I hate this sentiment because if everyone acted like you literally nothing would ever get fixed.
---
its the simple cliche of the slippery slope. suggest invite takes away ALL interaction in forming a party, you no longer have to talk to the party leader. thus this can turn the game into the retail ghost-town-zero-communication game we see today. no thanks
---
100% true. The battlegrounds in Classic are going to be a dud. Steamers will get bored fadt, a lot of players as well.
---
Actually, it was Hillary who won it.
---
Its just that normal people were instantly thrown in another dimension, where Trump is the President.
---
Oh shit boys, we have a Cleared Up Til Naxx Guy here.
---
My thoughts are: How about we wait an see what Blizzard actually releases before we worry about fixing something that may not be an issue?
---
Hahah mobs getting stuck in tree is classic tho isn't it?
---
This is pretty rich coming from a 18 days old account.
---
Exactly, it would be pretty stupid, but it’s not that unlikely. It’s going to fuel threads about “Lul Classic dead” by trolls on the forums and we’ll have to explain to those people that no, it only feels that way because there’s actually so many people that blizzard had to layer the world to oblivion and ruin a massive part of the classic experience.
---
I totally get what you're saying, what with people basically assuming the worst, but you have to remember: we've been burned before.
---
Not only have we been burned by other AAA companies, but Blizzard itself.  After all, retail is just Classic with changes Blizz thought they should make.  Also, there certainly is controversy even at the origin of Classic; fans had to desperately fight for it while being told by Blizz they were wrong, and it wasn't until pservers basically held up a big sign that said "YOU WILL MAKE MONEY ON THIS GUARANTEED" that Blizzard finally capitulated.
---
So we have a bunch of people that have been fighting in various degrees for a long time to make this product, and the people agreeing to make it are the same ones who destroyed it to begin with, there's going to be A LOT of distrust.
---
You also have, and I don't really line using this word, "fanboys", which will become more and more prevalent as retail players take interest in Classic.  They generally trust Blizzard and in many ways prefer a different kind of game than those that originally wanted Classic.  They will be just as vocal too.
---
So when you have an issue like layering, a year ago you'd probably have almost unanimous agreement on this sub that it was a bad idea.  Now, you have influence of those that, frankly, are not as obsessed with the original values of Classic, or are at least see themselves as being reasonable when working with Blizzard.  They are vocal too.  And the more vocal they are, the more crazy anti-layering folks are getting, since not only are things being implemented that they don't like, but a large part of the current fanbase doesn't seem to care.  And they *should* be getting crazy, because if they don't constantly bring it up and express their disdain, Blizzard might just think "oh, everyone seems on board with this" and implement layering.  I don't think this will happen at all, but theoretically they could think "we implemented layering and no one cared, perhaps we can please the overlords and implement some sort of in game purchases that 'won't effect the game'".
---
Also, layering will have unintended consequences which many have laid out, and Blizzard hasn't acknowledged that at all.
---
Im one, but I've also decided my main and my "main-alt" for when Classic goes live.
---
You're a head ass.
---
I'm on tich. Group finder has a fraction of the people compared to legion.
---
i'm trying very hard to remember how it was for my paladin. i think i relied heavily on dungeons and BGs to get levels. this char was an alt so i also had it easy cus i gave him gear from my main. have a good 2h and use judgments etc. while solo. again, i had gear i could feed him from my main. yes, there was int mail/plate.
---
healing was a lot of fun though. didn't have much issue because with mana as you're gonna be using rank 1 spells a lot. however, in vanilla having to stop for healer to drink is not unusual. can't really go balls out aoe tanking in 5 mans like it is in modern wow.
---
Hybrid classes made sense when the only stats on gear was intellect and strength. As soon as they started adding spell power and things it just didn't work.
---
That was the exact argument for LFG channel, Party finder, and eventually group finder. It starts with simplification and automation. I believe asking someone to invite a person is an icebreaker. Once you start talking it kind of goes from there. 
---
Timesavers is how we got to BFA. Daily quests time save on farming, LFR is a timesaver for raids, Portals to main cities is a timesaver, flying is a timesaver, in-game loot tables and mob mechanics is a timesaver so you dont need to do research.
---
I spent most of my time in vanilla as a Druid in a pvp guild. (Shoutout Malice on Altar of Storms) 
---
Pure Feral focus is fun, but you’re a hybrid. You will be switching forms constantly to take every advantage you can get in the ever-changing situation of what’s going on in your 1v1s and larger group pvp (bear for stun/interrupt, cat for bleeds/stealth, caster/travel to insect swarm/moon fire kite, etc). For both pve and pvp, you’re probably going to be one of two specs: HoTW/NS (0/30/21) or Feral Charge/Swiftmend (x/11/31). Neither spec is hard-coded. There is a good about of wiggle room to make either your own, depending on how you prefer to play—more cat talents or more bear-oriented are the primary choices—or go deeper resto for swoftmend and better healing at the expense of feral. You can raid as either one of these specs, but you should expect to heal either way. 
---
Back then, I never used MCP. I don’t think we had figured out the nuance and min max that it offered in pve. Even with MCP, I’d be surprised if feral can compete on the meters with other dps mains. 
---
But for pvp, auto-attacks in cat form aren’t going to be your #1 source of damage, and you’re going to be shifting often enough, healing or rooting people, such that a +healing weapon will serve you better for the vast majority of situations.
---
with layering leveling will be so much faster, there will be guilds that kill him in the first week.
---
God knows.  She must've.  I have the memory of a goldfish these days but I remember feeling honestly surprised she didn't yell at me.  
---
There was a time she took away my keyboard and I just opened the internet and used the mouse to copy and paste one letter at a time to get to my guild website and post on the forums.  I was worse than a crack addict.
---
Indeed it isn't. But the point I'm making still stands despite your pedantic correction.
---
I see Tradechat/Panser fan bois are alive and well here.  Please go back to retail and r/wow.
---
Blizzard sent him a beta invite after sending him a C&amp;D for Felmyst? 
---
LOL I just hope people now can face the fact that the whole C&amp;D shutdown was faked.
---
Shatter for frost mage :D
---
Exactly “But how about this one little change is how we got to where we are today”
---
Holy fuck some of you people are so pathetic.
---
which you gotta be an absolute retard to roll on.
---
love that shit talking about the tank lol
---
I don't think that's a problem of factions by themselves, but a problem with Blizzard may not recognizing what type of story-telling and world building works in an MMO space, versus a Warcraft 3/Starcraft RTS. Linear, big stories that shake up the universe is pretty straightforward for an RTS, comprised of a series of maps that players bounce to from the last. A bit different with persistent worlds, which I think benefit from smaller, more eclectic stories. In a world that doesn't push the overall story of the planet forward very often, the faction of dynamic would not have felt as awkward.
---
Damn that sucks. One of the saving graces of healing  vanilla is unless you were super hardcore, you could be a hybrid spec if not fully out of spec. So priests could keep shadow to pvp if they wanted. Sucks that shamans don't get that.
---
I wouldn't mind some alterations *eventually*, but things should be vanilla at least for a few years, let the game run its course.
---
The things you can craft are often times really good. The thing is all the gold you spend learning everything is prob. More expensive than just buying the items from other players
---
Fixing broken classes or specs through rare drops isn't an answer because the people that don't have access to that gear still have a broken character.
---
But #nOcHaNgEs
---
There aren’t a lot of super Paladin geared items, mostly I’ll be using it for leveling. Then gathering materials and recipes to make my guild stuff for endgame :)
---
It’s not pedantic.
---
A vote implies the result will have some bearing, that you’re a part of the decision making process.
---
Petitions largely go completely ignored, especially by corporations.
---
Paladin is arguably the strongest class in the game.
---
ya.. please let them have their on server and ruin it themselve..
---
No, there's no technical reason, but the population is way too high for what a single realm is designed for. It's just too busy. Oddly enough, I'd personally be okay with playing on an extremely high pop server, but a lot of people aren't, because it really weakens the community aspect of the game. Most importantly: It's not vanilla-like at all.
---
Im surprised you took blizzards cock out of your throat long enough to type out this waste of font.
---
[NA] [A] [PVE] [Late Night Raiding]
---
A couple friends and I are looking for an Alliance guild on a PvE server with ideal raid times of Friday/Saturday 9:00pm - 12:00am PST. I have been searching for the last month and haven't found a single guild which fits this specific criteria.
---
We played during Vanilla and I am still playing retail. Not 100% on classes yet but one friend will be playing Dwarf Priest. I will likely be playing Fury Warrior.
---
When we don’t know the full intent or scope behind how layering will be implemented, it’s absolutely necessary to report what feels terrible and to voice those concerns. 
---
You seem to be taking a more passive approach, maybe because being able to breeze through leveling zones sounds good to you. But it sounds absolutely horrible to many others and has a ton of other negatives, contradicting the very essence of what Classic represents to many people. 
---
You can’t just sweep something like that aside.
---
i personally dont like suggest invites as a feature, its very small but theres something kinda nice about mentioning a someones name to be invited, more of an immersion effect, names matter in classic and it adds to its flair
---
good!
---
Gives me goosebumps
---
&gt; I almost want to load up retail to see, how my Paladin who is exalted with the Zandalar tribe, is handled in BFA...
---
There is literally no reaction. BFA is a wasteland.
---
Arena.
---
You couldn’t be more wrong but keep spreading nonsense
---
I'd agree with you if it was a company like CDR making the game, but Blizzard seems completely unable to reign themselves in, and have proven that time and time again.  I mean, FFS, they ruined their game so bad people demanded they release the original.
---
As someone who doesn't mind either way, I support both your answers and hope we all just have a good time.
---
 [https://www.avoidstreamers.com/](https://www.avoidstreamers.com/)share this as much as possible,  avoid running your experience with a bunch of retards and fanboy

It's effect use is good but i dont think anyone will exclude you from a raid without it.
---
Here are some pre raid options that are good too:
---
1. The Unstoppable Force (AV Rep) https://classicdb.ch/?item=19323 
---
2. Fist of Omokk (LBRS) https://classicdb.ch/?item=13167

3. Slavedriver's Cane (Stratholme undead) https://classicdb.ch/?item=13372
---
Special mention:
---
Fish terminator: https://classicdb.ch/?item=19944
---
(If you can join a ZG raid this one if it drops should be a sure pickup as warriors and pallies dont use staff obviously)
---
Honestly ? I lvled holy duo with a warlock recently on a private server and it was a blast, we even managed to aoe stuff quite well
---
At 44 I switched to ret (got the rockpounder), and althoght solo I was much more powerfull, in my duo I was a lot weaker. Gameplay was more fun, and I was able to kick some asses in wpvp in a way I couldnt as a holy paladin, but honestly, I felt like I lost more than I gained by going ret
---
After you get good great at 60, the differences in what you are capable of doing become much more pronounced, but before that, id say holy is prolly a bit better, as you can heal pretty well compared to ret, and the damage isnt terribad (specially with engineering)

---
lol, right
---
Both profs are relatively useless compared to Engineering. Unless you're a caster that will use the Bloodvine Set for the entire game.
---
As a person who played up to Cata I am having VERY hard time understanding anything in BFA. Anytime I watch a stream it like watching a completely different game I don't know what is going on. 
---
What I am trying to say Classic is a perfect place to start an MMO experience.
---
I am of the philosophy that a game company sends strong messages on how they *expect* people to play the game by what features they officially incorporate into the game.       
---
         
---
For example, Classic WoW quest design requires players to read their quest log, talk to other players, or (admittedly) check third party resources for information. They allow addons that help, but by declining to design location indicators into the game as a base, they are sending the message that officially the way to play does not include that feature.         
---
              
---
Later on, Blizzard chose to add quest tracking in and that sent a very clear message - Blizzard now expects quest tracking to be a fundamental element of their quest design. Sure you can toggle off the 'POI/Quest' filter on your minimap, but it's included and supported, which tells you its an intended functionality.         
---
To me, this relates to 'suggest invite' in that leaving it in as a toggle doesn't obscure a very clear design philosophy by allowing it to remain - the ability to add players via suggested invite is the way we intend players to build groups. As with the POI filter on the minimap, toggling it off doesn't change that it was intentionally woven into the experience, and such a thing makes it 'default'.         
---
               
---
I think we'd benefit much more from having that functionality cut from the official game, and allowing an addon to fill the space instead for those who, for whatever reason, find it cumbersome to type "invite &lt;Person&gt; please" in party chat.
---
Our healers refused to heal in vael until we got our DPS up to snuff
---
A true hero lol!

i dont feel any of what youre talking about, the stress test felt amazing for me
---
You're new to Blizzard games, aren't you? It typically takes a major outrage to get them to do anything.
---
[Just look at this very well written and pretty important bug report that went 5 days without any reply](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-instant-attack-normalization/200006) until it hit the frontpage here, and suddenly 3 hours later, outside of office hours on a friday evening, it gets a reply.
---
I'm positive that the Blizzard team will fix any major non-layering issues before release, but you're very very naive if you think reddit complaints don't have _way_ more sway than any bug reports ever could.
---
Best for shaman and lower end of middle isn't great.
---
In a less general context, yeah they're the best you've got if you're set on shaman.
---
But whatever, I'm spoiled rotten by hunter and mage anyways re:leveling.
---
Why do all you pro-changes guys use the alternating caps/non caps punctuation or intersperse your posts with capitalized words to try and make a point. Just comes across as substance-less.
---
People think it's not a big deal, until it is and you have to explain why your buddy the enhancement shaman is worth the lack of dps and the cause for not clearing a raid. Nothing causes your good dps to leave faster than lazy people getting a pass.
---
Sure if you are able to clear fast with crap comps and lazy people who don't use consumes and people who show up late and have to leave early. Grats, I just know I'd be one of the first to leave a guild that can't at least try....
---
It was originally, but they've since updated it to 8.whatever.
---
&gt;But what do you mean when you say no one wants a protection warrior in their raids?
---
Are you a socialable person who is able to commit to an absolutely mandatory 4-6 hours of raiding and 5-15 hours of farming every week, do you like running a guild, doing invites and kicks and leading (and dealing with the drama) from  literally dozens of people?  Do you have no social life, no kids, and no other real life distractions to ever prevent you from raiding on time, every time?
---
Then congratulations you will make a great Main Tank!  Every guild needs at least a few main tank warriors!  
---
Otherwise though?  You ass better be good at fury dps and offtanking as fury too.
---
This is disingenuous as hell to say. It’s absolutely crucial to inform blizzard of when new systems feel absolutely terrible and break what many consider a critical foundation of what Classic is.
---
I was on Greymane! Horde or Alliance?
---
I believe it. The guy sounds like a jerk in his videos which are about 9min too long.
---
Bonjour mes amis. Tu besoin one baguette ouis ouis. OHHH hooon hon hon.

OP mentioned in other posts he's going Horde, but I feel like Pally/Druid/Lock would be my ideal 3 man. 
---
* Soulstone/combat rez/full rez/divine intervention options.
---
* Fire Shield/Thorns/Ret Aura synergize.
---
* Blessing of Wisdom/Healthstones/Dots cater to longer fights(from low DPS).
---
* Free mounts(2) + travel form(1) for easy leveling
---
Cons being the terribad CC and no stealth skip options. Death skips could be possible at least.
---
I have started looking into switching to swords after Ambush and think that it'd be the best of both worlds. With the 2/0/22 talents as described above I'd have an amazing opener and still be able to dish out consistent damage and be more than viable in PvP. This is still not really solving the eventual problem of swords being so sought after
---
Wow I really hope they fix that.
---
Upvoted just for being a really cool pic!
---
Fair enough, I haven’t looked at it in depth
---
You can scoop up a lot of tier gear in one lucky night on a farm run though. It’s not rare to see 3-4 pieces of might or other tank loot drop from MC in one night.
---
Do you know what patch it was added officially? I cant seem to find it. Again I'm not arguing, apparently I did have an addon installed, but I suuuuuuuuuuure hated that era and it chased me away from the game for many years.

No, it's running off a modified 8.x

It was a technical limitation in the original game. They are artificially applying that limitation to a modern client.

My two guild leaders, A &amp; B, met as officers of another guild.   A's wife met B's irl friend and left A, travelled cross country and got with B's friend.  B thought it was shitty so he unfriended the dude irl, left guild with A, and they formed a rival guild on the same realm.  A's wife and B's friend eventually quit and got married.
---
A lived in a popular spring break vacation spot and would invite me and my 19 year old friends to "threesomes" (he was, from the pictures he sent, at least in his mid 40s).  Creeped us out and we eventually left over that and the other drama.
---
I agree with you for reasons of high pop but don't I think that they're going to allow a significantly higher amount of players on each server where this issue could happen. 
---
There are going to be a few servers that will max out the layering/pop limit and stay that way, I refuse to believe that blizzard hasn't considered this and planned layering accordingly.
---
10 eu servers with the frenchies picking out one in particular to be their server and suddenly you got a server that's about 50% french. GG's you gotta reroll.
---
Perfect example. All I stated was “Trump won 2016” and I got downvoted on ever post. I didn’t claim to vote for him, but I didn’t bash him. I merely stated a fact that people seem to hate so much that they cannot help but be upset over it.
---
So true. Big props to the devs.
---
There are a bunch around auto-attacking when you spam your basic spells like HS, right? Otherwise your warrior will just sit there getting wailed on until you right click or hit T or some other such nonsense? Every time I've rolled up a lowbie warrior I have to google it to find the script that makes HS also start attacking or its unplayable.
---
It says a lot about the current WoW Devs' "innovation" and "vision" when hundreds of thousands of people flock en-masse to a game released in 2006 because its more fulfilling.
---
Ahh ok so the downvotes are from people who support/believe in gamer gate.
---
Hilarious.  I’d tell you to head back to /r/incels but its banned.
---
But people upthread told me that stat inflation was only a problem because the worst expansion (Wrath) introduced 10 and 25 raids with difficulties!
---
Patch means Server restart, server restart means all units and entities respawn I reckon.
---
I don't *know* if it works that way, but I'd be surprised if that wasn't the case.
---
There are still gold sellers in Retail so you can assume they will be in Classic.
---
However I don't think they will be as aggressive (dead body spam) as they were during Vanilla.
---
How did you decide to spend your talent points? And what weapons did you decide to use?
---
Hit reply to soon. My point is that I don’t have confidence that what I experienced with being on dead feeling layers isn’t what I’ll experience when it goes live.
---
I’ll check later today
---
I'm of the opinion that a change.org petition will carry more weight than reddit posts. I'm aware I can't personally change blizzards decision but we can be part of something that raises awareness. The change.org petition for classic servers got nearly 300,000 signatures which likely influenced blizzards decision even if it wasn't the sole reason. And it is pedantic becuase you're expressly concerned with my incorrect use of the word vote rather than the overarching point that I'm making.
---
Basically yeah I’m fine with those things, I’ve been sociable and active with a guild forming for classic for a while now
---
Let’s also not exaggerate like every guild has the same requirements. A lot of people higher up I guilds have jobs and kids, I’ve met plenty of pserver GMs and MTs like this. They understand missing a raid for RL.
---
Barrens is the goat leveling zone. You go there as a level 12 boy and you leave a level 22 man.
---
O yea you would still want to grab tier 1 from MC.... but just saying it's not completely pointless to go for 0.5. Its probably not worth the effort it takes though.
---
Think of it like passive gold dropping from beasts as you level.
---
I’m sure they’re more than OK
---
Being 5 levels behind is almost always worse.
---
At a playercount of 1 million thats 40,000 frenchman.
---
And around 130,000 germans.
---
What kind of mutant server do you think we are getting where thats not overrun worthy ?
---
Probably not for a few reasons. 
---
1. A sub will required so no mass creating under level 20 toons.
---
2. smaller population so fewer customers
---
3. gold acquisition is harder so would require more upfront work for the farmers
---
4. harder to hack other accounts with newer tech/authentication.
---
All that should lead to relativity little gold selling spam.
---
Right, but the way it works out is such that you generate higher threat comparatively on the tank compared to the healer by pre-shielding. While the warrior has slightly less rage to play around with at the beginning, that is more than made up for by the healer being able to give the warrior more time before he has to heal him. This is because all of the priest's healing generates threat, while only a portion of the warrior's rage is generated by taking damage.
---
Now, your point is still very valid if you throw DPS or multiple mobs into the mix. Pre-shielding, while more threat efficient considering only the healer and the tank, means the tank will be slightly slower at building threat. 
---
It all comes down to what you need to do. If the problem is your healer is drawing aggro, pre-shield and have your dps hold off for a second or two. If the problem is DPS drawing aggro, don't pre-shield.
---
It's not a fallacy if we've already seen it happen.
---
How do you know its gummy lol?
---
Well Classic was the game that blew up into a 12 million user playerbase so I recommend that one
---
Shamans go for shields that have + spl damage and/or + heals
---
Seriously.... this exact question is posted like 27 times a day..........
---
Going tank.
---
I'm torn between starting out mining/skinning for faster gold from vendor or diving straight in to engineering for the leveling gear and bomb bonus to try and speed things up.
---
Either way at 60 I'm dropping mining for enchanting/engineering. I plan on most of my max level money making to come out of instance runs so gotta get that DE money for maximum advantage.
---
I'll have a Hunter alt that will take over mining and generally farming world stuff.
---
It isn't accurate, though. My main has been hunter, so I've been paying attention when hunter bug threads show up. It is always doom and gloom and "guess I'm not rolling a hunter now".
---
Even in the thread about that being fixed, some dude ranted at me with "omg a billion dollar company fixed two bugs, private servers already fixed these bugs" and other shit that makes it obvious he isn't in software development
---
we were pretty laid back, and then the one day the vice GM decided we were going to be a hardcore raiding guild and if you couldn't keep up you were out. Bunch of us split right there and formed a new guild. Fuck you bud!
---
Haha yeah that's pretty much on point. I mean, I'm glad they are fixing bugs, but it's literally their job. They have barely even scratched the surface yet and people are already jumping for joy.
---
wandering shay.  i never knew about this quest until i was exploring on a pserver, fun little hidden quest with a wandering night elf and her worried rocky friend
---
i know it's not classic, but i love the eversong woods!  tbc is actually my favorite version of wow. hubby must be so happy!
---
I agree with all of that. The thing is, previous expansions will never be as good as they were when current content because there are very few players there. I have no idea what they can do about it. It's very likely that something very similar happens to Classic in a year or two and 100% will happen if they re-release TBC. Being a level 1 when everyone is 60 will suck and I doubt that classic has the constant growth that vanilla did to fill the lower levels. If people want to get into endgame, boosting and leveling through one expansion is fine. Making people go through the original game and 7 xpacs at the speed they were originally done at (by yourself) would be even worse.
---
It's almost like this sub has more than 10 people on it with differing opinions...
---
Hey man. BFA could blow up to 12 million too.... Hahaha no I'm kidding it's clearly dying.
---
Illuminati confirmed.
---
Except when he threw away his humanity and the light when he took up Frostmourne in the first place. Arthas did some pretty shady shit before falling under Ner'zhuls control.
---
Things like this is why I can't roll anything but a Rogue for classic.
---
Going to have to visit it with some of your Horde friends later on.
---
while the idea of trying to speedrun molten core as fast as possible ( the record is what, 20 min? give or take wathever that Pserver got wrong), spending hours farming consumable to make trivial content even more trivial is...  well, to put it simply, I have a bunch of game on steam that could use some love.
---
Well, they've fixed barely any of the bugs. It's progress, but hunters are still broken.
---
I agree, if you are not in the click loot council is a bad system. Im joining dkp only as well
---
I don’t keyturn often, but I never noticed this and I feel like I would have. I guess we’ll never know.
---
Was a 17 year old guild leader of an MC guild on a relatively small, "dying" server. Was honestly tough, but I had a great core and we got along great. We'd regularly pug 10-15 slots, and made shit progress.
---
Then free transfers from a couple of high pop servers opened up to our server, and we saw a chance to do a merger / recruit more people. Sadly, at 17, I was just not ready or well equipped enough to handle the politics and drama that ensued as a result of several cliques coming together and trying to become on cohesive team.
---
Was able to adequately act as an officer, supporting more competent GMs through Vanilla/TBC/WotLK/Cata and didn't take up being a GM/RL again till Warlords.
---
Shit's tough, esp when you're young.
---
Gold becomes rather expensive in vanilla and I'm sure it there will be huge demand and therefore we'll have a lot of gold selling.
---
Leveling they are better than ele/resto you can kill things  with minimal downtime. You'd probably switch it up around lvl 50-55 to full time healer.
---
No changes
---
That's right, they won't work faster or better just because people keep pointing this out. And note that I'm saying "pointing it out". I don't want people whining and complaining either but one does not equal the other. When Blizzard announced that there would be no language-specific servers for the EU I read many of the threads on here that were making good points about the importance of language-specific servers. I come back to this sub some time later and I hardly see anything about it anymore. That's what I mean. 
---
What kind of signal does that send to Blizzard? "Oh, they were upset for a little while but I guess it's okay now", it's not okay.
---
Also, I can completely understand people being anxious about every little thing that might ruin Classic for them so I can see people overreact. We've all been waitingand fighting a very long time for this and it's supposed to happen. I would be incredibly disappointed if something was to ruin the experience in the end. So it's easy for me to understand why people get upset when they see the effects of layering on the game, for example.
---
I'll just say it again, I think it's important to keep both Blizzard and ourselves in check here.
---
No. Some races are better in PvP and PvE. Orc is good in both, since they are on the cover of the box.
---
This was huge -- thank you Blizzard!
---
All these people who are saying leveling as holy is not that bad...I would be hesitant to trust them on that. Ret is slow, holy is pull-your-hair-out slow (when killing mobs)
---
I recommend you level as ret and just keep a holy set until 60. Maybe respec holy when you get to EPL/WPL and can grind undead mobs with exorcism. But what I really recommend you do is find videos of players in the 30-50 range specd as ret or holy and see what style you like more.
---
The gear just has to exist for the classes  to become viable.
---
The items could come from class quests, from quests from dungion drops, could drop directly from raids, could be craftable by professions...
---
There are tons of ways to introduce these items.
---
Mind using GetMoney() to see if we can afford the spell and make it red if we can't?
---
https://i.snag.gy/m39Mfq.jpg
---
As I said. Necessary evil. Layering will only be up for a month tops, and I believe that they will tune Layering before release.
---
I mean, what's the alternative?
---
What do you think about being able to minimize/shrink your map so you can have it open during questing? This is the only thing I really want them to change from original classic
---
I actually leveled as pure holy in vanilla. http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/19851048
---
I leveled as pure holy with a friend warrior and let me tell you it was slow. But any time my friend could not play it was IMPOSSIBLE. Without a good two hander and seal of command or a deep prot AOE grind spec I would not kill anything in reasonable period of time. 
---
Dungeon leveling was not that awesome cause not a lot of ppl would keep running the same place and getting a group together with travel takes time.
---
Unfortunately you're right; in a sex-negative culture where nudity and sex are tied to morality, nudes have consequences. I have heard of but didn't consider that software, so you do have a solid point there.
---
I am hopeful that our culture will change since the vast majority of people today have a camera in their pocket and will at some point use it for nudes. If the majority of people have easily discoverable nudes, then it loses its value. Also we have progressed a lot in terms of bodily autonomy and not caring what others do with their own body, so maybe we can progress a little further and this all won't matter.
---
Yeah have fun with that. Please don’t try to suggest that Blizzard turn classic WoW into it though.
---
What happens when Blizzard overestimates the percentage of players who are "tourists" and there are still too many players after Phase 1?
---
This whole argument relies on the assumption that Blizzard have a time machine.
---
His point was that 1.12 is the reference client.  
---
Since C'thun was added in 1.9, and nerfed by 1.10 (iirc).  
---
Which means that we wont see a prenerf cthun at all, just the 1.12 version.
---
She doesn’t do that AoE often if nobody’s in melee range. If she’s being kited, she chucks a knockdown boulder every so often. If it were easy, more people would do it. She’s also level 51. Downing her at 40 is incredible.
---
These are not even the same people, at all. The sub has more than tripled in size since blizzcon. There's also the fact that spell batching seems to have a lot of bugs, so yes, bugs should indeed be fixed.
---
You don't need to be holy to heal while leveling. Even if your duo leveling with a warrior or dps class it's still a waste go holy. Just spec ret and it's not a bad class to level at all they are pretty average in terms of speed.
---
I laughed, but the end of vanilla was pretty silly  comparing the capabilities of a fresh 60  to an end game raider.
---
I’m into the grind when it comes to MMOs, so this is definitely something I’m looking forward to. Thanks for the reply!
---
This is the shit I was looking for in this thread. Blessed.
---
Mining and BS. Will drop Mining for Engineering, around lvl 55.
---
Yup. I guess the first ooga video was posted on his yt
---
Going with a hard no here. Sure it sounds innocent enough, but once you add one QoL feature you add another, then another, then we are at Retail.
---
Classic is supposed to be as close to Vanilla as possible. Adding anything, regardless of how innocent it appears simply takes away from tjah recreation.
---
Also, it's not hard to say "hey, can you please invite player 5".
---
Use the search function in the subreddit here and you'll see about 200 people asking the same thing.
---
I mean. I don't think you searched hard for information..
---
You don't. Since it's against the rules of this subreddit.
---
I’m playing horde!!
---
There is a Skarm on lighthope private server is it the same guy? He is a very geared human warrior
---
I generally don't get sword spec until I Respec at 60 because I like to keep my option open with maces. I mention sword spec in the etc section since I got a lot of downvotes last time because I didn't specifically mention sword spec.
---
&gt; You could easily make things like Boomkin and Prot Pally raid viable with some properly itemized gear drops.
---
No you couldn't because both classes would still suffer from mana issues and prot pallys would still not have a taunt.
---
Layering is not necessary... making more servers is. Layering is a huge change compared to suggest invite for someone who’s against adding new stuff lol
---
Blizzard already has a game where player "convenience" takes precedence over actual RPG elements like the economy. If that suits your fancy more, you're welcome to play BfA.
---
I searched pre load and found nothing relevant. I don't know what else I should search for.
---
no layering?
---
Demand creates supply.
---
There will be gold sellers, but the price will probably be much higher than we're used to.
---
Then maybe you might actually make a good MT
---
regardless, the point I was making was elaborating all of the bullshit that a warrior has to go through.  And while the last half of my post was almost all about why playing fury warrior sucks … it sucks even harder to have to lead (and deal with the drama from) 40+ people, which is essentially what a leader like a MT is signing up to do.
---
and by "fix" you mean remove right :) ?
---
Its all fun and games till you get tail swiped into the whelps!
---
wrong in terms of sliding legs on the floor.  
---
They wasted resources on reverting an animation fix 🤷
---
Both games sound good, but if what you’re saying is true, then classic aligns with my play style more. Thank you for replying!
---
No it doesnt scale
---
What was the issue with leg movement? Asking due to be out of the loop rather than criticizing.
---
If you’re creeping around Buc and you see red better Kal Ort Por the fuck out of there.
---
Deathwing server?
---
For leveling you definitely want riposte, once 60 you can spec out of it though..
---
Tu as besoin d'une baguette oui oui. But nice try :p
---
You're projecting your stigma of certain social taboos and piggybacking it onto a question where you expected what you thought would be an obvious answer.
---
You didn't get one.
---
This is the root of the issue:
---
&gt;"To think that it’s normal for a parent to be okay with their daughter (whatever age) is showing sexual pictures of herself to stranger for game pixels, that’s concerning and not wanted."
---
It's none of my business once they become an adult. I'm not entitled to that information, and if I do stumble into it it's not really my business to pry. I respect their individuality enough to make their own decisions, and if they find their decisions have landed themselves in hot shit, i'll be there for support.
---
r/wowservers
---
Or they are trying to pick the right target and accidentally right click the loot instead of the mob?
---
Either have it as it was in vanilla (tons of servers, hour long queues, etc)  
---
Or make a fucking server that can handle that many people without layering and whatnots. Yes its gonna suck being in that first wave and not being able to complete quests because people are camping spawns, but its also true vanilla experience
---
Really? I’ve heard that the current WoW was also attempting to appeal to newer players, so this is very nice to know :) . Thanks for relying!
---
Yea. I plan on tanking in classic and I’ll be leveling with skinning and mining. Just as a source of money while leveling but not concentrating on them.
---
Once I get into the end game, I drop skinning for engineering and usually I have a small stockpile of materials to level up with. All the extra stuff I collect during leveling is usually sold off when convenient.
---
Engineering is super strong for PVE because of bombs. Just watch videos where guilds nearly one shot Viscidus in AQ40. 40 Sapper charges going off simultaneosly drops him from like 95% to 1% during the mini blob phase. Or as a tank use them to get AOE agro. They’re super useful.
---
Item level became directly viewable on the character sheet some time during Cataclysm I think. I didn't play during that era so can't be 100%.
---
Yeah, I ment compared to the spread, rather than within the class.
---
My guilds MT, a 40 something year old man, kept trying to get us to go camping with him.  We were 16...
---
Probably, but I don’t know too much about either, so I really wouldn’t know that
---
saving sharpbeak i think was the name!
---
An officer playing Rogue in my vanilla friends and family guild kicked out another Rogue for refusing to go to MC one random Saturday night.
---
He had been egged-on to do it by some toxic people we gained from a guild merger.  
---
So the guild got pissed because the Rogue was full nightslayer with bloodfang hood, MC weapons, etc.  
---
The guild imploded a few weeks later, they created a new guild lead by the toxic people which imploded when they got stuck on AQ twins.
---
Then the 2-3 toxic people that killed both prior guilds joined blood legion and all but one of them got cut.
---
I don't trust anything Blizz says.  They make changes all the time so they can pump more money into the store and then act like that ain't the reason they did it.  Then they make up some preposterous crock of shit "philosophy" as to why they did it, then renig on that "philosophy" the next patch but don't change any of the shit they did to get more money.
---
Long story short, they don't be keeping it real.
---
Hell yeah the priest tool kit for classic is just so good.
---
They were on a break!
---
Wait why get rid of the reporting feature?
---
Even above 40. As soon as you get BoL you can spam ~300hp heals pretty much for free. Thats enough up to BRD, from then on you should pack some serious Int or proper healing gear.
---
The official forums are now complaining that patch 1.12 is too easy and it should have been patch 1.3 or something. (ignoring that Blizz has said they don't have data from earlier patches)
---
Yes, females were quite the guild destroyers
---
bro, if I could toggle on/off new character models I think that would be the best. You who like eye bleeding terrible looking 15 year old pixilated squares could do that, and I could have the new hotness, while also keeping the immersion, and challenge of WoW Classic.
---
2nd story.
---
Going into TBC, I was with a core group of deflectors from our Vanilla guild mentioned in my other post. We made a new guild on a server transfer with about 8 of us, intending to be hardcore-casual (new idea, at the time). Essentially we were &lt;10 people decked in T3, wanting to clown around in the new expansion and take progression lightly.
---
Well, somehow or another, we ended up being the top alliance guild, and fighting neck and neck with the top horde guild for server firsts. We got Gruul (bugged fight though, very controversial) and Prince first in Kara. Shit was fun.
---
So what was the drama? Well, two things. One was two of this original core of 8 comprised of a warlock(M) and a priest(F), who regularly flirted with one another. We other officers had to regularly deal with the frequent and inevitable shitstorm when they'd get to arguing like an old married couple. There'd be drama for days, they'd cool off, and eventually it would begin again.
---
He was a super hot head about literally everything, and she was a massive flirt and attention seeker. Thought everyone liked her. Genuinely asked me over comms one time if I "liked liked" her. Couldn't be more cringe, and I remember that awkward feeling of having to carefully reject her in the nicest way to avoid drama.
---
Second drama was that our Gm and his wife got caught up in the rush of being alliance first / server first, and lost sight of what was important and what we wanted to do as a group of friends. Got real strained when he began to enforce very specific spec/talent rules and was against any form of counter-points.
---
Guild eventually had to merge with another guild due to attrition, and in time it eventually died out. Bit of a sad ending to an otherwise fun experience.
---
I've been at the center of guild drama two times over the course of my time playing wow (vanilla-&gt;cata) and both times ended with the guild dissolving.
---
Time 1: I was a rogue in vanilla grinding away at my shadowcraft set and the main tank and rogue class lead of my guild organized a ubrs run. We were a small guild, mostly working on progression in ZG and AQ20. Well, wouldn't you know it, Felstriker drops. The MT demanded it. My class lead was in the run with me, she said it should go to me. We both rolled need, and it went to me. MT quit the guild on the spot. Later that day, both me and the class lead were kicked for causing drama, and to try to get the MT back. MT refused to come back and the guild pretty much dissolved overnight.
---
Time 2: Some friends and I were invited to a casual raid guild at the beginning of cata. We were going through University and figured it would be a good idea to keep things simple. Anyway, the guild was pretty lousy - failing to clear the intro raids on normal difficulty - and one day the main tank and the guild leader (who were father and son). People were pretty ticked off by the lack of communication and raid, so I decided with the agreement of some officers to do an alt raid night with me as raid lead. Our alt group managed to get our first clears of bastion of twilight and bwd that night 
---
Guild leader came on later to apologize. When he found out what happened, he kicked me and the other officers involved. Several others left in protest. The guild lead and his dad eventually abandoned the guild and left for another server.
---
It's not a limitation, it's a design/performance choice. It is true that setting WoW to the Retail timing in 2004 would have probably not worked due to networks speeds and other tech back then. Yet on the flip side increasing the size and timing window batching isn't just a flat downgrade to anything. If you reduce the refresh rate, you improve network performance, especially when a lot of players are interacting (Raids, large-scale PvP). Retail WoW has very fast-paced, and much more responsive combat, but players have also noted that network performance drops \*much\* more quickly as more players start to interact in a single space. There can be other factors there, but I'd bet good money that trying to keep up with the new settings will play a significant factor in that.
---
There's also a different set of player behaviors and interactions that come from Vanilla spell batching. Behaviors and interactions that clearly some players (who argue for it) prefer. That makes it a design decision. 
---
I've argued on the side of not including something in Classic if it only existed due to technical limits (like debuff limits). But after talking a lot about Spell Batching, and recalling how it felt to PvP with both settings (pre-change and post-change), I can appreciate the value of having it in Classic to retain the same combat pacing.
---
Way back, BF and GF (can’t remember) were having dragon sex in vent. It’s like they wanted to get caught. It was pretty funny and they got talked about a lot.
---
Awesome!! I'm stoked to try out druid now :)
---
I'd call it prejudice, not discimination. But what do I know, English is not my first language.
---
I do however, as yourself, find the OP incredibly lame.
---
Hiya - I'm appreciate the offer and you do indeed look like a good match, but we are very keen to play alliance. Thanks.
---
So happy they fixed this, I remember back in the day when they patched the animation to be fast
---
Layering is such a cataclysmic change that once its in what is the point of fighting  minor, sensible and widely accepted QoL changes?  
---
Truth is the slippery slope boat has sailed on layering already
---
true, but as everything it has its niche. its very handy when doing the benediction quest.
---
I was reading elsewhere that bombs don't scale well with endgame content.
---
Trion brings back archeage basically every year with their stupid fresh starts. It gets progressively worse every time. No publisher could have fucked that game harder than Trion did.
---
Why have 50 servers when the dropoff from tourists are gonna be big?
---
Let's say that it happens. Blizzard releases 50 servers on NA side instead of layering. 25 of those realms (Probably more) Dies after a few months. They then need to merge servers, which will cause even more horrible things like duplicate names and barren servers if they're not filled completely.
---
Out of all alternatives, layering is the best one.
---
It was just the open beta stress test no servers until they do another ended 4 pm EST on Friday.
---
Leeway is a gimmick mechanic added by Blizzard to Vanilla after they realized melee can't hit ranged classes ever, at all, because of shitty hardware and software.
---
Now that same problem is solved organically simply due to having far superior hardware and software - you don't need layering mechanic on top of it.
---
Think of it like his:
---
- Vanilla +1 - Blizz: "Oh shit melee can't do anything, let's do something about it"
---
- Vanilla +1 (classic) - Oh, so we don't need layering anymore, it's all built in.
---
- Classic as it is now is +2 - Because you have both the organic improvements of modern hardware and software *on top* of gimmicky mechanic being activated. It is completely unnecessary.
---
Oh wow, is vanilla really lacking that much content? The other replies are saying it’s a long grind, so that should compensate for that flaw at least
---
Oh I know. I had guildmates who were geared and capable of one shotting noobs with 5K soulburns and other huge nukes.
---
Nope, just required to craft as it is BoP, but does not require the profession to equip.
---
Of course they have.  Its been 5 weeks now, that's an eternity in internet land.   It's also a beta capped at level 40 so there's only so much to do.
---
It means you’re the only person in the world with full access to classic WoW. You’ll be mikes ahead of everyone by the time the 26th of August comes around. Congrats man, with I was that lucky. /s
---
The level of mental gymnastics required to go from TOGGLE SUGGEST INVITE OPTION to LFR is tremendous tho

I've played on sververs with 8k people. It wasn't really that fun. There's no community, no reputation and the economy is fucked up beyond repair. I promise you, you don't want that.
---
Wasn't that possible with shift m anyway?
---
In my case it's more about (was back in the day at least) Spanish/French players simply not wanting to communicate in English. So give them their own realms so that I can play with people capable of making themselves understood/understands me.
---
You've got to be kidding me. This is at least the fifth post this morning alone. Use the search bar.

Leveling is going to be 100% the person. I leveled mine in beta and was one of the first dozen to hit level caps at 30 and 40.

I'm pretty sure this would count as a "change"

Sooooo login after it downloads (only takes 5 to 10 mins) and see if it shows you servers. If it doesn't, you don't.

You should play BFA.  The alt people already ruined that.

Discrimination:

&gt;the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people,

&gt;preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience.

It's not just opinion, OP wants streamers treated differently too.
---
Thank you for replying! Maybe once I’ve learned the fundamentals from classic I’ll be able to handle the learning curve Retail has (that is of course if I ever do get bored of classic)
---
Giving credit to the artist is a good step, but I know I'd be pissed to see someone throw a Photoshop filter onto something I had worked hard on and post it as their own.
---
I agree but cant start the change wagon and expect it to end there...
---
But the other factors should keep it suppressed. I see WAY less of it in retail than I did in vanilla. And I think vanilla will be harder to access than the retail game for gold farmers.
---
GM had his IRL gf in the guild. This was Burning Crusade. The guild never raided or anything, just casual dungeons and leveling, we were all kind of shit at the game. There was a group of like 10 of us that were active enough to become friends, exchanging real life names etc. I remember one of these guys (he was in charge of all PvP activities, GM handled PvE) hit on the GM's girlfriend or alluded to something? Details weren't forthcoming. 
---
He got /gkicked, took some of the friend group with him to find a PvP guild. Guild chat was quiet after that, the GM and his girlfriend were going through some personal issues. I think they were long distance? Either way they just up and transferred servers one day, left an alt with the GM position and never logged in again. A few years after I quit WoW I resubbed in Legion and my first character ever was still there, but now he had been promoted to GM and someone had changed the guild message. Nobody had been on in like two years or something it was incredibly depressing. I was young and my parents were getting a divorce so really this drama was a drop in a really dramatic ocean, my memory of it is really clouded, but they were my friends and I really missed them. Some of this quite possibly could be me misremembering just because it was such a chaotic time in my life. 
---
Anyways, Lightpenguin if you're out there. Chicken Warriors forever man.

I wish that were the case, there's 7.7 billion people in the world and some are ok with people like that. Even if this person kept every argument to 30 seconds, theyd have argued longer than Jeanne Calment of France was alive

---
Yes you have the  classic version and you can play it on the 27 of August before that day no
---
Depends on gear,  
---
If your lack Str then DS is rubbish, whilst it adds AP you have to account for ImpSOR being holy dmg and scaling with Righteous Fury for threat and 1h weapon specialisation and spll power.  
---
I think the premise of "generalising talents and good or bad is a bad idea, its so build dependant....  
---
Holy shield / sanctuary is bad for pvp, (with exceptions) and only really excels in tanking... i agree for tanking there certainly green, yet you have imp righteous fury in white... and its arguably more important. This looks very different for each build... maybe be more specific and it could mean something
---
I agree when limited to slots if you want an optimal comp. On my server they were used as solo or few defenders, rank 14 paladins when having access to the weapons are strong 1vX. Yes you can fall prey to sap and sheep but trinket and bubble will probably hold on until some reinforcement.
---
Loke was also on my server, the only paladin winning the honor contest, I remember him holding the bridge in AV, turning the tide in these long lasting bgs of the past.
---
Maybe It's just nostalgia and memories of early pvp metas, but I hope to see some rank 14 retadins out there again :)
---
OH NO, THERE ARE STILL BUGS WITH ONLY....... two months left.
---
its not like blizz is developing a new game. Literally all they are working on is bug fixes.
---
2 months is a lot of time. start complaining when theres a week left.
---
Yeah lets remove the unique things about wow.

I bought gold in vanilla for my epic mount cost me $20 for 950 gold. I still think it was worth it.

&gt;Warriors, Mages and Rogues. I just dislike the class fantasy. I guess i could play them as twinks but never as my main
---
Try again
---
Well, do tell
---
The only way to efficiently counter goldsellers is for blizzard to sell gold. But that won't fit in classic and they won't do it.
---
That said, I'm sure there WILL be goldsellers in classic, but they will probably only cater to top guilds that don't have time to farm.
---
True you want to protect your guild and time investment. What was most surprising to me was that the officers spent time perusing the other guilds apps to see if their own guild members were applying elsewhere. Imagine your employer doing that! I agree in that the other infighting definitely contributed.
---
or that

Beautiful !!

I thought in vanilla it was almost always warlock.

I think it’ll auto delete my comment if I don’t throw some extra stuff in.

There are instructions how to play on the website.

All I know is that my gut says maybe.

So does that mean in retail guilds are generally inactive or not social to newer players? If so then I’ll likely stay away from it until I git gud by playing classic. Thank you for responding!
---
something something enh shamans and spriests in bfa etc tl;dr dude yes it does happen and has very recently happened
---
Why the hell am I able to see further than my nose! They need to break the graphics!
---
This never gets old!
---
Love is in the air has really strong consumables that can be used in raids all year long.. not required but still great to have
---
Is the idea behind Edward the Odd that you just use the procs for Holy Light/Flash of Light? Or is there a way it adds damage output too
---
I guess that's true. But hey, its vanilla, if you see that item on the AH just tell the whole server ^^
---
Is the pattern for BOP robe easy to get? It says 7% drop on wowhead... Do you need tailoring to see it drop?
---
Not really true, you can raid heal as hotw just fine
---
Need. Wouldn't even think about it. I farmed that mount on and off for 4-5 years. Never got it.
---
Looks like the sprint trail when stealthed isn't displaying correctly. Minor issue though.
---
Cool! It’s nice to have the option of upgrading, thanks for letting me know :)
---
Agree, I just tested on the new fresh on Lighthope and it is very hard to keep up with Herbalism.  
---
I would say its worth to make a lvl 5 alt and learn either LW/Tailor and enchanting to craft your wand or gather some valuable mats.  but thats it,  I really think any gathering profession on a fresh jam pack server is not viable and will slow you down way too much to keep up.  Get to 60 with your mount ASAP. then you'll farm.
---
Daggers, idk if it still pertains but off hand you wanted a 2.40 weapon.

The "more dots ok stop dots" animation never fails to make me laugh

[You're level 29](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tktRtmtwtvtitNtOtPtQvdtntVtotWtdtFtGtHtI). You have the option of Dual Wield Spec, Sword Spec, or taking Blade Flurry. Obviously you take Blade Flurry. So now do you take Sword Spec? No. Every point in Dual Wield Spec is better and the chances of you using ONLY swords for the next 30 levels isn't very good anyway.
---
[You're level 34](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tktRtmtwtvtitNtOtPtQvdtntVtotWtdtFtGtHtItXtjtJtKtL) and have just opened up Aggression and Weapon Expertise, but actually, Dual Wield Spec is still more damage, so you finish it.
---
[You're level 38](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tktRtmtwtvtitNtOtPtQvdtntVtotWtdtFtGtHtItXtjtJtKtLtMC0C1C2) with the option of 1 point in Sword Spec or 1 point in Weapon Expertise. It's an obvious choice again.
---
[You're level 40](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tktRtmtwtvtitNtOtPtQvdtntVtotWtdtFtGtHtItXtjtJtKtLtMC0C1C2JTtp), congrats on Adrenaline Rush! Now do we take Sword Spec? Nope. A 1% chance to hit again with a weapon, potentially being missed, dodged, blocked, or parried is straight up worse than a 1% chance to crit.
---
[You're level 45](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tktRtmtwtvtitNtOtPtQvdtntVtotWtdtFtGtHtItXtjtJtKtLtMC0C1C2JTtpuIuJuKuLuM), Sword Spec now?! Nope. If you've been playing smart, you've been trying to keep 100% uptime on Slice and Dice. When a mob is low and you still have a bunch of combo points, that's what you've been using it on. So 4 extra seconds on a 1-point SnD and almost 10 extra seconds on a 5-point SnD is great! Much better than a small chance to hit the mob again, which has equal chance of happening at 1% mob health when it's useless as it does anywhere else. Plus, you've still got that fast dagger in your offhand, so it's not really worth it.
---
[You're level 48](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tktRtmtwtvtitNtOtPtQvdtntVtotWtdtFtGtHtItXtjtJtKtLtMC0C1C2JTtpuIuJuKuLuMuXuYuZ) and you're starting to catch on. You know Relentless Strikes and Lethality are much better talents than Sword Spec, so you take 2/2 Murder and get both.
---
[You're level 56](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tktRtmtwtvtitNtOtPtQvdtntVtotWtdtFtGtHtItXtjtJtKtLtMC0C1C2JTtpuIuJuKuLuMuXuYuZuQuRu9uDuEuFuGuH), only 3 more points to care about in the leveling experience and you probably won't be switching weapons again. Now it's finally time to consider Sword Spec.
---
How much of a fucking retard do you have to be to think improved graphics has anything to do with shit like LFR and the other QoL stuff that led WoW down its path.
---
I mean fuck graphics don't matter at all right, lets just get rid of all the models and everything is just sqaure blocks with stats over it.
---
Fucking moron.
---
I’ll link a talent build a little later.
---
Pretty much
---
Our main tank for 2 years was a female human warrior, never spoke in vent ever and always acted as if was female. When real ID came out with bnet integration, they neglected to unlink Facebook and we all learned he was a dude all along. Hilarity ensued.
---
It's just been like that forever
---
I LOVED the original WoW.  I want it to remain EXACTLY as it was when I played it from 2004-2006.  After they release that content exactly as it was, then I'd be ok with them moving in a different direction with the game to help it evolve in a better way than it did going into TBC and beyond.  Vanilla WoW wasn't perfect, but by the time we got the 1.12 patch, things were about as balanced as they were going to get.  The game is launching at the 1.12 patch status minus the actual raiding content, so I think the game is in a good spot and should not be changed any further.  There are certain specs that were still not viable for raiding at the end of the game, but making it so they would be viable for raiding would make them incredibly unbalanced in pvp.  Trust me, they had 2 years to work out the kinks with the classes.  It's as good as it's going to get before adding new talents, etc. and fundamentally changing the way the classes play.
---
No. Cry as much as possible so they fix as much as possible, because once they start getting money for it, they will care way less.
---
They want our money and our trust back after ruining the game for us in the first place, they can work for it. And you can fuck off with your corporate apologist rhetoric. 
---
Strafing left or right while having a target still causes the entire model to turn that direction. Fix it.
---
Hunters thinking they can solo DM on a real server with % chance for FD to resist lol
---
They made the game so that every piece of gear is "good" and that spells and rotations are very easy to learn... All you have to do is boost and mash buttons, even though the coding soup is a lot more complicated, the game is made so that a 4 year old can roll a DK and melt in arena.
---
Because people are morons.  The new models and animations and assets in general look pretty good, but even though it impacts gameplay in NO WAY whatsoEVER they still *need* the old graphics likely due to autism.
---
Isn't that "you have a need for the baguette" not just " you need a baguette". Why would you bother correcting it that way.
---
They are playing on vanilla servers, which are based on 1.12 version of WoW client as it was in 2006. Classic on the other hand is trying to recreate the old vanilla game on more modern engine. So private people are not playing Classic in the strict sense of the word.
---
Frost mage Blizzard spam would blow away Thorns lol
---
I hope I’ll be able to handle it, but I’m always happy to take on challenging environments. Thanks for commenting :)
---
Not drama so much as a misunderstanding. In GChat some girl was talking about how her uncle died and someone else was making jokes. I typed "lmao" in the chat at a very inopportune time and got kicked. Any Wildhammer folks out there?
---
I really dont think that making dwarfs feel sub par compared to humans in PVE is the thing that makes wow unique.
---
That is also why i suggested different as well as true to the lore weapons for the different races.
---
That may have been your experience. I have ran two DKP guilds. The rules never changed or were bent. We did not even reserve legendaries. There were tiers different levels of raider were allowed to spend, but how to progress through those tiers were also defined by rules. Certain classes were banned from bidding on items, like a dft on a hunter. Everything was written down and did not change throughout the life of the guild.
---
This evolution happened over several years. People were asking for easier way to farm dungeons, or farm gold. No need to do any mental gymnastics, just look at the history and how each feature was introduced and changed. 
---
There are plenty more small things that became game breaking.
---
So let’s just give up and all go back to retail
---
I mean, why would you want that? IIRC, in vanilla the servers were capped at like 3k or something. And that was plenty.
---
think you wanna check your sarcasm detector.
---
Knowing blizzard they will mess this up and ruin classic.
---
Are you guys recruiting? Lol... that sounds like a pretty good system.
---
Yes, but the poster isn't doing any action, he want someone else to do it and is expression his very flawed view on why, based on made up BS. Discrimination by its nature are actions (or absence from actions).
---
Fear of too much change is a valid reason for saying no.
---
You must be new here. Dps never pick the right target. Each of them hit a different mob, making sure to breal CC as often as possible, and always put dots on so they can't be sheeped or blinded.
---
The build I showed has 5 points in resto ..... are you sure you are not confusing it with the 0/30/21 build?
---
At the same time, screaming about layering existing at all isn't exactly helpful.
---
Blizzard is putting in some form of layering. Full Stop. People spending time shouting about how layering is "Not Classic" are not helping it be implemented in a way that accomplishes the goals Blizzard has for it. The conversation needs to be turned towards, "how can it be done well".
---
Remember that leveling is not the only part of the game. It really matters what you wanna do at 60. I went feral druid on a P server and loved everything about it until I got to 60 when I was only asked to raid as a healer, and I felt gimped in PvP for not playing a hybrid spec. I was disappointed. I tried out protection paladin and I absolutely love it, but I know that at 60 everyone would want me to be a healer. So you gotta choose a class that will not only be fun to level, but also fit into what you wanna do at 60.
---
Oh thank god, I thought it was. Thnx for digging this out.
---
Wow, I always assumed people who play WoW are addicted and/or just get sucked into the game and play for longer periods of time. Thanks for pointing that out!
---
it sure is :)
---
HUUUUHH! - Defias Pillager
---
it appears fixed on latest build on beta
---
It didn’t break up the guild, but I remember the worst applicant we ever had. It was a mage named Xelgar in BC. He had absurd gear for the dead server we were on, and we assumed he just transferred from somewhere else. We brought him into the archimonde fight and he wiped us over and over again, not hitting tears, running through fire, not going the right direction. He was gkicked after that raid.
---
The next day he got back into our vent, hammer drunk and just started RANTING about all of us. We recorded the conversation and it was absolute gold, after that he became a running joke amongst the guild for 2 expansions. He had to of bought his account or something.
---
WoW 3 kinds. You will squeeze time for yourself, your mental health demands it. :)
---
She never cheated.
---
Were you able to keep up the herbing as you leveled from zone to zone? I was finding on my PS that I finished zones faster than my alch could keep up with so I’d end up in places where I couldn’t pick herbs.
---
Just encourages natiionalism in guilds,  which has always been shitty.
---
r/wowservers is where you go for that. Referencing pservers directly isn't allowed on this sub as that isn't what it's for, it's for the official retail server option.
---
That's been my issue.  I got one group of friends going Alliance and another smaller group going Horde.  I've always played Horde but the Alliance group tends to flipflop games though they claim due to nostalgia they'd stay longer with Classic.
---
That must have been pretty late vanilla. I know at one point I was seeing alot of spam for 1000g for $100.
---
I think professions can work very effectively if it's coordinated with your friends or guild mates.
---
For example, person A can learn skinning and enchanting right away. Person B can learn leatherworking and whatever else.
---
Person A has the option to either sell most of the leather to vendor early on for an increased boost in income, but he can also often send bulk leather to Person B who can then craft leather gear for free, thus increasing his own profession level, and then allowing pe rson A to disenchant the crafted gear and in turn, raise his enchanting level.
---
It can be super effective and mostly cost effective. Just need some external help or trading contract with somebody.
---
I mean in a raiding environment I find healing to be way more fun and engaging than DPS any day. As far as PvP or other activities go that’s up to you. In PvP though any healer class is going to do A LOT more than just cast heals.
---
In practice it might not mean all that much, even though some guides state the opposite, but I really dont like playing something I know is not the best possible option it simply bugs me somehow.
---
Oh yeah I misread your comment
---
Looks alot more 2006 to me.
---
Greater blessings, pvp titels, and only 10man.
---
Props to the people finding bugs/glitches. Between them and the classic team striving to give us the vanilla that used to be, I'm optimistic about launch in a couple months. I expect there to still be bugs or inconsistencies, but that's okay because I have faith they'll be ironed out. 
---
I don't know what to say about the EU servers topic, but considering how much work they've been putting in, I doubt they're not going to implement a solution to it.
---
Scrubs twink at 19 there's only 2 buttons to press. Stop patting yourself on the back. Win duels and bgs at the 60 bracket peasants.
---
Not sure I’ll have to check on my pserver tonight
---
&gt;Except Layering can actually distribute populations to create populated layers, and dynamically remove themselves when they are no longer needed
---
it doesn't create population at all it divides it. and those in your layer today become nameless faces. also layering doesn't just phase you willy nilly, once you're pushed into a dead layer the only way to leave it is to join a group. imagine if it was dynamic and you were happy questing along suddenly you're pushed in a populated layer and all the mobs are tagged lol. no it doesn't remove layers.
---
i was on realm 3, it was completely dead from hogger &amp; eastvale onward, long before sharding leveling only zones were dead not all zones, tbc dailies zone was packed, the island in mop was packed, players still fought over mining nodes in cata. in wod the apexis zone was dead 90% of the time. i saw 6 people at the start of bfa the world was almost empty for the release of an expac it was like the release of age of conan lol.   
---
the only time i saw people was when i got phased on one specific world quest, it happened 3 different times it was weird, a horde raid was at it all 3 times. 
---
if layering were done by zone by a human it could make layers feel populated but its not, its automated and done by continent and the 50 people in your layer could be anywhere.  
---
&gt; That's a product of a game that was pushing people to end-game zones and reducing leveling time.    
---
you're thinking CRZ not sharding which is done to " create a smoother game experience. "  
---
where crz is done to increase the populations of low pop zones specifically, sharding is the opposite.
---
Way to be part of the problem!
---
&gt; Level 23-60: $$ Elemental Earth - Hillsbrad (Rumbling Exile)/Badlands (Rock Elemental)/Thousand Needles (Thundering Boulderkin) 
---
Earth can also be farmed from the Elementals in Stonetalon Mtns, right? I believe the drop was disabled on pservers (to prevent lowbie ganking I guess) but they will drop it in Classic.
---
Took me years to realize this, but wedding factory hotel bars over any college bar.
---
Friday and Saturday nights, go to the places in your area famous for lavish weddings.  Normally a close by local bar or public bar is attached to the wedding facility for the “after party.”
---
This is the holy grail of picking up women.  Most single ladies are DTF after their best friend or sister just got married.
---
I'm pretty #nochanges, but that actually sounds kinda neat. Maybe certain servers will develop reputations for having really good pvpers.
---
Why does that shit happen so much in WoW? This thread alone (previous to your post) has something like 5-7 cheating wives/girlfriends (I count sending out nudes to others as cheating)
---
The same happens in older threads/forum posts that ask for guild drama.
---
Like, Jesus... Is that really so common?
---
I did the stress test and I did the same macro on a tauren huter with the gun ..... and I watched a streamer testing the same macro on Troll with a bow. 
---
The bug looks to be animation only and spamming it still has auto attacks. I dont think I had the same problem on my tauren though with the gun.
---
Give us original mount models for the first few phases! I want my unarmored ivory raptor!!
---
Undead do the same poison quest on Kalimdor that Orcs/Trolls do.
---
There might be a breadcrumb quest in Undercity that sends you to Orgrimmar to go start the quest, but I don't remember. If there is, it should be optional and only gives a negligible amount of XP for actually doing it.
---
Make sure you do the rogue quest that gives you the Blade of Cunning. Should be level 10 or 11, I believe. Orcs/Trolls have an equivalent quest, but I don't think you'll have access to it.
---
For leveling you can pretty much skip Silverpine if you want to, but I personally like questing there. Hillsbrad is pretty much unavoidable unless you're content with grinding a bunch of levels out in the mid 20's.
---
Do you have a friend you intend to duo level with? If so, you and any fury warrior will make an amazing team. You both suck on your own, but his DPS triples with a pocket healer, and he will kills things more then twice as fast as you would have solo-retting. 
---
Grinding 5 mans is ok too, but sadly leveling 30-43 will suck, SM is 30+ minutes of travel from Ironforge so finding a group and getting there will take all of your efficiency away.
---
Again, that's completely solvable with proper gear itemization. 
---
As for the no taunt, that's again fixed with another set bonus or a trinket that affixes another skill.
---
It's not the most ideal fix but if you didn't want to touch the classes themselves it's all you're left with.
---
HERP DERP FUCKITY DOO
---
They are trying to but WoW being an MMO with 15 years of expansions there have been tons of systems added then removed and added again and changed and so on, for a new player it can be extremely daunting to understand what exactly is going on and since people have so much experience with the game usually expect others to know the game, which new players obviously won't and the gap between a good player and a bad player in retail is massive.
---
Since the leveling "experience" in retail is not really considered a fun part of the game anymore it's just something you try to get out of the way, it doesn't exactly teach you how to play a game even if you don't boost a character.
---
In classic you start your character with 2 spells and some really basic gear and slowly gain new spells. Even for someone who knows the game it takes 200+ hours to get to max level, for someone new and taking their time exploring and experiencing the game it should take 300-400 hours to get to max level. In that time you can learn what your abilities do and there aren't a million random systems in the game. 
---
Also a really big plus for new players is that classic being a lot slower paced people tend to be a lot more patient. When I played retail and some random noob joined our grp we just simply vote kicked him and got another person no problem, you can't exactly do that in classic and if someone isn't a complete idiot I'm more than happy to explain to them what to do in dungeons or help with the class they play. In retail everything is so fast I'd be annoyed if I had to wait a few minutes for someone. 
---
Many people that have already played Vanilla will focus on endgame a lot but as a new player I would recommend taking your time leveling, exploring the world, making friends etc. There are people that enjoyed playing Vanilla without ever raiding or doing high level pvp.
---
i wont be playing so good luck  
---
and what does that have to do with my comment?
---
Certain gear has always been mandatory for certain specs though.
---
https://youtu.be/yTckIG8mEak
---
Leave my reading comprehension lacking ass alone.
---
Let's go with your 1 million EU players number even though it's preposterous.
---
You're getting at most 5 servers. 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 PVE. Maybe not even this many.
---
For every 1 player that would have chosen a French realm, they'll be 5 players that would have chosen a German realm.
---
For every 1 player that would have chosen a German realm, they'll be 3 players that would have chosen an English realm.
---
1 million players spread out over 5 realms is 200,000 per realm.
---
If ALL the French choose one realm, they'll at best make up 20% of that realm.
---
If ALL the Germans choose one realm, they'll take over a server. But that's unlikely because choosing PVE, PVP, or RP is a hotly debated topic and a very personal choice.
---
You'd be hard pressed to find quests in the opposing zone, wouldn't you?
---
Notice how he whispered about the tank. Didn’t omgfbbq flame him in party chat. Times are diff bruhhhh.
---
Absolutely loved UBRS. I spent so much time in groups waiting to find someone with the key or a rogue to pick the door. When I finally decided to get the key for myself I felt like it was one of the best decisions I ever made lol.

Tested the new fresh on lighthope this weekend, and I feel behind really fast doing herbalism due to the lack of herbs and the high population.
---
Pretty sure Im gonna go skinning and enchanting with a lvl 5 Leatherworker or tailor ALT to craft my wand asap, then gonna stop DE and sell the green/blue for mount.
---
Will focus on profession once 60.
---
I ran an add on in vanilla. So yeah... no changes.
---
Sounds terrible tbh, not onyl are you going to open yourself up to being ganked much more, you will also have to face the situation of having no class trainers near you. Requiring you to hearth more than you normally would. It def would be a challenge, but i don't think it would be fun at all. Good luck though if you decide to go for it.
---
Yea, greater blessings were not until 1.9 which came out Jan 2006

I was able to run and play the stress test with a very minimal notebook at about 30fps at 720p and visual settings around 3-4. The notebook has a Celeron 3450 processor with integrated Intel graphics 520 and 4 gigs of ddr3 ram. If I open about 5 tabs on chrome (especially if any are videos like YouTube) then the notebook starts slowing down which should tell you how little it takes to play wow reasonably.
---
Ew
---
Its so ironic how much hate too many people in this sub have for the devs. Despite everything they're bringing us and how responsive they've been, too many people apparently harbor nothing but skepticism and anger. Like chill the fuck out.
---
Dwarves will always superior class for Priests, every race has their niche.
---
Pretty sure your armor cap math is incorrect. It has been 14 years but I played a Druid both Resto and feral in end game through Naxx and when I was full tank spec with max armor I recall the drop off being at 16,000 armor. Everything past that was 0 damage reduction. Please provide source if I am incorrect.
---
LoL, i totally forgot about that crouching pally hidden healer thing xD
---
For solo try to get some str gear and or non needed rolls that are dps and just say “offspec please” /roll with anyone else doing the same. Possibly
---
Mix in some spell power?
---
Yeah, I work in networking and as part of my job I deal with load balancing software frequently, I'm no programmer, but I have a very good grasp of how this sort of stuff and what goings into managing. Blizzard is handling the situation as well as one can, given that they've chosen that course of action. 
---
They chose layering. All the "suggestions" people are giving to "fix" layering are mostly ridiculous given how it actually works. Its all silly, but people don't want to put the time into reading how it works.
---
That is not even REMOTELY fucking imaginable.
---
nah by 2006 i was in mostly tier1- tier2 and was strictly holy.
---
AOE leeway means that things like frost nova will hit even if the target is slighlty outside of it, to compensate for lag.
---
The running through blizzard thing is due to batching.
---
NOW, HANDLE IT

5-6 days Pro. 7-8 days Average.

I kinda feel this way about rolling a shammy. Might just go mage this time but wf in pvp can occasionally be fun.

I wanted to do this since I was always horde but it literally feels like a betrayal, I had no idea I was this attached to my faction. I have to roll horde

Looking for a guild that is semi casual and would raid Sunday and Monday 8pm EST - midnight. Wanting to role a warrior tank, MT/OT. I am a pretty laid back individual and due to work I wouldn’t be able to be on much 3-4 days a week.
---
Pm me if interested.
---
Hello,
---
I still cant choose what to play on vanilla launch...I really like rogue style..stealthy annoying sh*t. But I also like hunter mostly for easy lvling and still strong in pvp (my main target will be pvp).
---
On the other side i am worried about buying arrows all the time and worried about pet care food etc.
---
what is your opinion guys ?
---
Appreciate all answer. thanks
---
You dont need to preface with "I dont watch streamers"
---
Damage wise? They don’t replace abilities, but they’re still super useful. As a tank you can start the fight by throwing a grenade for just a little extra threat to get ahead of your dps.
---
And in world pvp they’re life savers.
---
....slightly worse? Come on now bud.
---
Ashenvale?
---
I only ever go to Hillsbrad right before I'm ready for Arathi and usually it's just for the FP or to finish off a few easy quests to ding.
---
It won’t shock me if it happens.  I plan the move through the levels quickly but I think my wife would divorce me if I took a week off work and put 100 hours into the game just to down Ragnaros first.
---
When I say slow I mean FUCKING slow
---
Sure, engineer helps you big time, but against, its another cost. Having those consumables help, but again, they cost time to get and they only give you an emergency button to push, they don't solve the issue completely. Mobility is a big problem for warriors.
---
On a pserver, I just remember this one warlock was was a guild leader *crying* in the raid Discord after some things had gone awry and the guild started splitting. No matter who was right or wrong previously, that kid was definitely the loser and de facto "incorrect" person. When the guild split, not knowing ANY of the drama particulars since I was still leveling to 60, I chose the faction that didn't have the crying warlock. That faction guild disbanded in another month anyway, probably due to more bitching and crying.
---
Looks very good on humans imo
---
Finally. People were telling me I was crazy, but I knew that combat text was tiny.
---
It is possible that the guild you were applying to contacted people from your guild to inquire about what kind of person/player you were.
---
I think tier 1 looks really cool
---
I see you've met my right wing coworkers.
---
Yes, I grinded living essences before school
---
honestly, I didn't think enhancement shaman in bfa was hit too hard. the pruning sucked ass, it always sucks ass, but I thought other specs got hit wayyy harder.
---
source: someone who's played enh shaman and ONLY enh shaman for a decade now
---
Rated BGs were never popular on retail. They are would likely be niche in Classic too.
---
Are you looking to have your ass beaten you ally scum
---
BOTH bindings dropped on your 2nd week??
---
Well, for one I like having more people in my server, and I dont think doubling or tripling the server capacity equals the things you claimed
---
&gt;and one day the main tank and the guild leader (who were father and son). 
---
think you left out some details
---
Trolls subpar?
---
Beserking and 5 HP/sec begs to differ.
---
100% agree, but I’ve seen the mentality shift to people rolling need on boes. Not vanilla spirit at all
---
No I mean the classic client is giving me more trouble.
---
You sure about that?
---
The sad part is you have to remember the people getting on the forums and reddit is a pretty small % of players.  Most players have no idea this is going on and are going to be in for a fun surprise down the road.
---
But he didn't post it as his own. He specifically mentioned the artist and never claimed it to be his own work.
---
Yes, there's information. There are numerous posts about this if you bothered to use the search bar before writing another post about it.
---
He could also just stream on an alt. Keep his main secret. Yeah, he won't be getting any world firsts or whatever, but neither will you or I.
---
Yeah, just leave at level 12. Don't forget to train Swords though.
---
Worst is it was a break she pretty much created that he didn't want. She apparently had never "been" with anyone else. She fooled around with a few other dudes as well. 
---
I just dunno why she made it out like we were serious though, because it became very clear she planned on getting back with him from the start.
---
The biggest bonus is starting fresh with everyone else. Level playing field.
---
Assuming you actually missed the palpable sarcasm in his post, this kind of hyper negativity is what OP is getting at. Nothing beneficial comes from you harassing some other random person on reddit...
---
I'm currently writing a druid-focused follow-up to [my post about macros](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3b97c/with_10_buttons_or_less_your_macros_can_access/), because a lot of people expressed interest. I think Druids (followed closely by Warriors) are the class that benefit the most from comprehensive, smart macros and keybinds. This video is a good resource in an easily digestible format. My only complaint is that I think even more can be done.
---
More servers so when the population tanks a bit after launch as it absolutely will then need to force migrations to consolidate the population so people can find their player name is taken by somebody who hasn't logged in in 3 weeks because they decided classic isn't for them and now they're forced to change theirs?
---
It makes more sense to layer launch and then open new servers as needed after most of the tourists have left.
---
The +weapon skill is fairly overrated, and can be replaced by gear in raids (the only place it really matters) with +weapon skill items. Meanwhile, stoneform is an amazing PvP ability, situationally good PvE ability, and is irreplaceable throughout all of the game. Troll berserking is an excellent threat generating ability for tanks, and can be clutch for a priest to get big heals off quickly.
---
Your suggestions don't really make sense, either. You say that everyone needs weapon skill, but not forsaken because lore. Night elves and trolls have polearm specialization, which doesn't make much sense lore-wise as far as I know, and is mostly worthless. It also introduces the same issue, since different classes want different weapons, so now any alliance rogue using daggers has to be a gnome, right?
---
The reality is that you should just play what you want, and accept that you have made a flavorful choice at the cost of a potentially sub par min/max choice, which probably won't matter for 90% of the content. The unique racial system gives classic WoW a lot of flavor. Don't homogenize it.
---
Id had nothing to do with the changes themselves but with the kind of feedback blizzard choose to cater to
---
Say that to all the people that played BFA Alpha and beta. I mean, the Classic team is doing the best work seen in ages but in the end it's Activision Blizzard they fear. We love this game, we don't want this game to fail.
---
dude this has literally just happened with the BFA beta where the devs refused to acknowledge tons of bugs and feedback by players who were saying "these balance changes and game mechanics arent good, please fix them". Then we got BFA and we all know how that went down with players
---
Whoops! Thanks for the heads up.
---
This was a huge meme on Tich for months.  Iirc, she told the guild in advance she would do it but people didn't believe her.
---
As far as I’m aware, 305 skill allows you to only need 8% hit in PvE. More weapon skill helps reduce the damage lost from your glancing blows. 
---
Getting 350 - 310 weapon skill and 8% hit should be the norm, I believe.
---
Yup. We were pretty stoked with the first, then couldn’t believe our eyes on number two. Pretty incredible luck. However in all our time clearing MC weekly afterwards we never saw another binding or an eye of rag.
---
Your healer may run into mana issues if they’re switching back and forth a lot. I like the idea of a versatile tank/dps team, though. If you add a rogue to your setup you’ll be more than fine, and still preserve the stealthy playstyle.
---
Here's my drama among a few comments; It's [WoW related](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bqhfq9/whats_your_i_finally_met_my_online_friend_horror/eo4j9cr?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), as all parties involved had been guildmates for years across multiple guilds. 
---
TLDR: I moved in with a buddy of mine and his girl. He was a long haul driver, made false accusations of me messing around with his girl. They kicked me out, stole a bunch of my stuff. Cut them out of my life completely, including in WoW. They left our guild (I was GM) and I eventually quit playing.
---
People never remember the bug fixes or redesigns based on player feedback in WoW betas. They only remember the things that didn't change. I remember in a recent expansion beta, there was a huge uproar over monk tanking. Long posts about player feedback/complaints. There was even a blue post explaining that they thought players went playing the spec correctly and explaining the intent. You know what happened? Monk tanking got a bunch of changes and fixes based on the player feedback. During beta. People were happy with the changes.
---
This actually happens a lot. People always forget. They only remember what didn't get fixed.
---
getting +8 swords(so 1 point in weap expertise) and 6% hit will cap you. anything beyond that is not needed.
---
I do not fully understand your comment.
---
My friend has been levelling priest and while they might not do the best damage they're very hard to kill.  A lot of the time my friend would just heal himself to full psychic scream and walk away
---
You see WAY less of it in Retail than Vanilla because Blizzard added a legitimate way to buy gold in Retail.
---
retard
---
Yeah, if WoW PvP was factionless (aka free for all) I never would have played on PvP servers. That sort of system is just too anarchic and too enabling for arseholes to bother with.
---
My guess is this is from April or May 2006
---
if human +8 weap skill(so 1 point in weap expertise) and 6% hit will cap you. anything beyond that is not needed.
---
 Oh, my God! If you say that one more time, **I'm** gonna break up with you!

TOO SOON! YOU HAVE AWAKENED ME TOO SOON, EXECUTUS!

love the voice acting of that one

The only person I remember outside of my own guild and a few others was Agnwe anyway lol
---
200000 per realm? Youre delusional if you think blizz will make such realms, it will be more like 20-50k per realm with top realms peaking at 2-3k online

There are many types of autists.

I was specifically referring to autists that think WoW was made to be PVP game when it clearly wasn't.
---
I think watching people play video games, outside of events, is ridiculous anyways.  I'm just saying I've seen it pan out
---
w...t...f...
---
if people made a movie on that it wouldnt be believed
---
Im not saying there won’t be plenty of tourists. Of course there will be. But I think people (Bliz especially) are underestimating this game. I don’t think they need to literally double the server amount to 50. But for the more populated areas especially NA &amp; EU they should double the server amount. Bring the number up from 25 servers to 35. And having no language based servers for EU is a joke imo and I’m not even European lol. Layering kills the “genuine classic feel” more than a suggest invite option ever could tho bud. Watch the dozens of videos about it
---
&gt; I hope they also give new animation/model option, only you are able to choose what to use so it won't effect your "muh vanilla" at all.
---
Nah, they won't give you that.  The "muh vanilla" people will absolutely SHIT THE BED if ANYBODY GETS TO USE NEW MODELS OR ANIMATIONS because "REEEEEEEEEEEEE" even if they can disable it.
---
That is just how they think.
---
Layering will destroy large group encounters - there are already a couple examples of this, where 40-man groups ride straight through each other on different layers.
---
Sounds fucking hardcore you should do it

I'm looking for a raiding guild on a PvP server that fits my mindset going into the game. I have a flexible schedule for raiding and I live on the east coast, I can adapt to any reasonable raiding schedule.  I feel every player should contribute to the raid in every way they can, everyone should be putting effort into improving themselves, no player should hamper their playstyle assuming guildies will pick up the slack (example: being content to stand in the fire or refusing to accept advice from your class officer when you need it)  and everyone should be friendly and respectful to each other. I'm trying to avoid a guild with lots of demeaning insults thrown around. I have no issue at all with friendly ribbing. I would love a guild where we form bonds and friendships with other other, progression is important but enjoying your time in the game should not be sacrificed. That said, wiping for 4 hours isn't fun for anyone. But the most important thing is a guild that treats everyone like a person and respects the time and effort we all put in, not just treating us like faceless characters. Being able to call my guildmates friends is extremely important. I played classic til TBC came out, then I played wrath and quit for good once Cata released. During Classic I played warrior and raided up to BWL., but guild stopped at AQ because of TBC. I plan to main a paladin (going to be holy for endgame content) and have a warlock alt. I am okay with either DKP or loot council, both have their pros and cons. I would slightly prefer loot council if the culture of the guild is right but like I said a well designed DKP system is great too. 
---
I would also enjoy being able to do unstructured content with my guildies when its not raid night - ad hoc battleground premades, 20 man raids that our guild doesn't focus on (if the guild does include 20 mans as part of the raiding schedule that is good too), strath runs for mount, on the fly world pvp, any of the sort of things that are fun for guildies to do together when not on the clock!
---
I am going to be attempting to get to 60 at a reasonable rate. I have a flexible work schedule so I will be able to play frequently and will likely level quickly, but I am not going to be hitting 60 as fast as humanly possible, more at an above average rate.
---
I would love the opportunity to join a good guild. Send me a message if you think I would be a good fit. Thank you in advance!
---
If you are leveling solo. Lvl Ret and keep healing gear in the bank. You will be fine. 
---
If you are leveling as a group then yeah holy is fine. Focus on keeping the downtime of your squad to as little as possible rather than worrying about helping DPS. Judge wisdom if you have a caster. Keep everyone’s HP topped off. The rest of the group does the killing you focus on making them better.
---
Nah just use a down ranked version of holy nova and holy water when you need more. That event is easy breezy and if your knew to it, just have some one come in and wipe it so you dont fail it.
---
Which class to choose.
---
Nope. [Found it.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/3.x) 3.2 just before ICC like I was saying. I was getting ready for that release when the LFD groups all became jerks who would kick you for your ilvl.  
---
"Item level: A new option has been added under Display in the Interface Options to show the item level on item tooltips."
---
A ton of servers will have to be shut down and the populations merged. This has unpleasant consequences for active players as I mentioned in another comment. That is not preferable to layering for a few weeks and opening up new servers later on if needed.
---
Vanilla WoW was not designed around high server popualations. It doesn't matter if it was just a technical limitation of the time or by design, the game world was designed around roughly 3-4k online players. For big pserver populations to work they had to introduce dynamic respawns etc and no, that isn't an ideal solution because it's a very, very different feel and community from vanilla. It's easier to be a shitty person and fade into the background the bigger your community is, it's hard to fucking kill anything, it isn't even remotely authentic.
---
High server populations don't just suck "on that first wave and not being able to complete quests", they are like that all day every day forever. It isn't the true vanilla experience at all, dude.
---
The cognitive dissonance I feel towards goldsellers/buyers can be summed up like this.
---
I understand some people think it's Pay2Win and it's unfair that someone with money can essentially exchange real $$ to avoid spending time farming.
---
On the other hand, some people have copious amounts of free time either from being unemployed, a student, or a lucky S.O.B with little to no responsibilities or commitments outside the game.
---
Buying gold doesn't inherently give you a significant advantage over other players. You still have to be a good player, you still are required to spend the gold properly and either Raid or PvP at a compitent level.
---
So it is okay if someone has the ability to dedicate 50+ hours a week to the game grinding gold, but it's not okay if they work 50+ hours a week and then chose to pay real $$ in exchange for real time spent?
---
I'm not for or against Gold buying, I've never done it.
---
But......."Time is Money, friend"
---

---
&gt;Batching
---
They literally made it work the way it did with Vanilla to appease people.
---
I'm sure Blizzard will take note of your suggestion
---
not that it has anything to do with what I wrote, but alright
---
Only barely conceptually feasible.  You would be grinding entirely on mobs with the exception of a Horde in Westfall being able to do Captain Sander’s Treasure Map, or an alliance being able to do Winds in the Desert/Harpy Raiders in Durotar and the neutral Ratchet quests in the Barrens.
---
Glancing blow damage is only reduced up to 308 weapon skill, and has diminishing returns after 305. Going from 305 to 308 makes glancing blows go, on average, from 85% white hit damage to 95% white hit damage. Granted, you do still get a reduction to miss, dodge, and parry from that extra weapon skill, but after 305 it looks to me like the value of weapon skill goes down pretty dramatically.
---
Looks just like the path to the portal in Hellfire Peninsula
---
The gnome laugh
---
Item level was added in [3.2 during wratch.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_3.2.0)
---
Or assign lower priority or higher costs to alts
---
Because that's the way it is. Source: am French.
---
5 mans aren’t group pve, got it
---
Faction balance is indeed a problem but I’ll have to respectfully disagree on the friendly fire bit. The game would be pretty miserable if you could get curbstomped by literally any mythic geared player who was having a bad day.
---
MOVE UP THE RELEASE DATE
---
....do you think layering and leeway are the same thing..?
---
This just reminded me I still have a Pristine Hide of the Beast on retail haha.
---
Someone is likely to make an addon that will do just this.  It wouldn't be difficult.
---
I don't, but if that's your take from what I wrote then be my guest
---
Blizzard subscribed to the belief that they had to tune the came to the most braindead/anti social/casual player possible.  
---
It was never about creeping changes, it was about them not having a vision and being willing to sellout the integrity of the game for quick bucks
---
Conflating every QoL change under the same umbrella is to invite the same kind of braindead thinking that lead us to BFA
---
What is wrong with gold selling/buying?
---
you realize ofcourse that while it did stipulate the language on the server selection in classic there was nothing prevention anyone from creating their character there, even if they spoke French or any other language.
---
&gt; nGrinding 5 mans is ok too, but sadly leveling 30-43 will suck, SM is 30+ minutes of travel from Ironforge so finding a group and getting there will take all of your efficiency away.
---
I remember that lvl bracket. At that point I was just sitting at SM all day looking for group right at the spot (while being a dead ghost killed by the horde).
---
Honestly since pally was my 1st char I didn't really understand how bad lvling was for me.... until I rolled a mage. Lvling pally requires a little less dedication then lvling warr, but still, any caster except priest is much much easier.
---
Lots of those video guides only apply to private server.
---
Diremaul east: Lasher farm is going to be a lot more annoying to do, since you cant do the /camp reset on real classic servers, you would have to invite someone, then leave the party and get teleported to the nearest graveyard, the nearest graveyard in diremaul is way outside the instance.
---
BRD Mage farm: In brd they might've fixed the "bug" that wardens dont use hooked nets, if they fixed that, the farm is donezo.
---
Diremaul north: If they fixed the bug to make the last boss charge you, then this farm is also useless when you play solo, you would have to duo.
---
diremaul east jump runs also dont work if they fix the scripting, you would have to clear all the flowers before pulling.
---
Caution for those thinking pets/cosmetics will be expensive.  Without a toy-box, the novelty items weren't that huge.
---
That's important to me but I'd rather they work on mechanical issues rather than visual stuff like that, at least for now
---
Fascinating! Where does the 6% hit number come from? You get 5% from talents, so you should only need at most 4% more after that if you ignore weapon skill, right?
---
Whatever works for the guild tbh, there are just lots of workarounds for situations like this so idk how it caused so many problems.
---
Totally agree! Simple macros like Nature's Swift + Healing touch are thing I didn't even mention. I'm very interested to read your guide once you publish it my friend!
---
1000g for $500 at the start, down to $100 in 8 months.
---
It won't be 200,000 per realm.
---
&gt; Let's go with your 1 million EU players number even though it's preposterous.
---
And no, for the first Phase, Blizzard isn't looking to have the peak online numbers be 2-3k. They want all the poeple they can get on a realm, which is why Germany isn't getting it's own realm (20% of the playerbase not getting 1 realm means 100% of the playerbase not getting more than 5 realms).
---
So yes, if by some miracle 1 million EU players login, it could be 200,000 on one realm. That's less than 60 Layers. And when 90% of people quit before Phase 2, that realm will have a stable 20,000 population.
---
More likely is about 500,000 EU players, 100,000 per realm, and a stable 10,000 population in each realm after Phase 1.
---
Blizzard can always make more realms after launch if it turns out they were wrong. But they won't be making extra realms "just in case". That would be a huge mistake.
---
Where’s there’s a market there will be sellers.
---
What was "suggest invite"?
---
ya it might have been super early 2006.... i know i geared out quick though because i have a dated screenshot in march 2006 with almost full t1-t2
---
It’s how it was in vanilla. The previous wasn’t a “fix”.
---
Is this supposed to be french?
---
Fair enough, good point.
---
Never say there is no other option...for anything ever. There's always another option. For this issue, they knock it down to one layer and that server starts to see login queues. Maybe if it's really bad open free transfers as well. 
---
There are always options. Hell, 6 months from now some dev could have a great idea, code it, and they patch it in to deal with it in some way no one has currently thought of. Who know!

The same amount you have, which is why I’m wondering how you seemingly know so much about it and how awful it’s going to be!

Wait they fixed rogues stealth? Is it the old one now?

I need a Thunder Bluff one
---
You're probably right. French has a bunch of unnecessary stuff like that in it. I didn't want to ask if they need a baguette tho.
---
You /could/ persist that data through restart, it just has to be cached and reloaded somewhere. But there isnt a real reason to, especially because restarts are intended to reset stuff.

it's likely in anticipation of a stress test.

---
Why not? They are better for other things. This game isn't build around raiding.
---
Makes sense. I'd just layer the starting zones and first leveling zones. Also make sure layers themselves are quite packed to slow the number of people that make it out into the unlayered zones. 
---
It needs to be more of a zone by zone, or area of zone basis. Making it across the continent is weird because imagine if you're on a layer that has 500 people all leveling in the starting zones, but only 3 of those people are in the capital city. That makes the capital city feel empty, which is crazy. 
---
Continent wide layering definitely should be rethought.
---
Second and third from the last are listed as the zone Quel'Thalas in the game, north of the Plaguelands. Years ago, I used some Elixirs of Water Walking and made the same trek that you did. It's really isolated there.

If you’re planning on running human rogue, may as well go expertise talent for the +5 skill and then you never have to worry about it, imo
---
Europe is equal to NA in terms of numbers of players. I think I saw a figure saying NA was only marginally larger
---
&gt; top guilds that don't have time to farm.
---
Those 2 things contradict each other, if you're in a top guild, you will be farming a lot between raids without a doubt.
---
If you're Melee and you want to make gold.
---
Grind Whelps. MANY WHELPS!
---
hit cap is 9% from blizz, weap skill reduces miss and 208 will give equiv of 3% hit. so human with 308 will only need 6% hit from other sources (you can get 5 from talents obviously)
---
Go back to BFA then

---
Eh it's low enough that it's not going to really be that big of an issue.
---
As itzpiiz implies, the only way to level in the opposing factions zones is by grinding MOBs for XP since there are (almost) no quests for you there.  For example there are no Alliance quests in Tirisfal Glades or Silverpine Forest (ignoring SFK) and only a couple in Hillsbrad.
---
At about level 30 you'll get to zones with a mix of quest givers like Arathi and Stranglethorn.

---
Honestly, it's completely awful. You have 0 survivability talents in the holy tree and you'll do ridiculously low damage, so your kill speed will be slow and because of that, you'll take more damage per mob kill. 
---
You can at least heal to full for free every 2 minutes with divine favor, but mana isn't an issue as ret either unless you're spamming judgement on cooldown.
---
You do get concecration, but it's so expensive that even if you had a full suit of intellect gear you wouldn't be able to cast it more than 4-5 times before going OOM. Holy shock is another offensive spell you get as holy but it doesn't do good damage unless you use it with divine favor, and then you won't be able to heal yourself for free
---
As for healing dungeons, having divine favor is very nice, I'll confess. But other than that (and the divine intellect + healing light talents) you don't get anything very useful from being in holy spec. Illumination is extremely powerful at level 60, but when leveling you won't have enough crit to make it matter.
---
I understand wanting to level as the spec you'll be playing end game, but the playstyle of healing dungeons at ret and holy is so alike that you won't miss out on any healing experience at all. 
---
As for the paladin in DM going OOM quickly: paladin healing doesn't get good until level 20 because that's when you get flash of light. It gets really good at 40-something when you get blessing of light.
---
They were still worth a lot of gold.

I sold a few Whelplings back in Vanilla and made some serious coin doing so.
---
I love how you think you're better than most members of this sub. Next
---
Because 1 polygon armor would look so good on 1 million polygon models right? /s
---
100%
---
If I was choosing a game based on animations alone, I would.
---
I know they’re kind of a joke spec but what about Enh?
---
In Spain English language skills are not common at all. It's very rare that someone can speak English comfortably enough to play without issue. I'm talking like maybe 5% of people under 35 could play in English without big issues
---
This has to be a troll
---
Gonna take a lot longer to farm the 50g than an hour and even longer to switch back.
---
My rogue is exalted with the OG Zandalar and we had to gain their favour with a new rep all over again.
---
Would be immersive as FUCK if we were able to use the classic rep to quickly earn Pathfinder.
---
nothing to see here
---
Not true. At least on RP realms.
---
Spell batching and server lag are not the same thing. Your server could be capable of processing 1million spells a second, and batching would still result in the same "lag" for spell execution. Also looting doesnt have to go through the spell batching system (and honestly why tf would it)
---
Bottom line:  Save and mail all "white" items to a bank alt.  Wait till initial leveling curve settles and sell the materials later in the end game.  
---
From there you either farm or work the AH.  Just like always.

Considering you managed to get about 159 downvotes in three comments, you are probably the one thats wrong
---
Is it 3% reduced miss chance, or does that 3% hit come from -1% miss, -1% dodge, -1% parry?
---
Again man, it’s all about the effort you wanna out in. If you don’t wanna put in all that effort that’s cool! I’m just saying if you put in the effort results will show :)

---
There are only something like two earth elementals in STM. Not really worth standing there to farm them. There are some fire elementals but still not enough to justify being there over other locations.
---
No that was just to show the level of an item when you moved your mouse cursor over something in your inventory.
---
GearScore was the mod that aggregated all of that information.
---
Get a stack of restoration potions, they dispel magic/curse/poison every 5s for 45s!
---
It's just easier to shout as we've all seen, it's some interesting tech though I'm glad it's in with what it could accomplish.
---
But he didn't post it as his own
---
Where is the original post or whatever that had the high res digital that the guy posted? Anyone know?
---
I've leveled as pritty much every posible paladin spec, the spec will not chage your kill time or down time alot, so if chage it depending on your likings, the most important think is to hunt for rare weapons, and then chage your gameplay around that weapon..  What i like the most while leveling is finding slow weapons, use SoC and stack as much agi/crit as posible.  Good hunt
---
People are getting ahead of themselves and a bit too emotional, sure. But I'd rather that, than a dismissive "it's still beta" attitude tbh.
---
I love retail, not a retail basher. But as someone whose played most expansion betas pretty significantly it was clear bfa wasnt ready for release. From a polish, content, and balancing standpoint. Yet that whole beta was riddled with the same dismissive "its beta" attitude.
---
So stay on top of it, we deserve better.
---
Yeah, it reads like how your average GamerGater views the gaming industry. Falling apart because of diversity initiatives and that being the main reason games suck nowadays etc,. 
---
Not saying it isn't or couldn't be true, but I don't buy it. "We don't allow negativity in the dojo" come on dude. lmao
---
No you don't, but if tanks got pissed off I can only infer that some tanks didn't have that shield.
---
And I would give it to them before giving it out to paladins.
---
I'd love to see Orgrimmar like that.
---
We currently are! We have a link to our discord on the classic wow guilds discord. Look for &lt;Participation Totems&gt;
---
I'll be farming fire and earth there simultaneously. What other lv 25 locations are more profitable than that?
---
Can you paste Blizzard's batching code?
---
Why would the listen to BfA players for classic tho? You guys already have a game to play.

I got to rank 10 and never got the rank 11 mount. Drives me up a wall thinking about it.
---
\[NA\]\[Either Faction\]\[PvP preferred but PvE/RP is ok for the right people\]
---
I'm looking for a guild that fits my weird work schedule. I'm on a 2 week rotation and work nights (EST). Available times(3 pm that day to 7 am the next morning)
---
Week 1(launch week): Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (3pm-7am)
---
Week 2: Monday, Tuesday, Saturday (3pm-7am)
---
Basically if I work on a certain day one week, I won't the next, and it repeats on a 2 week rotation.  Optimal fit would be a guild that raids every 2 weeks around the reset (say every other M/T evening), or one with a rotating raid schedule (say W-F one week,  Sa/Sun the next).
---
Leaning toward Horde but I realize my pickings may be limited so I'll do whatever.
---
Class preferences: \[A\] 1. Druid \[feral tank/resto\], 2. Warrior \[Fury/Prot\] 3 Paladin \[Holy unless you need Nightfall swinger\]
---
\[H\] 1. Shaman \[Resto unless you need Nightfall\] 2. Warrior \[Fury/Prot\] 3. Druid \[feral tank/resto\]
---
Willing to do blacksmithing for Nightfall/other recipes
---
Plan to heavily pvp on off nights. I like PvE but the main thing is to get gear for pvp.
---
I have experience with retail vanilla up to C'thun but it's been awhile. MC/BWL on pservers.
---
Thanks for any consideration. I may try and round up people with similar schedules and form a guild. Let me know if you are in a similar circumstance. Can't wait for Classic, just hope I'm not limited to pvp grind and pug raids.
---
I was honestly asking though... Did they fix that or no?
---
&gt;It was originally zero sum, but some people barely showed up for progression, so we had to change things.
---
just switch to EP/GP and reward progression evenings more than farm evenings.  
---
So people will attend progression to get EP, and farm to get gear.
---
"IT'S DISRESPECTFUL THEY HAVE CRUNCH TIMES!"
---
"OMFG WHY'S THIS MOT FIXED YET"
---
I played till mid  Cata, and all of the QOL changes were actually welcomed by a vast majority of the community. We have demanded those changes not knowing it will ruin the game. 
---
I remember Dungeon finder and thought it was the best thing ever, Same for LFR, Dailies, Badges. Blizz simply did what the customer asked for and slowly it eroded the game experience.
---
Nobody "sold out". It was impossible to predict the long term effects of changes. Now it is obvious, but 10 years ago it was a good decision. So yes BFA you see now is because of small insignificant changes spanning over a 15 year period.
---
Poggers in the chattuuuhh and suck blizzards cock for doing the bare minimum
---
spell-batching is absolutely nothing like it was in vanilla.
---
That's why female orc is master race.
---
Depends on the zones you pick to level in.
---
I generally have to spend some extra time(2 or 3 hours) in silverpine to get 100+ on the herbs horde side. After that it's usually not much of a problem due to the zones I like to level in having plenty of herbs.  So you usually have to pause and farm a zone for a bit with herbalism at some levels.
---
Fair enough. I just remember it for pugs in Uld
---
Yes, you get extra gold (was added in patch 1.10). If you take this route, you should quest to 50-52 (because grey quests at 60 wouldn't be much extra gold). Then grind or do instances.
---
&gt;Oh, my guild used to force it upon people if it was a known upgrade.
---
I hated that shit.
---
They tried to force non upgrades on me based on a misunderstanding about how my class worked. Luckily I was CL back then so I had the authority to tell them to GTFO.
---
Leveling without quests will be a disgusting slog with a long /played.
---
If you have support and/or a valid method for level grinding this might make some decent coin.
---
Dosen't seem like it'd be better than the same amount of time spent being directed to normal gold farming.
---
They could at least limit it to 1-20 areas. Such as Elwynn Forest and Westfall. Most of these tourists won’t even make it out of those first 1-10 zones before they get fed up with dying by quest mobs
---
What the fuck is with all this talk of class-leaders having affairs, getting it on with other class-leaders, exchanging nudes, etc. 
---
I was class leader/officer (granted, not in Vanilla) and never got this ... "treatment". The worst we had was other officers getting way too drunk and spilling a little too much personal information in voice comms.
---
There's a difference between being difficult and being complicated. Vanilla wow was simple, but difficult. Dark Souls is simple, but difficult. Playing a feral druid in Legion was complicated, but easy.
---
I think things would’ve been fine if arenas and esports never came into the picture, because those are what pushed Blizz to bend over backwards.
---
Can also make heavy use of the mailbox as buffer storage.
---
I imagine it's not an intentional design decision, but rather a byproduct of how the underlying systems work.
---
Maybe changing continents has more to it than simply being in a different place, such that layering can take advantage of what's already there.
---
Either way, the idea that people are working themselves into a lather about how layering for a few weeks will somehow destroy the long-term viability of Classic is a bit much. You're not going to create your raiding guild based on the people in your zone killing mottled boars for a few hours at launch.
---
Hunters and locks can also drain
---
it is reduced 3% miss but thats the same way hit works  
---
i forget the exact maths, but i memorized what i'd need  
---
as human with 308weap you need 6% hit (from talents+gear)
---
Hahah I feel your pain, had similar stuff going on, tho not as dramatic lol
---
No dude, the amount of money and time blizzard would need to go through the source and fix libraries missing/no longer available, fix exploits from previous code/libraries and experience, create a new server architecture and process to handle the old style or create a new one (significantly more time) and all the bugs/exploits that comes with that etc. etc
---
That all on top of the guys needing to learn the old code and get familiar with how things used to be done and what was used in the past. 
---
It would have been significantly more work than porting old content and mechanics to the new client they wouldn't have even thought about it. 
---
Setting up one or two servers is easy but having it on an enterprise level is very difficult.
---
Tbh suggest invite wasn't that bad, didn't really expect that it would be removed.
---
stat weights are... eh. they dont really work in vanilla, you kinda just learn over time what is good and what isnt, it works in retail because of the massive amount of loot that is all over the place but against a warlock maybe you need this stat, against a warrior maybe you want more stamina, its all really situational
---
Slightly lowering the mana cost of some spells for boomkins and elem shaman would go a long way to make them go from low-tier raid specs to somewhat viable. That wouldn't break the game or change the 'meta' that much, it would give these 2 classes other spec choices for raiding. Having 6 shaman in a raid with ALL of them being resto is a bit silly, same with Holy pally.
---
Theres two different weapon skill formulas that are used. If youre weapon skill is 304 or lower while fighting a boss then the hit cap is 9%. If your weapon skill is 305 or higher then a different weapon skill formula is calculated and the hit cap is only 6%
---
I agree partially.  DKP is a better system, but I think a LITTLE loot council needs to be involved.  I think people should definitely be able to hoard points for what they want.  That's what I did and why I was the ONLY paladin in my guild to manage a full set of tier 2.  I would pass up on tier 1 because that wasn't what I wanted.  However, if you've got a Hunter trying to spend his DKP on Thunderfury, that isn't good for the player or the guild and if the guild's leaders are halfway decent, they won't let the hunter get Thunderfury unless ALL the other players that it would be beneficial to don't need it or want it.  Loot Council requires a lot of trust and while it usually works out, I agree that DKP is better overall because it allows the player some choice in the items they are getting.

EXP to money conversion was introduced in path 1.10 so yes, it will be in classic.
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Money](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Money)
---
Claims the ratio is 1point of exp = 6 coppers. I can't be arsed to look up experience awards from quests and looking times it takes to complete quests, but it should give you some idea to do those calculations and determine whether you think it's worth it.
---
This was one of the first things I noticed when I switched from a Wrath server to live servers back during MoP. Something on Blizzard's end adds like a 100+ms delay that you don't see on private servers. It doesn't show up in your ping either, which kind of makes me think it's software issue. Could also just be all the extra layers of security Blizzard has slowing down your packet traffic. Someone who does this kind of stuff for a living could probably give you a better answer than me.

Hey there,
---
To preface - I already checked www.vanillafriends.com and made an entry, but I could not find anyone from my guild or who I remember.

**Who I am**: Bruderschaft (human male mage). With Ðenial's help, I was the only person on the realm to ring the gong and be awarded the Black Qiraji Battle Tank and Scarab Lord title. Our guild also had the server on farm from inception until we broke up.
---
**Who I remember**: 
---
* **Meese** (GM and MT, human male warrior)
---
* **Kurbstomper** (Rank 14, male NE warrior) 
---
* **Swayy** (Rank 13, male NE warrior. Also high ranking in arenas TBC and on)
---
* Riley (female NE druid) 
---
* Luffy (male troll warrior) 
---
* Eevee (female Undead priest)
---
We had cross-faction friendships with many people in guilds &lt;Liquid Reality&gt;, &lt;You Must Be Critting Me&gt;, and &lt;Cheat to Win&gt;. I wish I could remember more.  
---
**Plans for Classic**: Rolling Horde with 2-3 close friends and playing on launch.
---
If anyone reading this knows anyone from Demon Soul vanilla, please post here or PM me whatever information you have. Thank you.
---
80% of Barrens experience is the Chat..... and since you are alliance you will not be able to see it. Barrens is called that for a reason, it is bare. Chat is the only thing that keeps you awake while you run across probably the larges zone in Classic.
---
Its not like theyll see new animations and models in their own client. In wod you had option to toggle and you only saw what you chose to see. People going nazi over animations sound retarded to me. Those assets are already made and the game is being built on a new client, all that is needed is a simple toggle option.
---
^^^Please ^^^dont ^^^shit ^^^the ^^^bed ^^^ guys.
---
To be fair, mage fantasy in WC3 was water elemental being a very massive part of way mage was so powerful. So I get that being where the idea came from. But I do agree the actual play in an mmo with a pet as a frost mage was not really something I was excited about.
---
&gt; So where do you draw the line? How iconic does something have to be to ignored. Or if you want to turn the tables, how "menial" does a bug have to be before it can be fixed?
---
You don't really need to draw a line because it's a game and it can be completely arbitrary. Blood plague would be fun to relive, but the examples of moments that you gave would not not be.
---
You just wanna pvp, don't you
---
I think the sad reality is the people who first created WoW and have been involved from the beginning are mostly gone. 
---
So the new people they've brought in, even over the last 4 years, have no vision of "what could have been" and instead want a chance to push their own, new ideas. And rightly so, they're professionals.
---
This results in the new people probably being extremely frustrated because working at Blizzard is no longer this sacred rite of passage. The game now is appease Bobby "Record Revenue and Record Layoffs" Kotick. 
---
For the record: Activision / Bobby Kotick are the real fuckin problem here.
---
Copperfield could take Dranlo, no problem.
---
Apparently it should according to vanilla vids.
---
Oh, that's a fair point.
---
I don't know if you've noticed, but patches existed in vanilla. It wasn't always 1.12.
---
It lessens communication 
---
Im glad its gone
---
Are you insulting my culture?! I'm outraged!
---
was this affecting UD female too? and if yes, was it fixed?
---
Is that warrior flasked for UBRS?

I'm not sure what "suggest invite" is. I suspect you can right click and "suggest invite" and the party leader will get a prompt or something to invite or decline said person?
---
Hey can somebody invite my tank friend his name is Xxbòrömîrxx.
---
This can be solved with "suggest invite" if it's what I think it is. It also attempts to fix something that isn't broken. "Hey pass lead so I can invite my friend". If it isn't broken, don't fix it.
---
People are used to the way RETAIL blizzard handles bugs. In retail bugs and problems get reported and the retail blizzard crew goes "oh ok we hear you but dont agree" and then they leave the bug fix until the next expansion or u tilt subscribers start quitting over it. It's a bad way to run a game and I'm just glad the classic crew doesn't have the same slack ass bullshit mentality as the retail development team.
---
My point was that Rogue utility doesn't universally apply to all group content.
---
Sap, blind, stuns, armor reduction (you wouldn't use Expose Armor in a 5 man anyway because it prevents Sunder stacking), and would poison wouldn't be used in raids.
---
Unlike FPS spell batching greatly effects gameplay and provides for an authentic feel and actually balances out connectivity and computing performance of placers.
---
They are doing a damn fine job with fixing bugs. Classic is happening, they listened. They Still listen. 
---

For drama queens the sky is always falling.  This isn’t a glass is half empty / full kind of a thing, it’s a this glass is missing two drops and I demand to be given an explanation as to why.
---
The real cost of a flood of game change suggestions / complaints is that some times it leads to change.
---
That’s what happened to WoW.
---
Leveling in the original was challenging on purpose.  It rewarded players for working together.  Then players complained that they couldn’t solo all of the non dungeon quests, so now modern WoW avoids challenging content in the world as to not offend the solo player.
---
Almost every class complained that they felt inferior to class X because that class has ability Y or doesn’t have to worry about mechanic Z.
---
Ya, it was that way on purpose for a reason.
---
Take the Druid as an example, they got the most flexible class, the best buff in the game and the most important Rez spell but Druids were never happy because
---
1. bear form wasn’t as good for tanking as a warrior  
---
2. Feral wasn’t as strong as a rogue
---
3. Healing wasn’t as strong as a priest 
---
4. Their res wasn’t a real res which made 5 mans more difficult.
---
Hunters ands warlocks didn’t like their lack of bag space compared to other classes.
---
People didn’t like being mind control by priests (priests were given the ultimate debuff on purpose.)
---
I can go on and on, but you all get my point the complainers got everything they wanted and we got modern WoW as a result.
---
As far as classes go modern WoW only has four classes (tank, melee DPS, ranges DPS and healing.)
---
This is why we can’t have nice things.
---
With Classic WoW the complaints are now about very subtle differences compared to the original.  
---
Many of the reports are valid, but the problem is most posts don’t frame them as simple bug reports for a beta test.  no, it’s always the sky is falling and it’s the worst thing ever.
---
They're going to be past versions of my retail characters. My Death Knight will be a Druid, my hunter will be a punchy rogue, my shadow priest will be a not shadow priest..

Oh trust me, people on this sub will find something to complain about, thats for sure.
---
All the assets are already made, all that is needed is a one sided toggle. If you wanna see your toons as a handful of pixels smeared on a skeleton you can do that but give me my chad orcs.
---
Yea must have been a different layer then because ours was all horde
---
There's no DR on stamina for pvp, the more you have the better.
---
The minute we believe that we can rest on our laurels is the minute the universe proves us wrong. 
---
I don't encourage you to be negative or doomsay, but also don't jerk-off Blizzard because they've been fixing bugs in a game that came out more than 15 years, a game they were sure none of us actually wanted and initially refused to re-release.
---
"Yay! They're doing the bare minimum!" Isn't a great rallying cry.
---
There's a shit ton to fix. Hunters still have loads of bugs
---
Luvstospuge. Going 13 years strong.
---
Is this actually the real Blizzard? It's too good to be true.  Normally they just ignore the community.
---
Then context should have sorted out what "additions" referred to for you. It should not have been challenging, even without scrolling up.
---
What do you think "batching" means?
---
Depends on the server you choose. If you play on a PvP server, good luck to you. You'll be fighting more than grinding out.
---
It's against TOS for one - so it gives you an unfair advantage against people who don't want to break TOS. 
---
For two, gold sellers very often hack accounts to get the gold in the first place. At least that was the case in Vanilla.
---
It warps the in-game economy as it causes inflation due to all the gold farmers who ONLY farm gold and don't do anything else with the game. There are gold syncs in the game to prevent the inflation, but gold farmers don't interact with those. 
---
It cheapens the experience for everyone if you know you can just P2W.
---
&gt;Certain classes were banned from bidding on items, like a dft on a hunter.
---
sure, why should hunters bid on their absolute BiS trinket...
---
On Lightninghoof, there was an undead rogue named Obesity. He was always ganking in Ironforge. No idea what happened to him. I don't remember seeing him in TBC.
---
You're free to play as you want, but IMO the beauty of the Barrens is that this is all the orcs and trolls have to work with. Plus the zone ties Mulgore and Durotar together. It just doesn't mean as much to the Alliance. They have their own issues to deal with. If you run a MOB grinding route there then it's just a big space.
---
Right, but once the info was shown in game is when people became jerks about it.
---
These days, my mumble starts up instantly but discord takes about 10 seconds on a SSD. I regularly have to wait on discord.
---
Not quite 12 years yet. Wrath came out in November of 08.
---
I am not sure as I am rerolling to warrior from being a 14 year paladin main. Would feel wrong naming my warrior my paladins name. So probably come up with something new. I may go with my RL name this time round so my discord name matches.
---
Going with the same name as I use on here. its an old D&amp;D name I use for everything
---
The Blizzard of the past was really big on creating top quality, centric experiences that played right to the most committed and die hard players. 
---
The Blizzard of today is really big on making MVP's (minumum viable products) that cater to the widest audience possible. 
---
You may ask yourself, "What happened?"...
---
It's pretty simple: Activision.
---
Between a few days of no bugfixes and no new invited yes, people were rightfully worried.
---
Always enjoyed whispering back, free Tibet!.  For some reason they’d get upset and stop talking..😊
---
And wow is and will always be THE most successful mmo ever. With factions.
---
&gt;ummm what server, sounds familiar
---
The remaining 40 hunter bugs

---
Paladins are pretty good at soloing, as in they can successfully complete orange quests without much trouble.
---
But all paladin specs are SLOOOOOOOW. Ret is not all that much faster than holy unless you have good gear. It's a lot of auto-attacking and waiting. I had more fun doing group quests and running instances, even if that's not the optimal strategy for quick exp.
---
Paladin healers are fine until 40, and great after 40 (when you get blessing of light). For healing instances, you'll want to grab as much +heal as you can find. The majority of that is going to be on cloth and leather pieces. Even a small amount of +heal means that Flash of Light can be your primary heal, and then going oom isn't an issue so much. Try to avoid Holy Light because it's not very efficient.
---
Here's the issue. Many a time, gamers have been told to "chill the fuck out, they'll fix it by release"
---
and many a time, that hasn't come true. 
---
You can't really blame people for having doubts when they've been fucked anally time and time again
---
I dont want QoL, I want a simple toggle that will let me use new assets that won't affect any players who want to see shit smeared pixels. Its exactly like changing particle settings in your game, only your pc is effected. I dont get why you nazis wanna police what the fuck I wanna see when blizzard already went through all the trouble of upgrading almost every asset and Classic is running on a similar client where it just needs a simple toggle.
---
Was this on the Warsong server?
---
Ok, but still it isn't the end-all, be-all.  An item that is 18 Stamina isn't going to be better than 17 Stamina, 6 Strength.  So how much would you sacrifice for 1 Stamina?
---
I never had nudes sent to me....what was I doing wrong?
---
I kind of hope they do, most of my playing time is done first thing in morning (UK) so that should time well for me waking up to raids for the aussies (just don’t mention the cricket to me)
---
It will be ugly. Barrens is heavily populated, meaning there will be plenty of people to report on you, your current location, and direction of travel, and it is a place for people to catch up on herbing, meaning there are a ton of people sweeping around the edges of the zone. Also, it has a ton of quests that give people a lot of flexibility on where they are done, so basically ever mob on the map is a quest mob. 
---
Personally, I would try to go to wailing caverns and stay there. Wailing caverns has a bunch of very good, non overlapping loot with deadmines. If you run deadmines, and are super geared, it can be great to hit wailing caverns on your way to ashenvale, as it's not that far from the flight point to walk down, and at that level, a 5 man group based in ashenvale is not going to be easily messed with by randos looking for herbs. 
---
It's a good place on a fresh server for everyone to get a 10 slot bag, and it has cobrahn's grasp, which is kinda the only blue mail belt you can get for a while, as alliance or horde.
---
Good job asshole you ruined vanilla for him
---
I know its not classic but god I wish they would add transmog to the game. Make it only show to your faction, idc. 
---
Otherwise I'll just have to make a macro button to put on my social outfit in town...
---
Thanks! That's already a lot to go on, I'll look up the rest myself :)
---
&gt; the edgelords on r/livestreamfail
---
That sub is an sjw hell hole. Not sure why you think they're edgelords over there

Damn I really want an animated Wallpaper Engine version

I've played 5 different pserver launches.
---
&gt; There was a time she took away my keyboard and I just opened the internet and used the mouse to copy and paste one letter at a time to log in to my guild website and post on the forums. I was worse than a crack addict.
---
Dedication. Did she get mad at you because it was affecting your grades, or would she rather you be out on the streets playing with teenagers your age, possibly getting mixed into the wrong crowds and end up in juvie?
---
It would be kinda cool after naxx patch or something
---
Cant you fucking read? All I want is a simple toggle which they had during WoD. I choose to see high res good game, you choose to see shit smeared pixel look and it doesn't effect anyone else.
---
Don’t do this. One there are almost no quests in the zone for Alliance. And two if you are on a PvP server you will just get camped all day. I’d rather do the boar challenge then try and level in Barrens as Alliance.
---
That's just for yellows
---
I have had prokbutt sense 2004/2005. He has been a pally sense day I made. Sadly I will have a paladin name porkbutt but he will be my alt sense I doubt I'll have a guild like I did back then and will let me raid ret. So I am making a warrior tank
---
&gt; even though people should know better by now
---
What do you mean even though they should know better? Them having their doubts that all the bugs will be fixed by release literally IS them knowing better, as like you've said it's become the norm in this industry to release a final product in it's beta form
---
And they won't be this glitchy *once the game releases*, you do realize it's still a beta even after todays update, right? You're comparing a released game to a game that is in beta.
---
Trolls definitely have the weakest of all the racials.... at least the +frost resistance counts for something for Dwarves in Naxx.  
---
However, this is part of what made Vanilla good. Not every ability, racials, talent, etc. has to be "useful" or good. Trying to change stuff in this manner is what lead to retail, which people (at least in this subreddit) tend not to like.
---
You sound like a /v/irgin.

I've watched a lot of videos on Layering. And we have to agree to disagree in this case. I think Layering is good compared to the alternatives.
---
Almost every raiding shaman uses a shield.  Nobody raided as enhancement.
---
Back in the day on Dragonmaw I was in a mostly Night Elf guild that protected Astranaar. Everyone had their hearth set there and we had Horde constantly attacking it. We also raided crossroads constantly. Shout out to &lt;The Blood of Heroes&gt; or &lt;TBOH&gt; as the guild name changed over time.
---
Nah. One is literal theft. The other is leaving the guild after a legit drop.
---
It's up to you if you believe me or not. I just stated how it was on the serer I played on.
---
Great answer.
---
If this was set in Silverpine:
---
Mageblood uses Son of Arugal.
---
You're super fucked.
---
Will DM East still be one of the better spots even without /camp though?
---
BigCritties - perfect Pally name.
---
Modern culture mandates that everyone freak the fuck out about everything that isn't exactly the way they want it to be. This is no different. I agree 100% with this post. As long as they fix any bugs that might negatively effect the economy I'm good, and they will, because the WoW client is honestly a masterpiece of programming architecture, its not like some games where it takes months to figure out the source of a logic error.
---
Thanks for the feedback!  The cost coloring is in line to be added, and I'll be sure to change up the rank colors to make them more readable.
---
Hahaha nice try, obv fake though. Impossible to do a dungeon with rets in raids lulul
---
Enhancement was a 2h spec, so you used slow 2hers and only swapped shields when a rogue was around to help live through the opener.  Nobody raided as enhancement, the threat windfury and stormstrike created was not manageable and the boss would turn on you within 5 seconds of attacking him.
---
&gt;The best system in the game is already implemented. Need before greed.
---
Master looter is implemented in the game as well.
---
hell, why not go FFA?
---
As someone who primarily played pally in Vanilla, leveling as a Paladin is pretty awful no matter what your spec is, but they are VERY fun to play at level 60.
---
Lmao I can't upvote this enough.
---
Most Shammys I played with raided with staffs due to mostly being resto specced. I definitely did she shamans rolling around with shields, but it was less likely than paladins.
---
Sorry :(
---
I really want to duo level Warlock + Pally for the AoE Farm that comes online at lvl 20. 
---
I grouped up with a Pally around lvl 52 to do this in Felwood and it was absolutely AWESOME!
---
The girls that started doublemint gum were in my sisters sorority, the arrows were a sorrority logo
---
Retail is gonna get it's ass whooped just like every other MMO that had to compete with WoW in 2006-2009
---
i mean you don't need it, but since you're respecing for it anyway it helps more than other talents.
---
&gt;or endlessly crying and moaning about how awful everything is.
---
The game is just as unforgiving, un-intuitive and painful as I remember, and I'm excited about it. Accepting the 2-H mace reward in the starting zone as a NE warrior before remembering I had run all the way to IF to train 2h maces was hilarious. Realizing that literally no class can even use that quest reward made me laugh out loud. 
---
They had a great opportunity to fix a pretty clear oversight - as no night elves can even use that reward item - and they left it in instead. I'm so happy about the little things that would never fly in a modern MMO being put back into the game. Inefficient quest rewards? check. Rewards you can't even use? Also check. Brutally difficult starting areas with enemies who run away and cast heals at level 5? Check. Players who never played classic crying about the quality of life? Also check.
---
It's such a bad game by so many standards but I'm so fucking excited to log in and play with my friends. 
---
The only thing I'm going to mis is playing with my brother. RIP Eric. 
---
PSA: Suicide is a bitch. If you're hurting PLEASE talk to someone.
---
I always felt conflicted about that zone in cataclysm. It was a really fun zone, but after you left it, there was no reason to ever come back. It just felt like your typical single player linear game instead of an open world.
---
might do names of old friends from when i first started playing as an homage
---
Have you been ignoring the overly dramatic layering posts the past week or something? They've been unavoidable.
---
I think it was like 1.9 and it was a sale.
---
I kind of agree with that.
---
How's that
---
They explicitly said beta invites would only be to active subs. You may not need to own BfA to get in though.
---
I can't wait to see how people try to run dungeons, not realizing that you usually have to cc multiple mobs every pull to live.
---
&gt;DKP only favors those who attend the raids thats it.Loot council rewards also players who contribute to the guild outside the raid like farming mats for the guild bank etc.
---
You can award DKP for farming mats for the guild bank, you know.
---
Yep, I remember whelplings were a pretty big status symbol. You always popped your pet out in BGs and groups, at least in the initial charge or downtime.
---
God, the nostalgia seeps in through those screenshots. thank you
---
It curves nicely too because when you get to higher levels you get waaaay longer to rest so it never becomes ridiculous.
---
i found one on wallpaper engine, but its of the original, not this one with the colors changed
---
On private servers I’ve tried this method out with a rogue. I grinded humanoids and pickpocketed almost all of them. By level 49, I had my mount and an extra 400g but I was so severely undergeared that I couldn’t sustain past level 50 and stopped.
---
They have to do it, literally a multi billion company, please don't tell me they don't have money/tech for it.

Eh, there are some BiS for awhile from BoE's for example.
---
For Mages, isn't the level 47 BoE ring BiS for three raids?
---
Early vanilla, our guild leader came home to see us wiping on Onyxia at \~5%.  This wouldn't have been a problem, however no one had killed her yet, and he worked for blizzard so he was afraid it would be a PR nightmare if we were the first to do so.  So he essentially made us leave her alone and go work on Molten Core, we weren't allowed to go back to Onyxia untill someone else had killed her.  Had a pretty drastic effect on turning a world class uberguild into a friends and family casual type pretty much overnight (why put in all the effort if you aren't going to be allowed to win?!).
---
something like this happened in my guild wars 2 guild.  Our guild leader had a really cute but super chunky gf, and he was a dweeb but a cool ass guy.  We were (still are) all facebook friends and apparently my good friend irl was talking to the guild leaders GF in whispers all the time about non game related stuff.
---
one day he somehow convinced her how amazing she would look with a different hair color, and then if she lost weight etc etc.  I didnt know about most of this until...
---
... one day I get a knock on my door and theres my buddy with this beautiful in shape girl.  its her, she lost all this weight and bought a plane ticket to see him.  Hes still currently with her and our current guild leader is battling depression and has no idea shes with my friend
---
classes. pvp. and all that ;)
---
This is sad.
---
But how is everyone supposed to get their rocks off without a circle jerk?
---
This is really situational.  As a priest it’s going to have a lot of value for you because often you will be the focus target.  Something people tend to forget as well is that classic isn’t a gear piñata.  You can’t always just pick and choose every option.  Generally speaking a piece of gear with more stam and int will be worth more than some plus healing because you will need that health and mana more in PvP vs pve.  
---
You really can’t put a number on it.  But if you feel squishy, and are getting blown up then chances are you need to work on getting more stamina.
---
Not practically or efficiently. 
---
There’s no quests and you’ll be ganked regularly.
---
The audio quality is good but I don't like the UI.
---
Why was Suggest Invite removed? What reason was there to do that?
---
Item level of gear was available to the game client long before patch 3.2. I remember being able to see it during TBC via mods.
---
I will say that actually clipping your own YouTube videos from a Twitch stream is practically a second job and isn't really "throwing away free money" like you're making it out to be.
---
exactly
---
Yeah but that was all part of Ner'zhuls plan. Arthas was playing checkers while LK was playing 4d chess. I'm sure Uther did some brutal shit during the second war.
---
Yup and it was known since it was announced yet this sub defended it
---
There are probably much more efficient ways to make money at 60 than running old quests you skipped while leveling
---
&gt; Skeletons is a HUGE deal.
---
Not really as the different layers will change their importance
---
I understand.  I was just trying to get a feel for the better items to focus on.  As it stands, the different specs on that site don't offer any stat weight to Stamina.  Obviously, Stamina is very useful for PvP so if I don't weight it then I won't see a lot of the good items potentially.
---
If 4/5 roll greed, nothing stops the last person from rolling need and ninjaing away. It's just safer. If someone wants to actually use a rare BoE, they can certainly say so in chat, and even if I was to win a need roll for something I planned on selling, I'm totally fine handing it over to someone who will actually use it, the only condition being that they equip it in front of me.
---
I feel like Guild quests were a thing. Not that they were designed to for the guild strictly, but they basically required guild participation to complete in any sense of efficiency. If modern WoW included guild quests like this to encourage social interaction, I think it would go a LONG way for the state of the game
---
Why would that cause your guild to fail?  It was one of the most exciting times, everyone got a taste of their class power level and for the most part it was all much higher.
---
Not quite as dramatic, but a friend left his wife for a guildy. They are still together and play WoW religiously.
---
Is that lamissa that's on the beta that's been on asmongolds, efands etc... stream?
---
&gt; A friend of mine and I managed to get his credentials and login out of curiosity on this character. 
---
Was it written on a paper, or did he tell you it? or did you just guess because he used something similar from an earlier game that you happened to play with him on?
---
&gt;That's one thing from vanilla that was really common that will be a lot harder to get away with in 2019.
---
Actually, A lot easier due to reasons.
---
That again depends on the person. I can guarantee there's a large amount of people that wouldn't find being killed continuously fun.
---
Right, totally, it was available by mods before then, and overall gearscore was added after, I only meant that in terms of changing behavior of the playerbase, this was the patch where LFG became toxic and I stopped playing, because people were jerks to one another over gear score (specifically, even all the kids who didnt download any addons)
---
I doubt it, leveling to 20 in Modern WoW is like 3 hours of game time. Leveling to 20 in Classic would be like 20 hours.
---
That's like asking will it rain the second weekend of September
---
I'd rather them work on the class bugs than a couple trees in stormwind. Visual bugs can be fixed later
---
I dont think it will go free, if it does it would probably be a few months down the line and very limited.
---
I see.  I misunderstood the actual goal of your question.
---
Xxxlegolasxxx here I come!
---
Haha he let a fat chick make him quit
---
I don't know when they implemented the trail to 20, I think it was BC or Wrath. I dont see why they wouldn't allow that though at some point. Maybe?
---
Absolutely love all of your videos, please make more!! :D
---
I honestly *remember* prevailing sentiment being Trolls were subpar back in the day, too. 
---
Rereading the berserking racial makes complete sense why they aren't, I guess I never just really looked into it very much back then.
---
There might be some reasons it's more common than you'd expect (such as it being easier for people to cheat online), but this thread is also literally about drama, so there's going to be some bias since that's all you're hearing about.
---
Do we know for sure it won't already be that way? Sounds like a great idea to get people to come back.
---
What matters isn't that "some bugs won't be fixed by August 27", but more which bugs don't get fixed, their level of impact, and how long before they do get fixed after release (if ever).
---
You left out way too much info for such a juicy story about a ret pala
---
&gt; What do you mean even though they should know better? Them having their doubts that all the bugs will be fixed by release literally IS them knowing better
---
I mean that, it's been very clear for a while now that Classic WoW beta isn't a glorified demo. They've been constantly fixing bugs that are being reported. They've just done a shit job of communicating their progress in resolving said bugs.
---
We had a guild that encouraged leading your own raids. A few people decided to create a new weekly raid series and they needed numbers to fill out their raids. For most of these numbers they turned to the guild, but they still needed more, so they invited some friends of guild members to tag along.
---
We had one guildy who did not subscribe to the idea of having one "main", so he played through about 4 toons on a regular basis. To be fair, all 4 of those toons were geared pretty closely to most other people's mains in the guild, so taking any of the 4 he wanted to play was never really an issue.
---
If you created a raid series you were allowed to run it however you wanted. Well, this new raid series had a "no alts" rule because they "wanted to raid cutting edge content, and only wanted to gear one toon per person towards that goal."
---
The raid leaders made the guy with 4 alts choose one to run as his "main" with that raid series. Well, the following week he chose a different toon that he wanted to take and the raid leaders would not let him. The guy with 4 alts bowed out gracefully and went to do other things for the night. 
---
This is where the problem begins. They invite a friend of a guildy who brings his alt (he raided with us enough that we knew who his main was). There was about five to six of us, me included, who were livid that members of our guild would turn a guildy away from their raid due to a violation of their raid rules, and then bring a non-guildy who apparently didn't have to abide by those same rules.
---
Now, I get it, our guild was set up in such a way that people could run raids the way they wanted, but everyone also had the choice to join, or not join, any of the raid series they wanted. My choice, and many others, was to not join that series anymore.
---
The people who ran the raid series, along with many others who were like-minded, ended up leaving the guild a week or two after this incident. While our numbers were less than half after the exodus, the ones who remained were happier and there was still plenty of us to raid on a regular basis.
---
well?
---
will it?
---
I think that no matter how small or unimportant a bug is, someone will find one in classic, or claim they have, and cause an uproar. It's happened before, and will happen again.
---
On the other hand, lets say this *doesn't* happen and we're all sitting around bored as can be waiting for launch.
---
Well, nobody said we couldn't discuss how fair/unfair gnome/undead rogues are.
---
^(kek)
---
Stick in there. What do you do?
---
The 'x levels free' system caused a LOT of problems. I hope they don't bring it to classic.
---
Not... really. A lot of white items are not that useful. Crocolisk meat requires a special recipe (that is alliance specific), so vendoring it is probably a good idea, small spider legs are nearly worthless to alliance as you need to do a level ~6 quest in teldrassil to even use them. , small furry paws are not useful till darkmoon faire. Bear meat is not a big seller in my experience as you have to trek to theslamar for the recipe. No one gives a shit about your longjaw mud snapper. Malachite has such a low drop rate that if you aren't a miner, you cannot really devote an inventory slot to a stack, and it's absolutely not worth mailing around one at a time. 
---
That's just it. You don't want to know the "one thing" that makes money. You can farm all the light feathers you want, but if 2 other guys on your server are doing the same, it will be a while sitting on that inventory before you can turn it into cash. 
---
You want a long list of a bunch of stuff of true and enduring value, so you can be a bit diversified. Maybe some guy is trying to get rid of the 40 light feathers he farmed, and it's good to know "oh, spider's silk is actually quite useful" (it is used to craft 2 different blue quality level ~20 items using vendor recipes ).
---
"Chill the fuck out" is not the same as "resting on our laurels".
---
They will likely put those in near the end of content like they did in Vanilla back in 2006.  They made all TBC talents available in Vanilla for about 2 months before TBC released.  They also made it possible to grind out Grand Marshal gear without having the title.  Those were good times.  I remember getting 4k judgement crits on clothies during that time.  It was fun for sure, but I'd appreciate them waiting to put that in the game until they decide what they are doing with Classic after Classic content runs out.
---
pretty sure i could learn enough spanish to do a dungeon or a quest in about 5 minutes on google.  Outside of that, just play with your guild like basically everyone does...
---
Sort of.
---
I've seen this happen multiple times in different guilds. I think it's part desperation, part being someone else in-game (no one in-game sees the stanky basement you live in or knows about the shit you pull IRL), and part sharing the same hobby/passion as someone. /shrug. People do stupid shit on the internet.
---
??? it takes me a few days to hit 20 in modern
---
Don't play the game. Seems easy
---
Okay so leveling in Classic to 20 will take you 6 months.
---
&gt; You did well holding your tongue on that run.
---
What? No. Sorry but I'd like to know if the person I'm dating is sneaking around with other people
---
$15 to try the game for 30 days? Unless you live in a country where it is actually a lot of money it should not be an issue even as a broke college student. You don't need to have the latest expansion to play Classic.
---
You can't really participate in the community if you can't chat with people
---
Yeah, you're right. I have a false memory of this sub freaking out about how you actually *didn't* need a sub to get into beta, and everyone was upset because they resubbed because of Blizzard's "tricky wording" or something like that. My bad.
---
No shaman I knew or saw ever used a staff.  Shaman didn't have any defensive cooldowns, threat dumps, magical shields and wore mail armor - there was no living from a boss hit or raid trash without a shield.
---
You would have to run for 5 minutes every time, you also need to find someone to invite every time you do it, let alone the minute you need to wait to get ported to the graveyard.
---
then the run itself takes about 15 minutes, less with good gear and if you did the conjure water quest to refill faster.
---
So you will most definetly dodge the lockout with this method now, but you'll be a lot slower then say, dire maul north hyena farm with skinning and killing the bugs top right corner, takes about 10 minutes each. (So you have to wait abit before going the 6th time.)
---
Indeed its anination only but still does not feel good... thabks for the info
---
what kinds of problems? its basically a demo to see if you like the game
---
Please.  A 10-yard melee range is ridiculous.
---
The fire rises, brother. We will be great once again.
---
In retail right now you can level 1-120 in 10 hours easily
---
What.. what are you talking about, my products are always bug free! There are some unintended features but... no bugs.. no never...
---
Layerings here to stay baby pogchamp greekyikes
---
Mizhena- When I was born, my parents thought me a boy and raised me as such. In time, we all came to understand I was truly a woman. I created my new name from syllables of different languages. All have special meaning to me; it is the truest reflection of who I am.
---
We get this same type of post after every update. Wish the game was out already.
---
Yep, noticed same.
---
&gt; We did things
---
&gt;she just wanted some exploration time with other dudes.
---
Yes she did. Also it doesn't matter if she didn't cheat. Talking to other guys and hiding the conversation with them is bad enough. Why would she hide the convos if they weren't nefarious?
---
Any idea if you would get faction rep for grey quests?
---
3% from gear to hit the softcap and more whenever you get crit capped. Human is very small increase on combat but bigger later on as you're not taking the 5 weapon skill talent with seal fate builds.
---
Don't worry you were right
---
I'm one of those NO CHANGES guys, but this is something I actually wouldn't mind.  If they kept the talents and mechanics the same, but offered better itemized drops that actually made those specs viable in raids, I'd be ok with that.
---
They dont have anyone in their guild that is on that part of the quest.
---
Realm names please!
---
I wanna coordinate with friends on which one to all play on
---
you can heal anything with any pally build till 10 man, just get that int/+healing gear and you done.  
---
Any pally build with SoR is good if you got some dragonbreath chili or shadow oil, because your white hits have a chance to proc and your SoR hits have a chance to proc, in the case of command only JoCom can proc stuff, SoCom cannot proc.
---
He wasn't dating her in TBC, it was finished by this point and by then it was pretty obvious that she likely wasn't the nicest of women and he dodged a bullet, he let him know it was her through some choice words but didn't say too much. What did he have to gain by going off on one in the middle of a dungeon run a long time after they finished?
---
Rogue can do that with spell batching
---
Stat weights don't really matter much in vanilla, because you don't have an abundance of choice for stats. The biggest factor in selecting gear is going to be limiting your hit gear to 3%. Lvl 19 pvp probably has the most freedom to choose between stats, because enchants make up so much of their stats.
---
If anything a 4 hour raid in a raiding guild is 4 guild hours - not 160 man hours.
---
Serious question: have you ever seen somebody actually try to sneak around? They sure as fuck don't slide their feet over the ground. Sliding might actually be the noisiest possible way to move around.
---
well when you dont have a source of income and need money for food...
---
&gt;  Nepotism doesn't pay
---
Not too sure about that take
---
All of the class reworks, talents, abilities, item adjustment and spells should be 1.12
---
They are gating content, items, and specific class skills (AQ/Dire maul spells) etc.
---
then dont make it level 20, make it level 5 or 10
---
????how?
---
probably not
---
Classic dungeon lesson 101:
---
Never shittalk tanks/healers as dps. A shitty tank is better than no tank. I am sure he was auto-attacking as best as he could though :)
---
Back? They've never left.
---
Yes. I used to love getting behind the gate on my shaman back in the day. Would be cool to see this and uldum in their vanilla versions full trottle
---
Fast forward, stoped when he said “not able to ice block and keep the flag, makes me not want to play this class in bgs” 
---
Hard life for mages... hard hard 
---
More bugs for hunters please
---
Back in vanilla my guild master and raid leader was an IRL friend. He used to play a dwarf paladin. Then I went horde for a couple of months and when I went back to play my alliance character he had rolled a night elf female priest, but he didn't say so to other guild mates who thought the dwarf just left. 
---
To everyone this priest was played by a girl. To me he admitted he was playing with his girlfriend, a girl I've never met and I am sure this was all BS. Strangely, we never came to meet IRL after that so he could never explain himself, I don't know why the fuck this cool guy hid his identity. And I didn't want to meet him either I guess. So in a way, the game ruined my friendship with him!
---
Wonder how much it would take to commission Conpatshe to do one of the exact same style, flavor, composition, and subject, but to change the perspective slightly to be as though looking out of one of those warm dwarven windows midway up the city's high walls.
---
I laughed, I cried.
---
Exactly, so they can see how pointless and detrimental mmo's are and never start that shit. I wish I had started doing heroin instead of wow ten years ago, at least I would have a chance to kill myself already.
---
lol holy shit your friend is a manipulative prick.
---
1) Bots use the free accounts to farm gold and sell it.
---
2) There is a dedicated community of F2P players who get to the level cap and twink there and pvp, all without paying a cent.
---
Honestly, it's wow. Nobody doesn't know what it's like at this point.
---
I'll be using names I have in retail. Except I have one new name to reserve. No I'm not telling you what they are.
---
No matter what your spec, if you go into classic understanding wow mechanics(like as if you’ve ever played WoW before) it will take you around 170-250 hours.
---
Oh fuck there was an absolutely gorgeous TB painting done quite a while ago. I’ve long since lost the link (buried very, very deep in previous comments) but if I have some time I might look for it
---
I will probably be old as fuck and still laugh at this video !
---
My ret pally (which was a joke before the talents) turned into a god because they added those talents and took out the need for grand marshal rank to farm grand marshal gear.  After I got the Grandmarshal's Greatsword, I was judgement critting clothies for 3.8-4.2k (a 1 shot on all but the most geared players).
---
That's a post from two years ago... How long did you actually stalk me? Lmao
---
Layering is necessary lol. Sorry that you’re wrong.
---
Warlock mage or Druid could also do the same. You literally just run in a circle with dots up and occasionally stop to hard cast when she stops to cast. I've killed her hundreds of times solo she shouldn't ever be able to reach you if you play it right.
---
i understand your apprehension but in practice there are so many variables in play when PvPing or raiding that i would strongly suggest against picking a race based solely on racials. sure there are things like fear ward or wotf that shine in specific circumstances but those are niches and are not representative of your full game experience. proper spec, gear and skill are the key to your success. i might be a hypocrite, though, as i\`m most likely gonna go gnome warrior because i love escape artist (best melee PvP racial). i\`d still fine as a troll warrior.
---
Link please and thank you!
---
Have *you* ever seen somebody actually try to sneak around? They sure as fuck don't go invisible either. I really don't care if the original animation isn't 100% realistic, the gliding is smooooth.
---
This would be realistic if everyone was mounted....
---
This was super common. It's why guys played as female characters. You didn't even have to say you were a female, people would just do nice things for you often
---
LEE DO NOT
---
idk why you'd bother much trying to farm instead of just leveling at 25. Getting to a higher level nets you more options for much more gold per hour.
---
Weapon skill: you need 305 because below that you are getting extra penalties for your weapon skill being too low against level 63 mobs.
---
Hit: you need all the hit you can get because of dual wielding penalties. I don't think it's even possible to reach 100% hit as a combat Rogue.
---
Totally agree. After doing the Worgen starting quests it felt like like a near total waste. Same with the goblin zone, but I hated that one.
---
This has me excited for TBC.
---
That's true. This is definitely not a minmax trio.
---
The question is will collective stealth, fast travel, and novelty be worth the trade-offs? We've done a cookie-cutter build before with Warrior/Rogue/Priest. If the trio is doable, we might go with it.
---
Who hurt you? She broke up with the other guy first. He didn't have to get back with her and she didn't have to get back with him. If she isn't in a relationship, whe can't cheat. Period.
---
Id be surprised if they put additional content into vanilla. They will probably just got to BC since it's the safest route and easy.
---
This isn't vanilla though, it's classic.
---
calmer than u are
---
\*\*&lt;Get of Fenris&gt;\*\* - Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore
---
\&amp;nbsp;
---
\*\*What’s it mean?:\*\*
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse. The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.
---
​\&amp;nbsp;
---
\*\*Our Philosophy:\*\*
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.
---
\*\*So what about loot and stuff?:\*\*
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.
---
\*\*What Gets us apart:\*\*
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such \*\*we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).\*\* This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool.
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!
---
​
---
\*\*A Brief History:\*\*
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.
---
\*\*Raid Times:\*\*
---
Phase 1 we will have two (yes TWO) Molten Core groups. East and West coast.
---
East Coast: Sun/Mon 7:00 - 10:00 PM EST. (4:00 - 7:00 PST)
---
West coast: Tues/Thurs 7:00 - 10:00 PM PST (10:00 - 1:00 EST)
---
Members may sign up for either that fits their schedule. Some more hardcore members should be able to raid both events with an alt/main.
---
\*\*Guild Priorities:\*\*
---
Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days).
---
\*\*Contact us:\*\*
---

---
Drop us a line and let’s talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we’re gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
I like suicide kings also. It's pretty easy to manage (there was even an ingame addon to handle it), it isn't overly harsh on new recruits yet still allows you to hold onto your spot on the list if there is an item you really want to hold out for.
---
you fucking serious?
---
Hit cap is 8-9% for YELLOW ATTACKS against level 63 bosses. Dual wield white hit cap is somewhere around 25%. You will never reach dual wield white hit cap in vanilla. More hit also increases your crit ceiling. This becomes very relevant with world buffs. Alot of misinformation in this thread.
---
Leeway is not a bug though. It was added on purpose to combat latency, which was a huge problem in 2005.
---
Question is if it should be fixed, since we no longer have latency issues. It probably should.
---
Very cool, like all the others.  Your maps have actually made me wish for more horizontal content in Classic WoW, when I didn’t really care before.
---
Spell hit is 3%, but melee hit is 5% for single weapon.  And I very much disagree with your statement that there isn't an abundance of choice.  There are plenty of times I could choose something with different stat values.  Dungeons, crafting, and quests provide many options for each slot.  Once Phase 2 hits we also have the PvP gear.
---
Boring? Healing? In Classic?
---
No fucking way.
---
Sure, as a paladins, is not that much, but still  you will have to really choose what, how and when to heal, because MANA is a VALUABLE resource in Classic.
---
The opening cinematic for Vanilla explains the situation in a couple sentences.
---
Our guild had pretty much all of them:  
---
-Guild had three leaders and one was an asshole. He ended up getting voted off the island and it was an  an acrimonious parting!  
---
-On one guys FIRST RAID of MC with our guild (on farm) he ninja'd Eye of Sulfaras and all the Rag loot. For the life of me I can't remember why we didn't have ML on, but we were a tight knit guild and were only interested in Rag loot - it was an AMAZING ninja! We were speechless our RL didn't have it on ML. Congrats Orc Warrior Zeja wherever you are!  
---
-Not drama necessarily, but two couples met their spouses through our guild and I went to both weddings!  
---
-One couple had a weird dynamic. The guy sounded like a chump and the wife sounded hot and was very flirty with me (and many other dudes!) Inevitably we had a guild picture post thread on our guild site and everyone was shocked by how much this guy was winning. He was a chubby nerd and the wife WAS HOT! We put 2+2 together and figured out he had money and she was a thot (we just called them hoes back then.) He took a long break and when he came back for TBC we were like "he Ken, where's Amy?" well yeah, she'd split his bucks...  
---
-We had several alcoholics and insomniacs. One beloved guildie had a substance abuse issue that spiraled into what seemed like schizophrenia or some other mental illness (extreme paranoia and delusions.) He went from everyone's favorite player (friendly and helpful) to hated and ridiculed. It was very sad to see b/c it was clear to me he was suffering from drug dependency and mental illness, but his behavior was so bizarre that people couldn't stand being around him.  
---
-WoW guild socialization is AMAZING. You will meet so many people from different places and slices of life you'd otherwise never meet or socialize with. I can't wait to meet new "voices" in whatever guild I end up in!
---
Depends on class.  Rogues have agility equivalence points: 10 Agility = 10 Stamina = 20 Strength = 20 Attack Power = 1% Crit.  We use this to determine equivalency.  It will help in how you weigh items when determining how much of a stat you're willing to drop for more stamina.
---
Faces and hair. who gives a shit bout the clash in texture when my beard is epic? Right now my beta pally has what I assume to be spray painted toilet paper tubes jammed into his face. It looks tragic.
---
You could say that for this entire list. The point isn't to farm gold at 25, it's to supplement your income while you're already questing that area.
---
\&gt; That means there will be 10 people in undercity. The game will feel dead af. 
---
If that's what you actually think, you don't understand how layering works.
---
For?
---
Gonna try to get the name Otis a reference to the game owl boy and Im rolling a balance druid.  Also use this name for my druid in DnD.
---
Herbalism and Skinning for the money.
---
USA USA
---
Wailing caverns sounds like a good idea.
---
I have literally levelled as Holy Paladin on retail during TBC - that's because I loved Shockadin and I wanted to see how viable it is outside PvP. BSD gear was also much more achievable than in Classic.
---
Having said that, it was fucking *horrible*. Do not level Paladin as Holy if you don't have a group and you can't just farm dungeons 24/7. I did that and it was simply put a bad choice. I ended up respeccing to Ret on around level 64 (in Nagrand) and I leveled from 64 to 70 in same time I leveled from 58 to 64. That should be a good comparison for you.
---
At work so I can't read or watch these yet but thank you both!
---
HAH copperfield.. Another shattered hand legend
---
You know, You've inspired me!
---
I'm gonna take my free time during the weekend and I think I'm going to do something I've always wanted to do: Go through [the hundreds of pages of ArsTechnica WoW posts](https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=267969) from back in the day to see what Vanilla players were actually feeling and complaining about.
---
Skimming through them mostly, I realize it might be enlightening for the current community to read.
---
That'll be a fun project!
---
I don't know who this figure is supposed to be, Thrall looks like this:  [https://imgur.com/p8m7mNJ](https://imgur.com/p8m7mNJ) 
---
In all seriousness though, this is a pretty cool sculpt. Good job!
---
New game (to me) new names. I don't feel any real connection between any retail characters I had and the ones I plan to have in Classic. And I never played Vanilla, so I don't have any old names to revive.
---
Also I plan to roll on the RP realm, which is another first, and my character names in the past have not been exactly IC friendly, so I felt like I should start over fresh with some legit ones that won't piss off my new RP friends straight away.
---
Sorry no.
---
From what I recall in vanilla mail between characters on the same account was instant even when items or gold were involved. Only items and gold to a character on a different account should take a while. The information on the wiki pages about this, if accurate, also indicates that it should be instant unless I'm just reading it wrong.
---
During the stress test I sent some good from one of my characters to another and it definitely nwas not instant at that time. It took about an hour it seemed like. A buddy of mine that was playing also tried it when I brought it up and his experience was the same with it not being instant.
---
So I guess if it's supposed to be instant and it's not in beta then we can talk about that?
---
Until there's a server crash and all his characters are inevitably shown. Don't be dumb, dude.

---
He is.
---
Then WoW is the least of your worries??
---
Played on Azgalor, you know, the server that exposed the reckoning bomb? Anywho, we had this priest that ninja looted domo's chest for his eye because he wanted it before 1 or 2 other priests and gquit. While trying to do his quest, he had both alliance and horde grief him to the point that one of our guildmates was frozen in place by a GM while the ninja looter was allowed to finish his quest. Dont know what happened to the guy after that, like was taking the fucking eye worth getting blacklisted by the entire server?

- [/r/classicwowplus] [My take on the "Classic +" post Naxx content.(Massive)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/comments/c5d3uw/my_take_on_the_classic_post_naxx_contentmassive/)
---
Then did you mean to type leeway in a bunch of the places you typed layering..?
---
You really don't. I know people are 100% certain that Blizzard has made Classic *so much easier* than vanilla was, but it's really not. It's still hard to solo. But if your gear is decent you can run equal level stuff with no actual tank.
---
This is beautiful.
---
Just don't go to the bar for one week and you'll have enough to find wow for 4 months.
---
One thing I think is becoming more common is that even personal interactions occur primarily though tech rather than in person. That causes those attitudes become ingrained and spill into actual decision-making and real-life choices, furthering divides.
---
Rofl, okay. Picking a new target then, if not the correct one.
---
Both, and also EPGP.
---
It will depend on the guild. Top guilds will use Loot Council, average guilds will use EPGP and MOST guilds (the crap ones) will use DKP.
---
OH yeah, I fucked up.
---
If you cant afford a mothly sub. How do you even manage to buy food? Do you have any other monthly costs exept for rent?
---
I def remember lavabeard actually the bloke had a big mouth !
---
For the Alliance! I'd never be a dirty, smelly horde. : )
---
A day as a temp worker will get you enough for a couple of months. I am sure there is a temp work agency in you are.
---
I just wanted to say thank you so much Blizz team! This is really exciting news! Blizzard games are meant to be perfect. Don’t forget that.
---
Thanks for being the first person to actually answer the question.  So, for Rogues at least, 1 Stamina = 1 Agility which gives us a good baseline.
---
But leveling to 5 takes 30min
---
Yeah fair enough, but the key difference is that a lot of people would enjoy it and find it an interesting experience, whereas no one at all enjoys examples given there such as hunter pets spazzing out and pulling an entire instance. It's not that tough to figure out what unintended "historic moments" (for lack of better terms) would be worth considering bringing back, IMO.
---
Not necesarrily, Horde doesn't auto flag in the barrens.
---
And many are afraid to flag thinking your bait.
---
Obviously, your going to get jumped more than on a PvE server, but it's surprising how many will target a lowbie alliance in the barrens and then find somewhere else to be.
---
There was a pally named "Plzattackme" running around near all the npc's that horde have to kill that are friendly to alliance south of ratchet, and no one was taking the bait, entire groups would just walk right past him.
---
&gt; They sure as fuck don't go invisible either
---
If they're sneaking around and not currently visible to you, what does that make them? That makes them invisible. It does not require that you see right through them, it just requires you to presently be unable to see them. 
---
&gt; I really don't care if the original animation isn't 100% realistic, the gliding is smooooth.
---
Really weak argument. I love watching ice skating at the Olympics too because of how smooth and elegant they look. The smoothness of ice skating unfortunately does not apply to other surfaces because you'd be dragging your feet and making absurd amounts of noise.
---
Hence why I asked if itll go free
---
If you are ok with the large amount of grinding vanilla is great.  I can see why blizzard is worried about a ton of people quitting though.  Getting to 60 takes forever in vanilla.  Could see a lot of people get frustrated especially when you get to 45+ where it's a slog to get a single level.
---
I'm going to be shammy with minning then I'm torn between herbalism and skinning to then drop if for engineering for pvp once I hit 60.
---
Dude, you weren't on staghelm were you? That reminds me of some shit that went down in our guild...
---
I've never even be to a bar
---
Female GM and male RL were dating. I made officer and a few months later was appointed RL instead of boyfriend as well as my class leader. Queue months of being undercut, gaslit, and ignored, where every time I suggested anything the GM would consult with boyfriend and then deny my ideas. We wasted weeks at a time trying to figure out how to progress without doing the strategies I suggested, and eventually the insulting got to be too much and I quit. I guess I was holding the team together because the guild fell apart soon after.
---
There was some stuff with boyfriend sexually harassing female guildmates, blackmailing them for nudes and stuff. That was swept under the rug and never spoken of by anyone besides officers.
---
1-10 for NE Druid and 1-10 for Tauren druid is actually unbelievably different.
---
NE actually have enough mana to cast enough spells to kill a mob, maybe with 1 staff hit. Tauren do not have this luxury. You end up doing white hits with your staff way more simply because you do not have any mana because tauren base int is their lowest stat. 
---
The good side is that their strength is their highest state so once you get bear form you pretty much never have to cast a spell again except to exit bear form and heal yourself and go back into bear form.
---
Asking the real questions
---
I'm not in the beta. Do it yourself.
---
What did they mean by those type of players
---
Mine wasn't really guild fallout on mass scale, just a personal matter that caused me to pretty much quit raiding. I was 16-17 at had been raiding with the same guild for probably over a year. We killed Nef in BWL a few times but we always seemed to struggle had would have wipes. IT was a smaller guild but decent. 
---
Anyways as a warlock I had always wanted Tier 2 Nemesis Helm from Ony. I always thought it looked amazing. I killed Ony at least 30 times probably more. Still no helm. I only had seen the helm drop 3 times while I was there. 2 times it was given to other locks that had been in guild for same or longer as me and had more DKP at the time, other time I think I did the raid with another guild for some reason and I got to do a roll off and lost :(. 
---
Sooooo it's been like almost a year.... all I want is this damn helm, people don't even care about Ony anymore since so many people have their helms already. I get an invite and I see I am the only lock without a Tier 2 helm besides this new warlock that has only been in the guild for like 2 weeks. I think "yup here's my fucking chance lets do this!" And lone behold.... the damn thing actually dropped! Holy shit was I excited. I was getting ready to celebrate when I hear they just gave the helm to this new warlock since I guess he had more dkp than me? I probably had gotten loot recently so was really low. 
---
Anyways.... I freak out... bitch about it.... no one seems to care. I bitch to my pally buddy in the clan and he is sick of the clan too. So next MC raid we do we intentionally afk a bunch, don't do what we supposd to sometimes, pull some mobs (idk how we didn't get caught) and wipe the raid a couple times. Then applied to new guilds. I think he got in, I never did but I pretty much quit raiding after that.
---
I definitely didn't handle the situation maturely but whatever lol. Still sad/mad when I think about it.
---
I dont have rent, and meal plan
---
Then you my friend are not doing college right
---
Melee leeway
---
&gt; i was on realm 3, it was completely dead from hogger &amp; eastvale onward
---
Stress test? As I originally commented, the wild movements they were doing with layering (the person in this video is not changing groups) were for stressing the server, not testing what layering will look like. That also includes overpopulating one layer which will mean empty layers. Stress test servers are not an accurate litmus test for what layering will look like live. Just like them dropping Ragnaros in Stormwind is an accurate representation of what raiding will look like live. 
---
&gt; in wod the apexis zone was dead 90% of the time.
---
That's because WoD had crap world content, you got most of what you needed from Garrisons, and Apexis was "meh" as a reward. Also there was no sharding in WoD, besides the garrisons themselves being individual player phases spun up in a sub-region of Shadowmoon/Frostfire. If you saw any population manipulation, it would have been CRZ, which was designed in Cata to actually bring people together from other servers into otherwise underpopulated zones. So if a tech that exists to bring in more people is still not successful, that actual problem would probably be that people don't need or want to visit said zone? That was why most zones on live were dead, especially ones not in the current expansion regions. 
---
&gt; That's a product of a game that was pushing people to end-game zones and reducing leveling time.
---
Right, but I'm not talking about CRZ, I was talking about the circumstances that lead to CRZ. ZOnes were dead before sharding, which was used widespread in Legion. So any talks about dead zones before Legion isn't relevant to sharding or layering, but of different aspects of the game's design. 
---
Sharding+CRZ principles were how we had the Legion pre-event, where we had 2+raids in each shard fighting demon invasions that took over Westfall, Barrens, Azshara, and Dun Morogh. Those raids were formed in general chat with people who were already there, I could see them appearing around me. So sharding can and has been set to allow in a lot of people, not split them up into dead zones.
---
BfA has gotten wonky as hell, and for that reason Layering should get phased out quickly if they don't want a repeat. But you are grossly misunderstanding what Layering is currently doing, or what it is intended to do based on the faulty data and experiences you have from the Stress test.
---
Ohh snap. I forgot about this. Moon walking taurens
---
I think increasing the Debuff limit to maybe 24 is more interesting than removing it. But bosses would really have to be scaled up for this to be a reasonable change. I also think world buffs really shouldn't stack.
---
Damn this looks beautiful, do you have a high res version?
---
Stoneform is ridiculously good in pvp tho..

---
Probably sold the account once he got the mace.
---
No earth-shattering moments like a bank ninja, or a dissolution of the guild, but a few noteworthy characters:
---
GL is also the RL. His GF is a waste of space, bad at her classes, and yes, AFKs during fights. She gets gear she wants because she's the only one who'll bed him, and he's always got it on ML. On the rare occasion when the rest of the guild made a fuss and got an upgrade to someone else, she would whine in guild chat and vent, like a four-year-old having a tantrum. She used to demand that I take shit off of the AH and give it to her because she wants it, and as a guild member, I should give her priority on my drops. Real piece of work.
---
One of our members wants to buy a scope schematic off the AH, but lacks the cash to do so. He makes a case to our officers that if we loan him the gold, DPS for all our hunters will go up (because he'll donate some scopes to the guild), and will repay in 3 months. This is not a cheap schematic-- several hundred gold. He buys the schematic, makes a scope for himself, fails to pay the guild back, and drops engineering for alch.
---
Well met*
---
Yeah you dont really want to cache what you dont have to, and that is definitely non-vital data lol
---
Loving the ability to sort by armor, I aint wearing no dress.
---
I played Kel’Thuzad alliance, which I believe Asmongold and Esfand played on back in Vanilla when they were relative nobodies, but I remember seeing them in battlegrounds all the time.
---
I remember Jhazz (spelling?) being our first GM, a night elf Druid player. Shaylah, a priest that was in bgs 24/7 it felt like and also got GM. There was a rogue, and I can’t remember his name at alll but he was pretty well known for spamming “Girls don’t play WoW” in trade chat for literal years.
---
Pacifist was probably the most famous guild but I can’t remember the names of anyone in it.
---
You are such an Alliance sympathizer haha!
---
* The Veiled Strand: 1 extra Alliance Quest Hub over Horde and preferred distance to the dungeon.
---
* Wildhammer Highlands: 3 extra Alliance Quest Hubs and severe preferred distance to the dungeon and raid.
---
* Blackened Marshes / The Headland: Horde have to either swim or go right next to an Alliance quest hub to get to the dungeon.
---
* Ships End Cove: A new high-level zone right between two Alliance cities.
---
* Savage Coast: Only a neutral city/hub, so yeah, pretty even.
---
* The Verdant Breach: same as above
---
* Uldum: same as above
---
* Bloodsail Bay: same as above
---
* Northern Lordaeron: Alliance outpost once again closer to the new content.
---
And now, with Gilneas, the Alliance sum get two extra quest hubs, and an innkeeper, all right next to the new content.
---
This is not where I expected to receive dating advice but I am appreciative of it
---
It's off-topic and irrelevant, which is the intended purpose of downvoting.
---
What do you mean? You go to college for college, whats the point otherwise?
---
I agree about keeping all the positive posts in mind. This has been one of my favorite subs for a while because I've had some nice chats with people. I think most people are just raging because they aren't having fun in the beta and students are all pissed that classic won't be released until after classes start
---
the bloopers were cute
---
Players would still be limited by mana, and a lot of debuffs are less efficient than spamming a single spell. It would be more interesting at 24 for sure though.
---
Yes, but now if they ever do, it's too late.
---
Once every month or two there should be a 1.5 AV weekend. Fun events like that would be great for the games longevity.
---
Whelps
---
These types of drama threads bring the stories out but it's not exclusive to wow.
---
Like, if you were with a group of people irl and they could tell you honestly without social repercussions stories they know (anonymity of the internet helps here obviously) I guarantee you'd hear no end of stories from peoples schools, unis, work, anywhere men and women are together, it happens.
---
People are scum, dude.
---
Thank you for your service ChromeDragon. 
---
Now if you could go ahead and design an alternate post-60 progression system and a new tradeskill, maybe an alternative to Archaeology that isn’t a horrible chore and implement some sort of item-level rebalancing so the powercreep after Naxx isn’t retarded, that would be nice.
---
I mean hey, I trust the guy who makes nice maps better than most multicelled organisms these days, you can’t make it any worse than how it went originally.

**&lt;Completion&gt;** Horde | East Coast NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore
---
Sixty iterations off the central finite curve, there's a semi-hardcore guild named &lt;Completion&gt; that will dominate world PvP, raid Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm, and create a family like community. Our discord has collections of all of the top class guides, profession guides, and BiS lists. Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.
---
**Who are we?**  
---
Our guild is run by experienced and skilled players that have played since 2004-2006. Our raid leaders have raided in vanilla through Naxx, and have raided through Naxx on private servers. Others have achieved PvP ranks ranging from Rival to Gladiator on retail, and raided at a mythic level with exceptional parses. In short, we raid to gear for PvP. We are looking to min/max our characters at a relaxed pace to dominate all aspects of PvP and PvE and have a blast doing it.
---
**Who are we looking for?**  
---
We are looking for more like-minded players with character min/maxing aspirations with a passion for PvP and raiding to join our ranks and fill out our 40+ man roster. Our core 40 man roster is currently full, though we are accepting exceptional players for all classes, and everyone that joins will have every opportunity to earn a raid spot. We expect our raiders to have extensive knowledge of their class and their role. We are also accepting any casual players looking for an active community.
---
**What will we be doing?**  
---
We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday, 8-11 EST and will use a 25% weekly decay DKP system for loot. There will likely be a 3rd optional day added in the future during BWL progression and onwards. We also will be doing many world PvP events and PvP raids, as well as an extensive amount of premade BGs. We will make a valiant attempt at rank 14 without killing ourselves in the process. Also, we will have other weekly community events such as dueling tournaments, "where is X" events, and weekly bounties against certain Alliance players, all with gold prizes.  
---
[https://discord.gg/VKuKuA](https://discord.gg/VKuKuA)
---
Yeah, the cinematic basically echoes what I said. 'The tenuous pact between the Horde and Alliance has all but evaporated' indicates that there is still 'peace' but it's at a breaking point.
---
No kidding, any thing to actually encourage guild interaction. As is, I only play with people I know IRL via the cross realm invite thing. And while I love it, I have no loyalty to any one on my server, and the only reason I play on a server at all, is becasue if I start and alt, I already have bags and epic flight gold ready to go.
---
Yes 1.12 talents and spells.
---
This is big for many classes. Shamans didn't have threat totem before like 1.6, warrior tanking is completely different(no spamming sunder is not how you get threat) , rogues were signficantly nerfed so they aren't really overpowered like they were in early vanilla, though they are still good, and many more changes.
---
honestly classic is almost entirely a different game than what you played in early vanilla.
---
Yes, but shamans with shields are going after caster shields not tanking shields
---
If you can sell gold, it will encourage botting and or hacking and thats a problem.
---
I'm telling you that 1) I literally worked at Amazon, and working over 40 hrs was discouraged on most teams, but unfortunately there was no company wide policy so some teams crunched and that 2) just because Google does it (or just doesn't actively discourage it, which in a competitive environment is the same as encouraging it) 3) I currently work in the government contact defense industry where, at least at the three companies I've worked at, and most of the companies my friends work at, it's explicitly not allowed, and finally 4) all the studies on crunch indicate that usually it's at best a small gain in the short run and a net loss in the long run, and at worst actively detrimental to software development.
---
So yeah, well managed companies do not crunch, and you need to disabuse yourself of the notion that Google and Facebook are well managed just because they make a lot of money. **Especially** Google. Just read some medium posts by former googlers some time.
---
Yes - why do you say it is weird again? I don't follow. It all seems quite consistent.
---
You’re a bad troll
---
I think you are spot on -- that's exactly what led me to this build: switching forms with the other Druid, allowing mana regen, and cycling DPS and healing. If we are getting damaged beyond our healing capabilities, Cat and Bear could also switch, allowing for an off-tank to soak up damage. Switching forms to compensate for missing members.
---
It's also very theoretical -- I'm not sure how well it would work. It might fall flat on its face. And I'm not sure how much fun it would be either. But I'm quite curious at this point.
---
The Ford Model T was the car that brought automobiles to the middle class and paved the way to America's interstate roadway system but unfortunately I don't recommend buying one
---
No no no. Let them pick humans so that the horde has an easier time in pvp!  
---
Their own fault for picking human.
---
I'm out of the lo
---
Seems pretty common to me.  I will say this though, wow was and is a major escape for people who are not necessarily happy.  So you combine that with at the time was a bunch of teens to late 20's people spending a ton of time talking to people freely and getting attention they were not getting irl..... shit happens.  As the dude below said, people are scum.
---
Stormrage EU?
---
Any big quests like this one were certainly considered guild quests. They required a lot of people to participate and held the promise of being renowned as the “Guild that opened the gates” on that particular server. It fostered a relationship between guildmates through the necessity to work together. It also brought upon things like guilds holding the server hostage (see earlier threads from this week) and really gave the game a feeling of allowing the players to shape the story. I’m excited to see things like that come back!
---
Most worker exploitation is 100% legal.
---
Yeah, of course everything is subjective, but it's probably good to start with something like that and determine your personal breakpoints and set bonuses you're after.
---
Paladin is the only unbeatable WPVP class. Not because you win, but because you can bubblehearth away.
---
Unbeatable.
---
A hunter joined my raiding guild as a main raider and a week or so later a shaman joined as well (unrelated), the shaman told all of us that she was married to the hunter and he decided to go along with it without telling us that he didn’t know her at all. They talked in guild chat and raid chat for nearly 2 years RPing like they lived together and were married (no one in the guild knowing that they weren’t), asking the other to bring them a snack, asking where the dog is, etc. to the point where they ended up actually dating long distance. The shaman didn’t have a mic or cam though, so all of this relationship was over text for 2 years. That is, until the hunter bought the shaman a webcam and they Skyped for the first time and he found out that the shaman was actually a middle aged man who had been catfishing him for 2 years. Only then did we get to hear the actual story.
---
The Streamer Kargoz did a duo speed leveling video as a prot pally with a warlock. They were slaughtering entire camps of mobs and had a good time tanking dungeons.
---
Does it matter? As long as there are different layers, they can be abused.
---
Did you ever stop to consider you might be wrong and you're basing it off of a guy saying he saw a few people in Ironforge?
---
TOO SOON!
---
I'm not trolling though, I'm actually serious. I'd love to try classic, but I'm not going to drop $20 on a non refundable sub just so I could see if I like a game. Thats a waste of money
---
In Vanilla you could have all but a few alts hearth out at 5% while killing the first boss. This would get the ID saved on these alts then zone back in to not being locked to the instance and clear. In the beginning of the guild we did it 4 or 5 times a week.
---
Recommend going Ret until at least 50 unless always grouped.
---
Try and get as much spirit as possible.
---
and paladins are for porn.
---
Holy fucking shit. Are you really comparing bugs in a video game to protesting an unjust government?
---
Killing that moonkin is actually insanely easy. Here is the strat:
---
As soon as the moonkin pops on top of you IMMEDIATELY cast entangling roots. 
---
Get as much distance as you can. Cast 2-3 Wraths. Entangling Roots will break at this point generally.
---
Recast Roots.
---
Rinse and repeat until dead. 
---
For assurance, get at least 1 minor health potion.
---
But it really isn't that hard.
---
I will admit that 1-12 as a tauren druid blows so hard, especially when you compare it to an NE druid, which feels so much easier and smoother because of their higher base int and therefore greater manapool.
---
I would expect someone who calls himself u/pedantic--asshole to appreciate meticulous screening of guild members.
---
Dude role played as a girl, catfish's this dude, gets him to send nudes, then posts them all over the internet and the realm forums.
---
Can’t stress this enough :D
---
Now, why does that sound familiar....
---
Oh right, it's because it is a reworded variant of "Oh it's just Beta/PTR/Live/First Patch, it'll be fixed!" that we've gone round and round with in the retail game for years now.
---
They changed aoe aggro for wars so we went from halfway through AQ40 to couldn't even kill nef anymore and i think burnout setin since the gear was going to be useless in a month anyways
---
Would be interested to know peoples thought on the t.2.5 (5) set bonus. I've noted I don't think it's worth the stat loss, but I mained a priest in vanilla and being able to spam flash heals as often as possible (especially on trash/certain bosses) was the reason for running 3 t1 and getting the ZG trinket, so I might be undervaluing it!
---
For max comedic effects, if you could refer them with their in game race. Like two middle age tauren and a 20 year old undead rogue lol
---
Berserking has been reworked about 10 million times since vanilla launched. It used to be really bad.
---
This happened on my rogue when we had to pug tanks for a weekend run. I got it over the tanks and at least 10 of the members of that run dropped.
---
This reminds me of a vague memory where an npc says "what do you need" with emphasis on the "need". Am I confusing this with another game?
---
Wait elves so longer have big ears?
---
Beast slaying and bow spec are over here like: Am I a joke to you?
---
And I would say that, but it's not really a *farm* if you're killing things there for a quest anyway. It's vanilla, you're going to have to do quests in pretty much every area when leveling.
---
It's all about the work / social life balance my guy.
---
Would this include neutral zones?
---
You seem to be the one who doesn't understand, as layering is continent wide, and with agressive layering people have already experienced empty cities...
---
I'm not OP I was just joking lol
---
omg-- I remember when people would use guild AND private channels in vent and mix up which button was which. It made for some... hilarious outbursts between pulls.
---
And 8 times the number of level 60s, and 8 times the number of miners, and 8 times the number of potential buyers, and, in aggregate, the same number of competitors on each layer as a medium pop server going for those nodes.
---
I actually went to highschool with mark fischbach aka Markiplier. I'm sure he's grown alot since I knew him but I guarentee stream personas are a real thing. He was one of the most quiet kids I knew. Everyone liked him though, I even got turned down by a girl for a school dance because she was waiting on him to ask her, and I ended up meeting my wife as a result. Life is strange man.
---
Fair point, but when was the last time you went to the Night Elf starting zone? Or Valley of Trials? Besides the capital cities there really isn't a reason to go back to those zones anyways. And the city got overtaken if I remember correctly.

---
Yeah, I am not sure how they would fix that, it is one of the biggest problems right now. The only way I can see to make it less of a problem is to highly restrict the layering system.
---
it still was possible to port back to the entrance with a little [setup](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bz7yii/will_maraudon_farming_work_in_classic/eqqqkbq/) 14 days ago. Don't know if anything has changed since then.
---
Daggerspine US.   Reading through these other responses, apparently this sort of thing wasn’t that uncommon lol.
---
Ya people seem to ignore the stuff that doesn't support the theory they came up with.
---
It for sure should as it is a clear advantage for melee in pvp.
---
I B U Y A N D T R A D E
---
How many times do you end up with multiple items of the same slot that are roughly the same value? You have to compete with other people for those items, and guilds/ parties are not going to like people taking items that aren't particular upgrades rather than let others have those first. The scarcity of gear and method in which gear is acquired at 60 really makes it so you don't end up in this situation often.
---
XD
---
Oh I def agree. But a man can dream
---

@mcinaction 
---
Where u at bro fite me
---
And yet we still have sexodar and other such lewdness.
---
&gt; They were using hyper aggressive layering with payers of 2-3 without any exaggeration for awhile now.
---
again, how do you know that? Server populations have been quite low, and layering is continent wide - so there could have been lots of people in your layer but not in your city
---
You also have to talk about how shit current wow is and have to make sure to tell people that like it that they're wrong.
---
Someone posted a video that showed hunter sounds were off.
---
It's not Vanilla if it takes less than a full minute to get your loot and your character is sliding around crouched the entire time.
---
I don't like socializing anymore than I need to, plus none of my friends ever went to bars or anything like it. Board game nights once a month were all we'd do
---
my retail name is the same exact toon I made in vanilla. Have had it over 13 years. tdub will be born again.
---
That's the AEP formula from shadowpanther.net and predecessors and it was debatable.  It comes down to what you want out of pvp. For some people pvp is "can I global this mage/priest?" because it feels real good to do that.  For people with possibly more experience and sense, (talking about warrs here) stamina is god tier for lots of reasons but fundamentally: if a mage can't burn you down (on avg) when emptying his mana pool, the mage can only keep resetting the fight and pray he gets a string of lucky crits.
---
Sorry but after having known Blizzard for 15 years, I have very little hopes of them actually fixing bugs that are being reported multiple months prior a reason.
---
Totally.
---
I had 60 fps in vanilla. Sorry not sorry.
---
This is why I ALWAYS kill the hunters pet and THEN the hunter.
---
Tbc is gross
---
I want all of that in. Interactions between players are a big part of vanilla, and in my opinion, both the positive and negative interactions are necessary to create a real world and a real community. They should leave as much as possible to be dealt with within the community itself.
---
Ok, so they just made non-sliding animations to break it. Got it.
---
I guess you have never played a hunter on beta mr. software engineer. It plainly sucks and its pretty much unplayable even with today's fixes.
---
Theldon that you?
---
I would prefer it to be that way. I was really bummed when I found out it was server-wide.
---
It'll depend on community feedback though. BC would involve a lot of changes to the core systems to Vanilla, which is exactly what the vanilla fans don't want. And I don't think continuing to separate the player base is what Blizzard wants. Two is fine, but three may be a bit much if it doesn't lead to a direct growth in total number of players (which classic alone is guaranteed to do). Three or more may just stretch the current base out which leads to too much overhead to support individually thin player bases.
---
New "classic" expansions however wouldn't threaten that unless a majority of the classic player base expresses disinterest in that route, which at this point in time doesn't seem to be the case.
---
Also keep in mind the retroactive development they had to put into making classic have the same look and feel for modern computers (which they still haven't gotten 100% right). BC also involved a number of overhauls which they would have to go again and re-build from the ground up. Meanwhile, a 'classic' expansion would already have the necessary dev kits in place to build upon, and they wouldn't need to add a whole new world each time as there doesn't need to be a new leveling process- just bigger endgame. So the development load and time would be much smaller.
---
TL;DR: "Classic" expansions would not only be a better use of budget and time for the dev team, but they would also cater more to current fan interest while not further dividing the player base.
---
Of course, this is just my opinion on the matter.
---
It's not really about completely not interacting with others. It's about not being as reliant on others to do anything in the game. For a lot of us with erratic schedules and limited game time it's a wonderful option. We just get to log in and play at our convenience. No drama, no AFKs, no ninjas, no people rage quitting instances / raids, no inconveniencing others when you need to randomly go AFK, etcetc. 
---
And multiboxing in no way excludes you from any social aspect of the game, if you choose to partake in them. Plenty of multiboxers do activities (raid, pvp, instances, whatever) with their guilds on a solo toon. And hell, there is of course the whole multiboxing community. Some of my longest time WoW friends I've met as a direct result of multiboxing. Now that realm communities and raid progression might start to matter again, it's perfectly plausible that multiboxer guilds will make a comeback as well.
---
Wait, they did all of this?  That's fucking phenomenal!!
---
We farmed those for raid buffs, are they on an island west of Feralas?
---
cata after classic pls
---
Love that game, lol. Darkest Dungeon's narration is better than a lot of dialogue in games nowadays
---
Main - Priest - Herbalism/Tailoring. Will just gather herbs as I level to my alt or sell. Level up Tailoring to Max and probably keep it. Might switch out Herbalism to Enchanting at 60.
---
Alt - Warlock - Herbalism/Alchemy. Will level these up normally and supplement my herbs from what my main gathers. Playing with the idea of leveling tailoring before alchemy on my Warlock as well for the BoP robe before dropping it for alchemy.
---
Because at release there would be 4 hour+ queue times **just to login**.
---
There is around 2 million supposed active subscribers and they all have access to classic servers for free, not to mention any returning WoW players and additional people to check it out.
---
You can't just make more servers because many of the players will just be tourists who leave before level 20, resulting in empty dead servers. 
---
By layering they can *greatly* reduce login times and starting zone congestion. After it dies down they can remove the layering.

I constantly hear people say "TBC was the perfect xpac blah blah blah" but when any private server did BC they failed spectacularly. There are popular wrath servers tho. I don't actually like TBC much either. They added some stuff that had low participation rate but became the focus (arenas)

Wise

Mmmm Pretty sure I remember there being a raid at the start of BFA with 20 prot pallies who cleared the heroic raid. Was quite hilarious.

I don't really care if you prefer the newer animation, that's up to you, I just like the older one more.

Perfected the blend of playable specs, daily things to do that where impactful, but not MANDATORY,  and epic storylines, and the best QoL ballances and FREAKING amazing heroics.
---
TBC severs most logical. Vanilla content would be  good though.
---
All that weird incest porn isn't popular for no reason.
---
/r/classicwowplus is a subreddit intended for discussions post-classic additions. You'll likely receive toxic replies asking this here unfortunately.
---
Pet AI is pet AI. Hunter pets and Warlock demons use the same AI system. So if Hunter pets got fixed, lock demons should be better now too.
---
Yes. That is vanilla and recreating vanilla is what this project was about from the begging. Also, I do not think that classes should be balanced. That is a modern concept for modern games and Classic is a recreation of a game from 2004.
---
serious question, how does she make people think you travel the world if you're dead broke?
---
All this info is 15 years old. There is nothing new or exciting about Vanilla Gold making that doesn't apply to Classic. I guess newly posted videos applies as new undiscovered content for a game thats 15 years old.

---
Can't you invite with your alt too?
---
I think it would be interesting to have the debuff limit either removed or increased. I don't know if there have been any private servers that have done this, but I think it might go a decent ways into making certain spec's viable without actually changing the classes/specs at all. Obviously this would be a rather huge change to the game, however so most wouldn't approve.
---
To be honest with you, I cannot completely recall the server name. I played a horde rogue on 1 server, my alliance hunter on a 2nd, and a warrior alt on a 3rd. I do know that it was my hunter that was on this server in question, and I recall that we server transferred to Baelgun right before TBC launch.
---
I'll never understand why people think tbc will be a thing again. the demand for tbc doesn't even come close to vanilla
---
Sorry, what? What are you talking about?
---
Completely agree.
---
I actually think the devs are really excited for Classic as well. In the recent 8.2 developer's insight video Ion starts talking about Classic near the end and he gets visibly more energetic, imo.
---
TBC was fantastic?
---
Guild leader and main tank took the top 10-20 most geared players in our guild and jumped ship with them to start a new guild with the current biggest guild on the server to prep for Naxx. I'll never forget what a piece of crap you were to us, Felmore.
---
It wasn’t added in vanilla. Don’t you see how flawed your logic is? Oh, they removed dungeon finder for classic, why would they remove a «fix» for making groups?
---
Didn't the internal cool down get added in the TBC prepatch? Shouldn't it be back to its legendary original state?
---
Same here. Retail stealth just didn't feel the same, and animations are a major reason why I played Undead Mage and Rogue. When they changed the undead cast animation in retail, it threw me off completely. The gliding in stealth is another thing that just looks cooler to me.
---
Hahahahahahah
---
Valid point which needs to be expressed. Its a simple yet complex situation overall
---
If I'm not mistaken, the youtube video of the priest tanking MC might still be available. Can check after work today.
---
TBC has proven it doesn't have a great fanbase.  BC Private server always fail. There hasn't ever been a popular one. Granted most of them have been plagued with horrible issues, still it feels like people say they like it, but when it comes to actually playing it, nobody shows up.
---
I feel like parents taking away computers opened up so many raid spots back in the day. My first time in MC wasn't even on my own character, it was my friend's mage and I spammed Frostbolt and made water for a week because he was grounded and didn't wanna lose his spot.        
---
        
---
I had no idea what I was doing and just did an imitation of his voice on a shitty mic for the limited vent interactions I needed.
---
I want another expansion. Maybe TBC, but I'm thinking a completely new expansion. As if Classic was really just "normal" WoW but in a different dimension where instead of TBC, we had something else. I'd like to see Blizzard just take a different route this time around. How great would that be?
---
sure, but vanilla is an entirely different game. it's what people have been asking for all these years
---
It's true, I love them boys in blue, though the horde get a much larger forsaken presence in Northern Lordaeron than the Alliance (they get an innkeeper(forgot symbol) and would get more vendors, as well as being nice and close to Undercity).
---
also the horde don't need to run past eastwatch if they just go through fuselight to the dungeon, also the two hubs closest the savage coast are both horde (stonard and grom'gol)
---
To balance it up though, I would probably added a small troll horde outpost in the verdant breach (local trolls turned horde, not darkspear) and make the furthest quest hub in the veiled strand Cenarion Circle instead of alliance.
---
I know a few people that are interesting in running groups of that size. Who knows what will come of it in the end. Will be interesting to say the least.
---
Why not? Parts are readily available. Its a straightforward mechanism that nearly anyone can work on. The first gear clutch system is a little weird as is the spark retard but nothing that someone can't get used to working properly. They're fun little things.
---
Dude. Duuuuuuude. Classic is going to literally infinitely better than retail. Just trust us, we’ve played both
---

Hey! I made one of the original some weeks ago - you can look my post history :)
---
&lt;Envy&gt; PvP Server, Alliance | PvE Raiding Guild | EU
---
Envy are a long-running guild from private servers and retail looking for additional players at launch and beyond for semi-hardcord raiding, utilzing a transparent loot-council system.
---
But first, let me start by giving you some general information about us.
---
History:
---
Formerly known as Millenium, Inside Job and Cobra Kai across various vanilla servers; we as a guild have been able to achieve consistant progression through content from release, while earning a position among top guilds. We’ve also accumulated a massive amount of vanilla information over a span of several years, and it’s safe to say our resources are some of the best out there. We are a moderate raiding guild with an experienced core that has been together for over two years now, and we plan to continue our success come Classic.
---
Raid Times:
---
Wednesday, Sunday and Monday
---
17:30 BST - 21:30 BST
---
Our raids take place on Wednesday, Sunday and Monday night at 17:30 until 21:30, and we prefer our raiders be available for slighty longer on Monday nights for progression periods; currently looking to start MC progression within three-weeks of launch. We will also host optional ZG raids (once released) throughout the week at the same time. We are currently seeking exceptional players of all classes and roles at the moment, though healers are always highly sought after.
---
We have big plans when Classic comes, but we can’t do it without your help! If Envy interests you, you can find more detailed information on how to join by visiting [https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/](https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/)
---
Additionally you can contact myself (Ancilla#0140) or probability#1475 on Discord via DM for more information.
---
Remind me! 3 months
---
Haha this is great, or when you find a herb that requires a skill of 75-100 in a level 10 zone.
---
Histeria is better than being passive in this situation in my mind and I do not think we will get anything inbetween by the nature of things.
---
ya thats the truth. same with the thunderfury quest.... i remember our whole guild helping and being there to summon the boss at the end.
---
In order to use logic we need blizzard to communicate about this shitshow. Unfortunately there has been a black out about layering and eu servers
---
I'm not too :D
---
Ah yes, the famous tale of the *Vengeance of the Earthmother*. A classic.
---
Before the Storm (Patch 2.0.1) is the content patch for World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade.
---
A wow 2 would of been a lot better than classic in my opinion, that way we can all run around with our heads cut off again instead of going back into a game where you already know everything down to a math.
---
Most of the TBC servers that failed spectacularly though, were hot garbage. There’s a large demand for TBC servers in the private community, it’s just always been (for some reason) much more difficult to properly emulate.
---
If it's a BoE that could generate some decent gold I'm not giving it away to someone who will use it for a few levels before getting a new upgrade.
---
Whatever it is they should leave classic servers alone. Add more content to separate servers and allow transfers to those servers whether the content is TBC or classic+ doesn’t matter. Classic servers should be left as is so we don’t end up asking for WoW Classic: Classic in 10 years.
---
Please dear god remove leeway it's completely broken
---
Thanks! :)
---
I think it really depends what you're trying to accomplish. I don't see how Classic takes more time investment when there is an infinite amount of things you can do in retail?
---
From experience it's one of those things where you will see people posting them for ridiculous prices but then when you get one yourself you realize no one will actually buy it for that.
---
Because it’s the best version of WoW. 
---
THE BURNING CRUSADE
---
It was not there in vanilla and it streamlined player interaction.
---
I like it! I always thought it was weird that worgen joined the alliance. I think they would join the undead in this version fighting the feral worgen and the alliance(lead by a pure human greymane) who don't see the different, similar to the forsaken. Also making them look more like they used to and not chihuahuas. 
---
Heck if we want to get even more fanficie we could make his daughter the worgen leader or something
---
I should post this with a throwaway account but whatever. I bounced between two guilds on Kargath on Alliance for quite sometime Im Hungry When Is Lunch and Prestige which was a raiding guild during BC. I rose through the ranks of Prestige and even brought some former guildies along who also rose with me. We progressed in BC a decent amount. But once I became a class officer it was a bit too much time and I began to become inactive. One night there was a vote and it was decided I would be removed as an officer. So what did I decide to do? With myself and fellow conspirators I ninjaed the entire guild bank. My account was in fact hacked that same night by some foreign IP after I went to sleep that must have been monitoring the value of my account. 
---
Anyways, as a result of the ninja the guild fell apart and the couple that was running it got divorced. 
---
Last I heard nothing good had come of that. It was probably the single most dickish and selfish thing I have done not only in a game but real life too. I had hate mail piled a mile high on forums and in game. I apologized to the guild leader a few years later and she was gracious about it.
---
Living the dream
---
hes honestly a really really nice guy.  I never got the whole story from him because hes with her now and its just weird to ask, but another guild mate got the story from her and translated it to me in guy talk.
---
I have to admit though shes extra hot now.  its really weird and for the most part I forgot about it until I read this thread
---
I don't really care if it was like that in classic. Who the fuck wants artificial simulated 2004 ping.?
---
TBC pretty please?  I’d honestly be way more hyped for TBC than vanilla and I’m really really really hyped for vanilla.
---
No, it's not an exploit. 
---
It is intended that sitting down gives you auto received crits.
---
It is intended that receiving crits gives you reckoning.
---
Literally working as intended.
---
Hi. Curious noob here. How long was WoW in vanilla? Let's say X years. Did the content start getting dry after X years? What's going to happen X + 1 years after Classic launches? We will have had Vanilla for longer than ever before. What do we do once we've done it all?
---
I fully expect that we'll get BC and Wrath servers at some point.
---
As for new content, I wouldn't mind seeing expanded level 60 content as well.
---
I also suspect that we'll see season type servers that reset periodically so that there's a steady supply of fresh servers for those interested in that.
---
Also they can still use the retail game to get a general idea of what the gameplay and mechanics are like. If the retail trial isn’t enough to at least get them interested in classic then they probably won’t like it anyways.
---
&gt;How the fuck do you stand out as a mage in MC?
---
Time your trinkets and cooldowns like Arcane Power so they best line up with the bosses. You need to account for the clear speed of your raid.
---
Hit that 1 extra add with Cone of Cold, know when to Blizzard, when to decurse, when to counterspell.
---
Know when to use AoE spells, and when to fireblast instead of frostbolting. Know which gearpieces to equip to best suit the current boss, know when to use your evocation to minimize downtime.
---
There's a lot more to a class than just having a one button rotation.
---
Holy fucking shit. Do you not understand how analogies work?
---
This guy fucks.
---
Or sit in the tunnel and afk run into the wall for free honor...
---
you went back to dun'morogh for Gnomregan and an silver hand questline, back to elwynn for some mage tower quests from redridge, everyone had to go to tristfal glades for the scarlet monastery and to get to plaguelands.
---
Also you go back to every stating zone for mounts at 40 and 60.
---
besides, Gilneas changes a lot while you quest though it and you meet a lot of characters, it would have been nice to see how the zone ended up after everything dies down.
---
Because it was not in vanilla and enables abuse.
---
Nef only drops ONE Red Scepter Shard for the entire raid team, and they can only kill him once a week.
---
If a guild gives up their Red Scepter Shard, there's absolutely no chance they'll craft a scepter in time to get a Scarab Lord.
---
Meh. I just remember it being similar to vanilla but with features I didn't like. It wasn't until later expansions did the ideas for tbc get polished and looked good.
---
It’s the best kind of meme. With insane patience and hard work and flexibility you can eventually gear up enough to be viable. In the mean time you’ve got a really great raid/PvP healing spec and can tank dungeons to collect gear.
---
Still the best looking undead horse.
---
Aggramar EU.
---
My older brother ran a smallish raiding guild, by the end of Vanilla they had MC/Ony/ZG/AQ20 on farm, some progression runs in BWL and cleared some Naxx trash. At the time, i was mainly playing with another guild on the server and my alt warlock was still helping my bro's group out.
---
There was a Paladin officer in the raid group who was always hitting on an underage Irish chick who played a Hunter - creepy as fuck, and he kept getting called out on it. Sometime around the 25man raid announcement for TBC, he was kicked for being a creep.
---
Cue drama time, the Druid CL and Warlock CL's quit in solidarity with their creepy mate, and somehow took most of the core raid team with them into TBC. I saw the writing was on the wall for the guild and left my bro high and dry so i could keep raiding. The new group fell apart during Kara after getting stuck on Shade of Aran for ages, and eventually i ditched the alt entirely and just focussed full time on my main char. My brothers guild never recovered and only really ran 10 mans in TBC, and a some 25's Naxx in wotlk before disbanding during ICC.
---
I'm still not 100% sure i've ever been forgiven for that tbh.
---
* in general, criticism and opposing viewpoints just fucking triggers people*
---
It was on topic based off the comment I replied to so you’re admitting you’re part of the problem. Grow up.
---
Sub is filled with a bunch of emotional drama queens are who gonna get bored and quit within a few months of launch anyway
---
You are not. The moment I learned of this alleged bug, I tested it. It wasn’t there. This was only a few hours after the original video was posted. I thought it was important to stem the tide of beta disinfo, so I posted evidence.
---
I’m not telling people to calm down over discussing bugs. That’s literally the point of a beta test. I’m telling people to calm down with the “BLIZZARD IS SCREWING UP CLASSIC” nonsense when they haven’t even played the game in its current form. The sky is not falling. Classic is great. Chill out.
---
Is there actually a lot of demand tho? Take war.  Ma. Ne. For example. It has popular wrath servers, but the BC one is a ghost town. Why? It's the same guys running both. 
---
I feel like people remember BC being amazing, but when they start playing it they get tired of it emediately.
---
Turning around lacked the animation, the character just rotated without animation.
---
If it were the only thing offered I'd think it was cool, but if I had a choice? 10/10 times I'd go classic. They could bring certain elements from BC as a 'classic' expansion as they did have plans and some partially finished work to include Hellfire Peninsula as a part of the original experience but scrapped it in favor of a full expansion.
---
I think Nobbel or someone like him has a video detailing all of the scrapped content almost included in the original version of the game. Basically if it was in Warcraft III, it was also meant to be in classic. So the foundation actually is there to do it.
---
A couple from our guild said it would be cool to meet some people in real life. So, another guildie bought a plane ticket, unsolicited, and told the couple. The guildie flew down and was basically a horrible guest the whole time. The guildie complained about the activities the couple came up with, and was generally ungreatful for all the last-minute planning done to entertain the guildie during this short-notice visit.
---
After that, the guildie in question fell in internet love with another guild member and we never heard from them again. Our guild, at the time, disbanded and we ended up reforming without the two lovebirds. One of the lovebirds used their ex-girlfriend's name as their character name. I think they went on to take it as an alias for their real name, too. I think they're still together years later.
---
Omg wow in vr? A dream come true!
---
It's not necessary at all. But you will get a huge DPS boost if you have a few MCP's.
---
Keep in mind that weapon DPS and attackspeed doesn't matter. Only certain on-hit effects work in forms. And On-Use aswell, ofc.
---
There are some good alternatives out there. Just go for a big +str stick.
---
Releasing BC solves no issues. You either end up with retail if you go through the expansions (and then people will want classic again) or you stop at BC and still have the exact same problem of classic running out of content.
---
Paladins can also one-shot people.
---
I would /p "Everyone greed" and then proceed to press Need. 
---
No regerts
---
Bitching is better than being passive and not putting preassure on Blizzard in my mind.
---
Ya I would rather they put additional content in Vanilla. If I had a choice between vanilla, BC and Wrath. I would probably play vanilla then go straight to wrath.
---
The video with this posted was edited within a few minutes to say this 1 of many other issues was fixed.
---
There is a lot of value  in making it accessible to new people though. A lot of people just weren't that sophisticated 15 years ago, and so don't know it. 
---
I will say, I notice a couple things I am skeptical of, and a couple of my favorites are absent, but there's a lot here. 
---
Honestly, I learned quite a bit, and that's all I can hope for for the average wow reddit post.
---
I've heard of something very similar elsewhere...
---
Good. Let the casuals take a hike. Classic is for the OG players and supporters.
---
I'm really glad you think this will work.
---
We'll be in voice chat the entire time.
---
I can definitely see us coming up short on the DPS side of things, in which case we'll need to level up or bring in others, which doesn't sound too problematic to me. Great point on the orphans. We've got the basics down and every class can DPS, so anyone is fine.
---
Yeah, i know joking, and its funnier/worse because you know some ass hole has done that. I'm just saying being a dude who uses others nudes is gross, not you.
---
Didn't read far enough down, said the same thing as a comment to someone elses comment. Well played sir, I hope we're not in the same group.
---
He replied right after the other post saying that 1 item of the list he showed was fixed
---
Ideally this TB background would be animated, maybe the elevator going up and down and some smoke coming out of a tent. I’d pay some $ for that!
---
Enhancement is extremely underwhelming. Mainly because of the fact that you need to take up atleast 2 debuff slots to do any damage at all (Storm Strike and Flame Shock). Elemental is more viable, and defenitely viable in AQ20+, but if you want a safe spot, go resto.
---
The re-color added a bunch of artifacts and made weird green areas.
---
You'd think that. Same thing about orb of deception.  
---
Sold a red whelpling, azure whelpling, and orb of deception each for a few hundred a pop. They aren't worth extravagant amounts, but definitely nothing to sneeze at.
---
Mage will most likely be a lot faster to level, plus AoE gold farming.
---
Troll post btw
---
If you got a penny for every shitty meme shoehorned into this video you'd have like, a full dime.
---
Have you done that at level 40 in Vanilla? No? Ok then. This hunter was required to aspect weave around her boulder to avoid daze. She would have caught him otherwise. She very rarely casts her AoE if nobody’s in melee range, and will absolutely catch you at base movespeed. I don’t care what you’ve done in later expansions, this is Vanilla Warcraft.
---
oof, I don't know about that.   
---
the interest in vanilla wow is a clear signal to the mmorpg developers that the way the genre has evolved over the years isn't for the better
---
If I don't have it, I'm needing, as should everyone else if they also don't have it.
---
No doubt, but his plan only succeeded because Arthas played right into it, Uther warned him about the path he was heading down even. Ner'zhul wouldn't have done squat if Arthas had stayed true to the light.
---
Do remember there's a civil war going on at this time period between Crowley and Greymane. Could easily see Crowley joining the Horde.
---
Dwarves look sick in plate.
---
only verified neckbeards can do that
---
tbh. Just go full meme and tank dungeons as you level. 
---
Threat isn't a problem. But you're gonna be really squishy.
---
Dude go to a bar, get laid, rinse repeat
---
rofl.
---
Look at what you say.  
---
You literally think that an animation with slide walking is correct and game changing and that the WoW Devs used their time wisely by breaking it again.
---
It's an animation. Not a game changing feature like the automatic group finder.
---
I get that the smooth movement might feel more like sneaking around while making no sound, but in reality both animations are wrong or you're simply moving too fast.
---
According to the bug spreadsheet on the subreddit, iz has been fixed :)
---
It's definitely a grind but not impossible. There are only two mobs it drops off so you will probably have to do a bunch of LBRS runs. The pattern itself is not BOP so you can get from AH but it sells for a lot when it is there.
---
I think youre thinking of elemental fire
---
Playing a gnome is like having another item with a lot of intellect on it. It’s objectively better than human, but you don’t have to play it...
---
5%
---
Ya I don't really like BC. I feel like there is something wrong with it but I can't quite explain what it is. Maybe it just feels so out of place now.
---
Sigh
---
Game night!?! Game night?!? In college game night should be strip poker with the girl you picked up in the bar...jesus kids today
---
We had some...stubborn characters in high positions within our guild. The rogue class lead took the Onyxia trinket over the necklace because he had dreams of building a mace based defense rogue. We had a Paladin who insisted on offtanking. 
---
Binding dropped from Garr.  We were DKP based,  you messaged the loot master if you wanted the item, whoever of that group had the highest DKP set the bar and anyone else who wanted it and was within 10% of that DKP was also allowed to roll. 
---
Everyone kinda assumed it would be between the warriors and the rogues. I was a rogue and had the highest DKP in that group but my other rogue buddy was close...I was always assassination (cared more about PvP anyway) and he was a combat guy so I was just gonna let him have it. Our guild leader was a hunter...you can probably tell where this is going. He pipes up in Vent that he's going to roll for it which results in a big argument during which the class lead Paladin (who almost everyone hated) says "It says right on there that it's for Hunters, Paladins, Rogues and Warriors"...defending the guild lead but also his way of saying he's rolling for it to. My rogue buddy wasn't in the range to roll with these guys and neither were any of the warriors. So I decided fuck it, might as well try to get it if that's the case.
---
Suffice to say I didn't, the paladin got it. A large group of us ended up splitting off and forming another guild that night, leaving behind most of the leadership from that guild + the other deadweight. That guild became the laughing stock of the server for a while. They basically never progressed beyond MC and I believe the Paladin paid some other guild to help him complete Thunderfury.
---
This is kind of an oddball request, but do you think you could make a fresh character and then try to gain experience points for exploring places in The Barrens like Thorn Hill or one of the farms or even Crossroads? 
---
I did this on the stress test and I don't think I got exp for it... it was kind of a blur, but I remember saying to myself, "huh... I thought I would get exp for exploring that." Less legal versions of this game have all exploration giving experience points, but I'm not sure if the Beta does. Could you please confirm?
---
Trying to plan some day 1 exploration routes.
---
not a dude, and dont care about sex.
---
&gt; Why not?
---
Mainly because the max speed is around 45mph and I have to take a 65mph freeway to get to work.
---
&gt; Parts are readily available. Its a straightforward mechanism that nearly anyone can work on. The first gear clutch system is a little weird as is the spark retard but nothing that someone can't get used to working properly. They're fun little things.
---
I'd love to get my hands on one, but they're also cost-prohibitive now that they're a collectors item.
---
This is like the single most classic guild drama out of Vanilla/TBC era haha. I started playing the day Vanilla launched and by the time I was 55 (played pretty hardcore as a 15-16 year old so it was pretty quick) I got invited to my main raiding guild (#2 on server) which I stayed with through most of Naxx. Well, in Naxx we had some classic loot drama/council nepotism (I forget the exact situation) but I remember getting mad at a council member for something and gquitting. Joined the #1 guild instantly with almost no application process lol.
---
Nice! What server did you play on? I have a hunch it's Maiev because your guild name looks familiar to me, but that server wasnt out until 06 i believe
---
I played alongside my older brother. We were on US-Dark Iron for our alliance characters (our mains were Horde on Kel'Thuzad). Dark Iron, for whatever reason, was home to all these guilds based around various popular webcomics, especially Penny Arcade. There was a coalition of Alliancd guilds called the Penny Arcade Alliance. They were a bunch of weird fuckers. But, my brother and I were in one of their guilds. I was pretty young, so I mainly just leveled (very) slowly and didnt talk. My brother was in college, and also better at the game, so he was 60. 
---
Now, he didn't like the PAA very much. One day, he is pretty stoned and he logs into Vent, and starts telling his guildies how he is in some "shitty comic guild" and how much of a "lameass fuck-around" it is.  He receives only silence, followed by a quick boot/ban from the Vent server.
---
Does a doubletake, realizes he was in the PAA vent, not his Horde guild's vent. So sad, too bad, logs onto his shaman and goes about his business.
---
Next day, I log on. I do not know any of this has happened. I do notice my brothers character is no longer in the guild.I ask why. They ask me why I care. "Well, he's my brother irl."
---
Instant /gkick, with the classy /w "fuck u faggot" from an officer. I am confused, as I am so young, I am not quite sure what faggot means. I look it up in our dictionary, for I am studious. Am further confused: how am I a bundle of wood?
---
I later try to get a dungeon group. I get kicked from it. This happens several times. Turns out I am blacklisted from all the PAA guilds. Which was 90% of the Alliance players on the server apparently.
---
What a lame-ass fuckaround.
---
I log onto my shaman.
---
wow, what a stew of hot, wierd and depressing all in one short story.
---
neat!
---
Formatted to where you literally can’t read one thing.
---
I'll put it this way; If you EVER want to level a warrior at any point in time, having someone who can heal is generally a good idea. Solo leveling a warrior is painful.  Any combo, is a good combo for PvE. Leveling is 100x better and mostly faster(you still have to get just as many quest items x2) for both of you. Most importantly, play what feels most appealing and own it.
---
Oh, does it automatically ban someone after enough reports?
---
Underhumped asocial A wants to hump spiritual doormat B. He looks for opportunities to undermine other males to prove his masculinity while she doesn't know what to do and tries to find a surrogate parent in the guild because decision making and taking responsibility isn't her thing. Underhumped asocial A considers surrogate parent a threat and writes hate-mail, trying to pose as three different people that all make the same orthographic mistakes for some reason. When confronted he runs away and the guild learns he was paying the sub for slouchy hedonist C, the guild leader, who dissolves the guild.

Funny you should mention that, I saw an interview a couple of months back with a professor from a top U.S university doing research on how AI (Alexa was the case they used) may be affecting things like our patience and ability to accept no for an answer. I can't remember the specifics of their findings but it was an interesting listen nonetheless and one of the things they were noticing was that there might have been a link between it's useage and how good children were at general social interactions. None of it was conclusive at that point whatsoever but I would not be surprised if they came out in 9 months or whatever and said yeah this is what we're finding.
---
Hope you are ok my man there are many active users playing wow it's surprising the number. If you need help an ear is here
---
I dont think any of us actually play poker, and us girls arent exactly going to strip down in front of our male friends. Plus we dont drink while playing anyway
---
It's 5% intellect. This 5% scales with gear that increases your +int as well. IDK the exact numbers in full Naxx BiS gear, but it doesn't really matter - if your goal is to min/max for PVE then Gnome is the best choice. They get more Int, a bonus to engineering (so higher pet levels when you make battle chickens / arcanite dragons,) and escape artist. Honestly they're best for PVP too.  The only edge humans have from a caster perspective is diplomacy - and that's if you have limited time and want to grind out rep easier.
---
On retail you would go up to it and it would just dissapear
---
Wait for someone to roll need then roll need. If everyone hits greed I hit greed. If 2 people hit greed before anybody hits need just ups my chances of winning without me being the asshole.
---
On the other hand, I would tell my tanks to take their ass through UBRS and come back with the bare minimum of their pre-bis before they get to demand things.
---
Nothing. Someone saw 30 people in Ironforge on the beta and this community made a chicken out of a feather.
---
Mmm if they have a bunch of quest for a dungeon and can clear bosses efficiently it probably is ok.
---
I thought i was, but not anymore. Can't confirm this with source
---
WoW is a Theme Park MMO period, it is NOT a sandbox MMO in the slightest.
---
i am using dude as in "wtf is wrong with you"...male or female take my advice
---
MN doesn’t go over his macros really, he doesn’t have much intent to be an educational stream, he’s just gaming and people tune in kind of a thing. I actually really enjoy the style even if I do want to figure out the macros behind a lot of his binds lol.
---
Any level 60 who doesn't have engineering is bad at this game...
---
For me it's also about the unrepeatable experience of walking into the capital cities for the first time and seeing them brimming with activity.
---
Classic is going to be a lot of people's first experience with WoW. And many who have left the game have done so because they miss feeling like you're actually in a living breathing world with other players. 
---
If layering is done really well, and starting zones are still pretty packed, and cities are as well, then that's fine. But from what I've seen of the beta in a lot of instances, and what I've experienced myself in the stress tests, is that layering can be far far too aggressive and can lead to empty feeling zones and cities.
---
Hmm.  There were a few...
---
&gt; First guild had lots of loot drama.  
---
* First was one female player who was "in" with an officer.  Got preferential treatment, but ended up sleeping around with a few members of the guild over various areas of the country.
---
* Second drama, basically the guild leader had all his friends as officers.  Loot pretty much went exclusively to them on all the early kills.  Pretty much led to an exodus and we poached a lot of the better members and started our own guild, who ended up becoming more successful than the old guild.  Eventually after this, the guild had broken apart and stopped raiding.
---
&gt; In the new guild though... more drama. 
---
* Started the new guild so we were recruiting.  We were alliance, but there was a horde Shaman (or Warrior, can't remember exactly) that nobody wanted to take in their raid guild.  We told him that if he rolled a Dwarf priest, he could be in the guild.  He deleted his level 60 horde character (PvP server) and re-rolled dwarf.
---
* One female member and male member were in an e-relationship.  Things didn't work out with her and the warlock, so she moved on to a rogue in the guild.  They eventually ended up moving in with each other.  The relationship ended when she cheated on him with a fellow Wal-Mart employee.
---
You understand that this is a beta right?
---
The whole point is to bring up faults, bugs, exploits, and issues.
---
That is HOW they are fixing these issues, because people report the issues.
---
Wow. The GM stealing my guild bank and zerver xferring has NOTHING on this
---
For some reason it links to a poorly zoomable image on imgur, if you copy the actual link and paste it in a browser you can fully zoom in and read it
---
You did 4-5 full clears of BWL a week?
---
305 actually lowers it to 6%. Under 305 and it’s 9% (even though you will only ever miss 8% of specials).
---
The video was edited to remove the deadleg spin footage, that’s all. It wasn’t within a few minutes, it was almost twelve hours after posting. I don’t think checking bug status before posting that sort of video is too much to ask for. 
---
Many are presenting the beta as some buggy mess, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I just don’t want people to feel down on the game they’ve been looking forward to for so long. It’s almost here, and it’ll be so much fun.
---
I thought in vanilla ony had a 7 day reset as well?
---
I'm sure it was lower, but not by a ton. I remember the real problem tbc prot paladins had was with reaching the uncrushable cap. Holy shield would bring you up there, but I believe it lasted 10 seconds, on a 10 second cooldown, so with any latency at all there was downtime, so there was always a chance a boss could hit you for a crushing blow.
---
That's just how the game used to work, yo.
---
I remember that distinctly in Wrath. Looting worked the same in the stress test as I remember it working in Wrath.
---
It was buggy, weird, inconsistent, and had little feedback. But that was how it was, and it reaaaally isn't that bad lol.
---
you're gonna have a bad time
---
I doubt we will, we are social creatures, we will always want groups. Fortunately I think it's more and more common for people to see a sports team or brand or video game faction as their tribe instead of ethnicity or idealogy.
---
Fred, Phil, Karen, Chad, and Jeff
---
If you're quick enough you can get Legolas
---
Blacksmithing is pretty bad for most people.  You only really need two per guild (weaponsmith and armorsmith)
---
To get many of the important recipes it will cost you a fortune to buy the rep items.
---
I’d press Need even if I already had my epic mount.  It’s one of the coolest and rarest mounts in the game.
---
For my main it is going to be the same name only spelled differently, as an homage. For my alt, which will be a druid, I’m gonna use a name that sounds similar but it’s not exactly the same.
---
Downvoted like the rest
---
Yeah. Nice to hear.
---
Right now?
---
Trying not to wig out, because my work contract ends Friday, my manager is out all week, and my contracting manager is asking me for an update.
---
At least I subbed for six months in advance!
---
your advice isnt even relevant to my post or comment though
---
Maybe it's intended to work differently, but so far that's the result of how it's been implemented so far.
---
Hunters too tbh
---
You are like a poster child for having a shitty time
---
Tbf, while retail isn't in a good spot, it's not like it can't be saved.
---
Blizzard has shown, and even proven in the past, that they can make genuinely good design decisions and implement them.
---
Probably the most frustrating part for me about retail; Blizzard can absolutely fix this, but either they don't have the desire, or they don't realize many of the fixes are things they implemented previously and then promptly abandoned.
---
It worked that way at least until Wrath.
---
I remember this shit CLEARLY cause I had to learn how to loot to get actually get my fucking loot consistently and even then it wasn't 100%.
---
You do you man, but most people choose ret to level for a reason. Around 40 or 50 you get all the stuff you need to AOE grind a bit, but it doesn't make much sense before that.
---
Absolutely disgusting.
---
You should watch Preach Gaming's Drama Time videos.
---
Your old friend trying to get his old name: "Damn it."
---
I completely agree, except that baiting on a fresh server is less likely to happen. Maybe after a couple of weeks...
---
Also, I don't consider south of Rathet as "Barrens" territory... when I read "Barrens" I'm thinking the oasis, more central areas and the oases.
---
I have 3. I think they're hilarious. They're all puns.
---
Lootcouncil because I trust the people I'm playing with oddly enough.
---
Sad but common unfortunately. A lot of guild leader/MTs were older (for vanilla time standards so 20-30's or even 40's) and had lots of responsibilities. My guild leader was our MT for awhile but eventually he ended up only logging in like once a week or two. Same case for my other vanilla guild, Ascent. They had a GM/MT during their world first Rag kill (Ascent Medivh server horde side) who got interviewed by Time magazine when WoW was blowing up. By the time I joined them during Naxx he wasn't playing much anymore.
---
Which is why that doesn't work on beta, and the devs said it shouldn't work....  ROFL!!!
---
Do you have the Boris Dwarf pally grand marshal vid saved by chance?
---
Nah bruh, what was disgusting was the night BRE dropped and I got it ;)
---
The difference that you missed is that modern cars aren't failing. BfA is. If modern cars as a whole were failing, then there would be value in going back to basics (assuming that cars weren't being phased out because people no longer need cars).
---
This analogy isn't fallacious. You're just a moron.
---
Hunter is a problem for everyone in wpvp especially leveling- the pet can solo you
---
Well you’re looking at either loading up on clothies so you don’t have to roll against someone for melee DPS gear, or taking some melee types who are going to want to roll on that hit/crit stuff you’re looking for.
---
You actually had to kill over a million so you could level up to kill a really op guy who was killing everyone
---
Mages and locks should roll gnomes for the + int
---
Priests should be dwarves
---
You can roll a human pally if you want ;)
---
I guess this is only anecdotal, but 2 high-pop TBC projects come to mind; Feenix Archangel and Gummy. 
---
Feenix was in the earlier days of the scene, Nost hadn’t raised the bar yet, tons of bugs, but still filled to the brim. Gummy had the Nost of TBC servers, but he shut it all down on a whim (twice).
---
Not to mention the long awaited and ultimately doomed Corecraft. Still lingering in the back of the TBC-lovers mind.
---
I think one of the reasons we see so many populated Vanilla and WotLK realms is because TBC is just stuck in between the two. It’s not hardcore enough for the Vanilla crowd, not casual enough for the WotLK crowd. And the people who specifically love TBC will probably be happy on either of the other 2 servers, but not necessarily the other way around. Couple that with an expansion that is somewhat “cursed” within the private server scene, we’re left with the 2 ends of the spectrum (Vanilla and WotLK) without what comes between the two.
---
You’ll need at least one Steve.
---
probably the best herbalism zone in the game imo
---
I don't like social situations, I barely drink (and when I do its never been to the point of getting drunk), and even if I somehow got dragged to a bar I wouldnt fuck some dude I just met. Different people like different things, and I prefer to stay inside and play games or read. Nothing wrong with that
---
Worst problems for priest are poly and viper sting
---
^I'm ^not ^a ^R ^tard...
---
I main‘d Druid and used macros, but never knew about the mouse over &amp; the modifier macros. Nice, thanks! :)
---
I mean, assuming that they put as little money into servers, architecture, and development as they possibly can isn't a really crazy assumption.
---
And that's what the person your responding to is basically saying.
---
&gt; opinion ion 
---
This made me chuckle for some reason lol.
---
I realize why layering is needed. But it needs to be implemented differently than what I've currently seen to be worth it. I'd personally rather not to be able to log in for a week than walk into an empty capital city on launch day.
---
&gt; We were speechless our RL didn't have it on ML
---
I bet checking for ML became part of the pre-raid check after that.
---
Steve can replace Chad
---
Chad is actually super overrated and hard to get along with
---
Ya I dunno. I haven't played since the first weeks of WoD. At this point I hope they don't put classic stuff into BFA or the other way around. They should treat them as different games and seperate the fan base as much as possible imo.
---
Wouldn't night elves get + bow?
---
You'd have a riot at launch when people aren't able to sheep each other at the same time.
---
That's cool - most of the guilds I've been in used Loot council. The last one I played with on retail did it fairly and with the benefit of the guild in mind - many of the guilds I was in didn't take that approach.
---
Nothing. I want them to do nothing to Classic after all phases. 
---
Release new servers from time to time.
---
What they should do, is learn from Classic and make retail worth playing again.
---
Why is that what benefits are there to faction locked classes?
---

---
Don't forget to grab 2 rogues.
---
Level ret, Respec at 60... Duh
---
one of you being a warrior will make it easy for you guys to find groups. warrior is my favourite class so i would recommend having that in your duo for sure. the 2nd class is really up to whatever else you guys wanna have fun with. having a priest (or druid) would make your grouping ability for dungeons even better, that\`s for sure.
---
i think all starting zones are gonna be packed. pick whatever zone you enjoy being in. my personal favourite zone is mulgore and i would walk my non tauren chars all the way there when i made alts.
---
&gt;  The final crux of all this is my goal is to get Sulfurus Hand of Rag,  
---
this is a very very hard feat to achieve. the drop rate was ridiculously low and mats were expensive. i would not base your wow career on this item lol. i found BWL and AQ40 weapons were more prevalent than that item.
---
I scrolled through like the first 20 top level comments on this post and they're literally all just filled with praise for Blizzard.
---
You know what they say about people who say drama and negativity follows them around, right?
---
Your math is off. Hit cap is 9% when under 305 weapon skill as it negates 1% hit from talents/gear. So at 305 skill cap is 8% which doesn’t include the hit gained from the 5 weapon skill which is 2%. So at 305 skill you only need 6% hit from talents and gear.
---
That's the thing about TBC. It doesn't have dedicated fans.
---
I’m having a hard time figuring that out, specifically. I’m either gonna main Tauren bear tank and main alt NE Hunter or vice versa.
---
The guild of all rogues, with the token hunter?
---
Hope you’ve got a 5ghz cpu as it’s running on one core.
---
Each system has their pros and cons. There is no perfect system.  
---
If you're in a guild or thinking of making one, there's a good amount of resources, wikis and youtube, where each system is explained. It really depends on you.
---
Free for all, may the fastest rogue steal all the loots
---
Thorns and fire shield don’t stack, but the rest of this is A+
---
Keep in mind that while you're leveling, most of your gear is between 5-15 levels behind, and that things like Wool Cloth and Medium Leather go much higher than level 20.
---
Good for leveling...
---
Not viable for end game raiding.  Their dps is terrible.  If you are lucky you can find a guild who needs another shaman for windfury but already has too many healers.  Then they will make you the nightfall bitch. This won't be easy to find
---
just out of interest, is it because you don't want any changes, or that this isn't the kind of content you'd want?
---
I’ve definitely gotten exploration XP, but I don’t know about the specific spots you mention. I’ll check for you once I’m home, it’ll only be a few minutes.
---
That's almost definitely due to them wanting to do business in China.
---
If you want to do business in China, you have to self censor stuff like that.
---
Do what we do best: Find the one bug they _haven’t_ fixed yet and use that to prove Blizzard hates my class/race/faction/profession
---
Is there though. Its not like Google is something new?
---
Why are they worth again?
---
I forgot precisely how it works but I remember concluding it enables abuse  when reading about it back when there was a lot of discussion about it. There is plenty of info here and on Youtube if you want to check it out.
---
 It's constantly filled with posts full of incels insulting pretty much any woman on twitch, and people spamming/upvoting edgy streamers like Trainwrecks, Asmongold, xQc etc. And before they banned him it was basically just all Iceposeidon clips. 
---
I don't really go in the comment sections anymore, I just check the front page occasionally to see if anything funny actually gets posted. But I still just see a bunch of drama posts with the same absurdly immature streamers. Just quickly scanning it right now, it still seems pretty much the same.
---
It's not like retail where you just pick the spec you are going to play at max level, and level as that spec to get used to it. Most classes in vanilla/classic have basically one leveling spec, and anything else is so much slower its genuinely not worth it.
---
I can't say this enough.  They should lower the maximum cost of respecs down to about 5g-10g.
---
This will allow people to raid properly but also enjoy the non viable specs like enchancement shaman
---
Healing in classic is amazing.  Mana management requires a lot more foresight than today, and there are a lot of skills you manage in Classic that you don't manage today (like waiting to heal for threat, maximizing spirit regen and abusing the 5SR, limiting overhealing).  
---
The best part is that unlike Live, people will thank you for good healing after a run.
---
Basically like FFXIV lol
---
Stay awhile and listen...
---
It really don't matter much tbh. 2 casters 1 rogue/hunter dps and a warrior, and add any healer.
---
They're supposed to be how they were on 1.12 of Vanilla...
---
Both can be good, both can be abused.
---
DKP with a monthly Tax/Decay. Legendarys are Loot Council made up of class leads and raid lead.
---
I've considered it. But until I see that actually happening more, I have no reason to just sit back and believe that'll be the case.
---
Take that rendering back to 100. You’re basically running the game at 2 times the resolution.
---
maybe it's cus its in space with energy domes, giant mushroom forests and blue and green aliens
---
it's sci-fi in a fantasy game
---
Why not /roll on something instead of DE if nobody wants to spend DKP on a small upgrade?
---
Not planning on raiding in Classic, but back when I did raid my favorite loot system was any sort of point-based system (EPGP I think is what we used), but bolstered by loot council oversight for particularly important pieces.
---
It offers the stability and fairness of point systems in most cases while also allowing for intelligent distribution of key pieces (legendaries) as long as everyone is on the same page and trusts guild leadership.
---
99% all drama is either loot drama or a girl.
---
That's what I mean. I get the whole #nochanges thing but this is unique in it was literally just a workaround for the state of networks in 2005, not an actual game mechanic.
---
The odd mage thrown in as an alt but yeah all top tier rogues, and I cant fucking wait to get mine back
---
You clearly have no fucking idea what you're talking about.
---
Private servers use game cores that had been developing for quite some time. Some of the cores are partially open sourced which means several different pserver teams could make changes/fixes to the core.
---
&gt;What minor stuff are you talking about, there are major game breaking bugs all over the place and people havent even stepped into high level content.
---
For example, I can tell you for sure that these hunter bugs were minor in a grand scheme of things. Is it game breaking ? No, you can play your game. Is it global ? No, it influences only one class and not always. 
---
Is it really so hard to comprehend that there are much more important things to develop/fix than bugs like that ? Or do you really believe that Blizzard won't fix things like that intentionally ?
---
It was, it's just that it was working as expected lol.
---
Leeway compensates for bad latency, people had HORRIBLE latency in 2004. Now with 50ms latency we see how bad it actually is, but it may have just always been like that.
---
Your raid dps is higher when you use a real dps class over the shaman with better totems.
---
https://i.redd.it/y4guulluh2f11.png
---
Google exists, but when I google for wow information, this is the kind of result I am hoping it returns.
---
Also, frankly, google is not very good for wow, in my opinion, because there are so man false positive results for other versions of the game. It's much easier to find wow vanilla/classic info when it's consolidated in a single location, such as a forum like reddit or classicwowlive.
---
I wouldn't mind TBC or Wrath servers, but leave the Classic servers capped at 60.  As to new content: more world bosses would be neat or maybe taking a page from retail and adding different difficulties/ challenges to dungeons that can be unlocked. Randomized boss encounters with different mechanics. New battlegrounds, new dungeons. I'd love more 10 man raids. All of this should come with new attunements, and epic quest chains. Im sure there's room for profession tweaks to add more content or progression there.
---
You will also have a huge lack of access to trainers.
---
Enhancement shaman = dead weight.
---
Why bring one over someone who could help the raid?
---
Didn't that lore only become written shortly before Cata? If we only look at the lore that existed during vanilla then Gilneas could go in any number of directions.
---

---
It's network compensation... Has nothing to do with hardware and software it's about your computer communicating with their server, and how long that takes.
---
As such you need a bit of leeway cause sending those messages takes time. But the amount of time it takes has plummeted since 2005, so we're seeing lag compensation mechanics meant for 2005 internet on 2019 internet.
---
He said multiple times on stream that while the choice is not so obvious and depends mostly on preference, he personally rates escape artist higher than stone form.
---
People organize pugs on private servers so Classic should not be different.
---
While I love this design, it doesn’t capture the city itself. Very cool picture though!
---
I would expect there to me some raids with 5-10 pug players in them before guilds get an established 40 man core of raiders
---
Yeah there should be a few pugs later in when people have alts leveled.
---
I know you'll get downvoted to oblivion, and so will I, but this is actually one of my favourite discussions. I would love for them to carry on classic into a new expansion, but learn from their mistakes.
---
1) No flying, ever, anywhere. As soon as players are in the air they are immediately 'safe', and safety should be a rare gift in the world of warcraft.
---
2) No exponential jumps in stats from one expansion to the other. In my opinion this is what broke wow. Having raid gear at the end of one expansion with +10 STR on it to having quest gear the starting zone for the next expansion with +15 STR leads to a race that can never be won. How many times will they stat squish before they get it? Linear progression please.
---
3) No power creep in terms of story. They're always raising the stakes to the point where I stop caring. At the end of legion I'm super guru commander of everything, right? Where do I go from there? Why does it matter any more?
---
4) No catchup mechanics. Every part of the game should be important, no matter when you're joining.
---
5) Just because you're releasing an expansion doesn't mean you have to jump up 10 levels. How about releasing a new continent/world that has lower level stuff in it to? So when we all level a new character we get some new content as we level? Lots of MMO RPGs do this.
---
I 100% expect there to be pugs of MC, Ony, ZG, and AQ20.  Maybe some BWL, but I suspect pugs might start to struggle there.
---
As someone with no ambitions to raid, I hope I'm right, as that's the only way I'm going to see any of that content.  Worst case I'll organize some myself.
---
The t2.5 is straight up crazy... in certain scenarios. While chain heal is crazy good for both MC and BWL, it loses some power in AQ40 content.
---
The way you should look at the t2.5 set is that you should give the full set to a poorly geared shaman in your guild. That way they get a huge boost to their healing while not losing too much stats. If all your shamans are well geared, give the set to one shaman to use on certain bosses/trash where chain heal is king.
---
 Having t2.5 as a goal is just as you say, not good. But it helps the guild if you can get it on a few shamans.
---
You know you could actually be on to something there
---
How do they farm gold? The cap is 10g, beyond that are not looted.
---
They cant interact with other players, save for /wave. how will they trade the 10g?
---
Not really, I still did alright in school.  She could just tell it wasn't a healthy way to live and wanted me to not be a loser who gamed for 16 hours a day.
---
Fair enough. The guild drama thread got me thinking about loot systems, but I just noticed someone else asked this same question in a different thread earlier today. I can definitely do my own research, but I was curious about peoples' personal experiences with the different systems.
---
yeah im a little worried about this but at the same time i feel like if they see their old characters name they would send me a message and maybe we could reconnect
---
Brother Vehk I will see you on the battlefield one tapping level 11s in full whites. A man of honour and courage.
---
Shitload of bruiseweed in darkshore, which takes level 100.
---
I think that's because of the bad experiences with the system so far. I see why it's "needed," but the way its currently implemented which leads to dead capital cities and empty zones if the game decides to put you in a layer with few other players around you is not acceptable.
---
I think there are different aspects of each version of wow they could "tap" so to speak.
---
I do see what you're saying though. Vanilla wow very different from basically every other iteration of the game. I'm not sure there's anything in BFA I'd want in classic either.
---
I'd think it's also a mechanic for people playing with 5 frames per second, but otherwise you explained it better than me. Leeway is archaic and unnecessary.
---
These make me sad because they're not real and likely never will be.
---
I understand your frustrations. Developers have missed features and deadlines in the past. Sometimes features are released that underwhelm. Classic, though, is already completed. The fixes being put in place need to be worked through the process, and that can just take a few weeks. It’s sometimes difficult to communicate those changes internally let alone the public. Your frustrations are not misplaced.
---
Source: software stuff and things.
---
&gt; players aren't lazy, they actually type a name in party chat saying : "Inv xxLegolasxx".
---
Lol, the thing about this is that it literally doesn't work in BFA if they're cross-realm. That's why suggest invite is a thing. You also can't mute people cross realm, which is just wonderful.
---
The last person I'd want in my group is a [Karen](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=karen).
---
Nah, that's the red one from PvP, but I'll play a warlock so I have the best mount in the game anyway the Dreadsteed of Xoroth is better than even the Black Qiraji Battle Tank, although the Qiraji is a better afk mount.
---
Yes. a clear would take 4-5 hours. This was while we waited for AQ40 to open.
---
YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!
---
Alright, I've played vanilla for long enough to have an opinion, I'm going to itterate on what I said in a reply in here, let's go abit deeper in this "Fantastic guide" which clearly screams private server bias. (Which is a bad thing for a LOT of reasons, which I will name a few.)
---
I apologize to anyone that finds this insulting or finds me rude, but I will have to say something when people try and decieve people and use misguided and misinformed information and spread it out through "guides" like some youtubers have done. (I wont say any names.)
---
I will promptly delete this if people find this as thusly.
---
So beyond that, let's continue.
---
**Disclaimer: This will be a very long post, I will not post a TLDR, Be warned. (I might have to devide it later.)**
---
**Smaller Disclaimer: I've played classic wow since 2004 beta on EU, I'm not by any means a bad player at this game, I've dabbled in private servers just like anyone else, so I know most if not all the things that are wrong in comparison to the real thing, I have really good memory, so take it as you will.**
---
------------------
---
#Private Server Bias.
---
So before we start digging through the actual post, let me say a few things about private server economy "meta" and overpopulated servers and what it means.
---
+ 1: The overpopulation of servers, the size of 5X the original size at some points, maxing out at 12k people in a single server at the same time, this means dynamic respawns (That are implemented for this very reason) Will be all over the place, black lotus spawning every few minutes instead of hours, veins and herbs spawning at a rate of 5X the time, herbs and veins spawning seemlessly almost inside of eachother, the private servers dont have a "cap" for a given cave or mine, so you would see a pile of 20 nodes inside a cave, In a real server there are limits to the amount of nodes per location, for example the mines near goldshire has a max of 3-4 veins at a given time.
---
This make the saturation of the market almost nonexistant and the AH stores are overflowing with cheap (Or hyper expensive) items, because of monopoli of goods. (Such as black lotus gangs and devilsaur mafia.)
---
For a regular player, this doesn't bode well and that's all I can say, the guide assumes private server values, half the stuff in the guide cannot even be sold at a decent price and stuff like gravemoss and other lategame ingredients wont apply until atleast naxx. (Shadow prot potions are used in naxx at the earliest, or some bosses in AQ 40)
---
More details on this later as I breakdown the guide abit.
---
+ 2: The private server knowledge and bias: Seeing as the guide uses private server videos in the video guides section, I really doubt this can be avoided to say, this guide is probably done by someone that has extensively played on private server and I would really question wether or not classicwow.live actually thought this through at all.
---
You cant put a private server person with bias to make a guide were half of it doesn't even work in the first place, or its so devided that people wont remember this entire thing once something like naxx comes out in 2 years time, the guide should've focused more on the early phases and not be such a late-game thing.
---
Someone else will have done another guide by then I'm sure but this sort of thing to me just seems straightup atrocious.
---
Alright enough about that, I will now break down each individual thing about this "guide" that's private server biased and I will try and keep as much information as possible.
---
That's fine, I wouldn't think less of anyone for thinking that way. I just personally am okay with letting someone have a BoE if they plan to actually use it, unless they're kind of a dickhead, then I might fallback to your line of thinking lol.
---
"The lack of transparency from Blizzard is worrisome"
---
Lmfao...its like they dont understand what a Beta is for
---
-----------------------
---
#Guide Item Breakdown
---
This will be the longest section, I might have to reply twice, we'll see how reddit likes it, but anyway, lets go. (I will go from top to bottom, so just cross reference with the guide at your leisure)
---
1: Red whelps/Dreaming whelps/Searing whelps: You dont farm the whelps for the pet, you farm them for the easy XP and the small flame sacs for the recipes that use them, the drop chance for a pet is something under 0.5%, you could kill 3000 of them and still have nothing, to say that this is a "gold farm" and hinting at the pet, is not a good choice, should've focused on the actual ingredients instead.
---
2: Elemental protection potions early game wont sell, this is a private server phenomenon, the bosses are about 50% harder then they should be on private servers, they hit harder and have a lot more armor and other resistances, they're overtuned, on the real classic stuff like this in something like molten core isn't going to do anything, its going to be too easy so people wont buy it, and if they're struggling, the potions wont help regardless.
---
3: Elemental earth: Again, focusing only on the protection potions when these sort of thing can be used for a lot more thing, people wont know until you actually tell them so this guide doesn't help anyone, it also hints at "until AQ 40" which is a long-ass time from when you want to be making your gold.
---
Elemental earth can also be used for these things.
---
Elemental Grinding Stone: x2
---
Greater Nature Protection Potion: x1
---
Field Repair Bot: x2
---
Restorative Potion: x1
---
Maybe should've included that, resto pots are actually good PvP consume for hardcore climbers in phase 3. (Which is a lot sooner then AQ 40.)
---
4: Elemental Water: Again with the protection potions, you wont be using these until naxx, good luck making gold with it when you have to literally wait almost 1.5 years, should've touched on another method instead, but it seems like the guide likes to spew out common sense things, that everybody should know, just to make it longer and seem important for gold making.
---
5: Golden pearls, States to farm the hatecrest near feathermoon stronghold, the hatecrests have disarm, silence, DoT's and healing, the guide doesn't mention this at all, the screechers are atrocious to farm as a caster, and the warriors and whatnot have disarm and nets and melees hate them, teh guide never mentions what class you should be farming this as, warlock &amp; hunters are the only ones that should be farming this, because of the pet.
---
You're better of farming the pearls at 60 near the azhara temple in north east azhara shoreline, killing the makrura and murlocs inside and outside the temple, farming at 41-50 is a waste of time, since you lack gear and dmg.
---
6: Devilsaur leather: I dont know how contested these will be, but goodluck if you play on a PvP Server, this entire thing will be flooded to the brim, regardless of faction colution being against the ToS, people are still going to be attacking you normally instead, works if you play on a PvE server though, again the guide doesn't mention this, just puts a $$$$ which indicates a lot of cash, but for what its worth I doubt they will have the same prices as private servers, you wont be making a lot from this.
---
7: Lists a Mage AoE Farming guide, but in real classic its going to be a lot harder, aswell as the influx of players, you're not going to be able to do this reliably, the guide doesn't mention this at all, just gives you a sheet of locations, doesn't state PvE or PvP at all, on PvP you'll be spending most of your time in ghost form, a single rogue can ruin your entire day.
---
-----------
---
#Guide Video Breakdown:
---
Alright so again with the private server bias, I will make a few remarks on which of these videos are not going to be possible to do, the rest are fine as far as I know.
---
1: Dire maul tribute: in diremaul tribute runs (Which was not a thing in real classic.) the boss should be charging you, on private servers this is not the case, you will have to duo or trio to be able to do this, and even then if you duo you need atleast AQ40+ gear to be able to kill him fast enough and keep up with the healing, there is no way with molten core gear or BWL gear that you will be able to duo this guy down if he charges you, this is abit iffy, but I will stand by with this, It wont work, even if it works, you need phase 3+ gear, goodluck making gold before then.
---
2: Dire maul east lasher farm: Lasher farm is going to be a lot more annoying to do, since you cant do the /camp reset on real classic servers, you would have to invite someone, then leave the party and get teleported to the nearest graveyard, the nearest graveyard in diremaul is way outside the instance.
---
This results in a lot of wasted time and you could've been doing something else, like diremaul north: hyena/bug farm, which is a lot easier and you can simply walk out the instance when you're done and reset.
---
3: BRD Mage farm: the original mage farm by pulling the middle room is not going to work if they fixed the wardens to cast nets, it will be impossible unless you use a FAP, which is expensive, and even then 30 seconds is not enough for you to kill all of them unless you have really good gear.
---
Your best bet is to use the arena spectator farm if they dont include the elites that were put there in private servers to prevent farming, again iffy, we'll have to see.
---
4: incedius farm: I will just say that this looks like a very very time consuming farm, if you're a warlock, run dungeons and do orb runs instead, also involves a lot of RNG and other bullcrap that can go wrong, we dont know the aggro radius and whatnot for this, you'll save repair bills by not doing this, I dont recommend this at all to new warlock players, the guide doesn't mention the skill level requirement at all, except patience (It says none, but I dont believe it, also gear none, he's using some pre-raid BiS gear.)
---
5: diremaul east jump runs: If they fixed the scripting on flowers and whatnot this will not be a thing, or it will be too slow or gear dependant, the thing is once the boss is in combat for X amount of time, the mobs in the ring auto-aggro if you haven't killed them (Just like the last boss in SM:Cath) this was avoided by simply putting him out of line of sight with the mobs (Private server bug) in real classic this was not a thing, the flowers will be attacking you, you will have to clear the flowers, and you need really good gear to solo that shiet with a single dps warrior at the front. (Which again takes a lot of freakin time, and gold, the point is to make gold, not spend it on gear first.) again the guide doesn't even try to mention it, just simply puts a lot of $$$$ again.
---
6: LBRS boss runs: This requires atleast 3 people with pre-raid BiS gear, the guys in the clip have zul'gurub gear, which is phase 4 I believe, this is not going to work at all with regular gear I'm sure, and also the guide doesn't mention this at all as usual.
---
7: Zul'gurub farm: Again, you need gear to get this, you wont be doing this when zul'gurub comes out, no way,this guide seems to assume you'll be in phase 4+ already, which is just wrong.
---
8: then we have recipes and flasks and all that, you wont be getting raid recipes unless you're the main crafter in a raid guild, good luck on that I say, flasks are going to be rare (Let alone the recipes), black lotus spawn every 8-12 hours or so, trying to make money of it is like shoving coins down a well and wishing for good fortune, just wishful thinking.
---
Same with raid enchants, and other bull that this guide seems to want to shove down your throat, then mentions standard things like mining/skinning/herbalism.
---
AH sniping and bid low sell high and other AH shark methods, most people aren't AH goblins, you wont be in the first few months anyway when people dont have gold or want to spend it, they want epic mounts, this guide is littered with things like this, just wow.
---
-----------------
---
#Closing words:
---
That's all I have to say about this, I know it might seems abit rude or insulting to the guide maker, I hope he sees this and tries to correct the list abit and actually make a decent gold making guide that share some of the none-obvious things.
---
I've been playing this game for a very long time, and I hope to sink into it again once the classic launch hits, I will be using my own guides and methods that I've made for myself in notepads that I keep for myself. (I've shared it sometimes on reddit, it had some good vibes, check my posts if you'd like to find them.)
---
I wish you all the best and I hope I wont get blasted for this, but I want people to know the truth and to actually have a decent guide on the classicwow resource website.
---
I am unsure, I know on the privates they had her on a 5 day schedule. So it was hard. But this schedule is for the hard core pvper because a lot of us want to at least attempt to get HWL or higher pvp ranks and me being a main tank of the guild i will need all the time not tank specced as possible to do so. But i may just send it on the rogue instead.
---
People will (or should know) if a dungeon is worth it for them to run (read: if there's an item they're looking t drop). Therefore, if you're just tanking, does it really matter what "healer" class you take? Are you really going to tell a healer, "no man, this place doesn't drop anything good for priests?" and wait around until a shaman/pally healer joins your group?  
---
Also, there are other benefits to running instances other than drops...
---
I have never shared this story Ill avoid names, and server. But simple story short(ish):
---
GM and disabled wife ran the guild, 2 of their friends who were married also were major officers. Rumors begin to float around that GM is cheating on wife with the other woman, the wife of his friend. Well after many months of whispers. Turns out it's all true, GM leaves wife for the other woman, she left her husband to be with the GM. The kicker, THEY ALL LIVED TOGETHER, and still did for some time afterwards. 
---
This was in vanilla, and last I heard the first wife of the GM passed away due to medical issues relating to diabetes(which is why she didn't have all her legs iirc)
---
The one tip I will give to who these people are/were was both the GM and the other wife played Shamans
---
I guess I kind of talked myself to your side of the argument there. 
---
Personally, as a TBC fan, when there wasn’t a good TBC option, I’d just make due with Vanilla. But I think you’ll find that about a lot of TBC fans, they just make due with what they have access to. There may not be many of us, but i still believe TBC has its merits.
---
My pleasure! Hopefully you find us!
---
That's something you could do on a graphing calculator from 2002...
---
RPG
---
Thats complete bullshit... Id rather have no tank than a shitty tank and tons of repair bills.
---
The fear I have that I think other people are echoing is that layering might be pretty close to being as good as it's going to get for launch. Maybe there's a lot more they're going to do with it, maybe other things are taking up their time. We're kind of in the dark, and launch is approaching fast. The fear isn't totally unjustified.
---
Top kek
---
Gamers are so fucking entitled. This game owes you nothing.
---
Using that for a dwarf.
---
Hilariously I think this is actually so accurate that it seems bugged.
---
It's a mechanic to compensate for reaaaal shitty 2004 internet, but when you use it on 2019 internet it just doesn't work the same or look right.
---
No, but some systems are better than others. For instance epgp is arguably far fairer than old fashioned dkp
---
What is the best loot system to get TF on my hunter?
---
"Stop bitching and complaining about our bitching and complaining!"
---
I guess it all depends, right? 
---
A better question would be four slightly geared mages and a boomy or five bare minimum geared mages. If they’re all in pre raid BIS going into MC then take the fifth mage, but if the fifth mage and boomkin are both at barely-no raid gear going into bwl/The 20 mans.... wouldn’t you rather have the crit to boost your other mages and some utility for the rest of the team?
---
I prefer a Loot Council that announces who is getting what drops before you even step foot into the raid. Almost all of the drama happens because they don't bother assigning loot to players until it actually drops.
---
I'd still prefer Loot Council over DKP even without that though. You should trust the people you play with, but even beyond that the guilds gear progression is your gear progression.
---
I know that sounds super communist, but thats how I feel about raiding and gear. I should be excited when someone else gets geared because now we're stronger.
---
Yeah, def, lower frame rate significantly reduces your ability to react in a timely manner.
---
Yeah, It's almost like the current version is a ... Beta, You know?
---
Ty!
---
I've put approximately 20 seconds of thought into this and come up with this list:
---
Tank -- Warrior  
---
Healer -- Shaman  
---
DPS -- Rogue  
---
DPS -- Mage  
---
DPS -- Hunter
---
It's basically impossible to have a group with *no* overlap, but the above lists definitely minimizes it to an extent.  There might be some leather pieces that both the Rogue/Hunter want, but I think that's a pretty diverse crew overall.
---
I don't understand how this works?
---
So you're killing Razergore with how many raiders and how many alts?  The raiders HS out and leave the alts to finish Razergore, so only the alts can loot Razergore?
---
The raiders then zone into a new instance and clear 8/8 bosses?
---
Not sure how you're getting 4-5 full clears of BWL using that exploit
---
Druid Tank, Paladin Healer, mage, rogue, hunter.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5dz60/which_class_has_the_strongest_level_1/). 
---
Isnt this the plot of "Wedding Crashers?" Also good for you man!
---
We were doing a BC raid, I was a lowely DPS. We were fighting trash and I slurped into my mic. GM asked, are you drinking? I said that I was. He goes "how can you be playing with two hands then". I told him obviously I had to use one hand for a few seconds. He kicked me from the raid group. I was a heated 16 year old so I quit the guild. And 5 of my IRL friends left the raid and guild as well.
---
Play what you actually want to play, and don't pick based on what's playable on launch, it's only a couple of hours/days that it impacts you, race choice matters for years.
---
To save everyone 8:36 seconds, the argument for layering in this video is as follows: Most of the cons of layering can easily be solved by blizzard and if it is removed before end of phase 1, it wont be that disruptive to the classic experience.
---
Literally nothing new in this video.
---
Nah. OPs trying to tell a collective of people how to behave. Maybe he should go fuck himself instead. Not equivalent.
---
If it stays then RIP leveling warrior
---
Mostly a bunch of mobs that magically disappeared from one patch to another, some roaming, some stationary as well as NPC strength as they were continuously neutered throughout the lifespan of vanilla.  
---
Can't give specifics, don't have the cold, hard list of changes, but that was mostly it.
---
Did you run into issues where players wouldn't bid on items that were upgrades because they were all saving up for the "better upgrade" on the next boss, and loot that was an upgrade basically went to waste?
---
You cant hear images...
---
Me: (CLANK CLANK CLANK)
---
&gt; Cry as much as possible so they fix as much as possible
---
You think they're making changes because you're crying about them? They aren't reading this sub and going "Oh fuck this dude said we need to fix this thing, better get on it!" They're going through the bug reports and working out what needs to be done. The only people you're affecting by constantly screeching about issues THEY LIKELY ALREADY KNOW ABOUT are other posters. File a bug report. That's the only helpful thing you can do.
---
^ Fucking this!               
---
What always makes super nostalgic for Ironforge? Why it is all the giant blue splat every where! -No one
---
Will there really be a short supply of tanks? Warrior is probably the most popular class I would assume. Though I guess since you level slower as a warrior there could be a situation of rushers hitting 50+ and finding that there is a shortage of tanks to do dungeons with. Would be a fixed with time though.
---
Rank 10 as my Druid.  I regularly ran Battlegrounds with great groups but never focused enough for a long enough stretch to get past rank 8.  I always wanted the full Champion set...

About me:
---
Hey guys I have a full time job, I have a fiance &amp; I am going to be a dad on the 24th of October so that's going to be crazy. I played bc when I was a kid but only got to about level 30 due to my parents not having enough money to afford the sub. I tried a private server at the time but wasnt the same. I played a bit of legion and I've played bfa can't say I enjoyed them that much.
---
If I'm going to be honest I'm not the best player out there obviously due to not playing it for years but I've been a gamer since I was a kid, I know when I do something wrong and try to fix it, i can take criticism and I like to think I actually have a brain.
---
What I'm looking for: Just looking for a guild I can chill with, have some banter, grind some gear with and if I end up having the time raid with. 
---
So yeah if there's any guilds out there that thinks I'll fit in their guild let me know 😁
---
Hahaha. I mean if we had vanilla for a few years and tbc came out, I would probably play it lol.
---
Wasnt this feature implemented in 1.12.0 and removed in 1.12.1 cause it just didnt work back then? 
---
I think its a no change change
---
&gt; The push back on the issues in the beta are what get those issues fixed.
---
No. The bug reports are what get those issues fixed. They don't give a fuck about people posting on this sub.
---
Because this sub is full of fuming pathetic whiners. Hey look, you sound just like one of them giving the OP a pissy response too, what a surprise.
---
What made it more fair? I experienced EPGP but not DKP.
---
Well still black on red is a poor choice. https://www.designworkplan.com/read/signage-and-color-contrast
---
Not from a Jedi :)
---
I think it would be cool to see continued vanilla content, but doubtful blizzard would handle it well. to an extent it's too much an admission that their existing game is flawed to basically create an alternate timeline.
---
I think there is a lot of room for growth in the vanilla style though. Keep it at 60, add more content to azeroth. Focus on more fun consumables and profession goods, maybe more diverse items to help out the hybrid specs kind of like aq40 had. Maybe a few changes to hybrid talents to really flesh out the utility roles rather than just make their DPS/tanking/healing really good. More effort to make things laterally useful instead of how wow expansions just stack ontop and obsolete.
---
Some things like the outdoor pvp areas tbc had would be a great addition to the vanilla world.
---
Lionheart Helm. Gold is already gonna be tough to come by as a warrior :(
---
I don't think voice was implemented in vanilla. Pretty sure it was in like WoTLK or something like that.
---
\&gt; But you keep telling me about my experiences on vanilla wow 
---
I wasn't criticising you man, but it was an 18 hour grind ... most random people wouldn't help you just because you asked nicely.
---
I also got the pouch myself and that was with a guildmate who I then returned the favour for.
---
Just don't want people to get their hopes up that a random 60 will kill 2,500 mobs with you standing next to them for the fun of it.
---
The discord link does not work for me, am I the only one?
---
Oh wow really? Thought this was a way later change like 7.1?
---
Seeing skeletons all over starting zones in private servers reminded me of Darkest Dungeon, ew adventurers seeking fame and glory to be slaughtered by the scary and menacing gnolls and kobolds
---
I dont think so. Check out this thread.    
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/incorrect-dr-categories-on-scatter-shot-and-freezing-trap/181629/5
---
Video evidence of a long trap after scatter. Apparently scatter and trap were intentionally put on the same DR in 5.3 PTR but then they reverted it.
---
Holy crap. Some RLs are fucking Nazis.
---
You need an active subscription.
---
Depends what they want to do really. If someone want's to do raiding or rated PvP as their main focus, I'd recommend retail 100%. If they're the type of person who just wants play here and there to collect things and have a variety of content to do, and doesn't want to grind through everything, I'd recommend retail as well.
---
Really, the only people I'd recommend Classic to over retail, are people like myself and a lot of others here, who enjoy the slower pace, the more social community, and the RPG adventure feel of Classic. 
---
That being said, realistically speaking I'd tell anyone interested to try them both. They each have their merits. Classic is definitely an investment that a lot of people won't want to make though.
---
quality metaphors

10/10 - IGN
---
love the keyboard turn when the raptor was attacking.... lol
---
I have been waiting for someone to bring up vent. Thank you for the chuckle.
---
I don't really like it since it will push people (like me) that doesn't like to use voice, to use voice.
---
Did you get into the beta, or the stress test? I’m guessing the latter, which is over for now.
---
I'm pretty sure the Burning and Rumbling Exiles are in Arathi, not Hillsbrad. Don't remember encountering any elementals in Hillsbrad.
---
It's possible to stealth or not stealth with or without spell batching. It mostly depends on opponent. The biggest thing with spell batching the opponents target loss of the rogue going into stealth can easily be batched into the same 400ms window as their attack making the rogue stealth and get hit dropping stealth all at once. This can expand the window from .5 sec to .9 sec.
---
Take my upvote :P
---
Of course! Blizzard employees working on the game!
---
I flew one out.. Drove to another, and happened to run into one at blizzcon.
---
You make a good point, yet everyone I know is only playing classic in anticipation for bc. Kind of an anomaly
---
Active Sub, nothing more nothing less.
---
I think it might be how separate everything in it is along with how different some of the design choices are. The game starts to go in a very different direction with TBC.
---
I really like a lot about TBC. The gameplay is fun, the atmosphere is excellent. But there's first the most obvious issues of vertical progression rendering all previous content obsolete, and making the old world dead to where all high level players are off in some new instanced world, along with the problem of flying mounts.
---
On top of that, it's diverging from and retconning WC3, and suddenly you're killing characters like Kael and Illidan, while the Draenei became what they became with the old Draenei becoming "the Broken", and the Blood Elves that were nearly all killed are suddenly over half of the Horde.
---
If not for the above, I think it would have blended in with the vanilla game. Particularly to me with the latter, it felt like the Blood Elves, Naga, Draenei, and Fel Orcs belonged as different neutral factions or as a third faction, IMO.
---
Wow good morning to you too
---
To add; there is a base level of expansions you are given when you subscribe.  This typically is one expansion below the latest one, giving you a reason to buy it so you can do all the latest content.  But you don't need that expansion to play Classic.
---
&gt; Maybe he should go fuck himself instead.
---
What are you, 12? Jesus.
---
Fucking thank you for saying something. We get that people are worried due to live, but come on.
---
And if a guild is raiding Nef on lets say tuesdays (because they want to give people as long as possible to get to the quest) and still dont have anyone who has the quest to get the shard - then they can take someone else who can get a shard if they want to.
---
I dont see the problem.
---
TBC was great, and a lot of players joined the game during the snowball effect in TBC.  It's historically part of the era where the game was at its peak popularity - through to WotLK and ICC.
---
The demand for TBC will be there after classic has been out some, I guarantee it.
---
Yes I’m 12. And you’re still wrong.
---
The Barrens is Horde territory, not Neutral. He'll be camped on a PvE server as well.
---
Esh.. yeah, well, at breakfast the next day she was talking about how nervous she was about our relationship and wanted to know when I was moving in and what not. I guess she was WAY more serious then I was &gt;,&lt;
---
Great so Fury Warriors will be even more op than they already are on private servers? Imagine being the only class with 3 elite talent trees and being the top dps in pve while being a hybrid...terrible game design.
---
Because some of the gameplay elements seem to indicate that the conflicts are much more escalated than the lore suggests.
---
Allegorically?
---
Also, I am sure i will not be done with raids in lets say 2 years.
---
is that a flask on the warrior O.o
---
We would have 1 tank, 2 dps and 2 heal alts. The rest of the raid mains zone out, these alts get the raid lockout.  The mains do not get Razer loot until the last clear and the alts get all the razer gear. Then after Razer is dead the mains would zone in and not get a raid lockout but could kill the rest of the 7 bosses because in Vanilla the raid lockout was only tied to a Razer kill. Then we would grab 5 more alts and do this pattern 3-4 more times a week. Leveling alts in Vanilla was easy due to another creative use of ingame mechanics. This is tag leveling, you would have a lower level character out of group tag a higher level elite mob and then a separate party of gear players would kill it, giving the leveling alt full experience.

Dwarf Priest: Tailoring/Enchanting
---
I'm creating my original character so going with my original Professions as well. Tailoring is a huge bonus for the BoP robes, but I enjoy it's potential to make money with bags and ZG gear later.
---
Enchanting is just a personal favorite of mine, and getting to DE every quest item is super handy.
---
I'm really happy for all of those who have been able to test the game so far! Albeit a bit jealous, since I only was invited for stress tests. That said, I'm glad I was, it made me realise why I fell in love with this game.
---
Yeah, you said it: "bring up" not shove into their face how slow they are at fixing everything, not whining about the game not being perfect yet without any layering..
---
get out
---
Oh...oh no. I don’t know what they say but don’t do it. 
---
All I really remember is that shadow priests melt faces and the Warlocks hates their CM...eonix I think?
---
lmao, facts
---
I’m gonna see if I can pit animated fires/lights in it for Wallpaper Engine. I’m shit at photoshop tho so I’ll just use the default assets from WE to do it.
---
I can see how what I wrote is confusing. There are some LW pieces that you can create and vendor for a profit, because the usual market price is so low. So some people make these and just vendor it. It's a good way to make a bit of gold while afk doing something else ;)
---
It took multiple trips but I eventually got it done 
---
I haven’t played wow in years but from what everyone says no one helps each other anymore in the game 
---
That is not even close to my experience when I played 15 years ago
---
Cool. Welp, no interest in telling a 12 year old why they're being a cringey little shit and need to go take a nap. So, carry on with your impotent bitching.
---
Back in Vanilla we had a chill Pally class leader.  Guy was laid back and would take time out of his day to go over rotations, down ranking, raid specific techniques for Pallys, etc.  Just overall good guy.
---
He has a wife in the guild, she was kinda aloof and seemed to keep to herself pretty much.  Then one day I noticed that the Pally class leader hasn't logged in 4 or 5 days.  We all start wondering what is up.  His wife also had not logged in for a couple days.
---
Come to find out, the wife was messaging our bad boy guild rogue on the down low.  Sexting and all that jazz.  Well she just decided to split and ditch her husband and move across the country to 'be with him'.  The guild leaders finally told everyone what happened and how devastated he was.
---
The wife and bad boy rogue gquit and server transferred I heard.  As far as I remember he never logged back in.  Still feel bad for that guy to his day.
---
I prefer this recolour's colors it makes you see more details
---
It's the lack of consequences. Everyone online can just say whatever they want to each other and no one can do anything about it.
---
You'd think that would cause everyone to not care what others say but.... it seems to have the exact opposite effect. People bite down, hard. Like beating each other with feathers.
---
Warrior for burst, priests or druid for heal and probably some spellcaster for sustain.
---
Can confirm wow is more addictive than coke
---
he was filling her up with his light
---
But you just did? You seem like a sad little fuck.
---
The int is really unnoticeable. My fairly geared AQ mage has 328 int. That means my gnome racial is giving about 17 int, which is a total of 0.28% crit, and 250 mana which is a little over half a fireball.
---
No wedding crashers they do the leg work and attend weddings.  You can skip the hard work by going right to the public bar associated with the wedding venue.
---
To add to this, I've always found the idea of a bunch of Chinese gold farmers fascinating. I remember I was 18 when I saw the documentary. Bunch of people in a computer lab/cafe all-day.
---
My reaction was: "Neat!"
---
Sort of like Trump's wall idea. I cannot really speak for wether or not it is a viable idea but the engineer inside me would be god damned to see it actually built.
---
If he convinced her to get in shape, thats a pretty good thing to do.
---
Exactly, it's not the same attitude!
---
What’s the state of hunters currently?
---
The Gnome racial ultimately ends up giving you a couple extra hundred many and like 0.46% spell crit.
---
It is still BiS for casters, but if you really hate gnomes, you're not losing out on a lot.
---
Jesus Christ......... That poor pally.
---
FU john would've been classified as obscene vulgar, with a 1 minor infraction. If you were given a 3 hour suspension, it was because you already had 2 minor strikes from previous violations, or you had a larger violation on record that automatically prompted a 3 hour suspension. That's how the old system worked.
---
I get ya.
---
Like I said, every system has flaws and weaknesses. People holding ontop DPK points, new players not able to get enough dkp points to get anything over hording players, loot council showing favoritism, etc.
---
My suggestion is to be upfront with whatever system you're going to be using. Have the guild vote/discuss this and make a unified decision. This way, if the guild decides to change systems because the current system sucks no one can be blamed... or no one can complain about the system being used...
---
Classic is not BfA either man, not the same team, not the same attitude. Ragnaros in Elwynn forest, blue posts every now and then, bug lists and so on, it's pretty damn clear
---
Ok So i'm just Copy pasting my old post on this:                  
---
                 
---
I knew a guy in Vanilla because he was the GM of our sister guild, so one day I get invited to MC cause they need people so I say sure! I'm super stoked cause it's my first time raiding, well I get there and they find out I'm not a healer (druid) and they tell me bear tanks sux and to respec, I tell them basically never mind I'll dip out so they can find a healer.
---
Well turns out they needed a tank and said fuck it I can stay and off tank as long as i throw heals and innervates. Well as soon as I joined their Vent I'm immediately met with this shrill assholes voice who going on and on about druid tanks are trash and whatnot, so i mute the dickhead. Well I'm whispering my friend what the pulls are because no ones explaining shit, he tells me which marker is mine because the dipshit I muted was the raid leader. So i unmute this kid who freaks out over every little thing and is always screaming like the -50 DKP video but not Asian and insanely fucking unfunny, hes the main tank.
---
This Warrior tank sucked ass, I dont know if it was gear or rotation but this kid was constantly screaming he needed healing and were on trash. Well low and behold fearless leader dies, next tank grabs it and also is one shotted, another Warrior taunts and eats dirt.
---
I figure fuck it, might as well try so I taunt and grab it and like some kind of magic it's barely fucking tickling me but the ENTIRE time this kid is screaming "BREZ ME, BREZ ME, BREZ ME!!!" so I say "I fucking cant i'm tanking like a druid boss!" well we kill the mob/s and this dude flips shit going on and on about druid tanks are trash and if I cant follow commands I can fuck off, so I left. But I was still in their vent so I hear one of the healers talking about how much easier I was to heal so spazoid goes off on him and he says fuck it and leaves, so now they are down a healer and a tank.
---
Well I left Vent and my friend said it all fell apart 5 minutes later and I never got invited or ran with them again but this is how kooky this mother fucker was because were still sister guild so we got info from them especially when TBC dropped because a lot of their members came and joined our guild. So this crazy mother fucker is telling his guildies NOT to buy TBC under any circumstances. That he will kick them out if he sees any of them ding 61 UNTIL they clear every Vanilla raid, including Naxx. Well this crazy ass shit goes about as well as you can imagine, people leaving, some upgraded and just stopped raiding.
---
This guild leader has such a god damn mental break down he took a baseball bat to his PC while on vent, one of the officers knew him in real life and found out when his wife ran in to see what all the commotion was he either by accident or on purpose struck her in the face.
---
So the neighbors call the police (apartment) who upon knocking on the door are greeted by his wife whos sporting a giant bruise on her cheek and she tells them he accidentally hit her and they see the Dell PC in shambles, turns out it's against the law to break your own shit or something so he gets arrested and at some point ends up in behavioral holding at the hospital.
---
I never heard anything about the dude after that other than all off the officers in that guild changed servers and we never talked to any of them again. But anyways that is my very long MC story.
---
yeah okay buddy
---
Yeah sure. MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20 are PUGable for sure. Maybe AQ40 and Naxx if you have a dedicated pug-group.
---
okay buddy
---
It would be enough for me to not play it. So i really hope they do
---
Huh. Something like this happened in my guild too. Still have their character names remembered.
---
Out of a hundred confirmed bugs and likely hundreds of thousands bug reports, the ones highlighted by the community by whining about them often and loudly are the most likely to be noticed by the developers reading the subreddit and fast-tracked to be fixed.
---
I'm not really hedging my bets that the minimum wage sucker working QA at Blizz is going to give a shit between "this lamp is too bright in Sentinel Hill" and "this character looks retarded while strafing", but thanks for your outlook. It's a good reminder that there are still some people, even those who live regularly sit on Reddit and run in gaming circles, who don't understand how powerful social media is.
---
Druids almost exclusively heal, with occasional light OT on rare occasions. Not really any Druid dps in pve.
---
DV was also made up of the number 4 and another top 10 guild at the time. Taking the best players from both guilds to make a tight 45 man roster. They had a small gearing need as they did not have many spares.
---
The problem isn't the amount of classes that can do it. In modern wow half the classes can tank and every can freely change between specs - yet still no one tanks.  
---
 It's just an unpopular role. The fact that in Classic it's something only 1.5 classes can do just makes it worse.
---
They could perhaps make English and International EU realms, doesn't have to be specifically German/French etc. realms, but then the different non-English speaking countries can go on an international realm and group up in guilds etc. or make unofficial servers.
---
I am gonna make druid with ski lw.
---
Hoping I can be onyxia scale dude
---
Wll i mean the classic launcher showed up and i downloaded it. So yes? I think. Like i can go to the log in screen for classic.
---
For some reason a lot of warriors have a, to me, unreasonable aversion towards tanking anything at any stage. Probably bad past experiences or something.
---
I get the calm down notion, but to be fair BfA had bugs caught in the early beta that made it months into live. I think people are just a bit cautious.
---
You need people for that, if you plan on solo farming, you would have to make friends, or make 2 accounts, other then that, I dont know, its too time consuming for regular players.
---
not the same team... this argument, god damn, just cause the BfA beta was that bad doesn't mean the Classic team has to suffer this condescent sense of entitlement everybody here is applying; they communicate, they fix, they spawn bosses, they're not the same team
---
"The tenuous pact between the Horder and Alliance has all but evaporated. The drums of war thunder once again..."
---
This indicates to me that the conflict has escalated to war. Seems consistent.
---
Not sure if anyone will even read/see this, but if you do, has anyone else looked into or heard of the loot system the guild Onslaught uses? If not I definitely recommend looking up their webpage where it has a description, and I’ll give a brief one here. 
---
Curious on other people’s thoughts, and as a GM, I plan on implementing it myself. 
---
Basically, it works as follows: everyone in the guild (that plans on raiding) makes a “wishlist” of sorts, of the items they want to get. Players can assign values to items starting at 50 and decreasing from there linearly, with only two items able to fit a certain point value (can only place 2 items at a value of 50, 2 at value 49 etc). Each time you attend a raid you get more points, so now any items you have placed at 50 are worth 50.5 (just as an example). 
---
Basically the system allows players to choose what items they value, the list is available to all so you know who will get what item ahead of time! Much more goes into it but that’s just a brief description. Thoughts?
---
I was a shaman in a guild back in classic and the GM shaman was asking how to do a totem quest. I explained the steps for them in chat, then they put their login and password in chat and said I should login and do it for them... Some people just don't seem to care.
---
If there are no servers, it was the stress test, and it’s over for now.
---
1-10 group as 5 man and do tag kill quests and skip looting quests. Grinding mobs solo is better than a lot of low level quests. With a group higher chance of greens being traded to be used.
---
You didn’t get in the beta. That was the stress test from last week that is over.
---
I’ve always thought of TBC and Thor Ragnorok as spiritual siblings. They even have similar color schemes.
---
It's really important to understand that the reason the games lasted up to a day was less to do with the difference in mechanics between 1.5 and 1.12 and more to do with people not understanding how much honor you can get from AV or really the most efficient way to do AV.
---
Pre-nerf AV makes it harder to rush, but not even close to impossible to rush. AV by its very design actively **encourages** you to ignore the enemy team. There is no downside to ignoring the enemy and blasting through as many towers, captains and leiutenants as you can as quickly as possible. You can't fix that because none of the things that reward honor are contested between both factions.
---
BFA sucks fucking ass, showing and introducing them to classic first is a most.
---
Its for sure the best city in the game. I've done some Alliance 1-30 runs and holy shit are there cities and zones better.
---
Only if I could be an Orc betrayer and go chill in Ironforge.
---
We'll see if that is actually the case when it comes out, even then you would need a guildie to help you out every time you farm, or a friend, or make 2 accounts.
---
If you're truly solo, this wont work at all. (And even then they might just fix that "bug" and try and keep it like it should be.)
---
I believe the biggest factor is you can't solo king anymore on live.
---
&gt;  I don’t see why people are confused about why layering is such a big deal to so many.
---
Most people who think layering is necessary, myself included, aren't confused about it. It's just that we think it's the better option than the alternatives for Classic launch. The cities being empty is an issue on beta but I'd be pretty shocked if it was that way on live.
---
I remember seeing a lot in Westfall as well. If you go by the math of 5 skill points per level, then you should be picking bruiseweed around level 20--about the time you should be leaving Westfall/Darkshore.
---
Skarm has a nice video on this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG5P71m6D4g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG5P71m6D4g)   
---
But: depends on how the situation is on the live servers. The values on pservers could be way off.
---
#MEET THE NEW BOSS
---
PvE wise, feral is in the middle ish spectrum on the DPS. PvP-wise they rock.
---
As for resto.. They're good to have. But only one or two per raid since Rejuv doesn't stack iirc, and you'll mainly be decursing. pvp resto i dunno.
---
Blizzard has been consistently fucking up things for the past 6ish years.
---
I think people are pretty justified in their worry that Blizz will fuck up Classic.
---
But then Blizzard will know all your secrets...
---
CRUSHEEEM!!!
---
Optional TBC or eventually Wrath servers seem fine. Absolutely not 'Classic+'. People who want that are just asking for a new mmo.
---
Loot council, with background lists, for inital progression and main day raids.
---
Later on our off raids will be GDKP for some cash injection.
---
I don't believe that warrior lasted more than a week.
---
Sadly this was not the last time that gm/mt/rl fucked over the paladins. He refused avengers to the whole class and later gave the claymore of unholy might to a hunter.
---
By that point most of the class had noped out.
---
not the same team, and we've seen proof of that
---
Keep in mind Paly and shamy dont benefit as mush from Healer leather or cloth since it has spirit.
---
Alliance:
---
Warrior tank will also get Plate DPS
---
Paladin or Priest healer (paladin gets mail healing gear)
---
Mage or Warlock
---
Rogue 
---
Hunter
---
Horde:
---
Druid (if there is an enhance shamy in the group for Rez) or Priest 
---
Hunter or Enh shammy
---
Something for priest?
---
Afaik yes, but not exactly sure tbh.
---
You’re about 12 months too late on this one. Not that it was ever gonna happen, but it’s not even a point of discussion atm
---
PUGs will definitely happen to fill in spots for raiders who are looking at that 1 drop that didn't happen... it will just take some time.
---
mele leeway wow vanilla !!! TAUREN WARRIORS !! even stronger !
---
Don't give me that shit
---
At the release of bwl there were 3 established Alliance raiding guilds, TR, IE and VQ, all of whom had been in MC since Jan 05
---
If you had a small gearing need then you wouldn't have been doing bwl 4-5 times a week.
---
Having your entire raid roster have multiple attempts at Drake Fang Talismans and nef weapons and full t2 was a massive boost over anyone else
---
Your progress is a sham
---
Level 8.5
---
That's the problem, most of the complaints are similar to yours, but that isn't even how layering works, which means the majority of people complain about something they don't understand. If I remember correctly, the layer you first get assigned to is your permanent layer unless you change layer via invite, but as soon as you leave that party you go back to your permanent layer. There is no random layer hopping like you're suggesting. The fear that a zone will magically be empty is irrational.
---
So sad kinda there will never be a hype like this for any game ever again ( i mean there is hype for classic but not standing for 48 hours outside of a gameshop kinda hype )
---
No reserves, no decay DKP or GDKP + farming.
---
Idk if he would have swallowed his pride he would have had the gear fast. 
---
A month off means you're going to be under geared. Just OT until you get drops.
---
Yes..? What's your point?
---
Took 6 months of raiding MC every single week from the first bindings to drop for the 2nd to finally drop.
---
Haha exactly.  They'll find something,  somewhere.
---
Feral tanking is actually really good, its probably the best value to get out of any non-healing Hybrid class specs. Its still not quite as good as Warrior in my opinion, but you 100% can Feral tank in raids. 
---
Its definitely viable.
---
I loved my Sprite Darter Egg pet.
---
Hell, I say go a step farther and force ALL streamers to play on the SAME server.
---
I don’t think anyone who advocates for DKP here would outright recommend a blind one where hunters get TF.
---
&gt; At the time, PvP was only associated with severe griefing behavior in mmos. No other developer wanted it.
---
That's not true, because I played DAOC (Dark Age of Camelot) for two expansions before WoW came out. DAOC figured out faction-based PvP with large PvE safe zones, which allowed people who didn't feel like being ganked right now to level in PvE, while having a large PvP "frontier" to run around in and battle enemies. Like WoW later did, you could only fight enemy factions, not your own faction. They called the factions "realms", and "realm vs realm" PvP = RVR.  WoW also does RvR rather than PvP, by DAOC's old definition.
---
Pure open-world PvP of everyone vs everyone is still a grief-fest, IMHO.
---
ninja loot system
---
I feel like it was timed poorly. Like warping to another planet before exploring another continent?
---
Man somewhere in the world Alexensual is preparing new reasons to hate it after all these fixes you just wait til he drops that next YouTube video for 6k views
---
Mod please *delete* this
---
Fixed that for you.
---
My favorite instance. One of the 2 I was always willing to run. That and Strat Undead.
---
Blizzard fixed a bug that had been on BfA for years and that all the doomsayers said would NEVER get fixed, and yet here we are. The Classic team are clearly fixing things, but you just want to complain. Even if they fix the majority of the bugs you'll still complain because "not all of them are fixed". Nothing is good enough. Ever. The Classic team has already proven they deserve the benefit of the doubt, but nothing they do will ever change a mind as cynical as yours.
---
Who said being passive, I said being chill, being cool about it. This is all a work in progress, can't we wait and see said progress without insulting the dev team? That's all man. Layering is being tested, and they've SAID it would be gone after 1/2 weeks so why cry about it?
---
If course it isn't TBC. You had to buy the physical copy and install the expansion to play TBC. Everyone with a classic account could play that patch.
---
&gt; the ones highlighted by the community by whining about them often and loudly are the most likely to be noticed by the developers reading the subreddit and fast-tracked to be fixed.
---
Or maybe they're the ones they work on first because if the community notices them in huge droves, then it's likely they are reported the most, and are also the ones most heavily noticed by Q&amp;A, and thus would be the ones they work on first ANYWAY? It's almost like you forget this is an actual company that has put out a bunch of games already. This isn't their first rodeo. Regardless of what you think about the creative direction of their IP, they are still a fucking game company that knows how to make them. 
---
It's a good reminder that there are still some people who overestimate how important their voice is to professionals who will likely be doing their job regardless of how much you scream at them to.
---
As someone who has done a lot of drugs, they are a LOT of fun.  However, Alcohol is by far the worst one as far as next day (and sometimes later that night) experiences go.  I can't blame you for not wanting to partake.  Keep doing what makes YOU happy.  As far as WoW is concerned, I don't know if they are going to add something like that or not because I'm not sure what their plans are for classic long term.  If classic is just a way to try and get people back into retail, they may not add a game "test" feature like you are proposing, but if they plan on making classic a completely separate MMO from retail, they probably would add something like that eventually to try and get more people into the community.
---
Not sure if you know, but how does loot distribution work in this situation? If it’s a primarily guild organized run( let’s say 30 people from a guild, 10 PUGs), is all Loot /rolled on? Does the guild just reserve specific items and then let the rest of the items be rolled on or..?
---
And by other MMOs, you mean exclusively Everquest. Every later MMORPG that I know of looked at Everquest's brutal death penalties and noped out of that.
---
I'd be really surprised if they didn't reply. The Classic team has been on fire lately with listening to the community. They wouldn't just ignore ~17k comments - it doesn't reflect how they've been responding to everything else.
---
I just hope the response the give isn't "its a hardware limitation, so our hands are bound - sorry!", rather "we heard you - here's your language based realms!".
---
Aww..
---
They let everyone download the Classic data for the stress test, thats what it must be. They haven't invited anyone into beta for almost a month now.
---
We had two females in the guild, both ended up sleeping with guildies. 
---
One girl was obsessed with one of our officers. Ended up flying out to meet with him and didnt go home for a month. She was his live in sex slave the entire time. Eventually he was like dang this is too much and asked her to go home. She left the guild with a few other people. 
---
The other girl turned out to be a cosplayer/lewd model/softcore porn model.  She was extremely attractive. The guild had a massive guild meetup in Los Angeles. We rented a mansion there for a week, partied and LANed WoW the entire time. 
---
Lots of hilarious pictures from those days. Bunch of 16 to 25 year old nerds with too much alcohol and too much freedom. 
---
Well somehow it came out that one of our healers, who was extremely nerdy, tall lanky was like 25 and said he was still a virgin. 
---
So we wake up the next morning, everything is trash. Looks like the aftermath of a frat party. We start up our PCs to start playing WoW. 
---
Where is Joe and Samantha? Names redacted. Nobody knew. So we look around, and find them sleeping outside by the pool together. Joe is shirtless with the horde symbol drawn on his chest with sharpie and Samantha is just butt naked there with him. 
---
Apparently our main healer just lost his virginity at a WoW guild party to probably one of the hottest gamer girls I've ever seen. All while shes sitting on him naked drawing body tattoos on him with a sharpie. 
---
Fuck my first time was nowhere near that cool. 
---
We went in to raid that night and everybody couldn't stop talking about what happened.
---
[I personally find it more reflective of the in-game Ironforge.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/62/8c/23/628c23bd020f3baa9b6a4f989568f3b2.jpg)

heres how id turn wow into bfa, one small step at a time over 12 years

As a rogue player thru most of vanilla... when they changed the animations from gliding to this new shitfest duckwalk thing I almost quit my rogue.  So beyond stoked to have the gliding back.
---
i sure hope so, since i (probably) make way more €/h than i will ever can make g/h and i dont want to spend the limited time i have to farm shit ans dont have fun. thats why i have work
---
Yeah, it’s not an “early” UBRS or it would have almost certainly had 15 people.
---
Hi, what are background lists and main day raids?
---
Menetil harbor
---
TLDR: all girls are dirty sluts and should not be allowed to play WoW
---
/s...........I think
---
Do you have a recoloured one with the original aspect ratio?
---
Quite the bullshit comment there, since I've reported any bug I've found and made posts about what I found important with video proof and all. If everyone behaved like that, bugs would be reported and this sub would be more constructive.
---
It's definitely not going to be empty. I'd put anything on that.
---
Mains should get first opportunity, if no one wants to spend dkp then alts can roll for it...then and only then.  The team comes first.  The guild is prepping for higher content and all gear that is needed by mains get it first.
---
1 vs 1 = paladin!! .. They have SoR And healing!
---
People will be expecting classic to come out with the same shit 1.12 had.
---
People aren't expecting the same as the '04 release.
---
That was my first MMORPG :-)  Loved it, finally had to quit when the population dropped too low to sustain fun battleground play.
---
The demand for TBC will sky-rocket if Classic fills up with people who played the game back in the day. The active hardcore vanilla die-hard community just isn't that big and is easily overruled by a new majority of players.
---
You see people mostly band-wagoning behind vanilla because these people are very passionate about what they want, while people who are interested in seeing Classic go down the same path it originally did aren't as particular about what exactly they want and don't want.
---
It's like taking a bunch of kids to the ice-cream store and one of them insists the he must have chocolate and nothing but chocolate. So the demand for chocolate is super clear and overwhelming. But all the other kids just wants ice cream.
---
Yeap, it's semi-retconned but definitely canon due to the greymane wall.
---
 looks amazing
---
it only caught them up to the other guilds. The other major things were that we had Olgal, Kamin and a few others that controlled the AH from alts giving us the ability to provide consumables for the entire raid. We had set up afk macro's that would monitor green dragon spawns and announce to the guild when they popped. This allowed us to get at least 2-3 kills every rotation, as we had level 20 lock alts at every dragon portal with full shards. We were a well oiled machine in Vanilla. Yes cascading BWL allowed us to get more out gear but gear only took you so far. In general there was no dead weight in DV, they ran a tight roster and optimized comps always.
---
Lots of people didn't experience all of TBC and it's the supposed to be where wow " is at it's best ". I'd love to play TBC, but i'd love to try out new raids etc.. after Naxx it could be so much fun as well.
---
Oh good. This post. Again.
---
Well, they want to make money off of there labor so I'm guessing not for a very long time.
---
WoW used to have free trials, I'm sure eventually Classic WoW will let you level up to level 10 or something. I wouldn't expect this for like 6-12 months though.
---
Yeah I try unofficial servers from time to time. Just to feel the atmosphere and RvR some ;-)
---
Warrior has literally heroic strike and nothing else at lvl 1. Burst???
---
The best lvl 1 is probably the paladin, because he starts with a 2H, he deals damage by swinging and uses his mana to heal himself. At lvl 1 the mana regen is so insane that classes with no heal have absolutely zero chance. 
---
Out of the healing classes, priest druid and shaman need their mana to DPS, while a paladin does not.
---
You realize you're confirming my point right? While I do enjoy some types of convenience, I agree that it shouldn't take priority like it does in retail and to prevent that from happening, there should be no cherry-picking of conveniences.  
---
I'm simply no zealot who believes Vanilla was the single best iteration there ever was, ever will or ever could be and while I do acknowledge that some things would be an improvement, I don't want to see them implemented because that arbitrariness could lead us right down that rabbit hole once again.
---
So a dude was jumping off something in Uldir trying to get to the Zul platform.
---
GL said if he did it again and died guild repairs would be turned off. He did.
---
Dude left the guild shortly thereafter lol.
---
Come out with full fledged expansions without screwing up what made Classic/TBC/WOTLK great. Preserve the old realms, and do character transfers while keeping the reference character on the donor server/versions.
---
Why not Orc warrior and Orc shaman?
---
Looks like you have a lot to say. I'd encourage you to look into submitting some things you're passionate about (like your version of a gold making guide) on the site. The more information people have access to with good discussion along with it will only benefit the community. Thanks for the feedback here. I know that Sinyou knows of this reddit thread.

Feral tank is great in 5 mans dungeons and inability to become crit and crush immune prevents the from Raid tanking.
---
Feral DPS is ok in Dungeon but lack of CC and reliable spell interrupts compared to other DPS hurts them.
---
Feral DPS in raids relies on one mace that has three charges and since you need to activate it over and over that means to be competitive you will need to far it over and over.
---
Resto suffers in 5 man due to lack of rez, theirs on a 30 min cooldown. 
---
Resto in Raid has simple job, mark of the wild, Faerie Fire, Innervate the main priest, and Brez some key person. Your heal is too slow to be viable so maybe as Horde with the lack of paladins resto may be a bit more useful.
---
Just be able to pick which one you want when you create character...

Happened in BC, but here goes.  Was a teenage GM for a decent sized guild that was trying to gear people up for T5.  It is that time of the week for a Gruul's Lair raid and we usually clear it rather quickly.  This week was a slightly different exception though as our Mage tank could not be on that week.  A few wipes into HKM the new mage figures it out and we head on off to slay Gruul.  Two things real quick:
---
1) One of the prior clears of this raid the Aldori Legacy Defender dropped and when it did I selfishly used my GM and MT powers to persuade the pally OT to let me have it.  I told him that he would instantly receive the shield the next time it drops without question.  He was fine with this arrangement and as I looted the shield I made it aware to everyone in the raid what was happening and that the OT would receive it the next time it dropped.
---
2) My family is extremely Catholic and our internet was piss poor dial-up at this time.  As a result I would always raid from a friends house and it usually worked pretty well, but not this night.  The day of this raid was on Good Friday, and my parents drove to my friends house and pretty much dragged me away very shortly after we downed HKM so that we all could go to church.  Before I walk out the door, I give a brief overview as to how to tank to a friend of mine that was sitting on the couch and my other friends were rather confident they could down Gruul without me this one time.  
---
With all that I went off to church with my family hoping that it would all work out.  Not too long into the service did my phone start vibrating rather frequently for about 5 minutes straight until I had to turn it off.  Once mass ended I turned my phone on to see about 15 missed calls from my buddies and quite a few messages.  I separate myself from my family and see what all the fuss was about.  Turns out the Aldori Legacy Defender dropped and the Paladin that was promised the loot did not receive the item because my friends, had no recollection of the arrangement and since the Paladin didn't roll higher then another warrior OT they decided to give it to the warrior.  Came back online to a shit show.  The Pally and many other people left the guild and absolutely slandered our guild in trade chat.  What was a solid guild with about 40 or so up and coming raiders turned into a shell of itself.  I hated myself for screwing it all up so bad.
---
But we don't even know that Crowley *exists*.
---
You needed to poach to get things like Thunderfury, and to get better quality players. It was vanilla, it was all about how can you get a leg up without getting caught. Other guilds cascaded as well. IE for example did but did not have the alts we did.
---
That guy did not put his faith in the light.
---
That was not dating advice.
---
Plus escape artist and +15 eng for those higher level arcanite dragonlings.
---
How can that even happen in a DKP guild?  It should have been called out as bullshit immediately and you should have been backed up by the majority of the guild.  That sort of thing should kill a DKP guild immediately.  It is the whole reason DKP exists lol.
---
I'm not entirely sure since they announced it during Legion and not BfA. And Legion was doing fine compared to BfA, so I'd say it's more about getting back this other part of the community who wouldn't like even Legion. Also, they did communicate a lot through blue posts prior to the beta, even changing the Phase schedule after players voiced concerns (in a constructive way). Right now they're busy working out the bugs, organizing the stress tests and all, this is a lot of work, so I definitely would say they're clearly not the same kind of team.
---
Re-coloured circa 2019
---
So many cranky full adult men in this sub.
---
no. unstuck either teleported your character forward or used your hearth.
---
As a healer...I would rather have no tank than a shitty tank, guess who always gets attacked first with the shitty tank? The healer 99% of the time. Shitty tanks in vanilla seemed to only hit one target and then blame you for...err... healing them I guess?
---
We borrow money from her parents. By borrow, I mean she pretty much bullies them into giving us money. It's sad.
---
When you look forward but move left/right, your character's torso/head would still face forward, even though you're moving side to side. 
---
On the beta, when you target something and start moving left/right, instead of facing forward, your entire character just faces whatever direction you're strafing. It looks very odd, especially when you strafe back and forth really quickly (imagine what your character would look like if you just kept spinning your view left and right really quickly). 
---
My guess is this is one of those leftover Legion -&gt; Classic bugs. I think Legion reworked how your character looks at targets or something like that? (just targetting them would cause your character to tilt their head to look at them)
---
lmao! Is this the same guy who did the Oomkin video? The unlearn profession/respec thing at the end of both videos cracked me up
---
Of course its this common.  Hell, I know 3 different local DnD groups who have run threw each other in a whirlpool of Doritos and beer breathed carnality. 
---
Every one is out to fuck the token lady gamer. And when a person gets the pick of the litter, can you really blame em for doing that?
---
Searching here for 'Alterac Valley' gives a list of changes as the top post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2zg97/alterac_valley_in_classic/).  tl;dr - They gutted it.
---
You get into iffy territory there.  If I'm not wrong batching plays a role in Potting.  Hpbto save u from lethal or Fire pot response to POM pyro.  Changing that interaction since pots may be noncombat player action would significantly change the game.
---
There's other items and possible noncombat mechanics (flags come to mind) that should be batched.
---
Let's wait till they fix batching before changing what is batched.  Most agree the window is off.  Hopefully it's addressed.  It is a more difficult thing to fix so I'm not surprised bir isn't done yet.
---
I think we can see that there just isn't time before release for that kind of tweaking. I think you are 100% right that it would have been great for the game, but it would be weeks or months of extra work and to get the game retail-ready by late August they're going to be busy enough just photocopying retail vanilla as it was in 1.12.
---
Damn, since I have always played on a pve server, I just realize that The Barrens was a horde zone and not a neutral one !
---
What ? Alliance doesn’t have Barrens chat ?! Mind blown !
---
Hey guys, if i get a sub rightnow i'll be able to play beta? i wanna test if my pc will run this
---
Should warn you that the chance on hit effects won’t proc while in forms, and that the AV weapon can’t be obtained until AV releases in a later phase.
---
Loot council. Every option has its ups and downs. I picked the council because it is the best option for progression and because I do not have to keep track of arbitrary dragon points.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5dqnc/what_loot_distribution_method_will_you_use_in/
---
You could just check the post 8 lines down and see what they've answered there.
---
Varies. You would have to inquire ahead of time.
---
You don't know?
---
Oh god no...that was where it all went sideways.
---
At the end of vanilla I decided to quit the game as I didn't want to participate in having to grind 10 more levels in Wow. 55-60 felt like an eternity then and I couldn't imagine doing it all over again. So i gave my account to my friend who had his own account but I figured he would like to have my stuff too. Well 6 months pass and I get the "Itch" and ask him if he would be willing to hand my account back over to me. He agreed to do so on the condition that I join his guild and play with him. I said sure, made a character on the realm he was playing on and get invited into the guild. I think the guild was called "Scarlet Crusade" or something along those lines and I don't remember exactly what server it was either. This guild was a Military RP guild and had all the ranks and stuff associated with it. Well when I was about level 40ish I get invited to a group to go do a dungeon with other guildies which was great! Until we get in the dungeon and the priest who was healing was such fucking garbage. Letting people die constantly, not being mana efficient etc. Now my friend was in the run with me and he was an officer in this guild. I started to talk on ventrillo about how bad this priest was and how hard they sucked for the priest to then speak up in vent saying that they were the Wife of the GM and I was fucked. I immediately get kicked from the guild and my friend tries to invite me back for me to get kicked again. He then quits the guild because it was bullshit what happened.
---
The best part is that they sent him "Dishonorable Discharge papers on the In-Game Mail" He gave me the letter and I held onto it for many years and we would get a laugh out of it from time to time.
---
I might be hitting that goal but its doubtful. We came from a guild that was setting very ambitious goals like that and it rubbed us the wrong way. We kind of wanted to enjoy the leveling process and not burn out on the game before we even hit 60. We set a goal post of 60 by the 6th week and raiding by the next week. I don't believe Blizzard is going to be rushing to get through the phases so we should still have more than enough time to farm 2 raids.  
---
I hope that answers your question.
---
Haven't confirmed in classic, but crit and regeneration were buffed for lvl 1s. That makes the Troll race an easy pick imo.
---
Rogue is probably best, but hunter's lack of glancing concerns is a big draw.
---
I need about that long to justify why my hunter needs it so all good here
---
i dont agree i think cata was best thing that happened to wow
---
I don't care if they want to be cheap, that's fine.  Blizz shady though, just look at BFA.  Didn't get the allied races they put front and center until a year after release.  They changed leveling just to make it suck more so it makes more sense to buy a boost too.
---
There is tons of little shit like that they makes them untrustworthy.
---
I have no problem with them being goblins, if that's what they want to be, but don't come at me dressed like a Tauren.
---
Suicide kings or DKP. Undecided as of yet.
---
thanks! I had so many leftover bits that I thought I'd just put them in haha
---
\&gt;Giving credit to the artist \[...\] and post it as their own.
---
How is this one sentence?
---
Keep in mind loot council may not be practical in 40 mans. I'm not sure what your end game intentions will be but you'll have to vary the loot council process if you have pugs in the group
---
my personal preference is to press Classic for the setting, then change the view distance (the bane of our old jalopy PCs in the vanilla Era) so I can see the whole world as it was meant to look now that we are enjoying the 2nd season of this game with much better PCs this time. 
---
I don't know the FPS, I just know it looks and plays awesome. finally Home.
---
I remember when tbc launched our home mall didn‘t do a midnight sale but one at like 6 in the morning. I woke up rdy to go there but it seemed rly dark outside even for this time. I went to the mall and it was dark and all and I got confused. After maybe 30 minute of wandering around not knowing what was going on I finally decided to check my watch. Turns out its 1 o’clock in the morning. To this day I don‘t know what made me believe it was already 6 o’clock
---
Until I see it consistently functioning differently I can only go off of my experience.
---
I'm actually planning on making a priest alt in Classic. I'll be mapping my leveling route for priest next. With that will come macros and other things, so stay tuned! :)
---
well fuck,  my bad I should know better.  Don't look at me I am hideous
---
Really depends on who is leading the pug
---
Convince them to let you be the Master Looter.... but you'll have to do it in 2 different guilds. Then ninja the other mats from the 2nd guild's bank before they gkick you.
---
Happy to help!
---
You gain Brouzouf
---
Combat text is apparently fixed, not sure about the blood.
---
by guild bank you mean his alt on his account you sent guild stuff to lol
---
Holy crap cringe all over this. Military RP guild? What a bunch of douches.
---
I really like both. Yours I see as Ironforge at the end of the work day when the fires of the forges are low, while the original is Ironforge at peak smelting time.
---
&gt; hunter's lack of glancing
---
You can't glance against players.
---
We needed a healer
---
My memory was that there was a lot of elbow room for DPS buffonery up until about Uldaman, which was the graveyard of noobs.
---
As someone who has been into MMOs as long as they can remember and has pretty much only ever lived in prime areas of the opioid epidemic, I've probably heard of more people quitting heroin than MMOs lol.
---
Clearly we need to be applying harm reduction strategies to our MMO use. If so many people are going to be playing WoW no matter what, we need to make sure it's not a poisoned product and do all we can to minimise the harm that the game causes to its users!
---
If you're going to play WoW, don't forget to stay hydrated and drink lots of water, and try to remember to eat and get proper sleep, even if it makes you feel sick thinking of stepping away from the screen. Don't forget about the people in your life that matter, even if they may judge you for spending all your spare time on WoW.
---
Vael voice acting is so good. That "FLEE!" really tells you it's game on.
---
and this, my friends, is the reason devs dont hangout and interact about their projects on reddit.
---
In addition to what was said, you don't take the 10% equipment durability damage on items, saving you having to unequip gear (especially if you don't have the bagspace to do it). You can also use it in places where you wouldn't normally die, such as getting out of a city faster.
---
It seems strange to say that Loot Council is reliant on good leaders when the same is true of DKP, or they will just not address the issues with the system you are using.
---
I'm sure between us we can come up with anecdotes for why both are simultaneously the best and worst systems though :)
---
I really like your version tbh, they're two different kinds of feelings so it's really not about better or worse, but yours has more contrast to it, I like it
---
Because of what I said already
---
Nathan the unread warrior on Outland EU. We were alliance slumming it in greens and a few ok blues. If you saw Nathan in a BG or out in the world you basically just gave up. Me and my 2 mates would be in awe when we saw him!
---
lootbox, surprise features... whatever
---
Do we have your permission to discuss other bugs or should we bring our concerns directly to you and await your vetting process?
---
Agreed. Every MMO I've seen with free-for-all PvP everywhere eventually died because newbies and lowbies got sick of being griefed and betrayed constantly, and the griefers didn't like having no one but other griefers to play with.  EVE at least has safe areas, but treachery is a thing there.  
---
And that's the other downside of free-for-all PvP that you and others are mentioning: treachery is rewarded, so you can't trust anyone except your guildies, and sometimes not even then. (See some infamous EvE 'incidents'). And how do guilds even form in such an environment?
---
Yes it is but its PvP scene is smaller than games with 1/10th of the players and its only saving factor is the Arena which is practically factionless.
---
lord bless the snowflake generations
---
Farscape. Although I had “rivendare” and “moltencore” for a while, those might be alts
---
I didn’t suggest random layer hopping at all. But you don’t get to pick what layer you’re in, the game decides and it’s possible that you could end up being on a layer where there aren’t a lot of people in the zone you’re in. This leads to empty cities and zones like we’ve seen until layers were collapsed.
---
There were some interesting results. I received experience for Razor Hill, Far Watch Post, and Crossroads, but none of the smaller discoveries along the way, like Gold Road or The Barrens. I also received XP for Lushwater Oasis and The Stagnant Oasis, so it isn’t just towns. I suspect you’re only granted experience when a portion of the map is revealed.
---
The correct answer! The most overlap here is probably the Rogue and the Druid, but at levels 50+ their gear choices tend to diverge.  At least the Rogue shouldn't be interested in very many feral tank options.
---
Yes, a lot of maybes used to create the basis for your point. Very convincing.
---
Here are the facts.
---
1. There are a lot of bug reports.
---
2. Western developers read the subreddit for games they work on.
---
3. Issues that are commonly complained about are either fixed or at least publically addressed after they gain enough social momentum.
---
&gt;It's a good reminder that there are still some people who overestimate how important their voice is to professionals who will likely be doing their job regardless of how much you scream at them to.
---
Oh no, what will they do with the Atlas-tier burden on their shoulders of delivering what they promised to deliver? Refer to my earlier post about fucking off with corporate apologist rhetoric.
---
The fact that we are this close amazes me
---
I read vs as compared to, rather than duel.
---
I probably missed the point.
---
Oops.
---
Warrior, Priest, Mage, Rogue, Hunter  
---
There is no right or wrong answer, just my opinion
---
Worth an upvote.
---
RPG reasons, mostly. Though there would've been a lore-friendly (and RPG-friendly) way of adding them in. Alliance Shamans and Horde Paladins should be actually thematically different from each other. They could have mostly the same abilities, but the effects could be different and such.
---
I think it would've been cool if Dwarves could be Shamans (canonically Wildhammer Dwarves are) but have a more Earth-related theme to their spells even if the effects were the same. And in the same vein, Horde Paladins should've been Undead, and much like Undead Priests they would (canonically) replace the Light magics with Shadow magic. The *mechanics* could be mostly the same, but the aesthetics would be different.
---
1. every single botter account bought the game itself - once the account is discovered and banned, buy a new one, quick setup, rinse and repeat
---
2. the small population you are talking about is still one of the biggest one in mmos if not the largest.
---
3. a bot never gets tired
---
4. true, yet still happens
---
botting might not be as easy as it was back in vanilla, it still exists in retail, it will exist in classic.
---
and in a fresh server there will be demand for easy gold.
---
Back in WOTLK, I was a Priest that was sometimes healer, sometimes DPS, depending on what we needed. One time when we cleared Trial of the Crusader, the spell DPS trinket dropped off of the final boss and I used my DKP to get it. One of the mages went apeshit crying and whining about it, claiming that he should get it because I'm a hybrid and he's a pure. I think he gquit not too long after.
---
Later on, same guild, we were clearing through ICC 25 Heroic, and there was this clique of 5 friends in the guild that were kinda-sorta really fucking elitist, and one of them kept proclaiming that we can't do H Lich King 25, because we "don't have the DPS". They stuck around until we completed the mount achievements, and then the next raid night, all 5 of them just refused to join the raid. They were all online, but they didn't want to raid with us. The 25man group broke up pretty shortly after that.
---
After that, in Cata, I was in another guild and when we were progressing H Dragon Soul 25, the spirit trinket dropped from the normal mode 2nd-to-last boss, and after a lengthy decision from the loot council, they give it to me. I only used the trinket when I was Holy spec, because Disc didn't need the mana regen, so next week when I was Disc (I was holy for some fights, disc for others), one of the other healers whined over voice comms that I was "using a DPS trinket" (actually an int/mastery trinket) and not using the spirit trinket that I just got. The GM told me that he wanted me to use the trinket in Disc spec and just reforge my gear back and forth. I informed him that doing this would require me to hearth out of the raid in between every single boss to reforge my gear back and forth and back and forth, but he didn't seem to care. This was just kinda the straw that broke the camel's back and I just gquit right there and dropped WoW cold turkey for like 6+ months.
---
There is no Gbank?
---
Only if I have your permission to be annoyed at people who lose their minds over minor, unconfirmed bugs in an unfinished product.
---
Yes please, just like diablo 2 is frozen in time and i still love to play it.
---
I don't really expect anyone to believe me, but I was in a guild lead by the "more dots more dots more dots, ok stop dots"  "THAT'S A 50 DKP MINUS!"  "WATCH THE TAIL SWIPE" guy from the funny youtube video.  This was after the video existed, and he insisted it wasn't him, but it was.  He had the exact same voice mannerisms when he raged out.  "No this isn't over it's FUCKING OVER!"  He was a real asshole if anything went wrong, and we all knew he had transfered over to Skullcrusher after playing mostly on another server.  We assume because he got a rep of being a dick head.  
---
Anyways, I burned him real bad one night in the 40 man vent after he raged out.  I hit him w/ a Grandma's Boy line that was pure fire.  
---
He started raging because we wiped, and said we're done because his girlfriend was coming over anyways.  
---
So I dropped the classic "By girlfriend do you mean that piece of rabbits fur you rub on your dick every night?"  and the chat just irrupted w/ laughter.  He got even more angry w/ the "who fucking said that shit!?!?" screams, but the damage was done.  He had been humiliated.  Felt real nice after being yelled at by such a turd.
---
Would rather have nature resist than + to herbalism
---
I'd say even there it's the same. The big thing with Uld is people starting to run it at too low of a level. The first mobs are like mid-high 30's, and the last boss is level 47. Big jump in mob levels. You could do the first bit easily at level 43, then have a hella hard time on the last boss.
---
Hmm... DAOC managed it with alternating "we're fighting over this new land full of goodies we just discovered" expansions with "we each have our own new areas within a common expansion theme" expansions.

Just also be the Gbank toon.
---
Love it, that's what we love thinking about on the Classicwowplus sub reddit
---
I really want allied races but I'm still 110 and can't be bothered. I'll probably get bfa when the next expansion launches, will it be hard to get them then? Or will it be a boring grind like Pathfinder for flying?
---
how was the trial different from the current "free to level 20 (per character)" that modern has?
---
Yeah, I find that odd too. I remember thinking when I played vanilla how there were so many empty areas on the map and areas you couldn't click on, and there were entire regions from WC3 not in the game, such as Northrend and the Broken Isles (which from what I saw in retail, seem like they aren't even isles now, but a continent with areas separated by mountains rather than water, what...?).
---
Weird they went in the direction they did. I wonder what the internal discussion on it was like and why they thought it would be better than the alternatives (assuming they were even discussed).
---
Definitely meaningless to me but I remember the dragon whelplings from that zone east of goldshire (redridge? I forget the name) sold for about 350-400g each on my server.  I only made it to about level 25 during vanilla but remember killing those things hoping I'd get one.
---
Yes there certainly is. It's some dude's alt. And very often the other officers know how to get into that account etc.
---
It was way later.
---
Salutations!

I've used them all,  the most popular one I used was rolling.  You rolled with your class or toons that needed said item,  highest roll wins it. You can fine tune this quite heavily if you prefer as well.
---
How would loot work on a 40 man pug? (Honest question not trolling)
---
&gt; it only caught them up to the other guilds.
---
This is absolute nonsense, this is ridiculous.
---
BWL was added July 05 and looking at webarchive TR didn't kill Firemaw, Ebonroc and Flamegor until October and Nefarian until December.
---
So based on one ID a week (because I know we didn't cheat), we were killing 3 bosses a week until October (2 t2 bracers, belts, boots a week) and it took us until December to full clear.
---
So that's hardly a massive advantage that justifies you cheating in order to catch up
---
&gt; Yes cascading BWL allowed us to get more out gear but gear only took you so far.
---
Ah yes, just like steroids allow you to run faster than your competition, but you still need to train, diet right etc etc.
---
Ok mate, keep trying to justify your cheating
---
 *And Legion was doing fine compared to BfA* 
---
Thats like saying youre the smartest retard in the class. Good when compared to shit, but overall still shit.
---
 *Right now they're busy working out the bugs, organizing the stress tests and all, this is a lot of work, so I definitely would say they're clearly not the same kind of team.* 
---
So because they made a few posts, fixed some bugs (not nearly enough, according to beta testers) and changed up the release schedule (after making it very clear that they wanted/needed player feedback to get this right) Old Blizzard is back, right? This is exactly the kind of naivety that they eat up.

Everyone is rolling with authenticators these days.
---
Good, get in the back in your dress and heal stupid Pally.
---
We can keep complaining about high-level layering abuse until August :)
---
I think you may be right about exp only given when the map is revealed. Can't remember if it was that way in retail Vanilla, but it's probably the way it will be for Classic launch.
---
Thank you for looking into this - it's going to put a damper on my exploration plans.
---
Shove that chill pill up your arse.
---
It was in TBC for sure, later removed because no one used it I think. Then they brought back again sometime later.
---
Oh boy, so much drama centered around my warlock for some reason. I will share the time I ruined raid night - not 100% my fault, but I will take my share of the responsibility. Hopefully it won't sound too whiny.
---
My and one of the servers top guilds from vanilla had died, my guild leader worked to merge the two at the start of BC. At worst I was average with my warlock, never top dps, but also never last.
---
We had been progressing fine through the initial raids, but hit a brick wall in SSC. The elitists of the guild got a hard on for me and all the sudden every wipe was my fault because I wasn't top DPS. I let a DOT drop for a second or two and wouldn't hear the end of it. All the sudden I was kicked out of the raid and banned from voice without warning.
---
This was a time before you got teleported out of the instance when being removed from the raid. As you may have guessed, I didn't leave the instance. I wanted to know why I was kicked and banned but the raid leader wouldn't respond so there I stayed. Eventually I got gkicked which cemented my not leaving the instance. After an hour or so, they called the raid.
---
Lesson learned though. After that I changed back to my warrior and had some of the best times in the game.
---
My parents used to police my videogame time when I was a kid, but around age 14 they stopped. Used to be "no videogames on weeknights" during the summer. But since I got home from school at 2:30pm and they didn't get home until 5pm, I played every afternoon anyway.
---
Care to share your guide via google sheets?
---
Basically the officers will keep private loot lists to base decisions off of. Only reason to do that over pure loot lists is to gear up more optimally overall.
---
Main day is when everyone important is showing up, core 40.
---
Holy Wrath! Since you Will be doing crypts/sorrow hill and its all just undead.  And ofc a Holy light when wrath is on CD since you Will be pulling ridiculous packs when you have the proper gear.
---
lots of things, but you'll run into stuff that are just common things in german speaking culture that will seem really alien to non EU/Non german speakers. A few things:
---
* Germans and to a lesser extent other german speakers brutally direct to the point and their written english, if they are capeable of that, will often sound sinister, blunt or just weird because many germans that speak english use germanisms.
---
* \^\^, :D, :p
---
* Austria vs Germany rivalry, Bavara vs Germany and so on. A lot of tribalism between different german federal states and german speaking countries.
---
* Lots of insider jokes that someone from NA won't find funny but germans can't live without.
---
* Knowing what a Metigel is and how the mere mention will raise the morale of your raid.
---
* Baiting one Austrian in your guild into a rant by loudly announcing how you ate your Schnitzel.
---
* Baiting the swiss guy in /g by declaring that Ricola was not invented by the Swiss.
---
* Quoting jokes from german comedians/pop culture that need a lot of context that are really hard to grasp for outsiders.
---
* The one huntard that watched/read too much winnetou.
---
* Creative, german names for bear pets. Some examples: Hubschraubär, Himbär, Preiselbär....
---
* Allimania.
---
* Jan Hegenberg's song "Die Horde rennt" and the lesser known song "Die Allianz schlägt zurück."
---
* Intimately knowing your german speaking first world guilds. I still know that Tiara/orcish empire had the horde world first nefarian kill.
---
* Destromath was the largest Server for german vanilla and had the most competetive guilds there.
---
There is alot more stuff, but I think especially the last few points would have happened if there had neverbeen  specific DE Servers for wow vanilla.
---
I'm like 99% sure it had a time-limit. So you could level up to 20, but you only had the trial for like 10 days or something.
---
Paladin is strongest.
---
Just rogues and hunters mostly
---
Having been a casual player and barely raiding (which we used the DKP system for, when we did), I am unfamiliar with EP/GP.  Can you briefly explain what that system is?
---
level 1 warrior has the worst burst of any class.
---
I can't see them come back with a "hardware limitation" the community would be pissed, all we're asking is to put a "German" "English" etc after the realmname, they'd rather not add anything. 
---
While there have been enough posts about it there's one major difference, it's EU. Blizzard is known to flat out ignore any discussion on these forums.
---
And that's what many fear I believe, I hope we're proven wrong this time.
---
We will probably not see Classic plus content. 
---
That would mean blizzard would have to build a team around classic, they have one now but it's not really a design team, like artist, quest writers etc that would need to be brought on to create 100% new content. 
---
The problem is, is having two separate WoW teams working on two different products means that they're cannibalizing their own market and competing against eachother. 
---
Right now, classic is an augmentation, and a positive one to the WoW ecosystem. Which I think blizzard is happy with right now. 
---
Now granted, you could argue retail players and classic players are two separate player bases and will only increase blizzards share of the latent MMO playerbase. Numbers will be the deciding factor. 
---
If classic gets a huge and loyal following, bigger then say retail right now, we could see classic plus content. 
---
If it just becomes a niche spinoff of retail then our best bet is TBC.
---
Yup on private servers people pug AQ40.
---
Software eventually works
---
Idk if this qualifies as drama, but during warlords I convince a friend who has been super casual ever since cata to raid past normal. I found a guild that met both our times for raiding. Everyone seemed pretty cool. Guild master was a girl and raid leader/master looter was a dude. Pretty sure something was going on between them because of the amount of time they spent together. So the GM was a mageholic. She had 4 heroic geared mages and was working on her 5th. My buddy I brought to the raiding scene was a warlock. The first raid night we killed 4 bosses. Every single piece of cloth went to the mage. My buddy quit the next day and I completely understand. He hasn't raid past lfr since then either. I finally got him on about a week ago and we pugged 3/9 BoD. Idk why someone would want so many geared mages that they basically gimp all clothes in their raid team.

Less hoarding.
---
Hoarding basically means you're getting your big picks, and contributing less when you go a while without an upgrade.
---
Godspeed, friend. Looking forward to an update.
---
4th time guild was completing BWL, so fairly new at clearing the entire instance. We get up to Broodlord and beat him down to about 3% when our main tank dies. Chaos erupted and one by one he struck us down starting with dps and grabbing some healers. We were down to 2 healers and 6 dps, our rogue decided to be a hero and took aggro. He proceeded to  evasion tank Broodlord down to 0% That was the most tense 2 minutes of my life. Feels good man. Love those holy shit we did it? moments.
---
Happy to help, wish I had better news. Good luck out there, Horde scum :)
---
I agree with most thugs you've said,  except the inference in your op where it seems like because it's beta that it's safe to assume they're working on it.
---
Seen plenty of beta problems be reported to deaf ears at blizz
---
&gt;Listen, mon. Sometimes, people call good t'ings bad t'ings. Y'eva heard somebody say "do da bad t'ing"? Ain't no bad t'ing!
---
Ya, mon, ya stay away from da voodoo, but if a troll lady say she wantcha ta come get da voodoo, you go get da voodoo. Ya big idiot. 
---
Sure logically taking a step back its a different team and as many businesses shows different departments can have vastly different levels of competency, but at the same time I'm not going to blame anyone for being pessimistic as for a while now WoW beta's haven't instilled the most confidence.
---
The racials are fine the way they are, they actually make a ton of sense
---
Eh... it was pretty toxic at the start too  
---
Remember the classic forums during blizzcon?
---
I mean that's your opinion buddy
---
Just messed up spell batching, melee leeway and layering. You know, just the little things. But, sure, go ahead and praise Blizzard for tiny bug fixes.
---
Definitely, I get the impression that Blizzard is playing with us, announcing stuff like the  non language specific EU realms to keep us awaken, two months before the release is still a long time and they could announce fake stuff, just to let us react, protest and after few weeks announce they listened and changed their mind.
---
In the end, the hype would be even greater than before, people would feel so happy for winning such a battle :D
---
As a french, I signed the petition, not for myself but all the guys that can't or don't want to speak english
---
And I keep hope that Blizzard will announce more good news in the coming months!
---
shamans are not gonna be good healers for 5 mans. maybe a raid geared shaman healing a raid geared tank. aside from that, take whoever can fit the role you need. just communicate beforehand if you are going for a particular item and don't someone taking it. an item like hand of justice, for example. 
---
as a warrior, i preferred to take priest or druid for heals, rogue and mage for dps/cc and shaman for WF totem. that was my ideal comp. a hunter if a shaman wasn't available. cc was very important in 5 mans in vanilla. i hope they maintained that level of difficulty in classic.
---
Hasn’t there been multiple posts showing the leeway in classic isn’t the same leeway that was in vanilla
---
So with a layering system that is scaled properly it’s not going to be that easy to test and find somebody on a different layer than you. And if you do find somebody, and they are willing to help, there’s really not much you can abuse with it. You could potentially escape death from pvp? Or get another chance at gurubashi chest?
---
So we have at worst a few dedicated individuals able to have another chance at gurubashi arena for the first few weeks after launch but avoid potentially hours of server queue and hours of camping quest spawns. Sorry but if you think that tradeoff isn’t worth it then I don’t know what to tell you. If you believe layering violates the “classic experience” at launch then you’re forgetting that possibly millions logging in at launch did not happen during classic either
---
&gt;I prefer a Loot Council that announces who is getting what drops before you even step foot into the raid. Almost all of the drama happens because they don't bother assigning loot to players until it actually drops.
---
How does that work when you dont know whats going to drop?
---
that's fair enough indeed, but pessimism doesn't mean rage and irrational fear
---
talk a out the limits of addons with classic
---
everyone in this story comes across as an asshole.
---
Had a GL that was about 50 and he had a digital relationship with some 20yo girl. They would talk like they were in love (soul mate etc), especially him. It was like that for some months and then the girl stopped playing and he then found another 20yo that he did the same with. Guy was creepy AF in how he talked to them.
---
DKP that also awards for boss attempts.   
---
I like the idea of savings points to use on items I want. But do believe those who progress in new content should get points as well. Not just the guys on the farm content.
---
Honestly, an ideal 5-man composition wouldn't even include a Warrior tank. I'd rather have a Druid 5-mans.
---
That's still ridiculously dramatic for your friend's wife. Absurd, really.
---
on BfA sure, but that's a team that seems to listen well enough to feedback
---
It was bad enough that there was definitely a real-life rendezvous followed by a coming out of the relationship and all the guild/personal drama you'd expect from that.  She was ripe for the taking (like i said Flirtatious) but i don't understand long-distance internet relationship stuff.  8u
---
I fully agree with not insulting the dev team. And I did misread your post a bit a made some incorrect assumptions :(. 
---
And yes it’s being tested, but my point is that we don’t know what is intended design vs something that is being worked on. How complete it is vs how much more it’s going to be tweaked vs other issues. 
---
And I’ve read it being around from 1-2 weeks to a month or two. 
---
Either way, I want layering to be the best version of itself as possible. As do the devs. I just want to make it crystal clear that layering causing empty zones/cities is not good.
---
Looks like Classic's back on the menu boys!
---
They use a reserve system where you can reserve 1 item per raid. And non-reserved are rolled out.
---
true. it's been so long since we've not had the main Gbank I didn't even think of that. We always just logged into the gbank holder to get stuff. I guess people will have to mail in requests and have them shipped out once a day or something.
---
As someone who did a lot of premades on pservers going against a mage and being novad was really annoying so 2 points into imp sprint really helped counter mages. Just my 2 cents
---
A Phil is a healer
---
A Karen is a ret paladin
---
They need to bring back loot lag that would cause your character to freeze in looting pose when idle. It isn’t like Vanilla if you don’t have loot pose bugs!
---
Loot council hopefully.
---
Interesting, is that an in game mechanic or you need to trust people in the pug?
---
Ok,  awesome! I'm just trying to find reasons to go horde,  such a hard choice for me
---
There were a large number of unique quests unlike anything else in vanilla. Some required you to turn-in hundreds of items from corpses, in order to spawn squadrons of (flying) bat riders, or butt-destroying packs of elite ram-riders.   
---
Another quest involved holding an orb that allowed you to see enemy player on your map, but prevented you from mounting.  
---
Both the horde and alliance base were protected by a large minefield. This made it far more difficult to rush.  
---
The list goes on. It had a lot of cool ideas.
---
Ran into drama along those lines, though I still got my loot and stayed in the guild.
---
I believe we were doing loot rotations for class drops at the time. I was the newest rogue to the raid group, but had earned my place in the rotation (once you've raided enough, you get put in at the end of the class rotation, then move forward as people get loot and cycle to the back).
---
I passed on a few Nightslayer pieces once I was at the top because in my mind they were some of the less statted ones/less meaningful upgrades (I don't remember what exactly- I think I had passed on bracers &amp; belt maybe?). But that same raid, the chestpiece (I think) dropped and I spent my loot rotation position on it.
---
The next day, I get an angry whisper from someone else in the guild that another rogue (who, if I'm remembering correctly, was said player's mother) had been waiting for the piece I got as my first one for a long time, and I should have let them have it. Really boggled my mind- why did they spend their rotation position on other loot, then? And how was I supposed to know?
---
That said, it didn't escalate from there. We ultimately all got along, and I eventually wound up being the rogue class leader for the guild (...probably because I was in the same high school as the main tank and the guild leader, but still...). Other minor tidbit of drama: as the Rogue leader, I eventually had to write an essay on behalf of my team on the guild forums about how pissed I was that the first Dragonfang Blade the guild got went to a hunter when we had only had ~1 Perd Blade drop.
---
Some people like the idea of empty zones that they’ll be able to level quickly through and don’t care about seeing other players in general until max level. 
---
I want the other perspective to be heard as well, as often as is reasonably possible.
---
No way, I would never associate with a ret pally! Karen is banned, Kevin can have her spot
---
Knifey the rogue has the worst weapons, he shall have a new weapon if it drops
---
Healbot the pally has a lvl 50 chest, he shall have a new chest if it drops
---
Needsallthedrops the hunter still lacks the tranq shot. He shall get tranq shot.
---
Not sure about background lists but main raid days are just the raid days you expect people to show up. Not really a big deal when only MC is out but when you have 7 raids out + world bosses you typically assign 2-3 days that count towards attendance and the other days are off-raids where you don't have to come.
---
Yea I should have been more clear. I meant at max level. Say you are raiding as holy, what do you plan on doing outside of the raid? solo stuff to make gold is going to just be a time consuming progress in a healing spec is it not?
---
his... mom?
---
It is, thank you! 😁
---
Because you have decided on every item that can drop. This does mean that your loot council has to do a bit of work pre-raid.
---
Druid or war tank - 2x mages - healer - dps that can rez if the tank cannot
---
Could you point me in the direction of the 'people who lost their minds' over this?

---
The puggers don't get loot
---
one time, in UBRS, a hunter was like "where's my pet?" and then what seemed like every mob in the instance, all the way down to the trolls in LBRS, came rushing up and wiped our asses.
---
Guild LeaderDude fell in love with a priest in our guild - She was basically my big sister(10 years older) i knew for ages so i got all the details later.  
---
Even traveled to her place through the whole country because she agreed to a dinner.  
---
She then said he was a complete psycho and blocked him basically everywhere.  
---
Dude fell into "crazy depression" and destroyed the whole guild in the aftermath.  
---
A couple days later he revived the guild as a new beginning and he went full psycho afterwards trying to get any of the girls in the guild to date him.
---
Raid went well until that happened and it was hard for most to find new spots without going back in progress.  
---
In BC i started over on a new realm with the cool people from that guild and had luck with the new guild we joined over there.
---
Still friends with most of them to this day.
---
&gt; Like you are really pushing the mid 10s grind in loch modan when you could transition to darkshore for 12-18 and come back to do the 18-20 before redridge.
---
It's not really that bad, the only dicey part is the last defence of the kings land part with the 3 named, but throwing on a shield and prot stance it's actually not terrible, they are normal mobs so they don't do a ton of damage. The Loch in general flows really smoothly and it's a good place to break up Westfall (Since you can't really do all of westfall in one go, the later quests end up just being a tad too high)
---
Which booze quest? I might have missed that one. There's the Thandol Span quest you can't get until the level 30 which is why I do it later and there's also another quest you need assistance being able to jump to (either a mount of levitate, neither of which you can have at that point) but if there's another quest I missed or if there's another way to get to that booze quest if it's the one I'm referencing I'd love to add it!
---
&gt;I think it is a mistake to go ST at 30, I feel like you are better off at 32 and in the meantime do early hillsbrad, late ashenvale, maybe even thousand needles. But you actually don't do much on that first pass anyway
---
STV is right there by Duskwood plus getting the booty bay flight path earlier is helpful later on. In regards to hillsbrad if I went earlier I don't think I could do the last round in my hillsbrad section as I'd be too low level (namly the lions and the defias camps)
---
&gt; Jungle secret is not available in beta? 
---
Correct, at level 31 it wasn't available, I don't know if Classic has a higher level req or there's a quest requirement for it.
---
&gt;You don't pick the quest from the dead body down the elevators on the way to shimmering flat?
---
I didn't know about this, do you know the quest name? Could probably be added!
---
&gt;Also as you are walking from ratchet, you could already pick the quest at the shady inn for the march and redeem them when you go back to theramore directly. 
---
I could but I come from that direction anyways to get Hungry, Swing by the swamplight manor and do the stinky Escape Escort. Hungry needs murlocs and you do the murlocs and the turtles (which you get from Theramore from a quest chain starting at Stormwind) at the same time so there's no real benefit of getting and handing the shady inn quests early.
---
Aside from that there's a lot of quests to turn in at Theramore and I try to group them so I do all the turns ins together.  I also get limited on quest space and I don't know if I have the space available to carry 3 more quests through shimmering flats section
---
&gt;Why not do lost lingot on your 22-27 sequence, is there a prequest you don't pick before that, I forgot which one it is then.
---
That's the morbent fel chain. It starts in Duskwood and bounces between Duskwood, Menethil and Stormwind So it's just not possible to do all in one go.
---
I did. In cases where an item wasn't bid on (there was no bidding btw everything had a set price) and it was an upgrade for someone officers could force them to take it, but at a reduced cost. 60-70% of its full value cost or something like that. It was a long time ago. :)
---
Allow me to direct you to the comment section of the original video.
---
But if you take a Kevin then you have to have a smoke break after every boss!
---
Then why would they come?
---
Yea I can toss it on google sheets when I get home tonight.
---
Because they think they might get loot

Yes, what Greymane drama do you have?, I was horde on greymane through 2005-BC.  Our guild was run by a married couple too, but they were the least dramatic part of it all.  Actually really cool.
---
And then make a horde version for me.
---
To me it sounds great. Would be very handy to have built in voice chat instead of having to use some third party tool. I mean say you party up with someone to do some questing, no chance in hell you would bother with discord and whatnot but if there is a voice chat built in you can just click it and voila.
---
If they ended up going back to TBC as it worked previously, I'd quit and never come back tbh.  And I loved Burning Crusade when I played.  
---
But this experiment should really be going the Old School Runescape route, where new sidegrade content is added instead of just re-doing the whole WoW expansion cycle all over again for no reason.
---
I see how that works now.
---
Every boss has a drop table, so you know what its capable of dropping. You just assign all the gear before it drops and make that public to the raid.
---
Basically it amounts to just letting all the raid know when the Priest T2 shoulders drop, Steve is getting them. When this item drops, this other guy is going to get it first.
---
Am rolling a orc warrior just cause love the fantasy
---
I'm OK with that, I'm done with go go go go go BFA nonsense
---
DKP just straight up gives you points for raid attendance and sometimes other stuff like farming consumables for the raid or helping out in some other way. You then either have a fixed value for items which terrible, or you have a bidding system which is slightly less terrible.
---
God you guys have made me look more carefully at the Rogue talents (not that i wasn't already pretty deep in to it) and my god its hard to choose.  
---
Vanilla talent trees are part of what made Vanilla so great.  The choices are hard.  But i gotta say, the rogue stands out to me as one class in particular that just has nothing but great choices everywhere you look.  
---
I can't wait for August 27th.
---
Yeah I think there could be a new addon for that like Bagone or something. All request go through it and bank toone once logged on can auto fulfill with some filters for control.
---
If there's one change I like from retail, it's how they changed gathering professions so that you can gather anything at any skill level, but if you're below the "threshold", you just get 1/10 the amount. (in the form of smaller items that you can combine 10 to get 1 of the normal item)
---
So frustrating coming across herbs/ore that you can't gather yet because you're not high enough skill level.
---
If you want it to progress past Naxx you will absolutely have to have catch up mechanics. Hell ZG is a catch up mechanic. If you don't have ways to get up to speed it will be very hard to keep a population stable.
---
Why would this matter? Kek
---
You trust the raid leaders who use master loot to give out the loot.
---
49 Twink here.  We had such an amazing community that I never tried to do any end game anything.
---
Im all bout that pug life
---
AND devo aura!
---
Hunters for sure. I'm a rogue fanatic so I love what you can do with macros for them but I cant deny that other classes tend to have a lot more going on, especially with pets that have unique abilities.
---
The wolf mount running animations are atrocious...
---
Loot council
---
Poison rogue was a bug on the feenix servers. 
---
It was awful because they did like 3k dps which is good dps but they were wearing cloth and low stam gear so any melee mechanics happened in the fight they would die.
---
They did it by having 3 weapons and rolling 3 ranks of deadly poison with shiv.
---
For gold I think the idea is to farm the lashers in DM with holy nova.
---
That would probably get boring after a while though, yeah...
---
Yes they tried, Is it working like it was vanilla retail right now? Not yet. 
---
Will Blizzard change it to the way it should work? Most likely after all the feedback.
---
so you get mc gear when people run arround in aq gear! yay

Hey there, I came across this [Classic WoW 5-man Leveling Guide](https://youtu.be/F9frydWyhL8) and would like to do something like that. I played from early BC to WotLK and now am a legend dad (Hearthstone), excited to play Classic. Dungeon leveling would be only once a week, but reliable. Contact me via PM. Greetings, Mosar
---
I hear what you're saying. I don't know what the right solution is, I just hate when the 'old' raid in an expansion becomes trash that everybody avoids. Maybe they can put quests in it, spells, set items, I don't know what. Keep content as relevant as possible as long as possible, imo.
---
No, you don't understand how the quest line works. For fuck's sake.
---
First step is kill Broodlord, everyone in the raid gets this.
---
Then rep. The guild chooses TWO people to funnel all the rep to.
---
Then the 3 Scepter Shards. The Red one says "talk to Vael". Guess what? He's dead because you killed Broodlord which is the boss after Vael. So you have to wait an entire week.
---
There's absolutely no way a person is on step 3 with the shards before every guild that can kill Vael hasn't already.
---
So you do the Blue and Green ones, but the Blue one needs something off Ragnaros and Onyxia and they only drop one of them for the entire raid. So now Guild Member B is behind. No worries, they'll get it next week.
---
Raid resets, you talk to Vael. He says "kill Nef in 5 hours". You do. He drops ONE Red Scepter Shard. So now Guild Member B is even further behind, but at least the guild helped him get his Blue shard by clearing MC and Onyxia again this week.
---
That's 14 days, the War Effort is over. Gong can be rung in 5 days.
---
So on raid reset, you do BWL one last time, get the Red Scepter Shard for Guild Member B, and now you have two scepters. Gong gets hit.
---
There's no room for a guild to give a Red Scepter Shard to some non-guildie.
---
I was really against this but now I kind of don't care. If they go TBC then awesome I'll keep playing WoW. But if they go this weird custom route then great I'll quit WoW and switch over to Pantheon. Already torn between WoW and Pantheon but non-classic content would def tip the scales in Pantheon's favor. But fuck if TBC comes out followed by WotLK, then it looks like WoW for the foreseeable future.
---
Ya I wish they would. I just don't see them doing it unfortunately.
---
Not as much tho. you have alot of instant heals and other instant cooldowns  or buffs you can use to mitigate further  damage if you took a big hit.
---
In vanilla these dont really exist. Warriors might have shield block but that only affects one attack, without talents, and only priests has an instant ability which you can use on anyone to give yourself more time to heal them, power word: shield.
---
Fast heals have faster cast time on retail aswell.
---
Can you all just fucking wait till it comes out i mean its not even fucking out and people already talking like its irrelevant, you want a never ending wow go play retail if you want the classic experiance play classic
---
He's not your Buddy, Pal.
---
Lol take a chill pill, dont need to get all triggered on me.
---
## WOOSAH
---
Oh I did call it out as bullshit, but the guild leader and their friend tried to play it off like it was a mistake. Their excuse was "you'll get the next one for sure." That event bled a few members from the guild (after Rag died that night of course lol) because it was only a matter of time before it could happen again. Nepotism in a guild ruins the experience for the majority of members.
---
Sword of Omen and, Vanquisher's Sword,  but it has similar blade markings.
---
Vanilla experience is a screen full of addons during a a raid.  Part of raid difficulty was low res screen full of frames so you cant see the fire on the floor.
---
It was a historical pop culture event beyond WoW iirc
---
Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
---
Excellent choices!
---
Yes, I know this, but OP doesn't seem to. And it was still worth testing in the Beta to make sure they didn't scale.
---
I can see your point lol I meant that I didn't use that many back then so I was curious as to what other people planned on using
---
I had like 30 addons in the stress test, I’ll probably have more on release, but not much more.
---
You just setup a modifier key macro for each ability that needs downranking and then it only uses one bar slot.
---
And on the other hand, for some people $20 is worth saving a 10hr grind.
---
you just need it once to set up, after that you could farm the instance. 
---
But yeah, will see wether it is considered a bug or not

Have you finally been able to cast hibernate on your baby? Then this is the guild for you! 
---
We are currently looking for other mom and dads who are eagerly awaiting the release of classic and want to get back into it despite the debuff of parenting. We are hoping to create a guild that is a community for parents who enjoy playing and are looking for like-minded players.  A community that  understand each other's situation without the need to always defend themselves when they just cant come online, or miss a dungeon run and so on.
---
There are no requirements or expectations to raid or pvp, however this might be an option if there is enough interest as soon as people turn level 60. It is expected that the guild will be most busy after 8 pm when the little ones are gone to bed. So at the end of the day when you are tired of farming diapers or leveling your child, log in and come relive the classic experience with us!

more like "you dont like getting wet? dont get in the swimming pool"
---
Its enough that Blizzard cause it to be invisible to average player.
---
99% of people who buy gold are just poor and terrible with managing their own resources. Billy the Rogue that has less than 10g on 40 and can't afford his mount buying 100g for $ is a non-problem. On the other hand, there are some who have money and will to buy literally tens of thousands of gold, and even single such individual can have significant impact on server economy. However, identifying these people with modern tech is piss easy and they will be certainly immediately banned.
---
The more irritating part is the advertisement spam. Blizzard should make it impossible for low level characters to write in public chats and whisper anybody. Similar precautions should be applied to mails. In general, it is perfecly possible to nearly completely elimanate gold spam, its just there is often no will to do so.
---
No, mages get a great ring right in MC.
---
I think lfr would be awesome after naxx and not just that but make it crossrealm. I think classes need some rebalancing as well: for example give all hybrids passive that regens mana faster than what they are able to spend, warrior dps should be doubled and all paladin abilities should have built-in taunts. Each class could have kick and purge also. But there's one thing they would never do: no flying
---
30?! I don't think in all my years I've ever used more than 10 or so lol
---
Will they give me an RP-PvP server as well?
---
Yeah exactly what happened during the stress test. Had to explain to someone they were going the wrong way and then we ended up chatting it up bout life and all sorts of jazz. Was kind of cool and gave me that old feeling I got when I made good friends on mmos
---
Keep up the good work sir! You're a rare thriving 4 leaf clover in a vast field of dead grass
---
Only reason I am going to play Classic is to experience TBC and then come back to my real home.
---
&gt;during WoD
---
this is Classic. not WoD.
---
The things you buy at level 2 are usually able to be bought at 1, you just have to sell everything you spawn with. On lock I run around naked for a while cause I sell all my shit for level 1 immolate.
---
What techniques have you used to make things like that in paint.net? Thinking about making something similar to this for Quel'thalas with its Vanilla outline.
---
It's alright, it happens, reading is tuff haha :) I know, I know, but they're working on all options on layering for the first weeks and it's not gonna stick anyway so we shouldn't worry about it, the beta is not how live is gonna be, it's just a sandbox... I do agree on one thing: they need to communicate more on what's intended and what isn't!
---
Well it was during TBC.
---
I was the guild leader of a friends and family guild with 50% good players and 50% not so good players. After a night of raiding we were talking on team speak and I was distracted and disbanded the guild by mistake. I was using CT mod and there was an option to do /raiddisband and I accidently typed /gdisband. Afterwards we only invites the good players back and ended up with a much better team. Some people who weren't invited back were quite salty.
---
Maybe, or he's just uploading from a friend. I doubt Gummy would get a Beta invite after being issued a C&amp;D from Blizzard and being accused of intellectual property infringement.
---
J/K, we all know his bullshit was a scam to run Felmyst behind closed doors with Grizzly after receiving donations.
---
I plan on using ElvUI which is a combination of many many addons put together in a clean, lightweight design. There are a few I'll use on top of that like Auctioneer/DBM/Omen but that's the main one
---
That's some serious class hatred...
---
Same tbh, I barely used any addons beforehand, but I scrolled through a list and found so much shit I could use, there’s a lot of functionality missing from the base game that addons can fix.
---
Absolutely 100% yes. They're even on private servers, just check trade chat on any of the bigger servers and there are gold spammers. If they care enough to cater to the private server audience, I can guarantee they'll flock to Classic.
---
the original UI was so bare that you needed addons just to see DOT and HOT duration, Even cooldown in original vanilla did not have count down.
---
I only got to play TBC on very bad private servers. You know the ones that were active during TBC. Funservers and the likes. So many people say that TBC was the best time of WoW so I definitely want to try it out. 
---
Wrath I don't know, I played it a lot and I didn't quite like it. 
---
What would be cool is for Blizzard to implement a kinda "WoW Workshop" where you could make your own servers, like Overwatch. Kinda like private servers but not really since they would be hosted by Blizzard and you'd have to have a subscription. So maybe someone could make a vanilla server with wrath style mechanics and balancing. Or "fix" expansions like WoD, throw out the garrisons and the homogenisation of classes but keep the raids intact.
---
For the love of your raidleader:
---
DBM or something similiar
---
Threat meter. 
---
The rest I don't care what you do.
---
Pretty sure TBC has been the most popular and wanted private server  since...well forever. TBC classic would be extremely popular.
---
I KNOW HOW THE FUCKING QUEST WORKS.
---
AND IF THERE IS A WEEK WHERE GUILD &lt;SEMI-CASUAL SLACKERBOIS&gt; DONT HAVE A PERSON THAT IS ON THE GOD DAMN QUEST BECAUSE NOBODY HAS FARMED REP - THEN THEY CAN OPEN ONE SLOT FOR A PERSON FROM ANOTHER GUILD THAT PAYS THEM GOLD TO GET A SCEPTER SHARD IN THEIR LOCKOUT INSTEAD OF GOING WITH THEIR OWN GUILD LOCKOUT WHERE SOMEONE ELSE THEN CAN GET THE RED SHARD.
---
CAPISCHE?
---
Blizzard has an incredibly unique and interesting opportunity to try something new here for the MMORPG industry.  But god knows they are probably the worst company nowadays to try anything besides safe and boring.  
---
A real shame, too, because I think going the new route would be relatively historic in retrospect after a decade or so.  But the shareholders wouldn't care.
---
So what about WotLK? Most P-Server players play WotLK, but also most "F R E S H" servers fail due to whatever reasons, but surely not because WotLK doesn't have a great fanbase. 
---
Apart from this, Blizzard already said they are open to TBC and WotLK.
---
As a baseline 3% crit would mean 3% more dps, to be generous with synergies we can round this to 5%. So for a moonkin to be better than a mage they would have to do at least 80% of the DPS of another mage. It is up to you to tell me if you can reach that in your guild, but to me that seems like a high number.
---
Any game ever... cept vanilla wow lol

Not sure exactly what's been ported to beta yet haven't been keeping up
---
Personally I'd prefer and have more fun with a priest mage druid comp, given horde side. The thought of the wasted utility from 2 excess druids is too much for me. In addition to the druids utility, which is great, a mage+priest addition would give polymorph, shackle undead, counterspell, mind control, abolish disease, dispell magic (on friendly and enemy targets), detect magic, arcane intellect, amplify magic, dampen magic, power word: fortitude, conjure food and water, slow fall, mind soothe, mind vision, portals, frost nova, psychic scream, and the list goes on. 
---
I guess the question is if some highly specialized advantages such as shifting roles and 3 man stealthing outweighs the negatives of reducing your teams toolkit by 2 classes worth. I personally prefer to feel that no spell is redundant and as a team have a spell for every situation.
---
One of the group leaders gave his alt a weapon in ICC instead of my friend's main who was there every week. We all left and started our own guild over it.
---
We will have a min bid of 5 which is what you will get for each boss. If no one bids it gets dis enchanted. Also the monthly tax will help with people hoarding DKP. Use it or lose a %. The more DKP you hoard the more you lose at the end of the month.
---
It will be my first time playing Classic WoW. As a beginner, can I play a Paladin and be fine? I'm not new to MMORPGs at all, but I'm fairly new to WoW (1 month playing).
---
yeah DBM was like an attunment for any raid.
---
Exactly. Classic needs to be a place to preserve the original game for anyone that wants to experience it all again, or people who missed it and try it years later. 
---
If TBC is ever added, like the above comment stated just have people transfer to those ‘Expansion servers’
---
Same problem for me.
---
If your goal is to gear yourself up ASAP then take a healing priest, mage, warlock, and a druid who is specced kitty for 5mans but looking for resto prebis.
---
The only four categories for prebis are tank, physical dps, ranged dps, and healer. Everyone in the same category overlaps heavily w.r.t. prebis items.
---
Nope. Available at 1. I sell my hammer 1st thing and train it.
---
You're the one making the claim, how about some examples? Pretty much all the highly upvoted comments in the thread I think you're talking about are pretty normal. Unless you want to pick out stuff at the bottom of the thread and think that represents the community at large. 
---
Of course there's going to be idiots who don't know what they're talking about. You're just giving them undue attention and making the issue seem a lot bigger than it actually is.
---
Seems like a good fit for me, I would like to know what you expect in terms of when your members hit level 60, and if you would be willing to take on someone that has raided very little before. I will play combat rogue.
---
Let me guess, during the stress test you made a human?
---
WL gets Imp and Immolate at lvl 1.
---
100%.
---
There's always people who will not only try to cut corners and get something without putting in the work, but they generally also want it as cheap as possible, so gold farmers will be rampant.
---
This guy is super talented. His [Durator](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/w88VGY) one is fantastic.
---
atlasloot is really handy for dungeons. It tells you what all the bosses drop, (including those spawned by script, like mutanus the devourer), which is not only useful for improving your gear, but knowing what words to use to fill your group. (like "oh, we don't have anyone to roll on this blue bow, whatever will we do, hunter". You sure you don't want to go to the barrens?")
---
I also really like lazypig, just to help me clean my bags up, and I could not live without a unified bag mod like onebag. (it just assembles all your inventory space into a single frame).
---
Thanks for the read, I know there are hundreds of YT vids being made on this topic but I'm old school I guess.
---
willitclassic.com shows everything confirmed to be usable afaik
---
10% casting/attack speed is still a decent cooldown. More so if you can time it right. Nightelves get absolutely squat from their racials. Even their priest ability is completely garbage.
---
Loot whore Guild leader keeps himself as literally the only hunter in the guild, and found tonnes of reasons to not accept trials.
---
Guild leader miss's a night of raiding and I the warrior officer and MT lead MC raid, we clear the place in record time, likely thanks to the 10 trial hunters I recruited knowing the GM would be absent.
---
WE push hard and with a collection of trials and most the raid wearing little to no FR resist we get out first and only Rag kill.
---
Two trial hunters get a Pair of T2 Dragonstakler legs for there participation and we head to Ony, looking to keep the momentum going finish our entire raid week in a single night.
---
We get to Ony and pull her, mid pull our GM logs on and asks for an invite, one of the other officers do so because I'm tanking.
---
GM starts talking in Raid chat telling us to wipe so he can get summoned, and then moves up to discord the repeat what he's been typing.
---
We don't wipe, we actually have our cleanest ever Ony Kill on the same night we down Rag.
---
Again a lucky hunter gets a T2Helm and this is also when someone in Vent says something about Hunters being super lucky tonight.
---
Officer Chat pops up and our GM is suddening ranting like a petulant child for about 15 minutes before suddenly without warning our Guild Ventrilo goes down and our guild is disbanded almost simultaniously.
---
Guild is reformed less than an hour later by the former officers and we go on to clear BWL and most of AQ40 before TBC hit months later.
---
Our hunter GM earned such a bad reputation from that one instant that he was essentailly blacklisted on the entire server, no guild wanted him, and when he rerolled to a warlock as soon as his identity was discovered that warlock was blacklisted too.
---
I use Elvui right now, same with Auctioneer and DBM. along with a couple others but certainly not 30 like the fella above lol
---
Great, more alliance capital cities on the eastern kingdoms. That's exactly what we needed! :p
---
Ya. They only did classic because somebody else showed them it would work. Otherwise it would have never happened.
---
Can't be in a real raiding guild with no mic.  Doubt this very much.
---
Dude. Go look at posts on the sub from 48hours+ ago.
---
Bring back wall walking!!!
---
That simply isn't going to happen you condescending dick nugget. It's the single most rare item in the game. Any guild capable of killing Nef is going to take 2 nights off of raiding BWL and MC for the 20th time to get someone or two someones the rep.
---
Hell, let's say we live in the timeline where Blizzard doesn't care about cannibalization. What does Classic+ even look like? This "horizontal progression at level 60" stuff is hot garbage. It honestly legitimately agitates me every time I read it before I realize that since it will never happen it's not worth getting annoyed about. It's so fucking dumb though. **So dumb.** 
---
WoW is about vertical progression through and through, from the very first day. WoW is always about getting stronger, doing new content, getting new gear. The direction WoW has gone is largely the direction it was always going to go, bar some hiccups along the way. Like, think about it - people talk about how exciting it is to get their first grey shoulders. What the hell do they think that is? That's vertical progression. You didn't have something, now you have it, it gives you an improvement both in power and in terms of cosmetics.
---
Amazing how fanatical people were over guild pride.
---
Blizzard owns nearly every facet of any private server.
---
You're right that it's the safest, but it seems like such a silly choice. Assuming classic is successful, why not build upon it instead of going down the exact same path that ruined the original game? I'd rather they release separate Classic+ servers than TBC, and I'm saying that as someone who loved TBC. Classic just has a lot more potential.
---
All of these old screenshots really make me wish I had actually bothered to keep track of them over the years.
---
Dishonorable kills are only from NPC's. The only DHK greifing you can do is same-faction, as any dishonorable kills you get are shared with a party, so inviting someone to your group then killing an NPC is the only DHK greif possible
---
Our guild will be running loot council. The reason why has nothing to do with fairness of efficacy. It's because our officer core is lazy, and because our office know LC will make it possible to take whatever items we want -- in a timely fashion.  
---
Vanilla loot distribution isn't about tier loot. It's not about items that drop every week. Most of the time, it's not even about progression. **Vanilla loot distribution is about who gets the item that only drops twice per year**, even though 15 people want that item. These items are *rewards*, not necessities.   
---
How do you fairly distribute these rare rewards? Relying on the best judgement of a group of close friends is a pretty terrible idea. But creating a point system with perverse incentives is hardly any better.   
---
On a personal note, I'm (actually) an autistic person, which means I tend to be unpopular, even though I perform quite well in raids. If I wasn't part of the loot council, I would refuse to join an LC guild. Because I know popularity will literally decide the loot order for the items that matter most. And fair or unfair, I want those items.
---
I just realized World of Warcraft had the first edition of viral «Fortnite dances»
---
A voice of light in a thread of darkness, downvoted into oblivion. I upvoted ya brother, keep fighting the good fight!
---
Gotta say, I am greatly sceptical of the reality in which Classic concludes with Naxxramas, doesn't get any new content and people would play it indefinitely, or that people will stick with it after classic reset.
---
Only the most hardcore - and therefore *tiny* demographic - would be excited about it. People get tired of playing anything, eventually and history proves that, I think.
---
At some point the sheer *novelty* of Classic will expire, with progressively less people playing the game. That's why I believe they will at least make it a replay of 2004-2010, with a cycle of Vanilla-TBC-Wrath into complete reset starting back in Vanilla ad infinitum.
---
Please don't stop.
---
YEAH BUDDY
---
Is it ending?
---
Hey thanks for the civil and polite reply.
---
haha this is my favorite one.
---
???????????????????????????????????????? the whole point of the list is to know which servers they are on when they announce it????????????????????????????????
---
Actively searching for a group, traveling all the way to UBRS, clearing trash to the first or second boss and then ragequitting sounds like a good strategy in classic. That is the beauty of a fresh server and no instant dungeon group/teleport to replace everyone. 
---
A few wipes are still faster and I'd rather drop a few gold for repairing and get some sweet pre-raid BIS and potential epics &lt;3 Also can't wait for bugged hunter pets doing the Jenkins :&gt;
---
Honestly, an ideal 5-man dungeon composition wouldn't even include a Warrior tank. I'd rather have a Druid for 5-mans.

http://www.epgpweb.com/help/system
---
EP gained per attendance, GP gained per gear received.  Your total loot priority is thus: EP/GP
---
In theory I like the idea of this the most.
---
Retail isn’t that bad relax. A few changes won’t make classic become BFA. You are insane.
---
Nice google images.
---
Why would there be red everywhere? You think the whole town is melting?
---
Discord is better for this purpose and serves a ton of other purposes, including a better LFG than in-game text chat channels.
---
I don't want the in-game voice chat because it will give people an excuse not to join Discord.
---
I don't know if it's true that removing spell batching increases the responsiveness of game play. That's like saying that a quicker autoattack speed increases the responsiveness of game play. Batching is a mechanic, and people play around mechanics. It makes certain counterplay options a lot more viable.
---
Loot council.
---
It's very easy to keep a loot council honest, because every gear decision is public knowledge. You just maintain the full history of gear allocation in a google spreadsheet on behalf of the guild and publish the link to it in disc after every raid. One tab of the spreadsheet shows the distribution of loot awards by player.
---
When the LC knows that it'll be totally obvious to everyone if the allocation of loot is unjust they tend to stay honest.
---
Reverse image search it.
---
this guy goblins.
---
6K? Did he blew up recently that seems like a lot for him.
---
You can save the MCPs for important fights where you need some extra damage or if you feel like smacking down some rogues and warriors for once. Yes you can actually beat quite a few of them with MCPs, probably not the best ones but look up Shedo on youtube and watch his vids.
---
Not that early. Y’all PvP ranked.
---
Ah yiss, share Greymane drama pls. Been too long.
---
There were massive, bug riddled TBC pirate servers once, WoW S c a p e, for example, was jam packed halfway into wrath when it was shut down.
---
Then there was other server that was actually good, which names I cannot remember anymore, but it didn't have more than 2k players. I suspected at the time that it being a "Blizzlike" server with normal leveling process threw a lot of people off.
---
Druids can do more than just dps.

You just reminded me about how there is communities in vanilla too, or at least the stress test. Thats a yikes from me dog
---
I ran out of spaces to put zones

it's a raid
---
You're just the guy that keep having faith after getting screwed over 10 times. Good for you. 
---
Most of us are just bitter dissapointed and sad to have faith.
---
This is why you do not have a girlfriend.
---
I agree with point 5 the most. MMOs keep obsoleting old content which makes it even more difficult to keep up with an already expensive game genre. I want a wider experience of the base game, not the same experience in a different setting.
---
New talents that coincide with an exact number of new points that let you exactly get them doesn't make anything new. Instead you could add deeper talent trees to the same amount of point of vanila, or more mid level utility ability builds to allow more hybrid specs. Suddenly you have the original builds and new ones to choose from, instead of the same builds with a new ability with your 10 points.
---
ya i commented up above after looking through some other screenshots i think this one was actually feb or march 2006.
---
Nah im just sick of seeing this arguement
---
Yea, maybe I've just grown too accustomed to the internet but this sub especially can get a bit ~~bitey~~ zealous.

---
This is correct. I recall many times seeing someone (usually a rogue) roll randomly and then see a chest and realize that is what we are rolling on.  It is pretty much an unspoken rule in dungeons that everyone rolls on who loots the chest first.
---
I’ll check this out later !
---
Really in vanilla there is only one addon that is absolutely 100% necessary; a threat meter. I don't know which one it'll be on Classic but that addon is super essential in vanilla. 
---
A good boss mod is also nice to have but unnecessary until like late BWL and AQ.
---
Found my new name.
---
Leveling and gearing in vanilla was more difficult, but a lot of the difficulty with mechanics came from having little understanding of them and relatively few resources to reference. Obviously the internet was around, but there wasn't 1/10 of the current sites that specialize in  builds and guides. 
---
Classes are easier to play now, but you need to focus a lot more on the fight as a group which adds difficulty. Mythic raids are the equivalent to vanilla's raids, and add even more mechanically to the fights. It's easy to do a couple of LFR's and consider yourself raid-geared, but that would be like getting BiS blues in vanilla and thinking that's what being in the end-game is.
---
just not the same team, not the same project, not the same state and not the same philosophy, so I treat it differently, weird right?
---
why remove reports though? that has nothing to do with the gameplay experience...
---
If you do dungeons to sixty you'll get there faster than the vast majority of people.
---
It's entirely possible but there are issues, like getting very little rep.
---
They had to have their hand held throughout the whole process of vanilla. They wouldn't even have tried it, if people hadn't proven over and over that it could work. 
---
Something tells me they have become massively risk averse. What am I saying. Of course they are. Some of the original wow devs have even been saying the whole industry is like that now.
---
As someone from 3rd world i know i will be looking to buy game time for gold, i dont.play bfa and dont intend to but wow tekens are a blessing for some people
---
I pretty much use the clone stamp exclusively and recreate the zone form other similar areas, with a few paintbrush effects to fill tiny gaps and do a few outlines or paths.
---
These are the addons I'm currently using, not sure if they'll all exist in Classic. LazyPig is my particular favorite addon that I've never used before. I don't think I will play without it.
---
Bagnon - Bag addon. A must have. I won't play without it.
---
Luna Unit Frames: I love this addon. It changes your unit frames but also adds a lot extra functionality. Druid bar, totem trackers, reckoning stacks, showing predicited healing done, showing mana consumption before the spell goes off, etc
---
Auctioneer: Its what I'm using, but any Auction add-on would be fine. The default AH is just really bad.
---
Improved Error Frame - Helps with error messages caused by addons
---
Cartographer - Amazing map addon
---
Bartender - Action Bar addon
---
LazyPig - Auto repairs gear and sells Gray items in your bag when you talk to vendors
---
OmniCC - CD counter
---
Atlas &amp; Atlas Loot - Dungeon map and loot tables
---
BetterAlign - Nice grid overlay for getting your addons in the perfect spots
---
EnemyCastBar - Shows cast bars of enemies
---
DoTimer - Better way to keep track of dots especially on multiple targets
---
MobInfo2 - Shows mobs health, exp, how many you'd have to kill to level, average currency drops, etc
---
MoveAnything - Lets you move any aspect of your UI
---
Questie - Shows objectives on mini map, but my favorite part is that it has an arrow that points you towards your corpse so you don't have to open your map
---
Keep em coming bro you know you want to
---
Our guild master left his wife for another girl in our guild, abandoned his kids and moved in with the other girl.  Guild found out and the whole server actually blacklisted him aswell.  He moved to another server but we figured out his name and kept after him.  He wound up quitting wow and his ex wife became our new gm.
---
10k players is nothing. you dont need layering if thats what you get per server.
---
few years ago when nostalrius was a thing i remember checking how many players were playing online and at peak it was 10k  and never did i have trouble questing nor did i see so many people i would lag out, layering didnt exist. (as an earlier comment said they were spread out)
---
And when it comes to population stats, private servers are scuffed on that so you can just write /who in the chat and literally get a number for every player on the server... not just your faction or the area.  So thats one "good" thing about pservers.  
---
They never have to keep layering... when they remove it the only thing that will happen is a login-queue instead. And we had login queues in vanilla too.  
---
What other negative-effects would it have?
---
they better if they want my money
---
All it does is read the combat log. It works just like any DPS meter addon. They can't break it, because it would break every top addon out there. 
---
It's a simple combat log parser. When players use stealth around you, that shows up in your combat log if you have the filter enabled. This is default vanilla behavior. All the addon does is watch for things like this, estimate the level of the player based on the rank of the skill the combat log sees, and broadcast this to you very loudly.
---
You are delusional
---
Welcome
---
Fair play for having it though. Mine are long gone, even from legion. Too many upgrades over time.
---
I think we started out with... um... CTRaidAssist then bigwigs? then DBM sort of became standard but I dont remember when.
---
Pretty easy but time consuming since you wont be able to quest 1-20. Just grind mobs in enemy zones until 20, then level in contested zones as usual.
---
There won't be wow tokens in classic, they have confirmed that.
---
So you better bet your sweet ass gold farming is coming back with a fucking vengeance!
---
omg, I hope she got some RL help. They have socialized mental health in Australia... Also, if you have dreams of holding your own Hand of Rag as a healer. maybe not?
---
Which private server? What?
---
Hyjal!
---
I'll port it myself. It's a simple combat-log parser and works just like any DPS meter.
---
Yeah I hear ya, Elvui does that for me. I completely understand, I watch some youtubers and most of them don't use any sort of bad addon and it drives me absolutely insane lol
---
Quest helper
---
Swing Timer
---
Energy Tick Timer (If I go rogue)
---
DBM
---
Threat Meter
---
Maybe I'll dabble in a UI addon, but I don't generally like them.
---
It was Quel'Thalas EU
---
If they were to make changes, I feel they would definitely leave some servers at 1.12 forever
---
They use a lot of hacked accounts for this kind of thing.
---
A potato could run this
---
Because master looter (aka loot council), as I said in my post that I assume you read, is an archaic form of corruption.
---
Most of my retail mogs were using stuff from vanilla.  Specifically my hunter has the black dragonscale set mogged and it looks dope.  Old armor sets look just fine on the new models and again, if it were a toggle that people could use it wouldn't hurt the people that want old graphics and at all and let people use the new graphics if they wanted.
---
I was an officer and part of the loot council in my old guild. We had a rogue who always seemed a little standoffish towards me and I wasn't sure why. One day I'm chatting in vent with a few members and I mention the rogue. We are talking about skillful players and I mention that our rogue is the best pve rogue I've ever seen in any raids and how fortunate we are to have him. Turns out one of his friends was listening to us talk and reported what I said back to him. His demeanor changed overnight. Turns out he assumed I didn't like him because he was Asian and that I was voting against him in loot council channel because of that.
---
I didn't know he was asian until someone shared this story with me after the drama was cleared up. I'd really love to raid with the old gang again!
---
Thorium Brotherhood??

Agree, the coolest Horde city in my opinion (undercity), was an alliance city (lordaeron) before it was such. Guessing a lot of the designers rolled alliance lol

Works fine until they have one of those letters like Á which is a PITA to type.
---
I played through all of vanilla, and the start of TBC, using the official Blizzard interface. Had my first Gladiator title before installing a single add-on. That might sound like playing blind, but it allowed me to develop an excellent sense of timing and game awareness.  
---
With that said, I'll probably run Bartender and the new version of LazyPig. (Assuming Classic allows for it -- LazyPig includes some quality of life improvements, like automatically dismounting when you cast a spell.)

---
Awesome responses so far! Just the information I was wanting to know.
---
Usually about 30-50% of the raid is from the guild or people you regularly host pugs with so you reserve a few items for them. Then you usually have a +1 system where if you win an item you get +1 and you can't roll on more items unless everyone has +1. This is typically reset before last boss so that people actually take the upgrades. Sometimes not though. I remember healing on my paladin and I wanted to collect items for PvP ret. Every rogue/warrior wanted the Nef items so I just hoovered up like 5 items before Nef. And of course Neffie dropped the usual crap he always drops on private servers. 
---
You can also run with gbid, it's a nice way of making some extra cash when your guild outgear the content you're pugging.
---
All it does is monitor the combat log. It works just like any DPS meter addon. They can't break it, because it would break every top addon out there including DPS meters.
---
It's a simple combat log parser. When players use stealth around you, that shows up in your combat log if you have the filter enabled. This is default vanilla behavior. You can see this without any addon, and most players keep their combat logs open in PvP just for this reason.
---
All the addon does is watch for things like this, estimate the level of the player based on the rank of the skill the combat log sees, and broadcast this to you very loudly.
---
No, all the lore beside that "here be Gilneas" was written for Cataclysm and then tangentially expanded upon with the release of the Chronicles book series.
---
Discord is going to take over so much. There will be a server for every realm's faction and you will be doing yourself a disservice by not joining it. You'll already need Discord for your guild, so not wanting a new app is no excuse. 
---
Discord is searchable, sortable, pingable, can be easily moderated, has an in-game overlay, and is just superior in every way to the built-in game chat.
---
I honestly expect all serious LFG and Trade chat to migrate over to Discord, as it's definitely more popular on the Beta than /world and with the population skyrocketing on launch day, everyone's going to want a way to filter that shit.
---
I have every intention of hiding all in-game chat channels beyond say, whisper, guild, and party/raid. For anything else, there's Discord.
---
Dynamic respawns did exist in vanilla tho. Weve known this for a while, they just werent as aggressive as weve seen on retail and pservers.
---
[Kevin Jordan confirms it.](https://clips.twitch.tv/TolerantRespectfulHerbsKappaPride)
---
Until I hit 60 just a quest add on to lead me in the right direction of quests.
---
I despise that tbh. Ok..its good to make money. But the profession kinda loses its appeal. And if you work on it , you can have major profit the way classic is.
---
These reads very much like Monty Python!
---
Its statisticallyaverage time to 60 was around 10 days played on the nost stats. Thats whats being refered too here. 
---
You can find the stats on one of nanos many interviews. He showed classicast the stats in his first interview with them if that makes it easier to see the source for yourself. 
---
Now i feel like you are the kind of person to throw shade on a private servers. That being said i feel these values will be emulated in classic as private servers are a "reasonably" close recreation to true vanilla with people coming in of differing interest levels.
---
RP-PvP servers.
---
I've always really wanted to see more zones that were entirely underground. In WotLK the Nerubian city was originally intended to be an underground one. Sadly, we wouldn't see this implemented until cata for Deepholm. 
---
So in vanilla wow, coming from a huge WC3 lore nerd, there were a few "zones" I really wanted to see, and top of the list was Grim Batol, the lost dwarf mountainhome. I never really knew how it would play out until Legion and Suramar City. Imagine an entire city zone, but an underground dwarfy one.
---
If memory serves the key to long battles was the fact that NPCs were so much stronger. You couldn't run into a bunker by yourself, kill all the archers, and cap it.  You couldn't mob the end boss with 20 guys and burn him down. You had to very methodically march up field and take all the objectives. And since it was so linear, your opponents had a clear idea of where to stop you.
---
I could be misremembering, feel free to correct me, but that's what I recall.
---
Even if they implemented the old version of AV very few wants to spend hours and hours turtling in AV. You want the rewards and for that you just zoom past the enemy team and zerg down the boss.
---
Honestly, probably not. It’s nostalgic, and fun, but it’s one of those things where we have more knowledge so it is unlikely it will play the same way it did.
---
what the actual fuck
---
There are gold sellers in retail wow where gold has less of an impact on the game as a whole than in classic. Of course there will be sellers.
---
Thorium Brotherhood?
---
&gt;Tichondrius
---
I wonder if she was the reason all the alliance left Tich?
---
They  never could. druids dont use weapons when attacking in animal forms so having windfury is pointless because it will never proc.
---
Chad has the sexy voice on discord tho.

AV games had lobbies that were open for longer than a day but there were like 12 people in them. There seems to be a weird distortion on what happened during AV. It was only done consistently during it’s extra honor weekend. By the time you do one Altrec Valley, you could have done 5 WSGS. Unless you are wall glitching to the final boss (which was like every game). But doing that also means you miss out on all the extra honor from towers and shit. Meaning you got less honor than doing one WSG. AV can give potentially large chunks of honor only if you do everything. Remember, the tower buff didn’t exist then, you could just immediately run to Vann/Drek and pull them. People were bitching back then that AV was too short, which is why the initial Burning Crusade patch gave the tower buff giving extra health and damage for each tower. 
---
Altrec Valley was only popular on the weekends and If any game lasted more than 5 minutes dozens left. No way you are going to climb ranks by doing hour long AVs. Waste of time. It will be popular initially because the 20 year old kids do not know any better, but that’s it.
---
The thing you are confusing yourself about is that this isn't "streamer culture" you are complaining about. It's just western culture in the late 2010s and what we have evolve into as a society. All these complaints you have are simply complaints about Gen Z and Millennial behaviors, and really have nothing do with streaming.
---
A few wipes could be groups making small mistakes and what not, a shitty tank is going to end in traveling back for repairs if you don't have the perfect dungeon group. I've had enough experience with shitty tanks and good tanks back then to figure out if the group will get past the first boss. If the DPS is on point with CC they can make up for it, but if not it is better to leave as a healer. Constantly wiping because a shitty tank takes more time than finding a new less shitty tank as a healer. Especially if you have a lock in the group and one other person staying. It is all judgement calls on what you think is worth the time. If Classic does stay frozen in time and you aren't planning on pushing toward end game in the first couple months, new tanks will always be available as a healer. 
---
When I played DPS, I dealt with what I could get...so, maybe that is the difference.
---
4 mages and a paladin/priest 😅
---
But the legs didn't move right in that dude's video, this is a P0 issue and the game is DoA without a fix
---
Software enhanced voice lol
---
This will get buried, but it has stuck with me for over 10 years and might be a cautionary tale for at least one person.
---
It's mid-TBC and I'm looking to finally get into some raiding as an MT along with my cousin, Ryan, who plays a resto shaman. We'd recently transferred servers from Hellscream to Ghostlands and it seemed that most guilds were transfer wide and pretty set on core raiders. However, we eventually found a small guild regularly clearing Karazhan that needed a new MT after the previous stopped logging. This guy wasn't kicked due to inactivity and held an officer slot for over a month of offline time, remaining the warrior class leader throughout my experience of getting geared through Kara. I didn't mind, as I had a blast with this tight knit group running Kara for 3-5 hours each week. Watching Ryan and I go from two dudes wiping in Shadow Labs to being able to carry heroics was nice as well.
---
I could write a few paragraphs on how much we loved this guild, we'd basically spend every Saturday chilling and shooting the shit while we cleared Kara and dungeons to prep for 25 mans. I'm sure I don't need to go heavy into detail, everyone here probably knows what I mean when you just click with a guild.
---
 Eventually the guild leader asks if I'd like to be an officer, and I happily accept. These people were my homies and I was thrilled that they thought I deserved the position. Through some crazy twist of fate, the missing MT logs in THE NEXT DAY. Dude claims he got into a car accident overseas and needed the time to recover. Officers are all weirded out, but we laugh it off and shrug, we need a few more tanks for 25 mans anyway, right? 
---
Apparently not. Dude has been online for maybe an hour and is already blowing me up about how "shittily" I gemmed my gear. I honestly blame myself for everything that happens after this because I should have just talked to the guild leader to nip this in the bud. Enhance sham in guild is very openly gay and old MT waits maybe three days before harassing the poor dude about it. I'm not trying to turn this story into some PSA, and maybe he was concussed or something and not just a douche, but then the "guild girl" starts complaining about harassment as well. Within the week about 10 people have gquit and I never see them again. Guy broke up a guild in like 4 days.14 year old me was taught a harsh lesson on how ephemeral friendship can be. 
---
Anyway that's my rant. Just try to have fun and not take the game so seriously. My girlfriend and I decided we're ganna just try to make friends and leave raiding to the more hardcore players.
---
I was about to ask the same question
---
but that's already got a vanilla design, they one they put in vanilla, I would just add like town or something
---
nobody else's utility applies universally either, aside from your 16 debuffs which you can even argue aren't universal because if you have a lot of pugs your debuffs are going to get messed up anyway. outside of that utility is all fight specific. also you would use expose in 5 mans when you don't have a warrior which is surprisingly frequent while leveling and sometimes even after level 50, especially since there's been a wave of people pushing feral tank meta lately.
---
Paladin then Rogue imo.
---
And it appears that most of the people playing in the beta are near no-lifeing the game. I expect it to take me near 3+ months to hit 60.
---
Long time ago there was the small little german town Braunschweig. I was going to buy tbc on release, there was a late night event with at a unusual opening time. I did think some mad people like 10 or 20 but when they opened the doors we were a horde of 100+ people. The staff had taken stance behind a barricade directly behind the main entrance, heavily guarded by security with piles of tbc boxes behind them (That was before online purchasing was big, kids.).
---
They had no chance, the horde stormed, it was hilarious and on a nerd way glorious. This horde were the glorious ancestors of the pc masterrace and no one could stand between us and the first addon of wow.
---
It would be fitting to have some sort of refugee camp somewhere between Greymane wall and Gilneas.
---
GUYS I FUCKING HATE THESE DOZEN OR SO INTERNET PERSONALITIES AND THEY MAKE ME SO MAD WHY DO PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THEM SO MUCH 
---
CAN I HAVE A PLACE WHERE I CAN GUARANTEE NO GAMEPLAY WILL EVER BE RECORDED (no such thing as recording in vanilla btw, pvp videos were drawn out frame by frame btw) BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO DEAL WITH FANBOYS (no such thing as fanboys in vanilla btw)
---
Edit (NOT DONE BEING MAD): WOW YOU FUCKING LOSERS ARE GETTING REAL UPSET ABOUT THIS LMAOOOOO 
---
I’ve played high skill dota for a year now. I’ve played with many streamers indirectly, some of which have been immensely popular and some of which have actually flamed me. I have never once been attacked by any of the fans of these streamers, the worst I got was some dumb spam in twitch chat directed at me that I saw in the vod. In all seriousness, don’t worry about the streamers; the chances of you inadvertently rolling on a (big) streamer server (asmongold, sodapoppin, Esfand) is low, and if you’re worried just join world chat and see how many spergs are spazzing about being invited to a streamers layer.
---
Also, I’d worry more about guilds like &lt;APES&gt; than streamers “ruining” a server. A group of talented players eating and breathing wow all rolling into a super guild is much more likely to damage the server than some 2k viewer streamer getting sent items every once in awhile.
---
may i ask what job you have that you enjoy every single aspect of without even a minor complaint?
---
My first real guild on my first server had this one girl that joined early on and got real popular real fast just being real flirty in the guild chat.  There was a couple other girls in the guild and they were all playing female nelves and always joking about sneaking off to ERP ect.
---
It was all pretty harmless, but you could tell a lot of the guildies would get hot and bothered listening them them ramble this stuff around, though the two girls that were originally in the guild had boyfriends that were also in the guild, but this random third girl that joined nobody really knew.
---
That was fine, most of us didn't know each other.  This was one of those guilds that just kinda formed and grew organically, we didn't move together from another game.  She was super into the realm forums too and like I said she just had a real flirty "teehee" personality and posted a TOOONNN.
---
She was pretty well known on the server, Horde would usually "pet" her and stuff instead of gank her (was a pvp server) ect.  This went on for a few months and I remember when we were starting to get more serious with our UBRS runs to get everybody their blood and starting to do MC she was SUPER resistant to getting into voice chat.
---
Turns out it was a guy all along.  Not to ruin the story but I legit don't remember how it got revealed, I just remember finding out thast she had cyber'd with quite a few people in the guild and on the server in general.  Still kinda weirds me out lmao.
---
Last private server I played on I had tons of addons. Am really particular about my UI and spend a long time setting everything up to my liking. Also when it comes to macros I use a lot. 
---
 For classic my understanding is that old macros and 1.12 addons are not going to work, correct? If so I guess I will start out with zero addons and as I go slowly add in addons as they are made.
---
Tauren master race
---
Funnily enough I had a similar experience, Eye went to easily one of the least deserving people in raid, literally everyone aside from the person who assigned the eye didn't want to see it happen.
---
But the guild got their revenge in the most petty of ways, the mats needed to craft Sulfuras to combine with the eye were stupidly hard to gather solo.
---
I was both an officer in the guild as well as the bank character that held all the Blacksmithing mats, meaning I had everything nesiccary to make the weapon.
---
I refused to use the mats to make the weapon and when I was threatened with being kicked I /gquit before he was even able to finish his threat in Vent.
---
The guild didn't disband but it lost it's core raid group.  Most of its tanking capable warriors, almost every healers, pretty much everyone who disagreed with who got the Eye of Sulfuras.
---
I do believe that the warrior never got his Legendary made.
---
Once you start the channel you don't need los or facing target
---
Depends if you want maximum damage or if you want to be safe (and slow and steady). Also it’s important to realize what everyone needs as a few comments said before. Sure you could have 3 warrior dps and a warrior tank and blow through it, but you’d have to run far more times and it wouldn’t be worth it.  
---
I’d say ideal comp would be Mage, Rogue, Hunter for DPS, then Warrior for tank and either Priest or Shaman for heals. I’d prefer Shaman, as they just have more utility over raw heals compared to Priest, but it won’t matter that much. Having Ankh for wipe recovery is nice as well.
---
No it'll be somewhere in between the zerg that happens in retail and the original AV.  In 1.12 it was common for games to last several hours and that's what I expect to see in classic.
---
You get significantly less.
---
This is a stupid opinion. "There are other bugs so your bugs shouldn't get fixed!" Actually Pepega
---
Shaman without a doubt. Rockbiter/LB for damage output and Healing Wave to outlast anyone, though healer vs healer is always going to last until one of the healers makes a mistake.
---
I'm sorry if that post came across that way, although I'm not quite sure why. Try reading it again in a calm and airy way as that was how it was intended.
---
Fair enough i guess im not on this subreddit enough to notice the blizz hate, but i guess thats common for most subreddits. People tend to use them as dev-pinatas..
---
However i do wanna add that talking about  mechanics such as layering and other things that might come off as nit picky to a younger audiance. Is necessary for blizzard to be able to deliver a true vanilla like experience.
---
Nothing, now everyone Shhhhhh! :)
---
A thousand "simple fixes" for everything wrong with DKP.

You know it's a true story because it's a hunter stealing your herb. As if stealing your mob tags and your loots wasn't enough. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

&gt; It was added on purpose to combat latency, which was a huge problem in 2005.
---
Spell-batching was also a technological implementation, like debuff slots, so... that's a huge can of worms!

I love these dilemmas.

"There are two truisms in software development: Every piece of software has bugs in it, and every piece of software can be simplified. Taken to its extreme this means that every program can be reduced to one line of code that doesn't work."

I loved this in BGs when you fist the enemy after killing them and then you spend the rest of the BG jumping around in a little crouched animation.
---
If it was about vertical progression alone there would only be one zone for each level bracket, wow used to provide many routes to reach the end, until raiding at least
---
&gt; black lotus spawning every few minutes instead of hours
---
I don't know any pserver that has Black Lotus on dynamic respawns.
---
We’re still a month or so out from the launch. Level cap is gonna be raised.
---
there is a big difference between "max efficiency" and "literally walking past free XP". clearly efficiency isn't the name of the game if they want to grind dungeons with 3 druids, efficiency wasn't even in the convo until you brought it outta left field
---
Most infuriating thing is to get interrupted by someone else who completes the gathering before you do e.g. if gnome had started to gather that before you did while being behind the rock.
---
Teams that want this will get stomped by teams that just go for the win.
---
Matchups between two teams that want this will be super rare and since there will be no way to communicate their wishes, one side will just end up rushing anyway.
---
and? how is that relevant to what i said? isn't OPs post mostly about leveling/doing dungeons as a 3 man druid team? i must have missed the part where they talked about anything level 60....
---
Why does it say powershifting is a bug? That didn't get changed till end of TBC so powershifting should be usable in classic.
---
Have some cake today amigo!

Sounds exactly like the kind of gameplay I would like. I don't necessarily want to chat about so much outside game stuff but voice is much better than having to spend time typing everything out. Also for stuff like dungeons, world pvp and whatnot you really can't type during so a simple voice chat would be fantastic addition. Wouldn't ruin anything. It's just a handy way to talk without having to use a third party tool.
---
The npcs in the room with the general also stacked differently iirc. So it was almost impossible to survive for even a short amount of time with them being around. They somehow buffed each other to ridiculous levels if I’m not being mistaken
---
People are panning this comment, but I agree it's the grown-up thing to do.
---
are you guys just no changes through and through or is there something else?
---
WHY THO
---
that is such garbaj....totems are like the coolest part of shamans. why the fuck would they take them away?
---
Nobody thinks its gamechanging. Instead its immersion breaking... people who play rogue will be using stealth alot so it would be a significant difference in how their gameplay looked like in 2005.
---
The reason they are reverting it is for authenticity sake... just like they disabled new character models and added a Classic-option in the graphical settings.
---
Considering Classic is on modern client they could easily just have modern character models ingame aswell but they choose not to... because that wouldnt look right. Modern characters next to 2004 mobs? eww.
---
So its the same thing with animations, they will try to recreate vanilla as close as possible.
---
This makes me giddy. I love them for listening and working so diligently. I’m glad I didn’t get beta access. I am so damn excited to revisit all the old school places and find my favorite trees!
---
No. It's the first pass you've paid attention to.
---
&gt; But the profession kinda loses its appeal
---
...the appeal of gathering professions is finding herbs that you can't gather yet?
---
Crazy that WoW created those situations... I never knew these things happened with the game
---
If the stress test is any indication probably not. Will be 45 min to 4 hours most of them. I did do a 10 hour one but it’s the longest I saw by far.
---
Where did you download the addons from? My understanding is that old 1.12 addons doesn't work on this new reworked classic version, is that wrong?
---
Yes and no. They’re pretty handy to have if you’re leveling solo, and you can make some neat gear when you hit 60. That being said, saving the cloth/just having skinning and giving matsto other people leveling tailoring/LWing will likely get you whatever niche pieces you’d really want while also having an open profession. If you’re leveling a pally and warrior it can sometimes be cool to have a blacksmith so you can double down on created gear, but other than that (and other stacks rocking two people that use the same type of armor) it’s not super useful compared to extra money.
---
Healbot, recount, DBM, gatherer, auctioneer, questhelper, and a threat meter as well as a map addon.
---
That Ally is aboot to die, trying to block that shield. Roll out the way son. You ain't blocking that gorilla.
---
I don't know what people expected him to do, I could get if he didn't hold his tongue at first and made a fuss but later on during the TBC run they just expect someone to go off on one over bloody WoW party chat of all things?
---
...im american? why did you randomly assume in scandanavian just because i mentioned those countries
---
Nice spaulders, smooth-skin.
---
Because /who doesn't care about layering which makes it very easy to play with
---
Current wows AV is basically 1.12 AV except for reinforcements i think. So its shit
---
I think there'll be demand for TBC and Wrath. 
---
TBC was peak WoW gameplay before the homogenization/casualization with Wrath.

 **&lt;Songflower Serenade&gt; is a PST/Late Night Raiding Guild
---
[H][PvP][NA][Hardcore][Tues/Wed 8pm-12 PST (11pm-3am EST)][Loot Council]**
---
* **Ideology**
---
Our goal is to offer a balance between time, efficiency, culture, and the WoW experience. Like-minded individuals interested in a fun atmosphere who can bring their A-game in raids are encouraged to apply.
---
Farming consumables, BiS gear (including PvP ranks), and other materials for top raid performance is required. The time commitment will be fairly hefty with ~8 hours of raiding each week (probably less with just MC out), 8-16 hours for farming, grinding gear, and helping guildies achieve their goals as well. We must use our knowledge of Classic WoW to position the guild to clear content quickly.
---
* **Requirements**
---
Consumables and BiS gear are required for raiding. Deep knowledge of your class, the ability to perform under pressure, learn strategies, implement strategies, research &amp; understand encounters prior to raid, give and receive constructive criticism, and bring a positive, calm attitude is paramount to our future successes.
---
* **Loot System**
---
Loot will be determined through a Loot Council. Most loot will be decided in council spreadsheets before zoning into raid. Wish lists and discussion between Raiders, Class Leaders, and other Loot Council members will be considered. Loot priority will be determined by reliability/raid attendance, raid performance, consumable use, effort into Pre-BiS and other gear, overall guild contributions, attitude, etc. Each raider will begin with a blank slate, and previous retail or private server achievements will not be taken into consideration when determining loot priorities. 
---
**To apply, ask questions, or chat join our Discord:** https://discord.gg/RdxMTs
---
Looks good! :)
---
Addons from live sometimes work, but 1.12 addons won’t work. Some addons have gotten updated for classic though which is what I used, there are a few websites but I personally used willitclassic
---
Then its safr to say that it will take you a year in classic
---
Bro wtf is wrong with you? You will have your shitty graphics as long as you want to use them, it won't affect you in any way or form.
---
I do t know the correct theoretical answer because I never bothered researching it. Rogue gearing is extremely straight forward. 
---
Pre raid you aim for all the hit you can get (devilsaurs, MotF, truestrike, blackstone ring etc). After that, you grab every single piece of tier gear you get your hands on, the only exception being that the devilsaur set should not be replaced for pve until you get both T2 legs and T1 gloves. 
---
As for off pieces, these are also self explanatory for the most part and usually involves hit.
---
Hunter. Skinning and dragonscale leatherworking.
---
ok thanks will check out the site
---
Yeah but the way this guy described it, it really wasn’t as necessary to complete the BG in the early days of AV. It wasn’t until they added more rewards for finishing the BG that everyone started rushing through it. I feel like they could reward you based on your amount of time in the BG as well as how well you did while you were there to counter the need for rewards just for finishing the BG. Anyone can stick around for a half an hour to reap the benefits of a winning team.
---
Probably the alliance's effort to reclaim Gilneas will intensify in the expansion after bfa
---
It still 2 months till release. Try it on a private server if the 25$ are a concern to you
---
There were also about a trillion mines on the ground in front of both bases, and mechanics to replenish the mines.
---
That's lvl 58 players playing purely for fun with no rewards in the game. Once people realize that winning or losing quickly is a lot faster honor and reputation, that playstyle will be played because it's rewarded.
---
make a druid tank instead of feral dps
---
Because that isn't WoW classic... you want retail features? Play retail bro.
---
ye well, how often do you end up looking at your characters face while you play the game? 
---
There is no S.E.L.F.I.E. camera ingame  and transmog doesnt exist.
---
So you're really here to dredge up private server drama then.
---
They'll be 8-minute rush-fests, primarily played by people who aren't excited to be there, and are only interested in how many honor points they can squeeze out of an hour.
---
&gt;  but Classic is simply a complete game.
---
Meaning once they're done with it, they're done, they don't have the next expansion to look forward to.  But that's good, they can move on to a new game.
---
&gt; the community is real,
---
It's not even out yet.  There's no game yet, so no community.  The community might dry up in months.  You have no idea.  You're declaring something that doesn't yet exist to be "real" in the hopes it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, but that's a bad way to try to sell friends on something.
---
&gt; you are encouraged to explore, and you're encouraged to get better equipment and level to help you explore new content.
---
So... basically like current WoW?  I mean, heck, in 8.2, I'm not about to send in my characters without getting them seriously geared.  Pulling multiple mobs is rough enough on my main, but a character who's been 120 long enough to get just a bit of gear is going to be mauled.
---
But hey, let's look at what you say about the current game...
---
&gt; The story is completely broken up.
---
Well, yeah, but the last time they tried to update it, people threw a fit.  It's still not really "broken up" except that 1-60 was updated to work after Wrath.  But that's not a huge issue.  That's the problem any game with a continuously evolving narrative faces.
---
&gt; Convincing them that only max level really matters is insanely counterproductive.
---
And yet, that's pretty much how Classic worked, too.  People convince themselves leveling is "the main game" so they're okay with it taking so long, but most people wanted to get to the raiding, the high end dungeons, all of that stuff.
---
&gt; Leveling is hellishly boring
---
Well, yeah, and the third time you level in Classic will be hellishly boring.  It's hard for something to not be "hellishly boring" when you've done it multiple times.
---
&gt; but once there, you have to follow a very strict singular quest line,
---
A cohesive story in a zone that goes from start to finish is a bad thing?
---
&gt; This discourages exploring the zones in the places that the straight quest line does not take you.
---
But the "straight quest line" tends to take you everywhere.  And it's not like old quests encouraged going anywhere but where the quest was, so it's no different than Classic.  The only difference is that you know where the quest givers should be most of the time, so you aren't wandering all over hoping someone will be there.
---
&gt; Allied races are MILES out of reach for any new player.
---
No, they aren't.  You can get the Legion ones by doing ridiculously easy world quests (since you'll outlevel them at 120) and hitting the emissaries to speed it up.  You can get the BFA ones by, y'know, playing the game.
---
So rather than having to play the game for a while to unlock something, because you're impatient, your answer is to recommend to your friends to play a game with fewer races and one that's totally known for being speedy to unlock stuff?  (That last bit was sarcasm.  Seriously, if allied races are "MILES out of reach," then why would you recommend Classic's attunement system, rep grinds, etc. to those people?)
---
&gt; Dungeons are completely disconnected from the world.
---
They aren't, especially in the more recent expansions, where the story for a zone typically ends up being wrapped up in a dungeon.  Sure, there's not multiple random quests dotted all over asking you to go into the same dungeon over and over again and keep killing the same guys you've already killed, but there's an argument to be made that being asked to kill the same bosses repeatedly for different people is pretty immersion-breaking.
---
&gt; Conjunction this with the fact that dungeons (where players are more likely to be impatient and rude) are likely faster and are blasted through without any real thought
---
Not really.  In Classic, if you get a group of people who know what they're doing, you'll blast through it without any real thought.  Certainly easier than Mythic dungeons.  Unless you're planning to do dungeons at least five levels higher than your current level?  In which case, sure, they'll be difficult.  But people tried to accuse Blizzard of having Classic dungeons wrong because folks in beta, with the experience WoW players now have, were able to just breeze on through them.  Kind of like how raids back in yon olden days might have seemed tough with getting 40 random people together and getting them to do all the attunement stuff and maybe geared enough to not be a total liability, but with experience, people know they'll likely be able to do the Classic raids without having full forty man raids.
---
It feels like you're making a lot of assumptions about current WoW without playing it, and making arguments for Classic WoW that don't make sense, and the most amusing thing is that you can't decide if new players are impatient or not, because some things in current WoW will take too long for them but others would be too easy?
---
But yeah, I'm still laughing at the idea that Allied races are "MILES out of reach" for new players but you'd recommend those people with no attention span and not wanting to put in a bit of time play a version of the game that you're fond of specifically because it sends you all over the place and makes you backtrack repeatedly just to unlock some of the content.  (I guess your friends are never going to raid Naxxramas, because there's no way they could deal with earning enough rep or the materials to unlock it, given how impatient they are.)
---
again, there is another way around that. Spread them out on different servers or have a 3-10 second lag on your stream to hid it if your alts are ever shown on a server kick.
---
Thanks for sharing that druid macro. Help/harm macros are so key for hybrid classes!
---
My guild will be running a dkp system with an extra set of points we call RNP (raid night points) which are temporary points designed for alts, offspecs, and new guild raiders.
---
yes they are
---
I probably rather grind stuff.
---
Truth be told they can't really use the term 'husband and wife' if their relationship was 100% Texas-to-VC kind of long distance. I can understand the attachment you would feel, but it's also a far cry from a conventional relationship: makes a lot more sense that the same cheating, pseudo-relationship occurred between the paladin and the woman. And ruminating on it a little, it's deeply depressing. I hope the husband and wife respectively found someone IRL for them.
---
Who uses a 4:3 screen any more?
---
I am fairly certain you could fo better xD
---
Ahh, yea MacKreels moonshine is the one I was thinking of, you need movespeed enchancement to get there and pre-level 34 don't think i'll have morespeed enchantment so that quest will have to be skipped.
---
As for the journal, sounds like I can do that one and get the feralas waypoint at the same time, thanks for that!
---
You can solo them as a hunter, can give some good gold if maraudon and dmn farming isnt in or if the elemental earth spawns are camped. Although you do need some good gear for it to not be too slow
---
They cut down the map a lot. Huge sections with NPCs and things to do were just covered in "an avalanche" forever. Now it's basically just a corridor.
---
And then in the area that remained, the number of NPCs was cut almost in half.
---
And then the remaining NPCs saw a 15-30% nerf.
---
And then the few remaining neutral PVE elements of AV were completely removed.
---
And then almost all the guard NPCs were removed.
---
And then anything left saw another massive HP reduction.
---
Heard there's a game for you. A solo MMO called BFA. 8.2 released today, try it.
---
Doesn't sound like an MMO to me. I guess a very low population pve server would be good for you.
---
FD resists are a thing on (some) pservers as well.
---
It could be worse. Alliance could have a primary color of red, put spikes everywhere, and have the race choices be cows, green people, bad Jamaican stereotypes, and zombies.
---
WoD as a concept was a decent expansion...if they even finished the fucking thing. The entire entry is full of half-baked and abandoned mechanics.
---
See I feel like it’s things like this that made classic so nostalgic and fun. And now that everyone knows how to do them and what not. I feel like MY first classic experience is going to be a bit tanked compared to the old days lol I just need a time machine :(
---
I would disagree with this- I had a lot of extra money since I didn't have to pay for a mount so I did some testing while I was playing on Nost (yeah yeah, Pserver, whatever) and my mob kill times were not much better on ret than on holy, especially since holy was far more consistent with kill times due to using crusader and not command, and also conc gives you a lot more flexibility while leveling to tank dungeons. It also gives you decent tools for pvp (free crit every minute, 70% less heal pushback, etc). If there was any class that could level as a healing spec, it'd be pally since ret is so not-great to begin with.
---
Rockbiter is stupid strong in early levels, really makes leveling a shaman from the start a breeze compared to say druid for example.
---
*unzips*
---
Rolling Need on everything
---
Back to retail carebare..
---
Thanks!  I like the sound of this system!
---
That sounds really interesting design! They definitely should have implemented these kind of things instead of constant power boosts.
---
because the TBC scene was cucked by corecraft and gummy.
---
Thanks for sharing. I don't plan to powerlevel but there seemed to be some good advice in the write up you provided. Stuff like keeping certain items that in fact are quest items for quests you haven't picked up yet. Horde I know very well but haven't played that much alliance so going to take some notes from what you wrote.
---
Which you need two of for every mage in the guild. Not to mention yoh are competing with locks and healers.
---
Ok so then you’re not raiding. What are you doing at end game?
---
Druid tank
---
Mage
---
Paladin/Shaman
---
Priest
---
Either the pally/shaman heals and the priest is shadow or the pally/shaman is dps and the priest heals.
---
I’m also wondering this
---
As far as I understand, most healers farm gold by farming dungeons, which is a still a hell of a lot better than grinding the same mobs for hours imo.
---
It was easy to fall in to the whole MMO part back in vanilla then it is now and I’m hoping it will be again in classic...that part is the most fun for me.
---
So I'm dumb - here's this:
---
 [https://willitclassic.com/](https://willitclassic.com/)
---
Okay then youre not raiding, what is your endgame?
---
They are complicated in that they generally have many different elements, but the decision-making about those elements is usually easy because of the priority list.
---
The result feels (to me) like someone stuck the game Simon in my RPG and is forcing me to play it whenever I want to DPS.
---
&gt; But at least that gives you room to optimize how well you execute on top of how well you get geared.
---
I understand the appeal of having a system that allows that. I love the dynamic and challenging gameplay of healing even in Modern WoW (for the most part) because making the right decisions lets me make a difference. But the DPS minigames feel wildly out of place in an RPG... like if you were playing Dungeons and Dragons and you had to play a game of speed sudoku to determine how much damage your spells do. And as you said they're just priority lists anyway, so there isnt even much decision-making like there can be with healing.
---
The fact that Modern WoW doesnt have even a *single* simple rotation (like frost mage in Classic or destro lock in TBC) is one of the few things I genuinely hate about it.
---
well you can grind mobs and get ganked
---
I believe their stance is Layering is gone at the end of Phase 1 **period**
---
I leveled holy in vanilla and on Nost. Every few levels I would wonder how much I was gimping myself and switch to ret and see how it was different. And it was basically not different at all. Ret isn't an amazing spec, and has almost no straight damage increases over the other trees, so leveing as holy basically didn't feel bad at all (comparatively). 
---
But I'm also the guy who has never found vanilla pally leveling to feel as bad as people say so /shrug
---
it might happen on a non av week if none wants it to end
---
I mean, if you have IRL friends, Pathfinder Second Edition launches on the 1rst of August and it seems really good shit.
---
i was playing a rogue as my first character and was in a guild that was progressing through aq40. i had a rogue friend on horde and he build a gnomish mind control cap, mind controlled my guildleader (a rogue aswell) and i killed him.
---
i got kicked out of the guild for that and he was 100% mad and had all guildmembers forbidden to join groups with me.
---
stay mad lul
---
Instances are great, but ultimately it depends on how many you can run, whether you get lucky/unlucky, and whether other party members are rolling on the same loot.
---
Leveling a warrior on Horde, you can pretty much be in all blues from level 20 to 60 by running each instance 1-3 times. Tanks are always in demand so it's easy to get a group, and there's no competition for your mail/plate drops. But it's harder with a lot more luck involved for everyone else.
---
Hey there. I'd love a chance to discuss you plans for classic if you are still looking for a home. You can reach me here or at  wildgunmen#1302 on bnet or wildgunmen#9537 on discord.

If twinked then Rogue. Non twinked probably Paladin

That's just off the top of my head.
---
If you can clear MC why would you focus on ubrs?
---
You don't need to go full Holy in order to effectively heal dungeons. Most talents past Illumination are strictly raid-only talents. They won't help you healing much because you won't be hitting raid-like damage patterns. It sucks to see precious skill points wasted.
---
Another thing to clear up is that Holy is still a melee spec. Holy Shock is so useless to Paladins that in Vanilla guides many authors even suggest not taking it at all (super inefficient DPM/HPM).
---
Let me recommend a build that'll make you the most effective healer *and* be able to deal as much damage as necessary: I guess you can call it a [“Holy/Ret hybrid”](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/505030205--050052512023051) because healing dungeons is the most efficient way to farm the necessary 2H weapons to make leveling as Paladin the most satisfying experience. Thankfully, dipping 20 points into Holy does little to affect your damage because your DPS comes almost entirely from the top-end of your weapon.
---
The first 11 points in Ret are the “damage” package of Paladin builds and gives you the most bang for your buck: *Benediction -&gt; Deflection -&gt; SoC.* Because of a mechanic called [Parry-haste](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Parry), you should pick Deflection instead of Imp. Judgement (which is useless with SoC) and Imp. SotC (also worthless.)
---
This means healing with a 2H, or switching to a 1H + Healing Off-hand for dungeons. Wearing a shield is going to do very little for you. Unless you care about the aesthetic of running around with a shield.
---
#Talents:
---
**Imp. BoM**
---
This is a waste of talent points since [it doesn't scale well](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a93mk8/paladin_levelling_talents_benediction_or_imp_might/ecgiude/?context=0). Mana is always going to be an issue so Benediction is your best friend here—you'll be Sealing and Judging *a lot*.
---
**Seal of the Crusader:**
---
Seal of the Crusader is obsolete in patch 1.12 [because of a bug that they probably won't fix.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ak3qqw/should_all_bugs_be_fixed_even_if_they_were/) Don't even buy SotC from the trainer, it's pretty much always a DPS-loss. 
---
**Pursuit of Justice:**
---
After SoC I'd recommend PoJ since distance will be your biggest efficiency-killer while leveling. Can't stress the importance of +8% run speed.
---
**Sanctity Aura:**
---
Mathematically, Ret aura beats Sanc aura because of poor stat scaling while leveling.
---
**Imp. Judgement:**
---
You should be using rank 1 SoC to level, which means never Judging it because you actually lose DPS by doing so. Not Judging SoC makes this talent worthless.
---
**Healing Light**
---
You might as well get this to improve your dungeon healing (you should be building a healing set with +Healing cloth pieces and off-hands) and then two points into:
---
**Imp. Lay on Hands**
---
This is the most controversial choice but Lay on Hands is so much better on Tanks than BoP since BoP suspends threat and only causes another party member to get one-shot instead. Giving your tank +30% armor for 2 minutes in addition to the emergency heal is more effective than Consecration or two points in Divine Strength.
---
After this, get Illumination. I'm skipping Consecration since it's useless while leveling as a non-tank. It's insane how inefficient Consecration is. I think a lot of people are blinded by guides that glorify AoE grinding around level 50+. AoE grinding won't be a thing while leveling at launch because grinding spots will be contested by other players (especially Mages) who can AoE much more efficiently than you.
---
**Illumination**
---
This talent is all you need to heal effectively until 60. Get Spiritual Focus because this becomes your most powerful healing combo with Concentration Aura (spell pushback is huge in Classic.)
---
#Additional info:
---
Don't waste gold on the following spells / ranks: Seal of the Crusader, Exorcism, Divine Protection ranks, Redemption ranks, Turn Undead, Hammer of Justice ranks, Lay on Hands ranks, Seal of Justice, Holy Wrath, Divine Shield, Blessing of Sacrifice. You won't stick around undead areas long enough while leveling in the early levels to justify the Undead-only spells. Maybe once you start hitting EPL you can pick those up.
---
#Stat priority:
---
+Healing  &gt; +Spell Crit &gt; Mp5 &gt; Intellect. 
---
Keep in mind that at very early levels you'll be mostly aiming for Spirit &gt; Intellect &gt; Stamina. Don't worry about Strength because most of your damage will come from the top-end of your Weapon.
---
I love this. Every guild should have a Matriarch.
---
&gt; Blizzard doesn’t really care about the virgin experience in Retail,
---
They do, though.  That's why the last two expansions (might have been last three?) came with a free level boost for a character.  So if you bring in someone new to join you in, say, playing BFA when it starts, they get a 110 character who can jump into the new content and play alongside their friends.  If they want to experience the older stuff, they can start from scratch, but the option's there for them to jump right into the latest expansion.
---
It kind of negates all the arguments about "leveling is boring" and all, because that's the viewpoint of leveling 1-to-max for your fifteenth alt.  Aside from it not being boring for someone who's never done it (and really, the cohesive story zones are so much better than dealing with BC zones which are still a mess of "run everywhere!"), it's not actually required for a new player.
---
Heck, they even changed up how professions work to help newer players or people returning.  Now, instead of needing to max all the prior ranks of a profession, each expansion's professions have their own leveling, so BFA has professions that go from 1-150, and you can pick up a profession and start crafting right there in BFA.  You don't need to get through 800 points of crafting first.
---
But yeah, the virgin experience in Retail Classic, as opposed to Retail Modern, is going to be wonderfully bad.  The good news is, those folks can just pay $40 and jump right into 9.0 in a year... assuming Retail Classic didn't scare them off.  But nah, Blizzard has no reason to care about the virgin experience in Retail Classic, because it's not being made for virgin players, it's for people who want to experience nostalgia (some of us for fun reasons on the side, and some who can't let go of the past and insist everything old is better than anything new and kids need to get off their lawn).
---
In a game with multiple expansions this is necessary but the RPG aspect of vanilla is what made it so great. Those odd levels where the nodes are super spread out and you can go days trying to get that last 10 skill ups to unlock the next tier of herb/oresz it's really satisfying when you finally find that silver vein you've been searching for.

Back during MC we had a couple class leaders who were "roommates" who were very obviously in love and more than friends. Then a homophobic officer hit his raid ventrillo keybind instead of his officer chat keybind while making a gay joke. 
---
The resulting silence on comms was heard for days.  The next few raids were very uncomfortable.
---
Make 3 and 5 piece set bonuses have better synergy across tiers (i.e., 3/8 T1, 5/8 T2) to encourage getting unique mechanics from previous content. Expand later sets to have more pieces, or change the equipment slots (remove boots/gloves, add rings/trinkets) so you can mix and match sets. Continue to add legendaries or high-tier class quests to older content when new content comes out.
---
Catch-up mechanics can be okay if they help bring you up the current content faster, but can be balanced by making sure BiS is a combination of gear from old and new content. This balancing act obviously gets harder the longer you go, but isn't impossible.

It would be wasted on a dwarf. Night elf is the way to go.

Just going through the cons:
---
Just because you want to heal at 60, doesnt mean you have to level as one.
---
If your aim in BGs is to win, then they will definitely only get easier with you being in healing gear. Nothing can turn a BG upside down than an ace healer.
---
Not sure exactly what healing class is easy prey. If you play druid or paladin, most likely people will leave you alone, since its not worth the time and effort to try and kill you.
---
I played a healer in vanilla from mc to naxx and never once was I made fun of for playing one. Had that been the case, that guy would have one less top tier healer to group with for the remainder of the game and boy did they know it. As a result most people made damn sure to thank you and treat you well.
---
During Vanilla, my GF and I broke up and she rapidly dated &amp; slept with several people from our guild / server.  
---
Feels bad/weird man.
---
At the moment a mage with a priest alt. 
---
Unsure if ill be a gnome and dwarf
---
Or
---
Undead, undead. 
---
That will depend on the homies.
---
I've never played it. That's why I'm excited.
---
TLDR:
---
1. Mana longevity wont ever be a problem
---
2. Lack of interrupts is a problem
---
3. Lack of CC is a problem
---
4. Healer should probably go balance.
---
5. This sounds supermegaawesomefun!
---
I played with a 3-man team all the way to 60 and did all the 5-mans except Scholomance (TBC hit) and it was the most fun I had in all my WoW carrier. It sounds like you have the same mind-set that we did. We took it slow and had one dedicated night that we played together and made sure that the slowest leveller set the cap for the others. We played prot warrior, holy priest and combat rogue. Up until the last boss of Uldaman dps wasn't an issue, it's all about being able to outlast the harder pulls. Bosses are generally not the biggest problems; some of the larger pulls are worse. Sometimes its very important to get the first mob down as fast as possible to make the healing managable.
---
The biggest issues are lack of cc and interrupts:   
---
If you want to be able to clear the higher instances you might need to get a rogue. Having a CC makes every pull so much easier. Some pulls from BRD and up have multiple mobs that need interrupting and druids have no real interrupts. I remember some fights where me (tank) and the rogue had to take turns to be able to do all the interrupts and that is with two short cooldowns. You can work around it a bit with bash and feral charge of course. With some engineering help thrown in everything might be possible though and this kind of project is all about the challenge so I say go for it!
---
One thing that will make the triple druid excellent is the availability of innervate after level 40. The healer will never have mana issues. The cat can always drop an innervate and if needed the cat could oftentime swith to bear and take aggro while the tank innervates the healer. Because of this you will never ever have mana issues in harder fights. The cat can also throw in a heal in critical situations.
---
I think the healer should go balance for two reasons: The better mana return during casting and better dps. As I said earler it's often very important to get the first mob down asap and in the first seconds of a pull the tank has plenty of hp so the healer can go offensive.
---
I think your pulls should generally work like this: 
---
1. Tank precasts regrowth and rejuvenation on himself, the cat and the healer casts rejuvenation on the tank. This way the tank goes in with a really good healing buffer. The tank will still get more healing aggro than the others.
---
2. The healer should go full out attack until the bear needs healing. The first target should be dead or almost dead when the first heal needs to be cast.
---
3. After this the healer focuses on healing to conserve mana.
---
Also: Make sure that one of you keeps on top of his leatherworking. :)
---
Don't listen to people that say you will get bored. Why would you get bored? I really don't understand it. All instances are so much more fun if there is an actual risk to fail.
---
I played with a 2-man team back in tbc with my wife: Beast master hunter + hybrid elemental/resto shaman. The instances were a bit nerfed by then but still not easy like in later expansions and it was loads of fun. In small party situations hybrids really shine and there are loads of ways to use their versatility in creative ways.
---
My plan for vanilla is to play double druid with the wife. With a little luck the first few instances might be duoable. We will get joined by a hunter friend and hope to get as far as possible.  
---
I'm still thinking a lot of what team we want to have. The only thing that is a given is that my wife will play a druid. :)
---
Good luck!
---
Ahh makes sense you were in one of the lesser guilds that got left in the dust. You need an excuse to satisfy the fact you could not keep up. Once we got into AQ40 you were left behind and soon forgotten about. Well Vanq had to leaving the server to escape the shadow of DV and P4L.
---
&gt; ...the appeal of gathering professions is finding herbs that you can't gather yet? 
---
I don't really favor one over the other, but I think they meant that gathering professions used to be more of an active goal that you had to work towards whereas now it's more of a passive one that you don't necessarily need to put a lot of focus into (if you don't want to).
---
For the authentic experience I'll be installing all of them
---
Yeah, cause it's a starting area meant to introduce new people to the game.
---
One MC raid during the Christmas patch, that included the stunning snowballs. My buddy and I started a giant snowball fight in between pulls, which lead to a RAGING raid leader/MT. He set an expectation that if one more snowball was thrown that the culprit would be kicked. Everybody stopped with the snowballs. Until he goes to pull Garr and my buddy and I peg him right before the pull, causing a wipe. He disbanded the entire guild and shutdown our voice server. GGz
---
A faster with +30 SP to weapon. Priest I would imagine.
---
You're right for yellow attacks. The bulk of a rogues dps is white hits though so I would argue hit is still very valuable past 6% for humans.
---
This also happened in 2 of the guilds I was in that I knew of. People literally drove/flew hours to bang. Whether it was over drama, loot, or just pre-Tinder era horniness I can't say. But happen it did.
---
Does anyone else hate streamers?
---
Sorry about your loss mate :(
---
upvoted just because you put the source in your post. other than that, for the Horde!
---
I mean you still have to level the gathering profession, you just don't run into situations where you come across an herb that you can't gather.
---
Another idea I had was the use of optional bosses/wings. So say for example there's raid 1, 2, and 3. Raid 4 gets released, but there's an optional wing with two bosses. To get into the boss you have to beat a mini fight, that requires gear from raids one and two to complete (for now).
---
So you don't HAVE to do it, but people who farm raids 1 and 2 (and thus gear up new raiders) will get into it. But by the time raids 5 and 6 come out you outgear it and can blow through it. Some way of linking things backwards.
---
Why would a pserver have an item that is not supposed to exist in the first place?
---
this isn't about layering being a problem, it's about realizing that it's being tested so that we don't have to deal with it after launch... Simple as that...
---
i have a pentium 2gb ram lmao
---
Damn... i hate horde we dont got shit like this...
---
Is it anymore fair for a hunter to be able to kite a warrior/etc indefinitely?
---
Does this truly affect the ability of hunters to preform in pve and pvp?
---
I have no clue, honestly.
---
Oh i see.
---
About you? Yes we know. If u didn’t care you wouldn’t comment vb
---
Glad others are realizing that this is a real issue. Last time I pointed out that we might have to implement RMT for the greater good, [it didn't go well, lol.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a9qbj7/unpopular_opinion_not_implementing_the_wow_token/)
---
Except Ice Block dropping the flag is not a bug.
---
Did they ever leave?
---
I was ok with right-click to suggest invite and ignore spammers. Fuck me right?
---
ur version is good, fuck these nerds. blue and orange is aesthetic cheat mode
---
I think the biggest drawback for me to playing a healer as my main, is that, just like tanking, and opposite DPSing, encounter gets less and less fun each time you kill them. As DPS it gets more and more fun, because you can push higher numbers and the competition with the other dps keeps at least some motivation going.
---
As healer, your raidmembers will get better at mechanics, tanks will take less dmg, and fights will end well before you go oom. Trivial farm as a healer is terrible and with a game that is set to not progress to newer expansions, that feeling will take up a huge chunck of your time going through the same content. 
---
Really enjoy healing on alts though.
---
What does that have to do with BIS?
---
Everything possible and it’s good because my rotation program works :) thanks to addons
---
I just made a few lengthy comments on this very topic in another thread lmao.
---
Thats completely false. Blizzard only responds to outrage and have time and time again ignored incredible high quality beta feedback on expansions and classes pre launch. Legion was a real eye opener when people showed them classes were under or overtuned and needed fixing. Devs like Celestalon outright laughed at theorycrafters who were showing just how broken some classes were. Lets compare Legion launch Brewmaster Monks to Prot Warriors with insanely busted Ignore Pain mechanics. The best thing to do to a Blizzard dev working on wow is get a big mass to attack them instead of "concise feedback".
---
Huh, guess I read your comment wrong lol. My bad. One word and the comment is fixed!
---
Remember when blizzard made a super boring dungeon based on this roleplay and then getting the lore completely wrong and you don't kill any civilians?
---
billions dollars company full of engineers who need small testers to find bugs 3 months prior to release date in a game released 15 years ago! not sure if you are getting it, 15 years old game which had most of its bugs fixed in 1.13 have bugs in 2019! from again... guess what, multi billionaire company with top engineers and new technology, and you complain about "whiners" who guess what? cant test the game becouse blizzard wont allow them to test it and all they see is a game 2 months from release date full of bugs.
---
I think the most important thing to expanding on classic is NOT INCREASING THE LEVEL CAP and NOT MAKING STATS EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER. I think ideally you want to expand on raids incrementally, with maybe a few odd pieces of gear between the last raid and the next. For example, assuming BC content, Karazhan should have been on par with Naxx or a bit worse and act as a catch up raid, making the BiS gear for SSC/TK a mix between Naxx gear and one or two bits from Kara/Outland questing.   
---
I would apply this to leveling too. Outland should have just been a mix of leveling zones from 1-60, not 60-70 making everything you did in Vanilla worthless. I would have structured Terrokar as a 10-20 zone for both Draenei and BEs - forming some sort of pathway there from their capital cities straight to Shattrath and do away with ghostlands/azuremyst island. Zangar 20-30,  Nagrand 30-40, BE Mountain 40-50, HFP 40-50. This would leave SMV/Netherstorm as 50-60 zones with a huge emphasis on large quest chain stories. More of a post-60 zone. Maybe one or two quest items that make the whole zone worth completing. 
---
And yeah, I would do the same thing for WotLK and so on. Keep the level cap at 60, make the continents 1-60 content for more variety in leveling, and make raids much closer together in terms of gear requirements. Half of your raid group should still have Black Temple pieces going into ICC.
---
I love druids, mained Druid from Vanilla, TBC and WoTLK. Was main tank TBC and WoTLK. Feral doesn’t have the tool kit you get come TBC. You can tank as feral but majority of non threat race encounters are just done more easily and safely with a warrior tanking (especially horde cus no fear ward.) Pvp as feral is also rather underwhelming, whereas a properly geared warrior can justifiably be a focal point to lead organized pvp. I’ll be rolling warrior in classic. The idea that all of the drawbacks to druids in vanilla can be overcome with love of class isn’t something that resonates with me.
---
And then throw that server in the trash
---
So chances are it still scales\`?
---
Uther himself says: Vengeance must not be part of what we do. Vengeance is a ret talent.
---
Is this foreshadowing for retardin spec being a wrong choice for paladins?
---
Or when joining/leaving a group in another layer* which for this discussion is pointless since it actually helps keep everyone on the same layer.
---
Reward-seekers ruined it.  AV never needed to end.  You could pop in and drop out and contribute to your faction's push, and it's was good.  We didn't need it to end.  It was fantastic when you won, but it wasn't a requirement that it end.  We just went in and had fun.
---
Well I shouldn't speak for any of you.  I had fun.
---
Seal your doom tonight
---
I'd say threat meter is only absolutely necessary for tanks, warriors, and warlocks. The other classes either can't out threat a good tank or can drop threat.
---
Ahem. Excuse me. STEP mom!
---
Are you talking about wow when we had to run around with Arthas or what?
---
Do you have this recolored version but in the original giant size? I have it spanning two monitors and I’d like to put yours up.
---
I just made 30.   No need to rush things.
---
Hell yeah
---
Many retail addons either work with classic without changes or have been/are being changed to work with classic.
---
Good to know I'm not the only one!
---
its a social game revolving around orange pixels, what do you expect?
---
How about no?
---
:P
---
I don't understand why people keep acting like Blizz is just "deciding" to not revert it. The majority *don't* want it, idk what to tell you. People don't want 2 day long AVs. It was the same reason it was barely even played back then until the change.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons Set version to classic.
---
Guy, you are mixed up here. You don’t have a problem with small time streamers. You have an issue with twitch culture.
---
I'm pretty sure tipsout was in a 10 hour av during the av weekend. 
---
So I would think it's possible and we will see it again .
---
Yes, the culling of stratholme in Wrath.
---
Boring, full of fake lore, and utterly trash dungeon.
---
And Hunter's were perfectly fine at 1.12? You're just grasping at straws.
---
Not with the patch we're getting. Even if it did it'd be swiftly nerfed.
---
Just wow, lol.
---
The skeletons are in the game, and the Chinese version doesn't have skeletons. So why can't we have the old effects and it be changed for their version?
---
&gt; circa 2019
---
not circa, we know exactly when, today...
---
How does it differ from DKP? You gain DKP from attendance, you lose DKP from getting gear.
---
Weren't the townsfolk gonna turn into monsters anyway?
---
You're expecting people that stopped playing / became seriously disheartened with the content blizzard was producing -  The ones that got laughed at and "you think you do, but you dont"  -  to give blizzard their trust and faith that they'll do this right  just like that?
---
Are you insane?  
---
That's like going back to a physically abusive partner just because they've verbally told you they've changed and expect you to believe it.
---
I carefully considered this... there’s no way I could go anything but Horde. If my friends rolled alliance I’d have to get new friends. In the end, there is only Horde for me.
---
God I hope so gota buy me some gold
---
Twink guild? They have those on proudmoore still but it means something different now
---
Because a test simulation is the game itself 🤨
---
20-40 is pretty bad with increased leveling requirements but low mobility/skill usage. Lot of player can't handle it and peter out. Dungeons are few and quests at this point start asking alot of you.(Travel/time commitment)
---
It sounds elitest to say but people are so ADD and won't push through without clear carrots.
---
Both. On AV weekend people will be rushing to get it done. On off weekend and weekdays there could be long ones.
---
Man i remember the same types of threads in BFA alpha, look how that turned out.
---
Fair enough.
---
That was my thought too. They'd get to the big player base drop and then stop. However - OSRS has shown that innovation under old guidelines can be moderately successful. 
---
We'll see though. Man can dream. Fact is that, like someone earlier said, they won't want to continually split the player base. If they move on to BC they'll do that. If they move on to Wrath they'll do it again. My big worry is that they'll try to make the BC break, realize that nobody is interested in that and then give up.
---
2man DME boss runs with a warrior is hands down the best way to make gold for a (holy) paladin. No respecs required, guarenteed good gold, chill with friend while farming, and you actually get to play the game while doing it, instead of running around on a mount picking herbs(which is the alternative btw).
---
I’ll feed your souls to Hakkar himself!
---
...you can feed him whatever you fucking want, just give me your damn raptor!!

Again, you seem to be taking your entire impression from the last few days on beta where it's been all but confirmed they've been hardmode testing layering. Why would they ever cause you to be in dead zones and capital cities? It's fearmongering at it's worst. You have no evidence that it'll be this way at all, the interviews have even suggested the opposite.
---
Wait we stirred off topic a little, could you elaborate what you mean?
---
If Horde, you think Priest is next best to Pally? Just curious for the other side.
---
Yes, fuck you.
---
THANK GOD

---
Hard to say for sure really, but yeah around the same value as 1str for warrior, or 1agi for rogue/hunter.
---
Eh
---
What exactly makes it more classic-y? The basic design seems the same as the Cata version, except with a brighter atmosphere? If anything the gloomier Cata textures make more sense next to Silverpine forest.
---
Don't forget that when people in the guild start getting their upgraded gear, the shards received from those DEs are NEEDED to have enough shards for the guild to provide the best enchants to people in the guild.  DEs in raiding are necessary to get everyone their best enchants.  If its just a small upgrade for someone, I have no problem with them passing on it to get what they really want.  Those shards WILL be put to good use.
---
&gt;there would only be one zone for each level bracket
---
No? That does not follow logically from what I said. In fact, having multiple leveling zones and not being expected to do both is very much vertical progression. You do one zone, and you ignore the other zone, and you go to the next set of options for zones. That's vertical progression. 
---
It is not "WoW-like" to tag on level 60 zone after level 60 zone. Level 60 is more than fully saturated with content. It doesn't need more content. TBC was the natural direction for the franchise. 
---
Now, having said that, is it possible to imagine an alternate level 70 expansion? One that is based in Azeroth proper, without flying, etc? Sure. That's a different story.
---
HELL NO WE AIN'T CHILLIN OUT TILL THE 26TH! WE ARE GOING HAM UNTIL THE 26TH! GET OUT OF HERE WITH SOME BULL TO CHILL OUT!
---
Great overall utility too. Plenty of CC, windfury totems from Shaman for Rogue and Warrior, Free food / water from Mage, hunter pet control (if the hunter is good enough), plus kiting with mage / hunter when stuff gets hairy. Not to mention portals at the end! Damn, this really is a good answer with limited competition for gear.
---
Typical!
---
I think for the warrior at least you want the highest raw value for agi+str+stam on any piece you can get as long as the item has stam on it. With 1 crit = 20 agi. With any toss ups being weighted towards stam.
---
There is a Classic section on [wowinterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/cat160.html)  and a section on [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons?filter-game-version=1738749986%3A67408&amp;filter-sort=2)
---
This thread is lacking the love for the Undercity
---
Screaming isn't funny. It's not content. Shut the fuck up and go back to streaming to your 5 viewers instead of posting here.
---
Any love for the Undercity?
---
Do you think this would work with a hunter as opposed to warrior? Using the pet as a tank?
---
Can also farm Mara once you get full T1 for ele Earth's, solid stone, boss drops and a chance at edgemasters
---
I would interpret that as saying "before, you had to actively hold off on zone progression to level your gathering skills, or you'd quickly find that you would no longer be leveling them up at all". It's passive in the sense that it doesn't require specific focus on herbalism as a priority.
---
We might be a good fit for you, see our recruitment post here: 
---
**Please visit our guild site at Warcurse.net**
---
My intention is to make a guild of people dedicated to long AVs, and defending the initial rush.
---
I had one of those: [https://i.redd.it/m6fsx6lwpcy21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/m6fsx6lwpcy21.jpg)
---
Maybe.. I know it works for a decent geared rogue so why not a hunter I suppose.
---
But hunters have better alternatives so unless if you got a good hunter friend I wouldn't rely on it.
---
Only problem with adding separate servers for expansions is that it’ll split up the player base
---
On private servers there were always people who made it their life goals to never let anyone else get the tag on the mobs. If someone managed to tag the mob, they would assassinate them on sight for the rest of their lives. They were called the Devilsaur Mafia. People are assuming that this will happen on every sever in Classic
---
Yes. But that is the dilemma. Kill a weak innocent or wait until it dies and becomes a stronger monster to fight. The light frowns on killing innocents.
---
We might be a good fit for you, thought we are just after AM on the east coast. see our recruitment post here:
---
DKP is a bidding system.  EPGP is a priority system.  In the former, you spend points to buy gear, and for BIS items that you share with other classes or items that you want to save a bulk of DKP for you can end up spending quite a bit of DKP for just an item.
---
On EPGP, your priority determines who gets first pick.  I would assume, an item comes up, and everyone who wants it will say so, and the person with the highest priority gets it.  I never played in an EPGP guild, but that seems to me how it would work.
---
Mostly similar at the end of the day, but DKP suffers from hoarding of points to outbid others, whereas in EPGP you can't actually bid on anything so it avoids that metagaming pitfall.
---
Now that's the classic experience
---
Yet it happened all the time. I was in so many raids that resulted in many whelps.
---
3 PM EDT happens when this comment is 21 hours and 17 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/j2b06FOo5
---
-more empty space
---
-a third as many questhubs
---
-more consistent texture and color palette across whole zone
---
-clear road network 
---
-more choice of path through zone
---
blizzard did move away from all these design elements, so it's understandable if you don't like this stuff, but lots of people like classic zones for these reasons
---
I hear you, brother. I’ve been Alliance since ‘05 and I’m going to be a traitorous dog and go Horde. Biggest reason for me? Absolute newest experience I can get out of classic. But blue calls to me too. It’s rough haha.
---
There are a limited amount of spawns, and a VERY high demand for the leather. The devilsaur set is pre-raid BiS for every physical dps spec off the bat.
---
You better believe they'll be back, making gold in Vanilla is brutal for the average uneducated /unskilled player, let alone someone with multiple specs. That combined with people who want instant gratification, they're going to make some serious money for a while.
---
There are only a few spawn locations for them and they are in high demand, so there can be a lot of competition to kill them and get the leather.
---
You sound like exactly what we are looking for at Warcurse. You can take a look at us via our website at [Warcurse.net](https://Warcurse.net). Only thing is we do weekend raids from 12-3pm sat/sun EST. 
---
See our recruitment post here:
---
They were going for spectacle and they succeeded. Stepping through the Dark Portal, having that alien sky above you and an army of demons before you. Hellfire Peninsula was something to behold and got people pumped. Made everyone feel they got their money's worth. It's the reason most peopel didn't like Borean Tundra. Compared to Howling Fjords it was... well a boring tundra.
---
The frost resist is good and stoneform is still great.
---
Well atleast there proud
---
What faction does the Pally friend want?
---
Blizzard said that they were going to make changes to WC3 Reforged to fit the World of Warcraft lore so maybe that's how the mission will go there.
---
Blizzard have a presence in Sydney inside the Equinix data centre. Its a whole lot cheaper for ISPs and blizzard to not route traffic across the world so id be pretty certain OCE servers will exist. I wouldn't use the stress test as an example as this was just temporary.
---
-You do one zone, and you ignore the other zone
---
that's the point of all these zones I'm making, it's not horizontal progression, more choices for vertical progression. most of the zone have been in the 30 - 55 range where I felt there was a lack of content when I played the first time round
---
Cheapshot doesn't break sap / blind  so you try again =D
---
Warhammer into Warcraft into World of Warcraft into World of Warcraft: 40k.
---
You really don’t need to level as holy. Level as ret dps! As a paladin in group content keep a 1/h shield around and you can viably tank and/or heal up to 60.
---
I was on Greymane for wrath when the afflicted ran the server.   I was in art of aggression which was the poor man versions lol
---
Thanks. I work in health insurance for an independent agency. It’s not my first choice. I fell into it after college because I needed a job, and I will have been there 6 years this September. It can be a rough gig, and I’m not built for my position. I’m not a salesman even though I’m technically in a sales position. I like that I help people, but there is a stigma with insurance, and a majority of the people I meet with treat me like I’m trying to take advantage of them. My degree is in music education—not sales. I took a semester of business because my parents wanted me to, and it was awful. Anyway, the job can be incredibly stressful—never had a panic attack prior to it. Many people love the work, but I can’t relate.
---
How does a weekend early raid sound? We may be a good fit for you. 
---
We might be a good fit for you, see our recruitment post here:
---
It does because you get to pick your fights. Add travelform, aqua form and roots and you basically get to engage/disengage from fights anytime you want. Perhaps griefing isn't the correct word to use for druids but annoying definitely is.
---
&gt; I don't give a shit about Blizzard and neither should you.
---
But you do. You give so much of a shit that you're sitting here demanding they do things for you. If you didn't care, you'd sit and wait for the thing to come out and just buy it or not. But you're demanding something of them. And, if you don't care about them, then why should they care about you? Because you won't buy their game? Shitloads of people buy their game. They could still make insane profit doing a third of the work they're currently doing.  
---
&gt;Don't even understand why you're so stalwartly defending any of this shit. 
---
Defending what? I'm not defending them, I'm pointing out the ridiculous entitlement of so much of the community. You think your bitching is helping anything. It's not. Flat out. I guarantee you, if the devs COULD issue the statement they want it would be "We fucking know and we're trying to work on it but we're fucking people with lives and this is just or job, we aren't camping out in the office to cater to you entitled little shits 24/7"
---
if you don't like the way the game is being made, then don't play it. I'm going to, because I'm happy with JUST 98.5% of the original game intact, as opposed to needing everything EXACT else I'll pitch a childish fit, like you and half of the people here do. If you don't like it, then don't buy it. But don't sit here and pretend you "Don't care about them" while desperately needing them to pay attention to you.
---
&gt;Get a hobby, or a job, or go get in shape, or go read your wife's text messages. Any of those would benefit you more than supplanting your indie dream perspective onto people working at one of the most successful video game companies to have ever existed.
---
Fucking YOU get a hobby or a job and maybe that would be a better use of your time than endlessly bitching at people to do your bidding because, I don't know, you lack control in your own life or whatever shortcomings you have that make you feel the need to screech like a wildebeast at people who are only doing 98% of what you asked for. The lot of you need to grow the fuck up.

&gt;I just hate when the 'old' raid in an expansion becomes trash that everybody avoids
---
Imagine unironically thinking that a raid that Blizzard whipped up in a week (Molten Core) should still be relevant content 15 years after it was designed. Absolute lol.
---
Best thing TBC ever did was throw out the vanilla stuff.
---
They’re not just pre raid bis, many classes keep them well into raid content because they’re incredibly strong. 
---
There’s only 6 spawns for the devilsaurs and that should be enough every rogue, hunter, arms and feral on the server, which is probably close to half the servers population. This bumps up the price and makes it a very attractive market for a mafia to control. 
---
In essence you only have to have two or three dozen nolifers to control the spawns in un goro and you’ll be able to make tons of money because the devilsaur set will always be hugely in demand.
---
mmm blood of heroes
---
i wish gnomes could be paladins
---
This is what my plan is. I'll probably be behind the leveling curve anyway. Might as well have some crafted stuff along the way.
---
Can't argue with NE priests.... at least you have three races that can be priests...
---
&gt;level 3counters141 point · 5 hours agoHere's an option, don't layer yourself out of PvP. And if someone layers out of your corpse camp, then pretend that they went offline? Is ganking really that important to you?
---
You should roll on a PVE server
---
Its a possibility but I'm also skeptical of them going back to each expansion for the reasons I listed prior and because I think each iteration of a re-release will have fewer and fewer players in comparison to the cost of each release.
---
IMO, best case scenario is either keep 'Modern' and 'Classic' separate with their own future expansions, or create a new iteration of WoW that blends the best of both worlds and pulls everyone in.
---
I do find the latter rather difficult to achieve (no one will agree 100% where the 'best' of both lays exactly), however there is precedent in the industry for the former in Runescape and Final Fantasy. Modern Runescape and Old School Runescape are maintained alongside each other as both receive new content while FFXI and FFXIV are also both maintained. *However FFXI may not have had any new content in some time there are no plans to close it and they do still have recruitment drives and fanfests. There are also rumors they may do an HD re-release.
---
early F for all the people who will run up to this and press it being curious what it does
---
I’ll never understand you lot wanting all these assbackwards reverts of quality of life changes.  Fuck it let’s go back to no electricity or vehicles irl.
---
Possible because your arguments are terrible
---
Spriest is pretty painful in dungeons. Ele would be a lot more fun I'd imagine as a dps joining groups while levelling and especially at 60.
---
We are playing Classic, not Vanilla.
---
Just figure out to use layering.
---
That's a meme at this point. Alliance will retake Gilneas after X.
---
If you stop I will find you, I want vanilla hellfire peninsula northrend and whatever in hopes blizz listens for the first time.
---
Also add links in the post to your other work, some might have missed it.
---
Oh gee that's a hard one...
---
for many it's less than an hour of work
---
Yeah I'm going first aid, cooking, and skinning on my warrior
---
They're already selling pre-orders for  classic gold
---
It's not a terrible idea, and with the crazy flexibility vanilla offers, you can definitely pull this off with three different specs (or a 2-1 split). One person will probably need to commit to being support, starting with something like this:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/500005031--5
---
eventually ending up in a variation of the regrowth crit build:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/5000353310001--50510310501405
---
The idea is to pick up the extra buffs and then dps in cat/human form to fish for the OOC procs. The other two can spec traditional feral bear and cat, something like this:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-5552501303022151-05002
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-553202132320205-05
---
Although, if you want, the cat person can go for a more hybrid healer build and spend their OOC procs on off-healing. Could work. 
---
I will say, however, that replacing the cat druid with a rogue or a hunter could really speed this thing along. Yes, the cat can spend his mana on heals, but the rogue/hunter can just CC an extra mob or two and help down things faster, preventing more damage that way. And you can still stealth through things by abusing hunter's FD.
---
I'm not particularly talking about between expansions, but rather within expansions.
---
ITS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN? It fucking did happen back in vanilla when i played you unconsolable brassmuncher.
---
And no, not every guild is going to do that since a vast majority of guilds do not give a fuck.
---
&gt; I feel bad for your students. They didn't ask to listen to a mentally disabled person for several hours a week.
---
Jokes on you, because i teach an advanced mathematics course that is opt-in.
---
yeah, but the hunter would be wasting time earning 30% as much gold as if he solod trib runs
---
I just hope that if they come in hard, that they will get creative again
---
The Goblin zones at least made sense that you would leave and never come back. Gilneas is supposedly secure and under the control of the Alliance and is the site of an active battlefront between Horde and Alliance.
---
I’m very much a life long card carrying Horde member but I’m really leaning to wanting to play Alliance in Classic. I kinda have that been there done that experience with the Horde. Only thing holding me back is IRL friends that want to play Horde. Im not confident in them sticking around for the long haul like myself. So I might say f it and go alliance. If I do I plan on Dwarf Paladin.
---
Honestly a lot of the hype over farming devilsaurs is overblown now. Back during Vanilla the community was overall a little more elitist than it is now and people expected you be in pre-raid BIS. So that created the demand for devilsaurs.
---
But as we now realize (thanks to pservers) early Vanilla raids can be cleared by players who fall well under the bar that was expected during Vanilla. Do I think farming devilsaur leather will still be a viable way to make gold in Classic? Yes, of course. Many people are still going to want pre-raid BIS simply because they like to play that way.
---
I however don't feel it will be as big a deal as it was during Vanilla. I could very well be wrong and that's fine. We will just have to wait and see what happens when Classic hits and people start gearing for MC.
---
There are prebis for hunters rogues and fury warriors, this is basically half a raid of players, there are only 4-5? spawns of devilsaurs with a decent long respawn timer. You need 22 pieces to get a set, which is a little over 1 hour of full clear farming. This means only 1 set per hour or 24 sets per day can be farmed for the hundreds or even thousand of players that need it, so it's quite scarce. There's 2 pieces to a set, one recipe is bought from an NPC the other is a random drop in un'goro. 
---
The big deal is that because it's so scarce especially on big population pservers, people have put it a quite ridicules amount of effort to securing these mobs to create a monopoly on them. We're talking cross faction collusion, 24-7 coverage, full on raid fights to defend the territory and so on, all because when you are farming(which won't be thaaat often), as a 2man team you would each be making over 250 gold per hour. 
---
On classic however the demand will be a lot smaller, region locked servers will make farming 24-7 a lot harder(on the pservers you had both NA + EU working together), and from what we know cross faction collusion will not be allowed, which basically breaks any attempt of getting a monopoly on the market. But it'll still be a lot of gold to farm there, and there will be lots of small skirmishes for devilsaurs, and overall a lot of fun.
---
oh yeah, good catch
---
Yeah man, sitting in BG queue for 2 hours was legit. Nah man. You're in the extreme minority. It's ok to be upset that you personally wanted those choices, but be realistic when Blizz chose the more popular ones. People don't like the 2 day long AVs, and definitely don't like 1-2 hour BG queues.
---
is it worth tho?
---
Eh, there's a reason I didn't put that part.  What we are now doesn't always equal what we want to be!
---
What’s that new tech that allows you to detect them?
---
Let's not forget they said they fucked all major storylines in tbc because they thought game was not going to last.
---
No one else could give me any evidence to the contrary, and plenty of folks eventually agreed that it was true, even though they still didn't want to accept it because feels&gt;reals.
---
So, please, tell me what new counter-argument you have.
---
leeway
---
Layering is a big issue in its form, except this very form is in the beta for testing purpose, the population doesn't require this much layering, they're just testing it, so people who complain about it like it's the live game are the problem, cause it's a non-issue. This form of layering is not something that is intended to stick, they're just working out how they're gonna make the launch smooth without allowing exploits and all. Overal, what I mean is that it's not about how things are seen, it's just how we react to them. Let's be gentlemen, report, talk about it. Not blame the devs for not having everything fixed two months before launch, y'know ?
---
I joined a guild and eventually started grouping up a lot with the guild leader. We started talking outside of the game and became pretty close. Close enough that we were making plans to meet and talking about relationships. Then one day he just said he didnt feel "that way" about me and we could just be friends. I was hurt but whatever. Later I came across him somewhere and he was erp-ing with someone. After asking him about it he said that he loved her and wanted to be with her. I had to break it to him that "her" was a g.i.r.l. He was so upset he quit the game and the guild ended up falling apart. I logged on a couple years ago and I had one character still in it. Dunno what's up with it now.
---
Yeah all you can do is skinning I've also been practicing on a more empty server and even there it slows you down so much to even chase herbs. Skinning, first aid, and cooking only imo if you wanna go fast
---
I'm mainly doing cooking because I'm a warrior, I'd skip it otherwise. Maybe take if I was a rogue

I think the shaman would be the better option cuz you can heal raids as ele/resto and better in group pvp. Shadow is one of the best 1v1 specs but raids normally only take 1 shadow priest if they even take any also I think for group pvp people more look for disc or holy priest.
---
"Several hunter pets fixed" 
---
We could talk about the other pets.

The guy from the Onyxia wipe video 'many whelps left side handle it!!' was my guild leader during TBC. His name was Xmaniac and he played on Firetree. He was actually an alright guy suprisingly lmao

But but why troll?

Good luck leveling with no hammer. Also devotion aura is basically useless at level 1. Mobs can’t even kill you.

This 3000
---
I've always been on the backfoot with the WoW expansions. My friends were always day-one players and I just didn't have the time, so whenever I eventually did I would be miles behind and just playing on my own - so I only ever really experienced a tiny bit of BC, WotLK, WoD and Legion respectively. The excitement around this Classic stuff has me pretty excited to be a part of it from the start.
---
It automatically squelches you after x amount of reports (IIRC, it was around 10 within a fairly short time frame).  Squelching means you can only speak to your friends and your guild.  The squelch lasts until a GM can review the reports.  This can take hours or even days, which would be debilitating in Classic.
---
Aside from the obvious avenues for guilds and such to abuse this feature, it doesn't even need to be a concerted effort-- if you say something controversial ("I like retail WoW better than Classic" or something as innocuous-yet-contextually-inflammatory like that) in a reasonably populated area like the Barrens, there's a very good chance that a bunch of random people will respond by reporting you and you'll get squelched.  That'll make it impossible to ask for help, get groups, etc. until a GM reviews it.
---
Furthermore, because the rules on trolling and harassment are so subjective and nebulous, it's unlikely that anyone would get punished for reporting you unless it was very obviously a directed attack.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Hiw does that effect the game in total?

I was part of Avant-Garde on Kil'Jaeden US. We had some girl drama in our guild who would send nudes to get loot. Well someone got ahold of those pictures and posted them in our forums. We were a top 30guild in the world, so people tracked our progress. Well the topic ended up gathering other guilds and servers. 
---
By the end of it all, we had a full 100+ thread of all the "WoW Whores" in the game.
---
Lots of fapping material.
---
I dont have beta so after stresa test i subbed to argue with retail players basically. The fact that im there to do that and tons of others jumped in on low level accounts makes me realise the unhealthy levels of addictive tendencies im old school rpg lovers and im so fucked up i love it. All the retail babies words were "durpp yeah lets lose real life for upkeep in video game characters who would want a game with balance and skill instead of massive time sink" or "classic wow doesnt let normal people play because you cant do shit if youre not some shutin who does drugs and goes on welfare" and the sad part is i agreed in excitement for release while responding "i know...itll be great you fucking casuals".
---
I dont get why this topic is downvoted. Its a pretty interesting topic if you ask me. 
---
I personally used probably a bit too much stamina on my hunter back in vanilla. I felt pretty hardy in PvP, but I bet my damage was lacking compared to other hunters.
---
Yes, we couldn't keep up with a guild that was doing bwl 5x a week.  You fucking moron
---
How do you lvl the eng? Buying mats?
---
This is very well done! Good job OP your editing skills are at least 250.
---
Kill times are roughly the same til about 40. The biggest talent in ret is actually the 8% MS buff. You'll be doing a lot of traveling and this is what is going to cut out a lot of your downtime and you get it at lvl 20 so you get a lot of mileage out of it. Another thing to note is that ret is much more Mana efficient which again lowers your downtime.
---
There is a benefit to holy though as you can both heal and tank in dungeons so you won't have to wait too long to find a group.
---
Finding a warlock friend is God tier leveling duo. So much utility and ultimate survivability. Plus free mounts for both you
---
Ele shamy has exclusivity on gear ..... literally no-one can use +spell damage mail gear.
---
Otherwise Shadow priests are stronger in smaller PVP encounters as they are considered to be one of the if not the strongest dueling class.
---
Ele are great in Big PVP .... chain lighting is sooooo much fun. 
---
In groups and Raids they suffer from the same Mana and threat issues and are mostly brought for utility, usually one MAX.
---
We did it for a month.....It is not like we did it for 6 months.... Get your head out of your ass.
---
What do you even mean? Most people rate TBC as their favorite expansion, TBC had amazing player count growth and pretty much where ever you look people talk about how good TBC was. 
---
The only reason we have this huge demand for vanilla is honestly probably only because of all the nostalrius drama.
---
i played a rouge and hunter. i leave my pet off in slight distance (hunter) and run up click/loot it and set my pet on them. in a few seconds i would get i'd walk off and feign death before they reached me.  then get up and shadowmeld and eat some popcorn for the inevitable person running into them. on my rogue i'd pop evasion then loot/vanish combo.  i'd enjoy the /1. \[general\]  WTF where did these ghosts come from??
---
While i do not think we will have the same epic AV battles as back in vanilla, im sure there will be more "non-reward seeking" people doing pvp than people think.
---
People like to imagine that Classic will be like a private server where everyone has gone out of their way to go back and play a lost version of WoW and max it out.
---
Classic will have a lot of average players that are just looking to have fun - so maybe there wont be a majority of boring people who just join bgs to get a reward and afk or whine as soon as someone doesnt do exactly what they say.
---
My god do you have just any idea of what you're talking about? They used their 8.0 engine to read the old data cause they couldn't just boot up the old game, this comes at a price. All the hiatus between the announcement and the demo, and then until the beta, that was them working hard to make it literally just playable, and now they're fixing bugs that are small in comparison to just not having pet trainer or completely wrong lighting. It's a lot of work, and you clearly haven't looked into it at ALL.
---
So you and Zirzor thought it's a good idea to share all the proper gold making secrets? now everyone and their moms are going to be doing the same shit , well done.
---
Greg Kasavin is a legend. I get what you're saying of course but bear in mind this was an era of written reviews and gamers who used to take their time reading a well-structured review... the video was just a cherry on the top. Besides, when someone respected and knowledgeable tells you her impressions in an impromptu way it's often better than an overedited video imo.
---
Most people most likely wont minmax their gear at the start, just take anything they can equip thats better than the  current stuff
---
These are all awesome btw.
---
All of them so far would be awesome to fill out the original vanilla Azeroth map for Classic + content.
---
Mind doing a mockup of the Crater of Azshera?  The BG entrance and hill is actually there in southern Azshera by the Dragonscale leatherworker trainer complete with a would-be alliance and horde entrance.
---
I personally would have loved it if they completed that zone, the BG, the quests (the shipwrecked defense one, furbolg gate,  etc.).
---
Yes I'm aware you said "last one" but these are really just that good.
---
Energy addon for rogues, and battleground targets. That's it.
---
Lool, is maths your strong point
---
5 IDs a week for a month is 20ids. You got 5 months worth of gear in one month, and you think your progression is legitimate
---
Just fucking own it dude.
---
Paladin will 1 shot you before you can cast a smite tho. Assuming he has an enchanted 2H weapon as well
---
Well you're talking about two different specs, so there's really no comparison.  
---
As a healer, you'll find spots.  
---
As a shaman, you provide more utility than  Spriest. Having said that, a good spriest is fine for most 5man dungeons and can provide some help with healing if things start to go sideways.  
---
But between the two (spriest vs ele/resto shaman), you'll have a better/easier time finding spots as a shaman.  
---
Lastly, if you level as a spriest, which I think most if not all priests should, you can switch to disc/holy for dungeons/raiding. A holy/disc priest vs a elem/resto shaman, it's a coinflip, depending on what a group needs.
---

---
It’s funny you bring up race choices. Alliance have such a huge variety! You can play Human, Smaller Human, Tiny Human or Tree Hugger Blue Human.
---
The Sims much?
---
I find any full raid healing spec better off having a proper Farming Alt .... I do not know a skingle person in Vanilla with just one level 60 .... most of the ppl had a few, PVE, PVP, Farm, other reasons.
---
Tank - Paladin
---
Heal - Paladin
---
DPS - 3x Paladin
---
for maximum comfort - Dwarf Paladins
---
Everything else is absurd, why would anyone not play paladin?
---
Do you have a version of your recolor without the cropping? I'd love to use it as a wallpaper but unfortunately I use a 21:9 monitor and the original was much closer to that ratio
---
Right??  yessss
---
I buy the hammer back at level 6, just before I start killing things.
---
Berserking has always been the best caster racial in the game. OP probably values it more than stun resist from orc
---
Or they think they look better
---
Agreed.
---
Unless you;'re a hardcore PvE player, TBC just sucked overall. World PvP &amp; BG's &gt; Arena and resilience imo.
---
There is so much potential in Classic for "classic+" content that it would dwarf all the content in TBC, nevermind the fact "classic+" wouldn't obsolete all the level 60 content if they build it horizontally ( you know, like an actual *expansion*???).
---
If you are committed to playing horde then I'll limit the discussion to that. Here is what I consider important: class population, playstyles, racials.
---
On horde, Shaman is one of the most played classes. Shaman throw out beast chain heals, it is satisfying to dungeon and raid as restoration. The skill cap is relatively high since you must use the correct totems. Look up totem weaving. Troll and orc come out ahead in racials. Tauren is decent if PvP and herbalism/alch. You can go elemental and heal dungeons, but you'll have a horrible time single target healing in MC.
---
Priest is a highly played class, but a little less so on Horde. Since resto shaman has great group healing, horde priests generally talent toward high single target healing. Priest doesnt have the widespread utility of a shaman, but they have a greater amount of healing based spells. They also have wonderfully fun spells like mind control. Both troll and undead are great. You can also go shadow and still heal through all dungeons and even MC since as shadow you pick up the mana efficiency spells in discipline. I find priest very satisfying to play
---
Not sure, but at this rate I wouldn't put it past them having it done before release.
---
There is already an option to downgrade graphics to "Classic" in video options..... not sure what more is needed?
---
WAHT DA FUQ
---
Might be better off holding onto the hammer Incase you actually find mobs and want to kill them. Assuming you’re doing an exploration route at launch.
---
Meta memes.
---
Twinked, Rogue, too much Agi. Non-twinked with help, Warlock can technically get Imp at level 1, but its hard to get without dinging to level 2. Otherwise, probably Paladin.
---
I wish I didn’t discover the release date for classic, these next two months are gonna last forever
---
Never considered it from the side of the guys getting stomped :p
---
If it stays rip every caster trying to fight against warrior
---
No worries, in this day and age, who needs sources or facts, amirite?

---
Look how quick you were to soapbox. Get mad about something that actually affects you, you weird hysteric.
---
Loot addons
---
These are great points, I am not really interested in playing as a PURE healing spec, so I think based on that alone I may lean toward shaman. It sounds like I can be at least viable in most if not all the content as well as a hybrid shaman.
---
Rogue will be dead before he even gets to evis.
---
Just go combat. Combat swords while leveling is actually pretty good for pvp because of endurance, improved sprint and the 5% hit talents. And also being able to level faster is obviously benificial for pvp too. You being 3 levels higher than your enemy &gt; talent points all day. Just watch how Payo is owning all these "pvp specced" rogues on the beta right now using combat swords, simply because pvp spec at low lvl doesnt do much damage.
---
My guild was full of them on Zul'jin-US:
---
- Hand of Rag went to our DRUID class lead, also the guild/raid leader's girlfriend at the time. The best part about this was that almost no one in our guild was butthurt about it, we literally did it for the lulz. It would've gone to our only arms warrior, who was an officer and highly respected dude across the server, but he didn't want it.
---
- Our Paladin class lead wielded a Brutality Blade with +55 healing on it. He was the butt of many jokes on the server at the time.
---
- Raid/Guild leader instituted a no feign death policy during raids. It got a couple hunters booted from the guild.
---
- Raid/Guild leader was a notorious drama whore, and led by screaming at people every night. Those who couldn't take it left, those who could stuck around, and we progressed better than your average Vanilla guild.
---
- Raid/Guild leader used very unconventional strats, most notably on razorgore.
---
- We constantly had beef with other guilds on the server for the dumbest things, but most tolerated or laughed with us.

You dont start putting the moves on a woman by telling her to change herself if youre a good guy.

Hyjal, grim batol, karazhan, hellfire peninsula, ulduar uldum, and many other.

2 top rival LS were competing for server first tiamat kill. our LS got server first kill, 7 days later it respawns and the rival LS claims it and starts downing it. At 1% things get shaky and my friend walks up, uses the skill mug as Sam/thf, and claims tiamat at 1%. we use everything we got to kill it just the 2 of us, and thanks to quick thinking got the /cfh tag just before dying. now theres a 7 day spawn that will never drop loot. the entire server imploded over this, people left LSs and formed new ones
---
I am definately looking for that fun factor. I don't want to be bored leveling, or struggle with dungeons.
---
I would like to see you make 950g in less than an hour in classic wow!
---
You really want to level with a partner, for example a warrior pulls with ranged weapon, the mob runs towards him and then either taunts him or pulls another mob, and you have mimimum 85% crit chance through talents. You can just group up with anyone from trade chat, the experience of duo leveling with ambus rogue is rewarding for both people
---
Must easier to grind efficiently then quest. For both XP and at level 60 for gold.
---
Maybe he wants all the new character models?
---
The current AV is a gutted wreck of it's former self... sorta like the classes in retail, I suppose.
---
So you mean all the places we did in fact see in other expansions. I’m not exactly sure what you are asking for
---
Please use search function.
---
Im excited to roll "need" on anything that isnt plate or a wand.
---
To be fair, imagine if all the corpses *ever* created were laying around the ground.
---
Westfall would be an entirely gray, wobbly ground. Sounds funny, sure, but it's not really necessary or adds anything.
---
We'll see enough skeletons laying around once Classic's out as there will not be daily patches I reckon.
---
Horrible slog, yes, long /played, not so much.  Grinding is as fast or faster then doing quests almost all of the time.
---
Yea not sure why people are trying to bar people from content based on class... it's BS and to reminiscent of r.io and its BS system
---
That doesn't negate any of the reasons listed above.
---
I hope you're wrong!
---
Oh...... wouldn't that affect the Master Race Taurens???
---
I don't want my character to be perceived in a way that isn't the one intended by my initial character creation.
---
This is a big point of classic - you can't transmog, you can't change models, no barbershop - you are what you are.
---
The appeal is progress. It's satisfying to be able to pick an herb you couldn't beforehand. I hate how retail professions work. Plus they're mostly pointless.  Especially while leveling.
---
Thanks for your cool work. Probably should implement tables like this directly into the website if people actually find them useful.
---
&gt; they'll try to make the BC break, realize that nobody is interested in that and then give up
---
Anecdotal but, I know guilds worth of people that, sure, are getting into classic for vanilla experience itself, but that is secondary to them in comparison to playing TBC. As people mentioned in this thread, TBC private servers haven't been done *really* well yet and instead of being a discouraging factor, it will be an advantage instead.
---
I dont want that either.
---
HOLY SHIT CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE THE 100,000TH PERSON TO POST THIS EXACT SAME RETARDED POST IN THE LAST MONTH?
---
GUESS WHAT YOU WIN???? FUCKING NOTHING LEARN TO LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGE BEFORE POSTING, THANKS!!!
---
Durid : skinning / leather working. To me never skinned beasts are lost money. Also I can make armor for myself to improve self sufficiency
---
PS I fucking posted a screen shot of a TR kill and you've only just realised I was in TR, typical DV intelligence lol
---
Asked and answered numerous times.
---
Also the best Tanking racial, or just behind Human Sword Spec.
---
Yeah I think this ultimately is the best way to go if leveling Sub. The damage while solo is best for the first 50% of the enemy mob's hp anyway. I've experienced Ambush Rogue duo leveling first hand and I have to say it's absolutely amazing. Kill times are seldom higher than 5-10 seconds for mobs within a level or so. I just wanted to see if anyone had gotten any decent success for a solo sub build.
---
 &gt; and I and anyone else who has ever done engineering, QA, or design can tell you, there is no such thing as a bug free piece of software
---
HAHA, let me show you my calculator app you scrub, 100% bug-free
---
For pve yes, but if your goal is to do dungeons and BG's you don't need a pve racial. 
---
But ofc the aesthetics harms of the troll male is important
---
You posted this 9 minutes after someone asking basically the same question.
---
I really like the female trolls because they stand upright and I love the casting animations. From what I understand beraerking would be great as a casting dps?
---
Last month ???? more like last week alone.
---
Casuals eh?

---
I really did not think of gear exclusivity either. That is huge.
---
Yeah but orc or tauren is so much better for pvp, and that's where you really notice the difference. You doing 5% more damage in a dungeon? Who cares. You killing some paladin because you resist hand of justice? Oh baby
---
&gt;Back during Vanilla the community was overall a little more elitist than it is now and people expected you be in pre-raid BIS.
---
From what I've seen on here and experienced on Private servers you are 100% wrong. During Vanilla unless you were at the top end, BiS gear wasn't a term you were even aware of. Nowdays to get into Ony &amp; MC pugs on private servers you need pre-raid BiS and then some. I do think Classic servers will be more relaxed but I do expect a fair amount of people turned down from some 5-man dungeons and most raids due to gear.
---
I also saw a lot of good comments about the game from newcomers in beta and like usual people love to troll.
---
Ask either the warrior or rogue discord. You will get a bunch of half informed answers here.
---
I think you might be giving batching too much credit. The problem is that visual signals don't match up with reality. You think "I started casting frostbolt a fraction of a second before he started poly, so I can complete my cast and cs him before he finishes casting sheep", but spell batching means that he's gonna get his sheep off and you're getting your frostbolt off and maybe, defying intuition or logic, you'll also get to counter spell him, all because those casts occurred in the same batch window. 
---
Remember that batching was a compromise, a best of bad options to account for high latency in the game's early years. It wasn't a conscious decision or intentional gameplay feature the way you're describing it in hindsight. Had the devs had the option of a shorter window, they probably would have taken it. I don't think they'll be keen to preserve the vanilla experience by capping my frame rate at 10fps during boss fights, for example, even though that technological limitation did encourage some...unique...playstyles at the time. Keeping the camera faced away from spell effects was CORE to my vanilla raiding experience...I seriously hope they don't try and recreate that for either of us.
---
Shortening the batching window to match the system in retail means that visual queues represent reality (within a very small window). I will fully concede that the current classic implementation offers the potential for some unique plays taking advantage of the system, but I would argue the same could be said for most "bugs"...they reward players who understand and exploit them, but that doesn't mean that those bugs represent the best implementation of the designers' vision. I would argue that vision is much closer to "cs the enemy when you see them casting" then "go for the charge even though you know you're outpositioned because you know batching will account for your relative slowness". 
---
If it's a mechanic, I would argue that dispensing with it, while driving us of one playstyle, would improve the gane by bolstering others, with the benefit of me mechanics more closely abiding by the "reality" of the animations.
---
Keep in mind you also get resto gear as well as there is no Paladin to use the Mail healing gear like in TBC.
---
Now hit this mob..... HARD!!!
---
inconsolable*  some educator you are...
---
Damn, dude straight won a 1v3 against a group with a healer. I kind of want to roll lock too now..
---
You okay bro?
---
Neither do I!
---
But we don't live in a naive 2004. Unfortunately, when you break it down, it really is an ethical issue at heart: Does our personal enjoyment of a videogame have a higher priority than the return of an old, multimillion dollar blackmarket industry which preys on the most vulnerable of our fellow players?
---
When I realized that's what it boiled down to, the answer is unequivocally no. Unfortunately, I discovered that r/classicwow has a lot of really angry, sociopathic commenters who gleefully felt otherwise. 
---
Was kinda sickening.
---
AV mobs were gradually nerfed until 1.12 where almost all the neutral mobs were removed, loads of guards and nerfed tons of the NPCs. This often caused AV to become a race to the finish because it was far easier to bypass mobs and objectives. In BC, reinforcements were introduced, to counteract turtle games forever. Yet another of the worst possible solutions to problems that Blizzard introduced post-1.11, reinforcements more strongly encouraged turtling, which basically caused every game to devolve into a turtle where no one really moved.
---
I am not going to debate that. You are almost certainly right. I will consider it, but I am not that into min/maxing either.
---
Must have titan panel for true vanilla experience
---
That's what i mean, it's either hours of mundane farming or not even an hour worth of irl work for many.
---
See here is how a real guild killed bosses, insulting someone's intelligence when you did not figure out how to win.
---
Wait. You think they are less elitist now? Based on what?
---
No, but many of those reasons are subjective to begin with, or just flat out misconceptions so they don't hold much weight in my opinion.
---
The same thing happened to us on one of our first few runs through BWL.  That rogue was the guild hero for the rest of the week and it was a moment that was talked about for at least a month after the fact.  Good times.  I can't wait to play this game again!
---
Create a PUG MC and reserve bindings drops. 
---
Thats the plan i have for my mage to get it. (If they can complete the chain).
---
Do the quest line with your normal guild. 
---
This obviously works after your guild has finished running MC.
---
oh god I love this type of thread,
---
Was playing horde back in WOTLK, got recruited by a Alliance guild to main tank for them,  Went over made great friends and had a blast but we where always looking for a OT/ step in MT when rl got in the way.  In rolls this gnome warrior, she came from one of the top guilds on the server and we wondered why she would leave and come to a 2 bit guild like ours.  For the first month she got on well, took the OT role on well, she needed to be hand fed what to do as she has said she was the MT in her old guild and didn't know how to OT.  Then it started, I was working full time so during the day she was on waging a war on the guild trying to gt herself the MT position, she would talk shit about me to the officers to anyone who would listen and when the leaders or myself where on she would whisper the leaders and offers nudes/ anything else for my job.  Raids nights where tough, mid fight she would pull extra mobs or fail to pull extra mobs and wipe us and always passive aggressive in raid chat about how crap I was.  This all culminated on the night of our first lich king kill.  Weeks of trying and banging our heads we finally get him down, she was absent from the run but was on in guild.  After hearing that we had downed him she went off her head.  She started whispering me going off about how I didn't deserve it and basically ripping me apart, whispering the GM and the officers about how bad I was, then in an extreme attempt to out me she in guild chat started accusing me of harassment.  I was so over it at that point, told the GM I'm out im done seeya later and left that night.  That was the one and only LK kill they had and they never completed another raid night with her, it got that bad that they stopped raiding all together.  I am still mates with the GM and he is still playing,  I got a whisper from him the other day asking would I like to come back and MT.  But alas I cannot give time for raiding anymore.
---
Shamans are a great class. Great utility. Just don't be angry/surprised if people want you to heal instead of DPS. That chain heal is sweet stuff.
---
Lok'Tar Ogar!
---
bindings of the windseeker makes people do crazy things.  that yellow text man... lotta stories in here revolving around thunderfury. 
---
i was fortunate back in retail, got one half, and again 10 years later in a private server.  never completed it, but i remember watching a rival guild fall apart because the guild leader got both halves and dropped everything to get all the mats to put it together.  when he finally got it, the guild disbanded from the stress and he quit the server.
---
Skilling up so you can gather that next herb that is teasing you.
---
A reason to desire to skillup.  A reason to collect less desirable herbs because you need the skillups.
---
Names redacted to protect the guilty.
---
Trolls are BiS casters and threat tanks for Horde.
---
Chinglish confirmed there would be, hes said on his stream multiple times that hes asked his blizz friends who said there would be
---
enhancement shaman pve dps
---
pewpew
---
That dude has balls of titanium.
---
That's the quick way to get blacklisted on a vanilla server then.
---
They're overpowered items and they're BiS for all physical damage dealers.
---
might just look a bit different but I suppose they could just force the hit box to remain the same and thus change nothing. I am not in support of adding the new character models because I think they are terrible but to each their own? idk, lol
---
I'm going to be reminding every hunter in my UBRS groups about this.... or maybe i'll just let it happen and bubble hearth.
---
I didn’t play any mmo’s before wow but the bard in rift was cool for a while
---
The new models are tied to the new animations. The old ones don't work well with them looking quite awful at times. Blizzard doesn't want to put in the effort to make the new models work with the old animations. The client can't change the animations based on which models are used so you're basically asking for classic to use bfa animations by asking for new models.
---
Sorry - you caught me before the edit. I changed it to "Not enough" because that's really what will hinge on whether they continue on to Wrath or not - how many people will move from classic to TBC. If it's a 50-50 split they won't want to 50-50 split again for Wrath.
---
TBC is okay, it's about as good as Vanilla in my opinion. But we need TBC to get to WotLK, and WotLK is where the magic happens.
---
We don't know for sure if it will remain in tho. Unless they have made a blue post discussing it? I am not hopeful they will remove it but there is a chance? Maybe? LOL
---
testing was done in the first four hours.   
---
it's because wod had crz, that evened out server populations, so full servers and dead servers shared their players across their time zones resulting in far fewer players being visible on full servers than there should have been.  
---
&gt; Sharding+CRZ principles were how we had the Legion pre-event
---
again, you had to group to leave your dead shard. and there were dead shards during the legion pre-event.   
---
&gt; BfA has gotten wonky as hell   
---
&gt;true.
---
&gt; experiences you have from the Stress test. 
---
they're the same as people have on the beta, and the same as i have on retail atm, though closer to before they changed crz so you couldn't join a group with anyone in the world to change server (they had to be in your zone). making it far easier to abuse.  
---
but lets talk about what its intentions are in classic. they are purely to divide the population for a "smoother experience" a population that's already divided 6 ways (starting zones) being divided again? if bfa populations on release are anything to go off classic launch is gonna be single player af.

Warlock sets looks so good, i wanted to go warlock at first but i'm a stupid tryhard that likes how his character looks and how he is optimized and the bis before T3 are just too ugly for my taste.. fak
---
You raise a lot of good points, but TBC definitely nailed class balance.  The piss poor performance of specs like Ret, Enhancement, Balance in PvE is bad game design, full stop.  The developers weren't fully sure of what they were doing yet, and TBC fixed it.
---
Price approx in EU, 100 g for about 10 $ early on and then it will go down.
---
My childhood friend deals with gold sellers in retail and told me this
---
Had so many good times finding all the hidden places in vanilla. Getting under deadmines. Behind IF. House at the end of the world... jesus I hope that's a thing in classic
---
&gt;WoD had toggleable new and old models when new models first came out and when you toggled old graphics on you just saw everything as they always were
---
No it didn't, it worked horribly.
---
I wouldn't mind an option to have new models *with old animation*, so you understand.
---
Everyone has their opinion. I think Vanilla, TBC and WOTLK are all incredibly good. TBC is my favorite tho.
---
Worgen are the second worst race in the game.  Change my mind.
---
It was a pretty lackadaisical guild. It took a lot of convincing of the leadership to even raid with that other guild for the few weeks we did, because they didn’t want to foster a negative guild environment focused on raiding rather than just being friends that all play the same game.
---
I have a.... few... incidents that come to mind.
---
- Early BC.  We had a small friends and families guild.  A few of us wanted to raid so we moved our mains to another guild to raid.  The guild leader did too but switched back because she and her husband wanted to play more casual.   They started to complain when we didn't do the same thing.  We still wanted to raid and enjoyed the other guild too.  One night the guild leader started yelling at me that we were conspiring against her and her husband because my friend's wife named her alt a similar name as the guild leaders' husband's alt.  I'm not joking.  I was like "What does this have to do with me?"   Then she talked about disbanding the guild.  I thought I talked her down.   The next day I logged in and the guild is gone and she and her husband server transferred. 
---
- Mid-BC.  This guy in the guild was upset by one of our raiders alts names and decided to report him to a GM.  And then told the guild that he did this too so that none of the females in the guild would be offended by the alt's harsh name (I believe it was 'Faqu').   Instead of just mentioning it to the dude in private or just reporting it to a GM and letting it go from there.    So the guy who had to rename his character was pissed.  The guild was pissed.  And the ladies in the guild were "We don't need you to protect us, asshole" pissed.
---
- Mid-Wrath.  There was the gnome warrior who was always semi-afk during pulls in Battle of Mount Hyjal and went on Vent you could hear the TV loudly behind him.  There was a betting pool on how far into the fight he'd last before he died.  A few people made enough gold to pay for their flasks and pots.   I guess that's not super juicy, but its been over 10 years and I still remember it well, so its funny, lol.
---
- Mid-Cataclysm.  This flirtatious lady apparently fresh from a break up joins the guild and immediately falls for the flirtatious guild leader.  In front of a 25 man raid she's saying things like "Hey pookie, what are you doing after the raid?"
---
- Early Wrath:  There was a general nuisance guy who was a good DPS and a good raider but outside of that would often 'rebel' against authority and pull bad jokes.  We're setting up to pull Grobbulous in Naxxramas.  Now he'd been told about this before, but just as the feast gets dropped he throws his mole machine down and sends half the raid, including the warlocks and mages to Blackrock Depths.   It took probably 10 minutes to get everyone back and recover for the pull.  He was promptly kicked from the guild.  Not for the first time.  And I think not for the last either.
---
&gt; you did not figure out how to cheat.
---
Corrected.
---
I jacked a flurry axe from the guild bank. I was also 10 at the time so I didn’t really understand why everyone was so upset.
---
Just wish TBC still had that "the whole world matters" feel and huge dungeons from Vanilla.
---
The rest is almost entirely improved. Classes, Raids, dungeonmechanics yet still needing CC, yet retaining all of what made Classic a proper RPG and a proper MMO.
---
I'd still play the everliving crap out of a TBC Classic, but until then, Vanilla will entertain me for quite some time I reckon
---
After the hour+ WSG I just limped through, I really hope they remove it. There's a certain druid on the horde side (pictured above) that does this all day, every day. I can't sweat the technique because it's really effective, but it's also really annoying.
---
both panderen and gnomes exist
---
You also have to remember, TBC is where a lot of people started. Many many players missed/skipped vanilla and started playing WoW in TBC, so for them, the thoughts of a TBC.20 is what classic is to vanilla players.
---
I don't think a choice should be given. Blizzard should trademark this system, something like "Project Eternal", continue to aggressively go after any pirate servers that pop up.
---
If you allow the possibility of staying on your classic version of the game indefinitely, that kills any hope for TBC or Wrath to begin with, yeah.
---
Did they nail class balance or start the path ro class homogenization. It is an RPG game, your class isn't supposed to heal, tank, and dps. Look what it led to.
---
They have enough bugs and issues to deal with as is IMO. As much as character model may be an innocent addition it may take away from current developer resources.
---
Needs more Orgrimmar...
---
Blizzard took TBC then doubled it. That was WOTLK. Never again.
---
Do you really think people would read that? Lets be honest, all you did was add to the heap of posts about beta access, LOL
---
This is true, if i see my character in a certain way, i want everyone else to see them as intended
---
Nostalgia.
---
Lol wtf is this shit
---
No it's his mum. He was adopted.
---
Stormx? LOL
---
I liked being able to betray my faction to join the other side, like EQ2 had. So basically an orc joins Alliance, human joins Horde. I know most people would be against it. But it would seem to fit some parts of Wow. There are groups in the game now made up of members of both factions. It might be neat if players could do that too. Or even a neutral 3rd faction any character could do a long quest chain to join.
---
Im not saying you're wrong but likes per reply dont mean shit. You are counting that as approval rating but you are counting anyone who didnt vote as disapproval rating. I never like or dislike anything regardless of my stance on it and i imagine there are many like me. And even if i did i would be way more likely to dislike something i would be against rather than liking everything i agree with. I wont say that i will never dislike something but im sure as hell never gonna like something. I mean whats the point?
---
Were you not on a server with lopsided pops where you had to wait an hour for any BG to start?
---
During actual vanilla you could get banned for like 3 days when enough people reported you for abusing that. Not sure what will happen in classic.
---
Even for better PVE they really could outdo themselves in Classic+ content.
---
Also if they were up to it hosting a BC version in conjunction with a classic+ version would probably be best or they may never regain the BC private server crews.
---
But anyways we're way ahead of ourselves.  Classic has to retain a larger playerbase than Blizz currently projects in order to warrant it's own new content development.
---
No you go back and make more!
---
it was all planed for vanilla without raising levelcap and flying mounts.
---
they just recycled the ideas with later expansions
---
he is asking for those zones without changing the vanilla gameplay. simple to understand
---
It seems like it, the armor is virtually worthless, the only thing you notice is not having food or water but at that level regen is so high it barely matters.
---
I dont think you can speak for everyone buddy
---
Nah couldn't give less of a shit
---
I'd prefer not to share character names on a public forum, so I'll neither confirm nor deny this
---
Remember in RFK we jumped into the pit and the hunter's pet pulled the entire instance running around.
---
yes, let's follow that logic shall we? wow is still alive with LFR, transmog, no debuff limit...current wow isn't dead and it has those mechanics! we shouldn't be afraid of integrating them into classic! and if the #nochanges people get mad, just tell them to move to private servers!  
---
see how it breaks down? let's continue
---
basically what you're saying is giving pally the correct gear to tank will destroy classic. how can you defend such a position? should it be the the best tank? maybe not. but it should be viable and distinct from warrior, so as to have more variety. maybe the pally is the better AoE tank through the spell reflect DMG, consec and occasional heals. maybe pally just performs better against undead. that's good class flavour, and it gives players a good mix of gameplay. the pally will be the trash tank while the warrior will tank the bosses. that's like differentiating mage and warlock. mage does more damage, but warlock has it's own utility. they both have their place in all areas of the game. having one does not invalidate the other, and the game is better for it.  
---
to be clear. we don't want LFR or janky dailies in classic. we just want to see the truly scuffed mechanics of classic fixed, so that the game will be better as a whole. you can't say vanilla is perfect. no game is. we're trying to come up with ideas to fix the flaws that still follow the original flavour of the game.
---
Donno what you are talking about. Healers in WoW as 100% support. They heal and buff and that's it's really.
---
EQ bard was also pretty awesome.
---
The Elephant in the room of course - EU servers being English-only and German/Spanish servers creating their own communities on the eng. servers.
---
Bard in EQ was tons of fun, especially in a group. Weaving songs to buff the group was a great mechanic, and you had some solo play options.
---
for sure, i was just giving him the 'needed' baseline as he was mentioning the yellow cap and talking about keeping it simple
---
It was in an interview, they said that all BGs will definitely be cross realm from the start.
---
This mentality by the player base is why tank is always in demand. Not many people want to do the gritty, thankless job.
---
The paladin was from Texas. The husband and wife were from Vancouver.
---
At least that’s how I read that comment.
---
You want 305+ for the 3% hit, but you also want 308 skill (especially since it's extremely easy to get for rogues) for less penalty on glancing blows.
---
Probably around 600$+ doubt he would go lower, if he does he does not charge enough.. think tbh a painting like that is in the 1k+ range imo
---
I hope it doesn't come down to a ban for this guy, as I'm a grudging fan. He pulled off a slick stump juke earlier that most could not even begin to attempt.
---
Someone uploads a video of bugs they find in classic, which gets posted to reddit later. Comments saying "fucking blizz fix your game" get downvoted. Comments saying "thanks for doing your part with testing, I hope you reported this in game" get upvoted.
---
Circlejerk about classic "whiners" appears out of nowhere, even though the majority of posters and commenters aren't whining at all, and those who are (the minority) get downvoted. My response wasn't meant to be pissy at all, if you feel somehow personally offended, I'm sorry you feel that way. What I'm saying is, you (op) can't claim that the bug didn't exist when you personally admit that you also didnt test for it earlier in the beta cycles, then use that as a way to tell people to chill. The majority of people are not raging or whining, but you can interpret comments however you want to, I guess.
---
The mechanical complexity is the amount of proccs a single spell can lead to. You can easily gain like five buffs from a single hit. Thus the server needs to check for much more in each intervall.
---
Yeah, I only played TBC at launch for about 3 months and then quit, not returning for a year. So I missed a lot of content when it was fresh, never gave it a fair shake. Maybe it's great. But I *know* WotLK is.
---
Class balance and raiding was great in TBC.
---
Pservers have a lot of things that are not supposed to exist.
---
Fuck no, hate that battle royal fad.  Keep that shit outta here.
---
&gt; Man you're really pulling at straws trying to defend this.
---
Sure, if "grasping at straws" is what you want to call a well-formed rebuttal.

WRONG
---
Wasn't so much a single plot as it was a bunch of plots that intertwined and were seperate
---
Clique!
---
If you think what he said is easy to understand, more power to you. It was very jumbled and unclear to me.
---
To say they never showed us any of those zones, which we did in fact see, I think is just completely inaccurate.
---
You are not in the beta.
---
A large portion of the players interested in classic do not play retail or have not played wow at all since whichever expansion they left at.  People specifically want classic to not be retail.  There are also the retail players that already want nothing to do with classic to begin with.
---
There will definitely be plenty of people who jump on every now and then simply because its free with their subscription, and those who level to 20 and decide they prefer retail.  
---
That type of thing is true for any game though.  Monster Hunter World expansion comes out in September, and the new star wars game is November I think, so there could be some dips as other games pop up too, but probably not huge and not permanent.
---
I think that direction really took off during WotLK, with Ghostcrawler's repeated emphasis on their *"bring the player, not the glass"* design philosophy.  That's when buffs really started getting homogenized.
---
In TBC, Shamans were still unique.  Warriors/Paladins/Druids were all capable tanks, but with different specialties -- single target threat / AoE threat / massive HP pools, as I remember it.  Shadow Priests were mana batteries in a way no other class could be.  There might have been some slight overlap here and there, but it was WotLK where they decided to give DK's windfury, and Rogues got misdirect, and several classes got various mobility options.
---
Plus in TBC, if a class could perform all 3 roles (like Druids or Paladins), they still didn't beat pure DPS at doing damage.  The DPS of Pallies and Druids and Shamans got buffed to the point of viability, but not to the extent that people stopped needing pure DPS.
---
I don't think it's right to say what a class is and isn't suppose to do. I have absolutely no issue with hybrids unless they were better than 'pure' dps specs or something. I also feel TBC was superior to Classic strictly based off balance. I'm insanely excited to play Classic as I didn't get to experience it first hand but I can't help but feel slightly deflated having some specs not viable.
---
Ret lol
---
lol not everyone has the same interests as you, I would much rather play games with my friends than stick my porker in some bimbo I'm never going to see again and probably not even remember.
---
It puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the chair again!!!
---
But they've already established that if they do TBC they'll leave classic servers in tact.
---
Like I mentioned, if you are only interested in one job (playing feral in your case) then druid isn’t your class in vanilla. You have to embrace the hybrid nature and versatility of the class.
---
If you only want to tank and melee dps then you are much better off playing warrior.
---
Hunter's run the 21marks/30surv build for PvP... not Marks

---
ook, so where do I join devilsaur mafia?
---
From memory every class was better balance. So you didn't have to stack 10war and 8mage.
---
Vanilla was originally designed to be the most casual MMO on the marked ..... What you suggest would move the needle closet to hardcore. I strongly recommend watching Kevin Jordan, one od the origianl Vanilla Designers. https://www.twitch.tv/kevinjordan/videos 
---
Another two great videos from one of the Vanilla Leads. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/435331774
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/432126733
---
Definitely real life stuff comes up.  But there's also just massive burnout when you dedicate that much.
---
Also lots of people quit at Naxx when TBC was announced.  Even if he didn't play TBC it felt somewhat pointless to really nolife Naxx.
---
Very few pushed it not JUST because it was hard but because a lot of people went casual at this point, took time off, or just quit altogether.
---
Just started noticing that the FOV settings seem to be off from how it was in vanilla, some people say it may be the aspect ratio and other variables but I'm not sure. I believe the original vanilla FOV was set at around 50, classic seems to be around 60-65? Not sure if there are any options available in the settings to change the FOV. With a higher FOV you will start see the world have a more fish eye lens effect, player movement will display faster / slower depending on the setting, and objects might appear to be smaller in the distance.

---
I can't imagine it will, 20 levels in classic like 20+ hours.
---
Fyi your math is wrong
---
It’s 6c/xp which is 60 silver per 1,000 experience. Quests in the 50-60 range give 5-15,000 experience. Some quests will give you close to 10 extra gold completing them at 60 vs prior. 
---
Grey quests will be complete waste though, so don’t save quests that are too low!
---
There is a bug megathread people COULD use. The fact is no one checks the main page and tunnel visions to create a new post.
---
Same type of players who would stand in void zones during KT.
---
Better class balance and better raids.
---
Personally I want TBC so that they will eventually make Wrath.
---
Wow... almost the exact opposite thing for me. Saved my dkp for chromaggus claw and raid leaders friend wanted it but I got it due to having more dkp. He left and I think he has always held it against me for taking it. I also was using azure song mageblade at the time.
---
Hello Hello!
---
I'm a West Coast player in search of a late night raiding guild (preferably start times 8:30 -9:30ish). I'd love to be the Shadow Weaving Priest for Phases 1 and 2, and spriest for Phase 3+. I know that's a long shot, so willing to play mage. Rank 10 Spriest in Vanilla, did some raiding on Pservers. Thanks.
---
As a career Herbalist, I got a kick out of this. Nicely done lol
---
oof, I see why your post didnt go well.
---
Yep, you’re right. Makes the tale a little more heavy then given they likely lived together prior to.
---
definitely just added this as my Work Rig's background.
---
I'm putting money on "yes". There are no EU or Asia servers yet either, so I wouldn't read too much into the current status.  
---
They already have servers located over there, so it's simply a matter of making a couple of them Classic™
---
Classic+. Kara Crypts please
---
I was in a guild of all Paladins, and we raided with an organization called Leftovers. Leftovers was the best raiding and leadership experience I've ever had. Leftovers had a problem though, it was split into different class cultures, and hybrid tended to be viewed unfavorably.
---
One evening, as we had started the Public Group's first excursion into BWL (we had a mixture of open and closed groups, and our open "public" group had started to go into BWL) we started to get increased chatter from the Leftovers general chat, which then went dead silent. We didn't think much about it, as we were all too busy wiping on Razorgore and getting frustrated (he was dead by the end of the night and we got to practice our suppression room tactics).
---
After the raid the leadership all huddled up and discussed what had gone done. Apparently one of the closed groups was having their own hard time against Razorgore. They were using a strat that heavily relied on the Paladins to heal sections of the room and a runner who spent most of their time running from one section to another gathering up adds for Razorgore to burn down. The Main healers were assigned to keep the orb group alive and heal the runner as they'd be taking big chunks of damage. The strat wasn't ideal, but it was workable as the Public group demonstrated.
---
Somewhere around the third wipe apparently the closed group's class leadership were all yelling at and abusing the Paladin lead and his group. After the 6th wipe and the entire raid now joining in on the jeers the Lead had enough. He summoned his fellow Paladins, put them in their positions for the fight, and as soon as the orb was used, they all bubble hearthed and dropped raid.
---
To my great shame I've forgotten that Paladin's name, but his act put him on a temporary suspension (because it did waste the remaining scheduled raid time) and made the organization re-evaluate how they were treating people. As a leader myself he was a hero and encouraged me to look out for the people who signed up with me and make sure they were being treated fairly and that they treated others in the raid fairly as well.
---
Thanks for the laugh :D
---
Yeah, I'm pretty ambivalent about flight tbh, even though i HATE wpvp. It sorta makes the world a blur when you can just hop over anything to get to a mine, or whatever, and I'm not sure I like that. 
---
I'll defiantly concede that the instances in TBC are linear, but I think they are pretty huge. Just not BRD / LBRS huge. Certainly as big as Strath
---
What? You're not seriously nit picking certain threads where a few users may or may not have overracted and claims that they represent any form of "majority", surely?
---
You know there are 144k people on this subreddit, right? You're clearly choosing to see only a certain group. There's plenty of love for Blizzard here and this very thread here is proof of that.
---
The moment you say i agree with dkp if there are exceptions, you lose me. If a hunter is retarded enough to bid exorbitant amount of dkp on thunderfury because he can then gz to the hunter with one binding, and no future raiding possibilities. The trick isnt to add oversight to bidding but to outright not bring people that stupid that they have enough dkp for that sort of nonsense. There are ways to make dkp work without loot council oversight or LC for some items and it comes from the structure of the system from the ground up. If done correctly that scenario would never be able to happen.
---
I'm sure some servers will have "mafias" who try to control the market but it won't be every server and nearly as brutal as it was on the private servers.
---
Exaggerate much? Nobody ever waited in 2 hour ques unless your server was complete trash in population and prolly PvE too. 
---
The "extreme minority" as you say is what got us classic. I'd guess to say I am part of the majority who also want classic AV and  classic wow which did not involve cross realm until the last parts of the game
---
WotLK was really the first time the player ever felt able to influence the world around him/her. That was an awesome feeling.
---
LFD was fine until they made it a daily and gave it cross-realm at the end of the expansion.
---
Dual Spec was great when it cost 1000g.
---
Yeah, WotLK was WoW's best time (as the numbers show).
---
I keep trying discord and hating it every time. I dont want 12 voice servers thx.
---
There will be one for guild. One for faction. One for my friends. One for my other group of friends. One for AH collusion to push high prices etc. etc. etc.
---
Honestly, discord is going to ensure that classic is absolutely nothing like vanilla.
---
The uploader was likely using a private 1.12 client
---
I like this man, will you lose some fights because you didn’t roll Orc/Tauren, sure. But it’s not going to be EVERY fight or even every other for that matter. Enjoy your Troll man. :)
---
Affliciton? That's a weird way to spell Soul Link. Is this an EU pronunciation?
---
It's Stormx. Based on what I know about the guy, I believe he's constantly abusing this in order to draw attention to it. So far it's working. This is the third time I've seen someone post a clip or screenshot complaining about it.  
---
With enough buzz, Blizzard will have to address it.
---
TBC was the last bit of WoW that was hardcore and you worked for everything.... nothing was handed to you on a silver platter and it did go a long way to balancing the classes.
---
TBC was pretty fucking epic!
---
Thanks for pointing that out - I went off the values in a database that had automatically converted the extra gold rather than count them myself. I’ll have to check which is correct - the 6c per 1xp or the values in the database.
---
This one hurts me a lot
---
Umm no. The game is going to be fucking phenomenal. All the whiny bitches won’t be making it to 60 anyways because they lack the patience. Most will fall off, which is good.
---
1. Developers constantly releasing half-ass games that are incomplete an labeling it "early access" to rake in dollars before the mob finds out the truth and comes storming with their keyboard samuraiing 
---
2. Parents of millennials teaching their perfect children they deserve everything, whenever they feel like deserving it.
---
Classic is finally going to filter the shit kids back to retail after realizing they cant farm LFG from 1-110 in 5 days of play time ezmode. I think of lot of us have been waiting for this to be released for this very reason.
---
If you’re a mage your BiS chest until AQ40 is a bop tailoring recipe from Blackrock Spire. You level with tailoring (or run 2 gathering profs and drop one of them for tailoring at 60) and then drop tailoring after making it for yourself and get another useful profession (if you want the robe of course)
---
Fair. I’m not sure how much more gear the oomkin would need to have to bring it, but I imagine it’s several raid tiers above. The patch and raid also matters. But if it’s a guild that’s halfway decent they’ll have some good bench dpsers of any class that would be better than Druid. 
---
I’d still just bring the mage either way so the guild can start getting a mage geared and make the Druid reroll a real healing class like priest or pally.
---
I came here to say this.  You're never going to kill anyone as a paladin unless you're INCREDIBLY geared and ret spec, but you can literally live through just about anything short of a 10 man raid heading your way.  Then... even if they do manage to get you down to 1% health, you can lay on hands... and if they do it again, you can just bubble hearth away.  I loved making people waste their time that way.  It was always fun to see how long I could keep myself alive with 5+ people targeting me.  When I managed to get full tier 2, most people would give up on trying to kill me long before I needed to bubble hearth away.
---
Oh man, the complaints from back when a class got an overhaul probably haven’t even gone stale
---
Roller skating while stealth-sprinting is back, baby!
---
It's been wanted, however it never happened. Probably makes people want it even more. Netherwing was quite good but overshadowed by the imminent release of Blizzard Classic. Have you been around the private WoW scene for very long? How do you not know this?
---
Man, everyone was so bad back then. lmao
---
F to all the ret paladins out here
---
Are we sure about that? During WoD there was a toy that turned you into an old model pirate and it was using old animations, also noggenfogger skeleton uses undead animations, I think animations are not set in stone and can be also swapped.
---
Good point
---
C -Feral, wat, you high?

I’ve had two double gins. I want to rage, damn it

---
Don't think anything will happen in the beta. I could see blizz applying some fix later in the beta to prevent people to get out of the intended bounds for wsg but maybe they don't care and just leave it be.
---
It getting abused will make it more likely that they'll do something about it though.
---
Instead of overcomplicating every macro with a long string of /cancelaura for every form, you should have just used /cancelform that does the exact same thing in one word.
---
They spell Surv as MM apparently, very interesting.

I just had a flashback. Watch out for the elite ghosts it spawns.
---
Exactly - which is why out best bet will be to partition for Classic+. New content using mostly recycled assets. People can claim it is lazy all they want - but how many goddamn different colors of trolls did we have to fight in classic? It is possible to make the most out of existing assets (cutting down on design costs) and still make content worth playing.
---
Somebody got all snarky with me last time I said it: but if we could elevate people like OP and maybe get the design team's attention once Classic launches it'll make this more likely to come to fruition down the line.

---
I see a lot of really good arguments in the thread you linked, seems redundant to move that conversation here
---
War and Peace right here.
---
Elemental shaman can do their combo in about .5-1 less sec with berserking active, so it can matter for sure. 
---
ELemental shaman = lightning bolt, chain lightning, earth shock.  Takes 3.5 sec normally.  With berserking it gets down to 3, and you're less likely to get pushback
---
If you were not supposed to those things, then the game should not offer you abilities and skill trees made made specifically for those parts or describe the class as capable of it, then it would be better overall for the RPG sense that its not described and only stumbled upon by curious people, not the game suggesting to you its doable just to pull a rug out from under you.
---
I loved playing a buffer in other MMO's. My fav was Shaman or Skald in DAoC.
---
Lmfao the majority don't want the old AV, sorry bud. Not even close. And an even BIGGER majority want cross realm BGs.
---
&gt;What did I miss? Instead of downvoting this, tell me why this is more than just nostalgia? 
---
People made and continue to make this argument against Classic (vanilla). Some people like different things. Enough people liked vanilla where they made Classic. TBC is one of the most popular and beloved expansions; its not a surprise that some people want this in the future.
---
As someone has previously told me... "Sounds hot on the phone? Add 10 stone!"
---
How about you let people live their own life. Bar doesn't = social life
---
its better than ret
---
A animation bug, something that essentially has no impact on the game.
---
It may or may not be that person, I won't comment. I made this post to add to that buzz, as I believe it's worth discussing. What do you think? Should they fix it, or leave it in? I can see arguments both ways, but I lean towards fix. It's frustrating for both teams when matches go on much longer than they should.
---
I like this behavior.  Gives me a better chance of winning the fight.
---
Like a pvp Growl effect.

---
&gt; nothing was handed to you on a silver platter
---
Don't get me wrong, I loved TBC to death, but the ability to get most of the arena gear just by getting in your 10 games / week was pretty silly.  Not to mention when they later made previous season arena gear purchasable with honor.  You could be decked out in full epic PvP gear just for participating casually in BGs, even if you sucked at PvP.
---
By that logic my toon should be a fat dude instead of a female gnome, I am what I am.
---
I feel so bad for the new players who won't get to experience "loot lag". We also need frequent world server crashes for me to really get that classic feel.
---
They could probably do it with some work. They honestly only didn't let the old models have the old animations so they wouldn't have to make new "old animations" for animations they'd add in the future.
---
What are you talking about? Not sure you read what I wrote. I literally said having empty zones felt terrible.
---
&gt; The other classes either can't out threat a good tank 
---
Most tanks are garbage. The kind of player who has to ask about what addons to use won't be raiding in a guild with a dual-wield fury tank. And with the increased parry rate on bosses it means treat will be even lower on tanks. KTM is absolutely mandatory.
---
People make this exact argument against vanilla as well, I think you have some decent points to make against TBC, but using nostalgia is terrible foundation to build your arguments from.
---
"it's good that you were arbitrarily restricted, because in the future you won't be"
---
okay
---
Brack Rotus 🇨🇳
---
Actually shadow might just be.
---
The trolls in Hinterlands can be made into a dungeon or a raid /shrug.
---
Is that what Nineteen use to run?
---
In beta the 6c/xp is what is being used for both the level 30 and the level 40 cap so far. (Hundreds of gold + mount easily acquired) Quests that are less than yellow (green, greener, grey) use the same ratio but will have diminished gold gains due to the experience being reduced
---
&gt; A reason to desire to skillup.
---
...getting full, normal herbs instead of petals/stems is your reason to desire to skill up, in retail gathering.
---
Says the guy that's made 999 comments on 100 subreddits. But no, you're using Discord wrong.
---
1. Guild Discord
---
2. Realm Discord - Your Faction
---
3. Realm Discord - Enemy Faction (optional)
---
Everything else uses the Friend system and simple chats/calls.
---
You should really separate Arms and Healer-less Arms
---
It's 2019, man. These 2004 security issues are not really a thing any more.  
---
It'll be fine.
---
Thought experiments like this make me wish you could freeze exp, would be great fun to have a guild of low level characters at various exp points which would go out in the world and raid rare mobs etc. I know gear options are few early on but it'd be neat no e the less.
---
You could move into trying to see how to incorporate the rest of the places that exist in lore and got added in later expansions. Like a vanilla northrend or Zandalar
---
It seems like it'd be a pretty easy fix. Four or five invisible walls in certain places and it wouldn't be an issue. Did they ever change this on live? Haven't played for a while.
---
Shit you're right should of made another phasing/sharing post
---
The thing is... classic is a MMORPG. Retail is a live service. I cant even call retail a game any more. The bad thing about classic it could, eventualy, end. Retail is forever (seriously, this game will live dozens and dozens of years, I can see it up in 2040 easely) and much more profitable because it is endless stream of content people willing to pay for. But classic is more about quality, when retail sacrificed almost everything to be infinitely playable. So, sadly, retail is a dead end in terms of quality. It got established consumers who are hooked by a lot of things and they need to be fed constantly to satisfy their appetites. 
---
As much as I love WoW, classic is the only way for this game to grow. Retail is doomed to be in an infinite loop of "meh" content for years to come. It will be less popular, but it will always have solid amount of hooked people.
---
So, perhaps classic will have something after all is done. Perhaps blizz will allow modding of classic, to see where community will take it, or try to add new content in some non conventional way. We'll see. Noone believed blizz will make vanila servers, and here it is. Perhaps not all is lost for WoW.
---
I think a retard with brain damage can come up with a better designed BG than vanilla AV. As you said, the only way to get rewards is winning lots of games, regardless of the time they take they reward about as much rep. It's a horrible BG.
---
If you spec 30/21/0 you can work on an AOE set and do pretty crazy stuff while still raid healing
---
Shield- Crest of Retribution (or Skullflame shield, or the engineering AOE damage shield if you're on a budget)
---
Thorium shield spike
---
Essence of pure flame (Rag trinket, 13 damage returned, not very sought after)
---
Nagelring from BRD, 3 damage returned
---
Razor Gauntlets, DME drop, 2 damage returned
---
With any/all of those, you can easily solo huge amounts of undead with holy wrath/exorcism, bubble, consecrate, etc.  And you can still heal raids fine without holy shock, plus you have blessing of Sanc which is a nice raid buff. 
---
If you want to go full on AOE-adin, 20/31/0 gets holy shield which will do a lot more damage.  You can still raid heal but definitely not as well, missing out on 5% holy spell crit + divine favor as well as a few filler talents.  But if your gear is good you can still do fine raid healing as that spec.  Plus you get reck bombs for PVP lols
---
Someone need to animate this and add it to wallpaper engine.
---
HUNTER GEAR
---
I need that for my arcane shots!
---
Is it just me or does classic look better than vanilla private servers? It seems like using the newer engine has made the color and the textures look better somehow... Maybe it's my imagination but that's the one change I'm okay with
---
Move PvE spec you got there.
---
Pac healer;shaman,skald,bard,minstrel ! Does were the days :)
---
Not exactly. It works when you want to shapeshift from form to form, but for example:
---
/cancelform
---
/cast [nostance]  Bear Form
---
/stopcasting
---
/cast Bear Form
---
You will not be able to leave bear form by pressing the same keybind.
---
It is largely because they do not remember it well.
---
Because its essentially cheating, idk how anyone could disagree. But its cheating that blizzard gets paid form thats the difference
---
Feral are the de facto flag carriers, no one is better. They should be higher on the list if only for that fact.
---
Is recruit a friend going to be available for classic?
---
Oh I know, 308 isn’t what changes the hit. I mean the 3 skill does but 305 is where only 6% is needed on hit.
---
Price Vendor.
---
its the only one I would advice everyone to get.
---
Yeah, that's what I heard as well, but I remain dubious because I haven't seen the primary source yet (granted, I haven't bothered looking either).
---
From a software engineering perspective it's also a little weird, because checking spell procs shouldn't be a fundamentally computationally expensive problem. Though MMOs are complicated and little things add up, so it's still possible.
---
Respect. I think a Druid thrown in (obviously preferably resto, but feral OT is still good) is nice for brez and MOW. But yeah I agree, and if I had to choose one class to not bring to a raid it’d defo be Druid; although giving someone the leather spirit gear is pretty handy
---
This just hit frontpage.

Fucking read it.

Play to finish as fast as possible, anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong.
---
Thay is literally one of the biggest arguments people used against classic servers.
---
Or do you not remember 'you think you do but you dont?
---
Well said.. blizzard know what we want and they usually deliver minus a couple shit expansions etc. I cant imagine how many man hours goes into a game like wow and in my uneducated opinion I doubt most of the naysayers do either. I've got faith blizz will pull it off.
---
Here ya go
---
I feel like I’m not sure what the context for this chart is. 1v1s? AB?WSG? Etc. definitely changes the rankings imo
---
These are great! Unfortunately most of my screenshots were on my Xfird account. Rest in peace...
---
Don't do this on live, you will get banned.
---
The mentality of not wanting to waste hours on a bad tank? There is a difference between bad tanks and new tanks too. I've spent a lot of time with tanks learning and am willing to have a repair bill for that, but not on bad tanks that think they know what they are doing and insist others at wrong. There is a difference. Good tanks and healers will always be in demand, bad tanks and healers can either learn and take advice or just go dps instead.
---
What's Clique?
---
Multiboxers didnt exist prior to legion?
---
I was on Greymane!  I remember most drama came from that human warrior, name started with a K, who ran a raiding guild, think it was Phoenix, and I just remember hearing he was a massive dick.  Apparently he would scream at people and then there was drama with his girlfriend who was a priest.
---
Here we go again...
---
Blood of douchbags... well douchbags in death at least
---
Did Blizzard just release a new patch fixing a bunch of issues? Im not in the beta :(
---
Basically what ended up happening is the 25 man core group got spit into two 10 man groups and 5 people were left out. The groups were also very unbalanced and one did much better than the other.
---
Been there! In our case the guild leader tried to retroactively "balance it out" by moving two of our ringers from A into the B group to try to bring up their progress. Which of course sucked for them, as they felt singled out and punished, while the A group felt annoyed at having to carry two "dead-weights" from B.

I'd assume they have fixed it at some point. I can't remember when I've last seen someone up there in retail. But I haven't played that in years either.
---
I played an mmo called Ragnarok Online(iRO) before wow came along, Bards would play songs which gave buffs, Priests could increase agility, blessing, shields etc...amazing game. There is still decent populated private servers going today, the official ones are dogshit full of bots and not available in the EU.
---
Again, that exact sentence is the argument people make against vanilla content. Its a terrible foundation for your argument, you have good points, but this one is just terrible.
---
That actually makes a lot of sense, tons of new spells are added to game so it would be resources wasted on two sets of animations. Although they have necessary animations for vanilla spells in new models they would probably not bother as bfa people would want old models. (if bfa would still have a player base that is)
---
Can't we all band together and move on to bitching about not having a release date for TBC classic?
---
Luckily im a math teacher, not an english teacher.
---
Also, its my second language - we can try communicating in swedish if you want to :)
---
The hybrid nature is really only apparent in 5 mans or very casual raiding/pvp. If you are trying to be competitive you are going to be healing in raids and healing/flag runner in wsg.
---
It sounds like you haven't done much research into the implementation of layering or are unaware of the alternatives. It's not forever and the game would be unplayable without it.
---
Is this all confirmed true? If so, props to Blizzard.
---
That's refreshing and gives me even more hope for an absolutely amazing experience come August 27th and onward.
---
Yo what the fuck we wont chill the game is 15 years old it should be fucking ready already.
---
Your characters were mauled leveling up? Heh all my tanks I leveled I never once got close to dying in open world and this was pulling multiples all the time.
---
Arthas was a good paladin far from the best though
---
Its fine, just good luck getting into a raid.
---
Its true that a multiboxer will level 1 character slower than a person, but you are leveling 5. It still takes less time to level 5 characters while multiboxing than 5 characters while not. Would you disagree? And the whole little safer for world pvp is in itself an advantage.
---
More like your idea that people won't play a game if people aren't streaming it.
---
What a joke.
---
I think the idea though is each layer will have as much as the old servers. This is a temporary way to prevent the mobs getting swamped and people being unable to level.
---
My concerns with it are the exploits and the weirdness of not seeing people you play with when in one group when in another, limiting the immersive socialising i.e seeing people at various points of the levelling experience because you're grouped with different people and in different layers. 
---
But it's been done to death we've all just accepted its happening and we'll.have a blast anyway.
---
I don't like it either, but it's a temporary solution for a temporary problem.
---
If you have a better plan for how to handle servers with 10k+ populations I think we are all ears.  Please keep in mind that limiting servers to 3k and merging them later is just an even worse and more community and immersion-breaking solution than layering for 1 to 3-ish months.
---
Your comment is the equivalent of going to a thread discussing the shape of the earth and complaining about an abundance of "round" responses.
---
I don't trust them when they say it's only going to last for a few weeks. There's no way the population is going to drop significantly in that period to warrant them removing layering.
---
Agreed, wording could definitely be better, it sounds like he's saying that you want/need 308 for 6% hitcap.
---
&gt; The new models are tied to the new animations. 
---
Not necessarily. That happened in Legion, where they implemented the cape staying down if you have a weapon sheathed in your back and the new combat animations. They replaced the old models' skeletons with the new ones, breaking most of their animations.
---
During the entirety of WoD you could switch to the old models and not see a single updated animation or broken mesh. There's a reason why you can't toggle the old ones anymore, they broke them.  
---
tl;dr: WoD models are fine to use as long as you don't bring Legion's model skeletons and their animations.
---
Yes, it is still needed. I’d say from what we’ve heard it is unlikely there will be another wave of invites.
---
I don't think that would work in a game like WoW which relies so much on solo play and a tight trinity.
---
Much fewer, and those who did were likely professional gold farmers
---
What issues did they fix? Just want a few examples... Im not in the beta :(
---
if blizzard doesn't think there will be enough germans/french/brits playing to give them separate servers, my gut feeling is that there will be one OCE server, probably PvE.
---
Tier list for what exactly? Vanilla PvP comes in many form. Tier list is gonna be different for duel, wpvp, pug Bags, premade BG, type of BG, and lastly the rare organized 5v5 world pvp group which was the prequel to tbc arena.  Personnaly I would base my tier list around organized wpvp. But nothing above 5man.
---
Considering the previous bans associated with this activity, I see this as an exploit. Blizzard has clearly stated they don't want bugs and exploits to travel into the new era, it should be fixed.
---
In my guild in vanilla we operated a dkp system with anon bidding for 40 man an always rolled ZG an AQ. We used an officer council to ensure that those that bid for items were doing so on merit an not just cuz they wanted something. With 65 active raiders in my guild you had to get gear and get better or get replaced. It wasn't perfect but we never had any complaints or disagreements
---
horde paladins, bro. 
---
and Kara.
---
they haven't done anything major on layering yet, the thread yesterday was simply someone noticed 30 ppl in org and jumped to a huge assumption
---
Now how do I get this on my wall?
---
It's not a population drop that's necessary, just a lack of congestion in starting areas
---
&gt;  limiting the immersive socialising i.e seeing people at various points of the levelling experience because you're grouped with different people and in different layers
---
This is kinda bullshit, because there are loads of zones you can go to, so it's not like you ever only saw the same group of people as you leveled anyway.  I mean you take a week off for vacation, come back and no one around your level is the same group you were with.
---
as a priest, i regularly found myself in easy recruitment to most of the guilds on the server. (smaller server)
---
one guild i joined had "class officers+guild officer" (instead of \~3/4 officers: melee+ranged+healer+maybe tanking.) They distributed loot via Master Loot with votes among all 9 of them. - This was a lot of power spread among a lot of people and caused a lot of loot drama on the regular. - eventually the officers chose to give me a progression drop over the vote of the priest officer (who probably wanted it for themselves). Next week, the priest officer kicked me from AQ40. (we were still progressing on the first boss, the g kick happened during trash pulls) - a couple of the officers whispered me saying they didn't agree with the ~~power trip~~ decision to kick me. (maybe a few weeks later, the guild broke apart)  
---
however, basically hours later i was kicked from that guild, i was invited into the top guild on the server because my naxx attunement was done. They had twin emps on farm, and most of each naxx wing on a rough farm. - not particularly juicy, but The Guild Leader Paladin and the Warrior Maintank server transfered, to raid to Death and Taxes. also, killing the guild.  
---
At this point there was almost no alliance guilds left in naxx, killing off a lot of the morale on the server, as other guilds slowly died away from burnout, either quitting to wait for BC or server transferring.
---
You're not a very good troll.
---
right? this has been one of the most positive wow-related places in a long time, and people choose to only see the small % of negative posts
---
Still haven’t fixed hunter feign death... and nobody says a word about it
---
&gt; I already see a lot of really good counter-arguments
---
Well, let's break them down again, because redundancy is good!
---
* In vanilla, this would actually be pay2win
---
Yep, pretty much. I fully acknowledge that it would be universally negative for the game. I wish it didn't have to be like this, but the game was designed before we knew any of the problems a world-popular MMO would bring.
---
* gold sellers didn't stop. They changed focus, forced cut prices to stay competitive, but had to compensate for their prices being cut.
---
This argument is letting the perfect be the enemy of the good; by all measures, gold farming is over as an industry—except in the weakest, most *automated* sort of quick-buck victim-fishing.
---
* Just because it can be hard to combat does not mean we should legitimize it.
---
The argument over *how* to effectively combat this is over. [I provide some reading materials regarding how we reached this conclusion here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2du2w/my_fear_about_the_upcoming_classic/erjgl4y/) The only ironclad solution to a blackmarket is to offer a safe, legitimate source of RMT.
---
* &gt; More awareness surrounding the risks of being scammed, and stronger push for 2FA to prevent account theft may do just as much, without impacting the game.
---
If this worked, it would have worked over the ten years that Blizzard fought with messaging and awareness campaigns.
---
* Where do you draw the line? Retail has purchasable level boosts. Goldsellers didn't and don't just sell gold, they also sell level services.
---
This is true. But economics doesn't lie. Legalizing and regulating is always better (for actual human lives) than letting a virtual black market run wild.
---
* Now that there's a sanctioned means of buying gold, however, **that deterrent is gone.** At best, you can argue that the deterrent was ineffective; however, that still doesn't actually advance your case.
---
Once again: Gold buying is *not illegal* and RMT doesn't put customers at risk. Credit card fraud, identity theft, and hacking are potentially life-ruining. We didn't know the extent of the problem back in 2004 when the game was initially designed (or else it would behoove the devs to implement it) but now we do.
---
I’d agree with this. The argument that “you could do this in Vanilla so you should be able to do it in Classic” has some merit, but not much.
---
Yeah not like I can hit 60 after a long grind and be like nah let me re roll to other faction real quick,  once I decided I'm going to be stuck for a long time lol
---
I’ll be absolutely thrilled if it works a lot better on release than what I experienced with the stress tests and seen from others on the beta. I hope my fears turn out to have been unwarranted. 
---
I’m going to have a blast either way. And I hope that if there are stains from the layering that they fade into the river of time quickly.
---
Thats a minus 50 DKP
---
Ugh that guy wannabe in SW during Classic :-) yes they will be there
---
Keeping my fingers crossed then!
---
Essentially this.
---
It had the best gameplay. 
---
&gt;Dungeons that split into 4 wings,
---
Because DM and SM were so bad? I think thats a good thing that they're effectively using the resources/tilesets to make a quantity of content. 
---
&gt;Earn raid gear that is mostly useless in PvP. 
---
Raid gear wasn't useless in PVP. You balanced survivability with damage output. 
---
&gt;Daily quests on a single island that replace farming in the world zones.
---
The Isle was absolutely amazing. Incredible dense world pvp which is exactly what the game needed in a continent of flying mounts.
---
&gt; All the meta comps are known.
---
???? Thats not a criticism when we're comparing it to Vanilla which had no arena comps.
---
&gt;They eviscerated the WC3 story, turning the main characters into whiney loot pinatas.
---
That can't be helped now.
---
I prefer to stay plain old poopy.
---
Yes blizzard could do just that but some animations look pretty awful then. I don't think it would be up to blizzards "standards" to just hack them in like that. But if enough people yell about it there is a chance.
---
Ok. Thanks for the BFA blog in this Classic subreddit.
---
I really wouldn’t hope for it. Beta seems to be for smaller, consistent bugs. Stress testing is giving them the data they need for leveling and server prep.
---
Well I raided and only did arena for the season 2 weapon I think it was? The two-handed axe?
---
I played a hunter so it was pretty painful, the line of sight/pillar hugging and deadzone.... I just did not enjoy it but I did it because the weapon was so strong and easy to get as you so well put it.

Shh let him and 300 other night elfs fight over some grell
---
Why would I keep that in mind? That is a significantly better solution, *especially* for the health of the community. If if takes 2 months before the merge, at least the first 2 months will encourage a proper community to form. Either way, the servers/layers are going to merged. I'd rather have a community from day one instead of two months down the road. It's *less* community and immersion-breaking than layering *by far*.
---
Couldnt you say the same thing as the debuff limit?
---
Yeah we became a guild in October '05, cleared BWL shortly after that. Once it was cleared we did cascade the instance for a month to catch up and possibly pass other guilds in gear. We did not do it for months on end as it they fixed the bug in the AQ40 gathering quest patch. It was mostly in December when it was done when we were all off school and had time during the week.
---
Checkout preache's drama time on youtube. Weekly show about this type of stuff.
---
&gt; No it didn't, it worked horribly. 
---
Yes it did, it worked as advertised. Legion on the other hand...
---
From S tier down to C tier.
---
I think your claims are a little far fetched there. Or do you have a design for a better BG?
---
Not saying AV is perfect, just saying being a game designer is harder than you think and based on your opinion here you would never be able to be one.
---
That could take six months. Layering in starting zones isn't the issue, it's that it affects the entire server. There's going to be layering in level 59 zones.
---
Challenging shout / Mocking blow on the pet to break yourselves from their freezing trap works great too
---
It's literally hundreds of people telling OP that he's wrong for thinking maybe we don't need to freak the fuck out over a few bugs. I'm quick to soapbox? You're telling someone else to fuck off because a game developer isn't listening to you. The amount of whiny brats Classic has brought out of the woodwork is insane. I kinda hope they just don't deal with any of it just to watch you all lose your minds even further. Hopefully it dissuades you from playing so we don't have to listen to you in-game, and the sane folks can just raid together. Fucking lunatics, the lot of you.
---
&gt;WoW scene for very long? How do you not know this?
---
Know what exactly? That people want a tbc server? I keep saying they say they so, but then the numbers don't reflect it.
---
Every BC server that comes out is either mediocre or a huge flop. They never reach the populations we see in vanilla or wrath servers.
---
unsurelarrydavid.gif
---
No because the bosses were tuned for that / debuff limit isn't a network thing
---
Dungeons as a dps is 90% of fights of 3-5 mobs where each one dies in about 6-12 seconds. A spriest basically has 3 damage spells, SW:P, MB and MF. SWP is bad in this situation because it won't tick for long enough, MF is in general a weak spell and MB causes extra agro and has a cd anyway. VE is nice utility but causes huge aggro in the rare situation where it's useful.  
---
By contrast ele has LB which is a great fast spammable nuke and CL which is the only real cleave damage spell in the game. Then you have totems for great group utility and aoe/kiting options.

I'm done with this discussion, downvote away and continue to be blind to the obvious negativity on this sub.

Are they accepting applications?

Why would we want right click report removed? Wtf?
---
Ah, the Trump approach.
---
&gt;Its statisticallyaverage time to 60 was around 10 days played on the nost stats.
---
1. Nostalrius was using the TBC exp values. With the fixed values, that would have increased the average to at least 12 days. It's a difference of about 20% I believe, but when you increase leveling time you also increase the chance of players getting bored with grinding and supplementing activities like tradeskills, BGs, etc.
---
2. The average Classic WoW player is going to be much more casual than the average private server player, which will also inflate average level times.
---
&gt;Now i feel like you are the kind of person to throw shade on a private servers.
---
I have no idea how you came to this conclusion since I didn't mention private servers, but you couldn't be further from the truth. Nostalrius was my introduction to vanilla WoW. I'm just being realistic so people have appropriate expectations.
---
That's not at all the point and you know it
---
Ok but where are the healers? A tier list based on groups should have team comps. Like obviously a spriest is good at dueling, but they're not S tier in groups cause they oom too fast. Personnaly i feel like lock/war/hpal would be the SS tier core
---
No but the limit was only there because of technical limitations which do not exist anymore
---
jävla CP-svenne
---
I'm level 31 on the beta at 2 days played I'm a warlock and I've done all of my demon quests a fair bit of dungeons and quite a bit of AFK here and there
---
How? Just stay on the edge of the leeway range while moving and do everything else exactly the same.
---
Karazhan was the one thing i really liked about tbc. The rest was just meh. Flyging killed the world. The zones (except for nagrand) were ugly and poorly designed, the fucking space stuff felt misplaced. Shattarath or whatever it is called was a stupid idea. I liked WOTLK far better (I guess by then I had accepted flyging). The zones were much nicer. Too bad it turned to shit during the expantion as they introduced lfg, and zoning and stuff. By the end of wotlk, wow had basically become a single player game except for raiding.
---
Leeway was so melee could hit people because of latency. In 2019 that latency does not exist
---
&gt; It's 2019, my dude. These 2004 security issues are not really a thing any more.
---
While the authenticator has done marvels for the game, its hard to pick out how much of an effect it had on improving player safety because it also overlapped heavily with the WoW token's implementation.
---
Umm. The points in that are pretty far off.
---
So what?
---
It also makes the game shitty and unresponsive and immersion-breaking, but yay for the #nochanges PvPers who yelled to get it I guess.
---
&gt; I think Blizz is better equipped now to deal with them and with the ppl who use their services.
---
Yeah, it's called the WoW Token, and unfortunately they're choosing to go the anti-vaxxer route.
---
How we're not in beta and how the cap is 40? Idfk
---
Eycept that even as an fc you only need 11 points in feral so its not even close to being a feral spec
---
Don't level as holy, level as ret and collect an int set through drops or even cheap pieces off the AH(I know people say don't buy anything on the AH, but I don't mind since the lv40 mount is free and you have extra coin). It doesn't matter what armor type either, rock cloth if it has more int than some mail or plate piece. I leveled a pally to 60 as ret, healed every dungeon on the way up and just kept a second set of gear in my bags.
---
thats what makes the most sense to me.
---
"From what we've heard..."
---
What have we heard and link?
---
The beta servers are so dead. Even on the PVP server, I log on and there is just nobody around.  
---
I think they're being foolish to not invite more people.  
---
I was running around Westfall last night and killed 3 rare enemies in a 15 minute window. All of them fairly visible rares (Brack, Slark, undead rare)  
---
There are still plenty of hard-to-notice things that need to be verified (recent bug reports as evidence)  
---
We need more eyes.
---
Hosting with minimal costs is only sensible. There's no reason to run the game on beefy dedicated servers like they used to when 90% of zones 99% of the time have basically no players in them; it's just wasted money. Sharding is a good solution for the modern game because it lets you split those inactive zones onto tiny separate virtual servers, which optimizes your resource usage.
---
In a perfect world sharding like this (each zone runs on its own server) would be the best solution for Classic, too. It's technically possible to make the transition between the zone edges seamless, so that you don't get situations where people visually phase out as they cross between zones (hell, Ultima Online had something like this in 1997), but that requires an architecture designed for that from the ground up which WoW's servers unfortunately are not.
---
They are in Arathi, Hillsbrad doesnt have any of those mobs.
---
Nah mate, you're the first one to practice speed leveling in WoW.
---
It won’t be farming lfg, it’ll be spamming trade chat all day and still leveling purely off dungeons. There wasn’t as much of a rush to hit level cap back in vanilla or even tbc, and lot of people just slow grinded through dungeons til level cap. If anything having a built in quest helper on classic now might change that because questing back then actually took effort and now it will just tell you exactly where to go. You’re not getting an authentic classic experience from this game, you’re gonna get a modernized easy experience with limited content that’s already been seen and everyone knows how to do.
---
What the fuck kind of shield grip is that?!
---
Nothing you've typed here makes sense.  Why would you have more community when your server gets merged into another one, instead of just chatting with the same people in trade or general the whole time?  
---
Suddenly, two huge groups of people arrive on your server because they've merged three servers into one - compared to the entire population being the same the whole time.
---
It's like you don't even think, you just type words.
---
I feel like TBC was 10 steps forwards but 5 steps backwards, and unfortunately those 5 steps are pretty bad.
---
I'd rather Blizzard release some sort of Classic+ as opposed to TBC. Classic might not be as complete, but it has significantly more potential in my opinion.
---
&gt; this is kinda bullshit
---
Cool but it's how I met some lifelong friends. So maybe in how you play but that's not how everyone plays. 
---
I did see the same people. I grouped up lvl 10-20, then later saw someone from then around, and grouped again. Next time I saw them we did a dungeon and joined a guild together. Years of raiding and pvping each expansion later with several different people I met whilst out questing in the world with similar routes and I think that's what I will miss about layering, as if I'm grouped with a friend one day or with a random another I'll be in a new layer and might be right next to that person I met in stv but don't even know it.
---
Does Improved Feign Death help for PvP at all? I thought it only effected NPCs. 
---
Ill be running a similar build, otherwise.
---
There was a druid in one of my guilds along my vanilla journey that bonded with everyone and seemed like a great guy until we downed major domo he proceeded to ninja the chest, left raid and guild. We came to find out that the guy had done this multiple times before on other servers and simply was selling the accounts after ninjaing the cache of the firelord.

Slow and steady wins the race.

*More well designed classes / specs in terms of fun and variety (less homogeneous than vanilla).
---
*All classes / specs have some niche where they're viable.
---
*Well balanced PvP system where every class and even most specs have room to shine.
---
*Introduced some actually interesting PvE encounters.
---
*Resilience was really good for the game, solving the issue of low skill PvE players getting too much of an advantage from their PvE gear, while at the same time shutting down PvP as a way of circumventing normal raid gear progression (resilience eats up too much item budget). It wasn't perfect, as raiders could still bring legendary weapons and some tier 6 to the arena for a significant advantage, but it was a huge improvement over vanilla.
---
It's the expansion that actually fleshed out the gameplay aspect of the game, while retaining every single aspect of vanilla worth keeping.
---
At the risk of sounding retarded, define "Price vendor" I would look it up but I have limited access to the web at work :S
---
They're not suddenly going to be gone.  You can still group with them.  I don't know why you think layering is going to prevent that.

I absolutely love the pre-Onyxia screenshot. I feel like the color variety is one of the absolute best aspects of Vanilla. Just beautiful and I think really adds to the fantasy atmosphere.

They didn't fix it because people were complaining on Reddit.

The only drama I remember is that at one point my guild leader (who was the main tank) and the rogue class leader were openly fighting on vent about who should get the next left binding of the windseeker when it dropped. Both of them had the right piece you see, and now both were arguing about why one should have it over the other.
---
We were raiding BWL and had just defeated Razorgore when the fight began. The plot twist here is that my guild was 90 % Greek (I am Swedish), and these guys were arguing in Greek. I remember sitting there, listening to them screaming at each other at the top of their lungs and not understanding a word. In the warlock chat channel I wrote: "I wish I could understand Greek :(" to which the warlock class leader responded "I wish I could not."
---
AFAIK there isn't an issue with the skeletons current;y  People thought they were disappearing too quickly recently as a bug but it was actually related to all the micro patches blizzard was pushing into the beta causing corpses to disappear on each patch because they don't cache that info.  But it is supposedly fine in general.
---
Obviously not, looking for support on times. I was playing undead warlock

That is not an appealing prospect for most people. Thus why there is a shortage. Saying "They can just do DPS" means, for the most part, they will not get to run dungeons. Even though you need three times as many DPS as tanks there are 10X more people willing to DPS than Tank for this reason. They might top the boards in raids when properly geared but nobody wants an undergeared DPS Warrior for Gnomer. This effect snowballs as they go up in level, continue to miss out on instances and fall further behind in their gear. 
---
It's nice that you are patient with a tank that is learning - most people are not.
---
Old av is the main thing I want in classic.  The matches might have taken forever but I wasn't there to grind honor.  I loved it so much that I remember maxing out on av marks and blowing them on consumables just so they wouldn't go to waste.
---
I dunno, I think genocide is a bit higher on the worst idea ever list.
---
Undead warlock, I've done several 1-5 play though in the past week... Average 33 minutes because of random luck with other players around, this is my first attempt 1-10
---
Not really a useful metric. I could just as well say that during vanilla and tbc the playerbase never stopped growing while it stagnated during all of wotlk (as the numbers show).
---
it simply give you the amount vendor will give you for X item in the field. So you can choose quest reward base on item which will bring more money if you can't use the item.
---
Or will help determine what you can trow out of your bag to make room, as it is pretty common in classic WoW.
---
All this add really fast to rack up money for your skill at low level.
---
Where are the healers? I feel like they have way more impact and some classes are useless/oom after they blow their CD, like spriest for instance.
---
People have done it even faster. The average 1-10 time for people is closer to 5 hours.
---
With just a very small amount of effort and guide, you can easily cut this down to 3 hours.
---
I mean are you seriously listening to yourself? I acknowledge there are two sides, you are the one who blindly refuses to see anything other than negativity.
---
The ironic thing is that all those threads you linked, except for spell batching, each have a thread each on the frontpage now thanking Blizzard for being fixed! And they all have _way_ more comments than the ones you linked.
---
It's really not healthy to live like that, but it's your choice, and you're the one who has to live with those consequences.
---
&gt; Eye of the storm, god no. 
---
What? EOTS is one of the best BGs they ever made.
---
My father just today expressed a desire to try out WoW after 14 years of not being remotely interested. He asked if I could show him around the game, and I feel awful because the current game as it exists is just truly awful. I've insisted to him to wait for Classic, as thats what my wife and I will be playing. I just hope he will wait that long instead of subbing to Retail and deciding he hates it.
---
How does the orc racial blood fury work on classic beta? Does it scale with your strength like it does in private servers?
---
Or randomly killing mobs by yourself.
---

---
High number is not the same as quality. It almost never is. McDonald’s sells the most burgers in the world, but their product is not a quality burger.
---
We did this with Master Loot from MC threw AQ40. The loot master would trap the mob with a loot box, every one would roll, and than if you havent gotten an item, you'd get it. (except tank rolls always win)
---
Man all these awesome guild memories... me, I was a lowly hunter in blues farming up items to sell on ah for an epic mount... it worked though!
---
People have done it faster, I think like 1:30ish is probably a really optimized route and a lucky one.
---
Your time was really good still, unless you're doing it on the newest fresh server.
---
What original thoughts and ideas, that have never been presented in any other threads on this sub. /s  I dont like layering either, but do we need 5+ posts a day saying the same thing about layering?
---
&gt;During retail vanilla I used 5 pieces of tier 1 all the way to killing Thaddius because of the set bonus. Though that was partly because I loved elemental and spent most of my dkp on snagging any +spellpower piece I could get.
---
Uhhh. Tier 1 is a healing set with a healing based 5 piece set bonus. There's no way any Naxx level guild would have brought an Elemental Shaman who happened to be wearing 5 pieces of tier 1.
---
My memory was  that it was the first time you got packs of seven or eight mobs, and if you have any split DPS or split aggro then DPS will die and/or the healer is going to get dogpiled. All the mobs have to be on the tank and the tank has to know how to keep threat on all of them, as well as the DPS having discipline and sticking to the kill target.
---
Amen to that.
---
I almost shat my pants when I first made contact with these. They weren’t even relevant anymore but dumb me clicked on everything. I died, more than once.
---
Hey  there, &lt;Envy&gt; are currently looking for a few more players; we've been potting around on pservers together for the past couple of years. While we're currently full on prot. warriors we're still looking for one more Fury to fill out our roster; along with all healers.
---
Feel free to hit myself or our Raid Leader up on Discord (ancilla#0140 or  probability#1475) or visit our website [https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/](https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/) for some more info.
---
&gt;level 1  
---
&gt;yeah same, make more sense to me, fast ''tip toe'' than ice skating.
---
My only experience is from back in vanilla with a prot warrior MT. There wasn't even a good threat addon until later. It is entirely doable without using one if you know your MT and your class well.
---
Ive been griding the first few levels on busy hours of a private server to see where the bottle necks are. (Undead is definitely the scarlets and rattlecages)
---
Dude thats so dude
---
Oh... for some reason I misread your original post. I thought you said "from what we've heard there WILL be another wave" and I thought I missed a blue post somewhere.
---
Good job on the heat distortion and the ambient dust. Just wish it wasn't so cropped/zoomed :(
---
Agree that it look dumb. Was it like that in vanilla?
---
&gt; I don't want my *character* to be perceived in a way
---
Read this sentence very closely and you'll see why you're response is  a smooth-brain thing to say.
---
TBC seems like it had just the right amount of modern day features while still keeping the vanilla "feeling". Id personally rather have TBC simply because of balancing.
---
They are just the best tanks on horde and i also think mages when it comes to pve
---
I feel like you've missed the point. 
---
Anyway I responded to OPs misconception about layering so we're done here let's not get into this again for either of our sakes. If you want to get what I meant try reading my post over again.
---
It works great with a nice addon where you can assign the value of how much an item is worth.
---
Epgp also usually has a decay of everyone's points per week by some percent so that new members aren't impossibly behind veterans (ahem dkp)..
---
I will often hold onto the rattlecage quest and get 2-3 on the way to other quests and get them every possible time I see one. Normally I cannot find more than 4-5 out of the 10 for the quest. I also suicide after completing the spiders every time while holding the samuel remains.... lets me get back to the graveyard faster and complete that quest right in the graveyard.

I have no strong opinions on class balance or arenas or raid content. The reason I dont really want BC is because I think Dranei look goofy and outland ruined the feel of the world.

That spec isn't seen very much. The current top spec in premades is Intimidation / Scatter shot.

The fresh server has nearly instant respawns. You should probably add about at least an hour to your time.

Go to blizz-art.com and type Thunder Bluff. One of them is my PC wallpaper. Stunning with rivers as far as the eye can reach.
---
It's not though, they lost the original code and are basically porting what they found onto the Legion client. Merging that old code they scavenged and the Legion client certainly made new bugs.
---
World was when the growth stopped and decline began. LFD alone is reason enough to dislike wrath. The raiding was made super casual as well. Wotlk was really when Blizzard committed to accessibility and convenience over RPG and challenge.
---
&gt; I am not wrong. NO ONE said "oh this queue for this game I just bought is long, I better quit". No one quit from queues. Everyone will play the game they bought, and they know that queues only get shorter as time goes on, so it doesn't effect their desire to play the game.
---
You are wrong. You cannot state that as a fact just because you never experienced it.
---
&gt;I just don't understand how much paint everyone has to be huffing to suddenly think FUCKING QUEUES were detrimental to WoW at any point, and not Blizzard shitting on the gameplay and immersion with QoL "improvements" LIKE FUCKING LAYERING.
---
How delusional you have to be to believe queueing is/was not detrimental?
---
They are both detrimental. But 15 years ago WoW was the only one of it's kind so everyone endured the queue because there were no other alternatives. Now we have the option to not go through the same ordeal.
---
Layering is also detrimental however, layering can be limited in it's scope so it can have a much smaller impact.
---
&gt;NO ONE GIVES A SHIT ABOUT QUEUES IN REALITY
---
Again, just becasue you don't give a shit about queues doesn't mean no one does.
---
I work 9 to 5. I gieve a shit about queues. I have a limited time to spend playing wow and I want to spend that time playing wow not fightinng the queue boss.
---
I give a shit about queues because my friends who have a more relaxed schedule may already be in game by the time I get home and I will have to sit in Discord hearing them play and have fun while I'm still at the queue boss.
---
I give a shit about queues because vanilla WoW already has a lot of downtime and I don't have the luxury to add queueing to that.
---
&gt; Either you will play the game because it's good, and sit your ass in the fucking queue
---
Waiting in quque does not equal playing the game.
---
Unstoppable force wont be available in phase 1
---
&gt; Just yesterday, this sub was in a doomsday mood, going "Blizz is never gonna fix this in time omg" and today a bunch of fixes hit the beta. ** This is not an answer to your whiny posts, this is the hard work they're putting in to give us a great experience in WoW Classic.**
---
Facts. I find it bizarre how people try and take credit for thousands of lines of code and dozens of man hours, as if the reddit post they made Monday night triggered the massive update that happened Tuesday.
---
How about no... They have been working on this stuff the whole time. People need to learn to let a beta be a beta.
---
They/Ion really didn't though.
---
What they said/haven't said has been over-emphasised by both 'sides' ('sides' of interpreting it), and really they said very little about what the real plan is.
---
I don't want to accuse you of living under a rock, but it is honestly either misinformed or disingenuous to make out like there's no issue at all.
---
We know the current implementation of layering on the Beta is problematic, and needs some polish and/or modification to the general idea.
---
And in terms of timelines, we need more detail than the slightly handwavey "it'll 100% be gone by phase 2, and maybe perhaps perchance gone within a couple of weeks, but who knows".
---
The point was you thinking that layering is going to prevent you from finding your friends.  That's not the case at all.
---
Wrath is when they homogenized. TBC classes were still unique.
---
ffs random people managed it in pservers a multi million dollar company should be able to flatten a few kinks shouldnt be taking this long they are just saving it to make up for inevitable slump of 8.2
---
MCP is BiS for tank druids too
---
Hey there, &lt;Envy&gt; are currently looking for a few more players;  we've been potting around on pservers together for the past couple of  years. We're only considering Resto Druids I'm afraid.
---
I want this in my life, that and they have to use the Alpha WotLK models.
---
Why’s wrath your favorite? Just curious. I started in Wotlk and left at cataclysm. Was short lived haha
---
“Someone call an ambulance.” 3 mins in LOL
---
Whelp Pet
---
Small Flame Sacs
---
Large Fangs
---
Whelps have low armor and low HP so they die easy to melee.
---
Consider the merge like two groups of friends joining. For the two months before the merge, they can at least form a group unlike with layering. The week or so during the merge will be strange, but at least everyone knows it's going to happen.
---
&gt;compared to the entire population being the same the whole time.
---
But they aren't, because they keep getting layered away.
---
&gt; Who hurt you? 
---
Big Yikers on the ad hominem there, maybe they believe when a woman wants to be a toxic manipulating cheater it's just bad, and everyone can see through the fake bullshit red tape of "they legitimately and honestly broke up"
---
I hope you realize women with black eyes who go back to the abusers "just had to call the police on him" by your standard.
---
&gt; If she isn't in a relationship, she can't cheat. Period. 
---
which is why subterfuge and lies were all over the place, and the fact that the friend didn't know that she slept with probably somewhat of a stranger without informing him of the STD risks involved etc. Things any normal person would want to know.
---
Legolasbeard then
---
Horde has been growing in popularity ever since TBC, back when being an edgy undead was considered cool and blood elves became playable. There was also the whole L70ETC and everyone chanting For the Horde! everywhere all the time that just made people roll horde. Even when most hardcore PvPers rolled human for the racial they went straight back to horde as soon as it got nerfed.  
---
It's not that they have or haven't played vanilla, it's that we have years and years of piled up horde fanboyism that simply wasn't there before the TBC boom. Also LotR was the hottest shit around back then, everyone wanted to replicate that. (No, GoT doesn't compare)
---
Ulduar is the best raid in the game, and ICC is up there to. The story is a massive improvement over classic and BC. It also featured two great zones in Grizzly Hills and Dragonblight.
---
I wouldn't say Wrath was my favorite but it is definitely up there. Plus we don't exactly need Legion servers anytime soon.
---
I can agree with the average being more inherently casual than pserver player. With pserver players having a higher interest want for the game. 
---
However, I do look to rereleased games such as osrs and you see a focus on efficiency. Even from the start people wanted to hit goals they missed previously due to being too young or not knowing. 
---
Now we have thousands of hours of efficiency content to consume before we even play the game and all this was not the case when nost and its reincarnation were booming. 
---
This means alot of people will play as efficiently as the popular guides dictate. 
---
Sorry for the assumption my man. Typically those that have played pservers are usually in the know on stats and stuff being generally more invested in the game.
---
I would love if in a years time blizzard releases some classic stats. Maybe next years blizzcon. 
---
Average and median Time to 60. 
---
Average level 5-60. 
---
Fastest times to 60 per class. 
---
% of 60s with epic mount.
---
DW Dagger Fury is amazing for leveling IMO
---
I didn’t think of that. I don’t know if it’s worth it anymore
---
The art in wrath was good, everything else was not. The gutting of unique class abilities and buffs was a massive step toward casualizing everything. The raiding was so easy it hurt.  The open world was no longer dangerous. Catering to casuals instead of rpg fans became the design goal.
---
spoilers dude: he isn't nice, he's completely selfish and self centred to the point would literally manipulate a woman in a relationship to change herself, not out of kindness, but so he can have a hot gf. it's more than weird, it's creepy as hell
---
what do you think he would do to you if it benefited him? he's shown he doesn't give a toss about anyone but himself through his actions. you can't trust people like that.
---

Holy hell that is aweome

Cause bags are expensive, and gathering bags are cheap.
---
I've got my 1 to 20 in just under 10 hours and my 20 to 40 in just over 30 hours (39 hours 12 minutes total for 1 to 40)
---
Really hoping I can get 20 to 30 in under 10, but I don't really want to try again on the Beta after 4 rogues to 40.
---
On the last Stress Test, I leveled 6 rogues to level 6 in the first 4 hours (43 minute average time) and 3 rogues to 15 (best time was 5 hours and 3 minutes).
---
Unless they raise the level cap on the Beta soon, I'll go over to my guild's Pserver with data tuned from the Beta and practice 40 to 50 and 50 to 60.
---
Gotta keep it under 100 hours total /played.
---
&gt;is an archaic form of corruption.
---
I'm sorry for whatever shit guild you happened to run in.
---
But by week 3 there isnt going to be a mass of hundreds of players in a starting zone. People who cant understand why this is needed for a reasonable launch astound me.
---
I want to see my character as a smooth talking chad but I'm simply a fat asperger dude who invests all his self worth in his avatar and I wanna see my avatar with more pixels instead of two pixels.
---
Id like to play 100% clean. Although the last time I played was during Cata and the UI was pretty great. So I might miss a few things once I get going.
---
Yeah dude I'm just going to say it bluntly you clearly aren't reading my post correctly. I'm just gonna try once more. 
---
In world you play and see person x. 
---
You group with person x. 
---
You play with your friend person y the next day. 
---
Person x is stood right next to you at the same zone as you.
---
But you're in person Y's layer now and can't see person x. 
---
If you could you would obviously say hi person x and quest with them. 
---
This creates missed opportunities to play with person x over and over and make organic friendships. 
---
This is how I met most of my guildies out and about in the world back in the day which you said was kinda bullshit. 
---
If you still don't follow.. let's leave it lol. If your reply is 'no that won't be the case' then yeah you're not following because it is and I've checked. It's not a big issue like exploits just a little detail for me personally in how I like to play.
---
More servers, then if the population really drops by 80% after a few months merge them. I don't think that many people are going to quit though early on. I expect the population to still be growing at six months as word gets out. If that's the case we could be looking at at least a year or two of layering for all levels.
---
How about
---
    /cancelform [nostance:0] /cast [nostance:1] Bear Form
---
Does that not shift you out on a second key press?
---
Everything you've posted here is wrong.
---
&gt; Consider the merge like two groups of friends joining.
---
No, what this is like is you are on a server and suddenly a huge group of strangers that are all friends show up.  Your "community" is now made up of 50% complete strangers.
---
&gt; For the two months before the merge, they can at least form a group unlike with layering.
---
There is nothing in layering that prevents grouping.  Furthermore, if you ever actually watch one of those videos about "exploiting layers" you'll see that what they are actually doing to do it is to ... wait for it ... join a group.  
---
That's right, they join a group with someone in a different layer so that they can play together.
---
&gt; But they aren't, because they keep getting layered away.
---
No they don't, and even if they do, you can still talk to them in any channel, and from your friends list.  They're literally on your server and available to group with and talk to.  There's just a *chance* that you aren't on the same layer so you can't immediately just walk up to them randomly in the world.
---
The whole point of classic is to get it as close to the original as it can be. Which it isn't yet
---
Randos on a Pserver haven't ported old code to a new client, so no. They did not manage to do that.
---
How about you just not play at all?
---
I don’t care for streamers but the community needs less judgmental people like you
---
My body isn’t ready for cities feeling grand and full of life again

Hey   there, &lt;Envy&gt; are currently looking for a few more players;  we've been potting around on pservers together for the past couple of  years. If you're willing to switch faction; feel free to hit myself or our Raid Leader up on Discord (ancilla#0140 or  probability#1475) or visit our website [https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/](https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/) for some more info.
---
I am sure they have other ways like no more free trial accounts so can't really spam. Maybe there is better gold tracking technology on the back end so they can perform better analytics.
---
Why is it bad to tell a woman she can monkey branch up if she disciplines herself and improves? It's shitty that she's in a relationship I agree, but the thought itself is not really anything but honest. What else does a guy say to a girl who he wants to lose weight and date? I'm open to answers
---
Well, they'll eventually reach 60 and presumably still want to have their fun 3 man group runs, so skipping packs is an awesome benefit for them.
---
Yeah, but if McDonald's is selling 12 million burgers a month and Wendy's can't stay open for business longer than a year barely selling 100,000 burgers a month, that means McDonald's is doing something right.
---
You are making this more of an issue than it is.  Your whole problem is "I might not randomly stumble across them in the world. This breaks my game!"
---
So you expect the total server population to exceed 10k in week one and then drop to &lt;3k by week three?
---
I am curious why you think they are invalid. What's subjective about it breaking TOS, for example? Or causing inflation?
---
Beta is for us to give feedback to the devs, not for them to give feedback to us. 
---
They have no responsibility to provide fixes to beta, nor does a lack of fixes in beta have anything to do with what it will look like in August.
---
There will be twinks either way, so I dont see why not!
---
This reminded me of the time I brought a girl home after a long night of drinking. I forget what we were doing but the bed began shaking hard enough to shake my little flimsy computer desk, which moved the mouse, which turned on the screen to reveal the WoW login screen.
---
It's a bit ironic to say that wanting TBC back is nothing but nostalgia when the same has been said about people that want Classic back, but here we are. 
---
Personally, I'm still fond of TBC because that was when I started playing WoW but playing Classic on private servers made me realize that I probably wouldn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would before I played Classic.
---
I would still take TBC and Wrath over any other WoW expansion but Classic gave me a much deeper understanding about why I enjoyed WoW in the first place: It's a true MMORPG. Classic was the time when WoW was the most "RPG", subsequent expansions started to detract from this.
---
One example of that is flying in TBC as it removes a lot of the danger and exploration aspects of an RPG from the game.
---
Anyway, if I had to say, people would probably want TBC back because of how the classes played, how every raid tier stayed relevant throughout the expansion and last but not least the arena. I would enjoy experiencing TBC again because I could see what Skillherald warriors and draincomps were all about. I was too new and too bad at the game to understand any of that at the time.
---
I was actually more joking around about being a heal slut. Didn't mean it to be serious.

Not the best example as the bosses were also tuned for pre 1.12 talents, but we will get those from the start.
---
ya ok sure but have you ever slaughtered a whole village of murlocs?
---
Because sex workers have such good life outcomes? If she wanted to be a professional meth smoker would you support her? What happened to home maker, doctor, secretary, veterinarian, or chef?
---
Damn straight. I gotta start my own guild.
---
Yes these games will still happen.
---
Even though I prefer fast games, it's very difficult to get everyone to stop turtling. No one reads, no one strategizes they just mindlessly attack the nearest horde.
---
The recent AV test proved this to me. I never even finished one game, even though I tried about 3 different games and spent almost 6 hours playing.
---
Personally, I like to watch a lot of WoW related videos on YouTube as well as viewing Twitch streamers like Sodapoppin from time to time. If I am viewing Classic content on YouTube or Twitch, I would much rather see the Classic models and animations. To me, the old models and animations are a big part of what World of Warcraft really is. The new models and animations just remind me of how bad the current game is \*to me\*.
---
Well, that won't fly with the 2 hour loot trading window for raids in classic thankfully.
---
but then why undead for priest? shadowguard is so good
---
&gt; On the other hand, I would tell my tanks to take their ass through UBRS and come back with the bare minimum of their pre-bis before they get to demand things.
---
I don't see how this is relevant since the Drillborer is better than the Draconian Deflector
---
Yeah but those people never really engage in social stuff outside the game. Maybe because they'd get called LARPer cowards that can't even wPvP 1v1 for shit as soon as they mention playing alliance on a PvE server.  
---
Out of personal experience, there's some level of truth to that. I've played with so many alliance people that want to be the hero of their own personal little story, yet still play on PvP servers, not engaging in any sort of wPvP, crying when they get ganked while doing jackshit about it (like starting a brawl) and don't even help fellow allies when they see you getting your ass handed to you. These people just seem to play on PvP servers just because they don't wanna get caught on the forums playing on a PvE one because of the reasons mentioned above, seriously how much of a tool can you be...  
---
I love the Alliance from a lore and feel perspective, but I'm really tired of the stupid attitude so many of them have. It's like all they want to do is afk in a nice looking city and take screenshots of the day's transmog. I'm gonna take some time off from the alliance. If I see classic's necessity for socializing changes them or at least trims out the shitty players I'll consider coming back home.
---
You know, people make fun of the "circle jerk" about people criticizing blizzard, and then you have someone posting an OLD video trying to incite drama about it being fixed...
---
Ya it was fixed, thank you. Let's focus on the other bugs...
---
The best thing I remember, and I don't know if it was in a group I was in or if I seent it online somewhere, but...
---
"brb cats on fire"
---
goes AFK, doesn't come back.
---
Unfortunately not. This is the result:

This is on the Classic beta server. You reckon this is a bug? Personally Ive always used the cancel aura lines, so I'm not 100% sure here.
---
Hey man, i just tried some of your instant shapeshift macros from bear to cat for example on a private server(since i dont have a BETA KEY) and they just cancelled my current form without instantly jumping into the next. Do you think this is something that is a feature only in the new classic beta since it is being run on the current engine?!
---
I barely did anything compared with putting together the addon and website and all that makes it work; thanks very much to you. It's an outstanding resource and I'm happy to help in some small way with people using it.
---
*slowly backs away*
---
I'd hope you could see the difference between PvP latency changes and PvE mechanic changes.
---
I feel like you're arguing for the sake of it at this point. I'm not writing an ironclad thesis on Classic mechanics.
---
Only it's not. Not by a longshot. FR + defense for a tank that starts raiding and getting to Def cap is their prio #1. What are you on dude?
---
Sex is moral because sex leads to moral questions. A woman who has had more partners in life has trouble pair-bonding when she wants to settle with a man (most women will want kids and a stable provider/partner). Sexual acts that might make a woman feel like she is "selling herself" can damage her selfesteem. You might say that the problem with her viewing those acts as bad is "society's view on sex" which is when I would remind you that that is societies prerogative to hold a cultural view they want to, and it will be rooted in facts and statistical outcomes.
---
Hypothetically
---
Incredibly back during vanilla beta Undead occupied those numbers (38%), while Humans were second (35%). Maybe being edgy was the cool thing back then.
---
There was an Orgrimmar version but i don’t know if it was recolored
---
No Kyles.
---
Why would it be cheating? It doesn't break the rules of the game. 
---
Can there be multiple characters in the same place? Yes.
---
Can you have more than one accounts? Yes.
---
Can you play as many of your accounts at the same time? Yes.
---
You can't use it to take more people to a raid or battleground and loot/xp is split between your characters.
---
Being a cry-baby and whining for game restrictions is what made BFA.
---
Hm, good question. I cannot confirm this though. In BfA it's no longer required to have these macro's, as casting a spell thats not supported by the form will automatically make you leave the form. All the testing I did is on the classic beta, so you could assume they will work just fine once classic launches!
---
Nah Sargeras horde.
---
Theuchiha, because I was a massive weeb when I was 14, I still cringe when I think about it.
---
Durator haha, that’s one I haven’t seen before.
---
It might not be an issue to you; that doesn't mean it isn't to other people. It's not even a big one so ironically you're the one making this into more of an issue than it is because you didn't read the posts correctly and want to save face. 
---
I can see most of your post history is you just picking random fights with people in wow classic themed subs. I feel like you just want to pick a fight with someone and vent s bit, is everything alright?
---
If it's helping with whatever's going on I don't mind keeping this going but if not then maybe we should just move on and accept you have a different way of playing the game to me and my kinda people lol.
---
If you can clear MC then your tank doesn't need drillborer, you're good to go without it obviously.
---
Or, you know, because the deflector is better and a must have for warriors at tier 1? And because drillborer will break by the time you reach magmadar? You need to go into the raid with 8 drillborers to make it to the end.
---
No homers either
---
Thank you. People who expect all bugs fixed in 4-5 weeks have never worked on a real project. 
---
I've been playing beta since day 1 and my experience has been absolutely been better than actual vanilla. The thing most people don't seem to be able to grasp is while the game design was damn good, actual vanilla SUCKED. We regularly had wipes due to server problems and called it "part of the game". While this subs number one complaint right now is 'skeleton despawn time'. We're living in a Utopia complaining about the flavor of the margaritas ffs.
---
This x1000000. Give me all of BC but put it in the vanilla world. Best game of all time.
---
Roll UD priest, enchanting and tailoring, try to remember where everything is and just enjoy the ride.
---
I'm not an expert or anything, but that seems a bit off. Would you really put a point in deterrence and then proceed to put 2 point in imp FD and none in counterattack?
---
Mazziwe was my first and only. 
---
Just got the account back as well. Frozen since 2005. Pure nostalgia visiting the old toons again!!!
---
It would take resources away from making sure Classic WoW is a smooth port with something that was never in Classic to begin with. I also don't want my characters to look like those retail abominations on *any* screen.
---
When gear goes up a fire mage in the group will be useful.  Won’t be like the beta with everyone try harding frost mages.  
---
My rank14 group had a fire mage and ele shamans, plenty folks got deleted
---
&gt; Also, it's definitely less immersion breaking. With a merge, you have the immersion "broken" overnight during their reset. With layering, you lose immersion every single time you join a group and watch everyone around you vanish and repopulate with different people. That is significantly worse.
---
Since you're editing, I'll address this as well.
---
Griffons suddenly appear and vanish as they fly past.  They don't go over the mountain into the horizon.  They just vanish.
---
A guy you are standing next to just vanishes because his BG queue popped.
---
A guy suddenly appears before you because he logged in.
---
A mob suddenly apperas because it respawned.  
---
The "immersion" argument is the biggest bunch of bullshit ever.  It's just people trying to find a reason to hate layering. 
---
"I'd rather have an entirely new community of people join than to see someone disappear!"
---
Give me a break.
---
LOL at the guy getting Chris Hansen'd hahahahah

Lion heart helm ! I’ll be buying that baby ASAP if it don’t drop for our guild
---
I remember waiting in line for a bit and getting my hands on a collectors edition of TBC.
---
Good leaps of logic. Good rhetoric.
---
I expected the '/cancelform [nostance:0]' to work because I used it in most of my retail macros back in the days, so that's quite surprising.
---
Does the alternative version with a modifier work? Would help understand if it's an issue with the conditions.
---
dkp with silent auction is best imo
---
&gt; I am hopeful that our culture will change 
---
I agree our culture has gotten lazy when it comes to reinforcing healthy sexual norms like finding a stable monogamous partner to have children with, instead of chasing "cummies".
---
Sex is for making babies, that's the only reason our brains evolved to make it seem fun, it pushes replication of genes. I don't want to be some kind of a killjoy but you can find studies of people. Studies that show the younger you start the more partners you will have by a far margin, the increased chance of contracting STDs, more likely to divorce later in life. The thing that I worry about is generally when I tell people these things they shoot the messenger, it seems true that the traditional style of finding a good partner first works out better in the long run, it seems true that what we want sex to be isn't what it is (free nonstop no consequence fun, nature had other intentions when it was wiring our brains).
---
Hilarious.
---
Nah. You take the upgrade thats available when its available and if you bitch about it you are a problem.
---
Afaik,
---
I mean good luck affording one since raiders would be using those for their own gear at that point, but I bought one in very early TBC and it worked the same
---
They did RMT because they didnt want to action/ban accounts for buying china gold because of how many accounts were doing it
---
Same reason certain websites won’t ban certain users that break rules but have massive numbers.
---
I'm of course going Horde! I will be maining an Undead Mage (original, right?) It was the first character I ever made. To me, Undeads are the coolest race and Mage is the class I am the most proficient with
---
I will definitely be a Tailor so that I can make myself gear and bags, and also so I can make bags to sell. As far as another profession, I'm not sure yet. I know I want engineering in the future for PvP, so maybe I'll be a miner to save up mats? Not sure what would be the best for me to do regarding that
---
I will of course have a bank alt parked in either UC or Orgrimmar
---
I plan to try to level at a decent pace, but I also want to take my time a little to really enjoy this second time around and appreciate it while I do all the old quests I used to do as well as the old dungeons like SM and SFK
---
PVP will be my main focus in Classic
---
When the time comes, I will most likely make an alt. Right now in my head that alt will be a Troll Priest, of course it's possible that will change
---
Admittedly folks will need to get used to that fact. By no means do I think classic is "ruined" by the vast retrospective knowledge we have, but we should expect things to be more streamlined due to the available knowledge alone.
---
Yet everything did better than shadow priest, which is really annoying when you play in a full communism  guild as.a shadow priest, you get to show up every raid and bring the same consumes as the rest, yet you won't get any loot until mages, locks and eles has their gear
---
Level to 60 quickly. I don't have the willpower or mental energy to maintain optimal pathing for 60 levels, but I'm planning on hitting 60 under 7 days /played.
---
Get attuned quickly, and hope to use my superior healer value to get into a guild for MC.
---
Trust me, no one wants your nooby names ;p
---
a little slow but not bad, around 90 minutes seems to be the best times.
---
I need my UI to not look like trash, so I'll need a decent bar, bag, minimap, cast bar, and name plate add-on. What currently works in beta is meh so I'll have to wait for the add-on community to catch up.
---
Isn't rockbiter a level 2 spell?
---
&gt;The "immersion" argument is the biggest bunch of bullshit ever. 
---
Well you started it...
---
Spent so much time putting this together I feel bad mentioning you forgot a few specs,..also your order is lol
---
With layering I think we should be ok not rushing the leveling. I would just enjoy the experience.
---
The current version is for afk fishing and honor farming.  Trying costs you too much honor gained, or rep.  Will still be funny when people get stuck in turtles regardless.  Not always but turtles will be common.  That is why they added resources, turtles were too common.
---
Again, you're assuming people are good at this game. Let me enlighten you that even though vanilla was released over a decade ago and private servers has existed for as long, people still suck at this game. Even with threat meters people pull aggro. Just last week I had to inform the mages that if you have the ignite and stop attacking because of threat, the ignite will keep ticking and you'll pull aggro and wipe the raid. 
---
Don't underestimate how bad people are at this game and especially when it comes to threat.
---
Kiriel on khaz Modan, eventually changed the name to Oak when I finished my professor title
---
You have successfully used every bullshit comment against Classic.
---
They must be assuming locks will pvp as SM/Ruin for some reason.
---
Yes, the modifier works!

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5hijc/was_pva_combat_in_the_maul_a_thing_in/). 
---
I always liked trying to force turtles, but not many people enjoy that. with the classic honor system it may be beneficial to do so, i don't remember much about honor farming a turtled AV vs winning AV's.
---
Because..?
---
I prefer the old models and graphics in a game that is born from the concept of recreating WoW as it was between 2004-2006. Client or not.
---
If they were to modernize the graphics to the extent of actually implementing the new models in Classic, I honestly wouldn't want them to stay there. Either remake all of Classic (zones, environments, props, SFX, animations etc.) to the level of fidelity we have today, thus achieving a cohesive aesthetics across the board or don't touch it at all.

I have bad news...

Because for some people they were clunky/annoying, and those people complain louder.
---
[blizz-art.com](https://blizz-art.com) doesn't exist?
---
You forgot to say that the rep grind gets really boring unless you're playing on release because I'd you join a bit late people will just destroy the dungs.and no one needs the loot, so it becomes boring rush through the dungs where people try to find a palace tank because the other 2 sucks at some threat especially when you blow up everything. 
---
The raids are still pretty easy for the most parts (even  on a pserver that made the raids harder) while a few are mythic difficulty and takes a lot of progress and no one can be retarded (tron gorefiend and karl that for example)
---
We don't know on the beta yet since it's capped at level 40. 
---
Everyone's guess is just that, a guess.
---
Another question is does the extra damage proc weapon procs and chance on hit effects?
---
I am sure I have seen worse ideas ..... Now off to layering ..... Do you have another suggestion how to solve the 1-3 million people attempting to platy Classic on day one? and over 50% leaving the game shortly after?
---
People have been saying that since the dawn of time and yet...here we are...
---
Oddly, 8.2 patch notes specifically addressed terrain exploits in ab but not wsg.
---
I bet you the population will drop more than you think and faster than you think.
---
&gt; It's less community and **immersion**-breaking than layering, by a long shot.
---
That's you, in reply to /u/valtieri , before I ever replied to you.  Like I said, it's like you just type words without thinking.
---
Absolutely no way on Azeroth that skinning nets 60 gold an hour.
---
&gt; or have an opinion on your sex life. 
---
What law or moral framework dictates that you can't have an opinion on ANY person's sexlife? Especially if that person might come to depend on you to pick up the pieces of it fails? We are talking about the people who brought you into this world, you are literally made from their DNA, some parents are total shit, but some are good and sex is a healthy and very earthly function of humans.
---
You used a lot of emotional words that were not present or implied like
---
&gt; pry into and pass judgment /  adult childrens  /  entitled 
---
That is just plain dishonesty, if you were a parent, and someone asked you to write an essay on what you want your baby to grow up to do with their life, I guarantee you it's the shitty, bad, and emotionally unattached parents who say "I want my girl to wear tight pants and bend over on twitch when an attention starved male who may be under 18 donates 150$".
---
Now sure, you can tell your parents to take a hike and do what you want with your life, I'm not going to believe for a second people choose sex work because it's fulfilling and totally a trauma free life style, far too many of the people starting out in those jobs come in as severely damaged goods for you to pass that bullshit off.

You want to morally judge her for her sexuality? Not my business. Her status as a hoe is up to your opinion and I don't care, lmao. No ones debating anything about informing partners of previous encounters or whether it's ultimately manipulative here. Are you replying to the correct person?

This aoe farming be good for rep late game? I feel like I remember farming for my exalted title in scholo or strat, given I was like 70

Quitit. I started out on an RP server and made it almost 60 before someone got the bright idea to report my name.
---
I was able to plead my case to a GM and kept my name. Only to be forced to change my name again for a brief time.
---
I fought for that name, haha. I don't now why, it was never intended to be Quit-it, I thought it sounded cool.
---
Elemental Earth is used for more than just nature pots. It's also used for Restoration Potion, which is insanely useful all throughout vanilla's content.
---
This is a topic probably best addressed on the blizz boards...perhaps the devs will take note.
---
oh my god, like totally, uninformed posts, memes, asskissing posts like they got payed for it...

ill continue playing for free on pservers!

Gotta catch ‘em all!

My go-to method of farming gold for epic mount on private servers was devilsaur armor since all the melee needed the +hit.  This time around I’m just going to pick a profession I actually enjoy and that will be useful to me and my friends.  If I’m unable to get epic mount money with it without farming an insane amount of time, hate to say it but I’ll probably just buy Chinese gold to get over the hump.
---
Soul link doesn't compare with SM/Ruin for BG's.
---
Being rich and buying gold ingame is not exactly p2w because u only buy a certain amount of items. Most of the good stuffs from raid and most guilds won’t offer boosts or carry’s for at least a little while. And most of the time p2w ppl arnt very good players. I will personally be buying a lot of gold and most my godly boe items. Only because I work 70+ hour weeks. If I had no life like I did back in original classic then I wouldn’t need too I was super rich then because I could put 12/14 hours a day into the game.
---
Keep blogging, psycho

---
....what? I've never seen anything like this happen on any private server I've ever played.
---
Introduced much needed life into the dead meme specs.  The PvP was more challenging.  Heroics were a fun/difficult addition to 5 man content.  And the game just felt fun.  I definitely enjoy TBC more than vanilla.  And that’s saying a lot because I absolutely love vanilla.  
---
Oh, and it’s not just a blast of nostalgia, because I’ve played both versions of the game via the p-server scene and still found TBC to be better. I could just as easily put a negative spin on a bunch of aspects of vanilla.  At the end of the day I’m not going to because it’s still a fantastic game that I’m really looking forward to.  Same goes for TBC for me.
---
Seems like it may have been reported for having “tit” in it... then again I don’t think your name should have been reported :3
---
It should be the first image on Orgrimmar wallpaper
---
It's better to use CDs situationally instead of automatically. You may use it when you don't really need it. Then it'll be on cooldown for when you actually do.
---
Let's say you want blood fury easily accessible with sinister strike:
---
    /use [mod:ctrl] Blood Fury; Sinister Strike
---
This will cast SS w/o control key + hotkey and cast blood fury with control + hotkey. The mod option can be either shift or alt also if you want to use them instead.
---
You can also make this macro a little more efficient by adding a stealth opener and vanish.
---
    /use [mod:ctrl] Blood Fury; [mod:shift] Vanish; [stealth] Ambush; [nostealth] Sinister Strike
---
Shift + hotkey will cast vanish. While in stealth ambush will cast and no mod key is pressed. Sinister strike will be used if not stealthed and no mod key.
---
I know of several ways to "fix" AV. 
---
1. Fix the stupid backdoor and bridge.
---
2. Massively increase the rewards for doing the quests in there.
---
3. Fix the NPCs so they don't bug out when summoned all the time.
---
4. Make a commander role so a person can take charge and direct people. The most fun I've ever had in an AV was when I took charge and lead skirmishes beyond the bunker to get cav and organise a tower raid etc. 
---
5. Either let it be possible to enter as a raid or hinder premading through sync queues. 
---
6. This might just be a private server thing, but fix so that you can't ghost walk to another graveyard, relog and ress there. This meant that you could just run right through everything and capture the graveyard by the enemy boss and whoever fell along the way could just ghost down there and ress. 
---
These are some improvements I'd like to see, but not in Classic. I want people to experience the old style AV and then I'll make popcorn while reading all the whiny posts on forums and reddit about how AV is just a giant turtle fest or a zerg past eachother.
---
The game is 15 years old.
---
There are no "supr seekrit farm spotz" anymore.
---
This is why you keep snowballs on you at all times.
---
Right? Gold framed.
---
Don't forget races. Bonus abilities and passives are super important if you only have 1-3 class abilities.
---
Human, Undead, Gnome, Dwarf, Nightelf are pretty much equally worthless or depending on matchup (shadow res undead vs wl?). Orc troll are prob tier 1 due to their great dps-increasing actives and Tauren close 2nd with slightly higher stamina and their melee range stun (amazing at lvl 1). I think paladins aren't better than orc/troll/tauren anyclass for that reason. In my opinion, orc shaman would win against anyone else.
---
Wow. A Layering shit-post that failed to offer a better alternative while telling a story that had nothing to do when Layering.
---
Lololol he deleted.
---
There was actually a Hunter on my server (Shadowmoon US) that had Thunderfury.  I can't remember if he was in one of the better guilds and everyone else that wanted it already had it, or if he paid off the better guilds to get it.  Anyways, shit like that does and will happen.  I remember a couple of rogues in my guild being pissed off that they didn't get our first bindings over the warrior even though they had the same amount of dkp, but the bottom line is that the first bindings that drop NEED to go to your main tank.  After the first Thunderfury has been made, the guild can be more lenient about who gets the bindings (we eventually had a rogue that was able to get Thunderfury as well), but it is the best tanking weapon in Vanilla and should therefore always go to the main tank first because that will help the guild progress faster.  I was a Holy Paladin that wanted several of the 2 handers that dropped during raids so I could pvp as ret, but I'd have to wait until everyone else that could use them in raids already had them.  It ended up being only about 2 or 3 months before TBC came out before I was even able to get Zin'rokh because there were MANY other people in the guild that it was an upgrade for during raiding.  I didn't mind waiting because I knew it was what was best for the guild.  If other people raiding didn't feel the same way, they weren't the type of people we wanted in our guild to begin with.  All that being said, I agree that if everyone in your guild isn't a complete dumbass, no loot council should be needed with dkp.  However, I think its worth mentioning that in classic, raids were 40 man and your chances of not at least having 2 or 3 dumbasses out of those 40, even in REALLY good raiding guilds, is pretty low.  Don't get me wrong, I definitely think DKP is the better system and should be adhered to 99% of the time, but going PURELY off DKP doesn't ALWAYS work to the advantage of the guild.
---
Keep telling yoursel that while you play a 14 year old children's video game
---
It got reported for having a phrase, two words. One of the RP server rules. I agree it was pretty ticky tacky, haha.
---
Also consumable balance. You ran either a flask or two elixirs. No more running 12 potions, 3 scrolls, and chasing buffs from dungeons and turn ins. 
---
But damn did I hate flying, resilience, badge gear, soft resets every patch, and the isle with daily quests.
---
So my understanding is that it's not a bug but both commands play at the same time on one keypress. You do actually cancel form but shift back into bear immediately because both conditions are fulfilled one after the other.
---
The reason why the modifier macro works is because it prevents the macro from playing the second command with a stopmacro in between the two.
---
There might be a workaround but without beta access to experiment with different conditions I can't really figure it out just now...
---
Off-topic: but if a car company released a barebones vehicle with a a magneto (so no battery replacement, ever), no radio/AC, could be worked on with nothing but hand-tools (with cheap, easily obtainable parts) and was sold for the price of a nice lawnmower, I would buy the thing in a heartbeat.

Steezy just trying to get his class fixed so it's playable. Honestly doing ALL mages a service in putting these out there. A lot of shit affecting their class that shouldn't be atm. 
---
Ya'll stop complainin' like some hoes.
---
This is for BGs? Then Rogue should be at the bottom and Druid S tier.
---
They shouldn’t be the best at all 3 of those things, but a class like a Druid should be viable at all of those roles.  TBC did in fact nail it as the hybrid classes weren’t considered the best at their ‘secondary’ roles, but were all still viable.  What they lacked in raw DPS numbers was often times made up for with their utility, which is exactly how it should be.
---
Absolutely nothing about the class balance or various classes felt homogenized in TBC.
---
Nah
---
For sure not me.
---
Omar level IQ my friend.
---
I always make new characters instead of porting the same name over and over again, unless it's a throw away character. I had Miakoda and Desdemona or something for my very first Tauren Hunter and Druid and they were specific to those characters. I'm rolling Alliance this time, so they don't fit. I've got a list of names per class I'll go through and see what I get cause my new thing is going for extra short names, like I had Sly, Echo, and Sky in Wildstar.
---
I said many not all.  I agree with the TOS perspective and the hacking perspective, but...
---
&gt;It warps the in-game economy as it causes inflation[...]
---
Inflation?  The gold gets spent, so not really.  It is not really different than if I'd spent the time to farm the gold.  Not to mention, gold farmers do interact with repairs, skill training, and maybe even mounts in order to farm more effectively.
---
&gt;It cheapens the experience [...]
---
Cheapens the experience?  That's subjective.  Your experience is the definition of subjective.  Personally, I do see it as a P2W shortcut, but it otherwise does not give you access to anything that would otherwise not be regularly available in the game.  For some people, it may well enhance their experience if they prefer to socialize more and grind less.
---
&gt;The idea of an MMORPG at its core is to be a world seperate from the real world. [...]
---
This is subjective too.  An MMO by definition is a massive world with many people who all have different goals or expect to get different things out of the game, and so they all approach it in different ways.  I dont think its inherently predicated upon being the opposite of our real world.  Also buying a mount with RMT = a god?  Okay...  I don't see it but whatever.  I think this argument is up to the personal bias of the OP, but I 100% disagree with him.
---
&gt;Gold sellers tend to ninja items as well.
---
I don't know about this, my ancient history was that ninjas were just people who wanted to take a shortcut or take a rare drop (like the mats for sulfuras, which actually did happen in my guild back in the day).  Objective argument, I just don't know how true it is.
---
&gt;Gold sellers tend to use bots to permanently camp grind spots - making them unusable to other players.
---
Objective argument, but generally I would say its actually easier to fuck up a bot's routine than real people grinding spawns.  You can always gank them too, or train them.  If it becomes a problem I could see the advent of specific discord channels to advertise botters and call the opposite faction over to gank them.
---
Like I said, many of the reasons are subjective.
---
What's the point of the [stance] part?
---
My macro is as simple as:
---
/cancelaura Bear Form
---
/cast Cat Form
---
I will add more to it like cancel cheetah ect, but it's simple, works, and does the same thing as yours as far as I know. I'm not great at making macro's so I like to better understand what all the extra stuff means.
---
What's the /stopcasting part for? in case your in mid-cast so it will interrupt to shapeshift?
---
And what's the "/cast [no instance] Form" part for? If I just use /cast Bear Form while I'm already in Bear Form, it will just shift me back to humanoid.
---
Rip bank/AH alts..
---
They'll find a way to monetize beyond a subscription fee/ruin it boys, but lord above I've got nothing bad to say until they do.
---
All products of man are natural, man comes from nature. A plastic soda ring around a turtle's neck is as natural as rain if you want to get philosophical. My point is guns are completely natural, I love em, my name is about em, and they are going to be on this planet longer than humans will be.
---
Reminds me of a joke about Mother Nature complaining to man about war and pollution and man asks "Why do you think we do that?" and Mother Nature says "because it's in your naa.....Ah you're not gonna get me that easy!"
---
It's one thing to as a coping mechanism say "they are adults, it's out of my hands"
---
But I don't think that really addresses "I raised them, I partially shaped them into a person who sells themselves as an object for money to complete strangers". I say that because no amount of bullshitting will make someone believe when a parent was raising their child that they said being a sex worker was where they wanted them to end up, that's some horribly bad trauma being repeated there IMO.
---
You got good points.
---
Yea. You have no idea how this shit works.
---
Dabncestrl. It was a terrible name. 
---
When I played Pokémon Red version at like 6 years old I made up the name Dabobry. I used this name over and over and eventually it was shortened to Dab. I wanted to make my first character name Dab Ancestral but couldn’t fit all the letters. I typically include Dab in all my names. Too bad my name has been appropriated for weed stuffs.
---
The more current Beta players go to 8.2 the higher the chances there will be another BETA invites wave IMO.
---
You’re seriously using the ‘you think you do, but you don’t’ argument?  LMFAO
---
claim certain names like banker and sell them for gold.
---
The healer would be happy to pick up cloth gear though so it's two of them that shares. Still an issue of course.
---
I stick to the New tab on Reddit's main page, mostly.
---
Flag carriers are resto
---
They make more money without you..
---
Ah so you believe the population will be 80% lower three weeks in than the other way around?
---
I disagree, if my kid ends up Jenna Jameson rich, I'll be fucking proud
---
One can only dream.
---
Doesn’t really matter, you’ll ding running  to meet up.
---
To get into MC and Ony pugs you need preraid bis and then some? wut
---
Darlantan Human Warrior
---
Yeah, I loved WotLK too.  If they ever do progress to WotLK, I REALLY hope they’re willing to remove the LFD feature.  The T9 content patch that introduced LFD marks the true sundering of WoW between the Classic era and the Modern era in my opinion.
---
Unstoppable Force single handedly (well, its a 2her) killed the market for Arcanite Reapers.
---
What's there to know? It's an arena with no point hidden away where no one goes unless they're running straight to an instance portal. The rare spawns don't drop anything good.
---
 Well balanced PvP system where every class and even most specs have room to shine. 
---
hahahahaha
---
 Resilience was really good for the game, partly 
---
And then they introduced warfronts.
---
Hilarious
---
Blizzard needs to already have an official response for this.  This can't be very hard to block by adding small invisible objects.  If it's in the game people are going to do it and I don't see where you draw the line on what's bannable and what isn't.  Is jumping on objects and tree stumps in the middle bannable?
---
I'll legit try to snipe my real first name. Would be kinda cool. Wont say what it is. Not super common or anything so I think I can get it if I'm fast. :)
---
That's a solid RPG name - nice!
---
Rattle off some TBC dungeons off the top of your head.
---
Have an upvote for Ulduar Hardmodes. Why they dropped it after one tier it's still beyond me. There never should have been heroic raiding. Just Hardmodes.
---
I (a Guild Leader) gave the T4 helm off Prince to our new Paladin healer to complete a set bonus (RL friend) over the long time Hunter, who needed it to complete the set. 
---
His Elderly wife (awesome that she played WoW) called me “Little Hitler” and both /gquit. 
---
My friends joke about it to this day. Easily 10+ years ago. 
---
TLDR: I committed loot related sins and got called “Little Hitler” by an old lady
---
haha, fat chance, more likely in rehab with bruises wondering why their parents don't show concern until they look like assholes for being absent, to any parent like this just cut your child loose so they stop reaching out and pulling back an empty hand.  Sorry I don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings, but this is honestly how I see it, and have seen it.
---
I don't want to insult you or your family so I am trying to word this in general terms how I see the situation, rather than make it a pointed claim against you personally.
---
anti-TBC whiners really have zero self awareness
---
TBC without flying mounts and dailies would be the perfect version of WoW for me.
---
I’d definitely TBC unaltered tho too.  Beggars can’t be choosers ;)
---
Wotlk was the first time WoW's population declined.
---
disgusting
---
Warrior. Mining and Blacksmithing of course. Armorsmithing when I get to that point.
---
At the VERY end of Vanilla, when they gave us TBC talents and made it possible to grind the epic pvp gear without earning the titles, I was getting 4k+ judgement crits on clothies.  I was at LEAST A tier at that point.... but you're right, the rest of the time, ret is a completely useless spec.
---
&gt; I think they're being foolish to not invite more people.
---
It's only foolish if you think they haven't identified all the things they need to fix and having more people would help identify those things.
---
I'd say they have.
---
good points
---
They could have told you to go pound sand and then you'd have sharding instead. At least they tried to come up with a compromise and it's not even permanent. Deal with it.
---
people just buy their stuff online. but imo the hype is still there
---
I will have to add that. Good points.
---
It's a thankless job for sure. By the end of the day your guildies are just gonna catch up with the gear you had dibs on because tank and you'll understand that you have been but a mere tool for 39 other people.  
---
Also don't thin yourself a leader outside dungeons, a ranged dps or a healer is way better suited for the role because they can actually see what's going on around them and steer the raid accordingly. You just call the boss' mom fat and take the slaps like the good daddy's girl you are.
---
Scooping the name
---
Ok? So just report it?
---
Playing instances when you are ten levels over them will be even faster, but hardly as fun.
---
Women being doctors is a leap of logic to you lol? Just the first search hit, to tell us shit we already knew. Now being a "twitch model/internet model" *might* not be as dangerous, but I don't know if 1 doesn't lead to the other at least some of the time. And I would be embarrassed to tell people that is what my daughter did for a living, different worlds I guess.

### Conclusions
---
Sex  work is associated with excess mortality and morbidity including the  sequelae of STI, mental health problems, and substance misuse. The  relation between these health problems and sex work is complex.
---
Wow... same story, destroyed our guild. - Archimonde EU ?
---
I figured a /stopmacro inbetween the /cancelform and the form cast would help, but it didn't. Reversing the command actually did. It works fine if you want to just swap bear to no bear, but not from any other form to bear, it will just place you back in normal form. A /stopcasting doesn't seem to help either. I'm trying to think of a way to pauze the macro.
---
It began to turn hybrids into no longer hybrids. Would you consider Paladins and Shaman hybrids in WOTLK?
---
Nothing has changed in 14 years 😂
---
For me, it's: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVERnEHcI2s
---
Gotta love how both have an "I WIN" macro which consists of two spell power trinkets (Zandalarian Hero Charm + Talisman of Ephemeral Power).
---
Bonus "I WIN" button action from a shadow priest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd7oamCTRf4
---
I too eagerly await the next layering post.
---
Tracking resources is no longer a buff shows on kinimap instead

“Whuuut?”  “Whuuut is it? “Moooore Work?”

Alliance miners somewhere if I remember correctly?! Where at though....?

If you add the www manually and don't use https then it should [work](http://www.blizz-art.com)

You there!! Check out that noise!!

Also, as a nelf in classic: isnu dab dieb or whatever the fuck. I'm 11 again every time I hear it

Because they are streamers. They dont stream, they dont make money.
---
Sub Rogue wPvP = clown on them fools for days, they can't even turn around to ask for mercy.  
---
Combat rogue wPvP = "I'll just hope they're squishier than me"
---
This was affecting every race. Every example has just been with Undead Rogue because that's like half the entire Rogue population.
---
Another thing to realize which has been pointed out in the past too, is that the Alliance as a faction acts as "the great filter".  So many players want to be the "good guys" the generic fantasy elves and humans, or other tolkien races in their big medieval fantasy cities.  
---
All those players get filtered out into the Alliance, which makes their populations much bigger, and full of the both highly social RP players and the dross the player base.
---
Healing puts me to sleep in raids. You get to watch health bars. The alternative isn't that impressive though, you get to watch some giants toes.
---
I'm not, I like reading everyone's ideas
---
no, this a marginal nerf to fury warriors compared to private servers.
---
Was that on Daggerspine?
---
Report feature + megathread.
---
No need for a new post at all.
---
I browse new on subreddits I like but I follow too many for new on my main page
---
Clearly Reddit will solve this problem.
---
Fucking great movie.
---
I gotta remind myself to not check it more than once every hour so there are actually new conversations
---
All good. Sounds good to me.
---
We are definitely going to TRY and do PvE lol.  It's just a much more higher barrier to entry. We are going to do it, just might take a while.
---
If you have Discord, come join and say hey: https://discord.gg/Kcb3SqF
---
If not, just keep in touch with me over the next few weeks until launch.
---
Some of us are playing on a private server if you're interested too
---
In my opinion, yes. In Vanilla hybrids were not hybrids .... they were healers, any other spec was "LUL". 
---
In TBC and WOTLK they were able to do non-healer role at 80-90% of a "Pure" class.
---
Thanks!  Totally stole it from a Dragonlance book haha.
---
I suffered a type-o with my very first toon... a gnome warrior named Smiley (except I accidentally typed Smallie)  worst part I didn’t even notice until someone in Ventrillo asked me why I kept saying the Wong name.  I argued.
---
Orange man bad
---
I'm researching vanilla PvP for an article. Finding mixed reports of whether it was ever used in the same was as Gurubashi, and if it even existed
---
Self awareness about what? That The Burning Crusade is totally overrated, and that a lot of posters on this forum are delusional? Do I think Classic is the perfect game? No. Do I think The Burning Crusade was a product of its time. Yes, I do. Players nowadays would not care for it. The long attunements. The Arena. The dead continent and world. TBC shares a lot more in common with retail WoW than you would admit I bet.
---
Those are the best, guaranteed several back and forth, so entertaining.
---
Watch nobbels recent video on it
---
I'll do my best to explain it point by point.
---
* The stances are the names of the shapeshifts. Stance 1 is bear form, stance 2 is aquatic form etc.
---
* Your macro is simple, but only allows for you to cancel bear form into cat form. If you want to go to cat form from travel form, you'll need a different macro. Naming all the stances in your /cancelaura in the first line, will simply cover all your bases, allowing you to shapeshift into any form, from any form.
---
* The /stopcasting allows for you to exit your form by pressing the same keybind without directly shifting into it again.
---
* The \[nostance\] basically allows you to cast the spell in whatever stance you are at that moment. If, for example, the code was  /cast \[stance:1\] Spell Name. you would only be able to cast that spell in stance 1. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
How much do you jack up the rewards, is the meta now to just go in and do repeatable quests and not even fight? How does the commander role direct people? Do they just draw on the map? Do you just get a special chat color? How long do things drawn on the map last if you go that route? Is there a punishment for drawing penises?
---
The other things are bug fixes and not changes to mechanics so I'm not going ask you questions. The point is, there are even more questions than what I came up with in one minute to question how you're going to implement your brilliant design.
---
Well some of those points are poorly spent
---
Tell everyone in the group to hit need and do so. Never go greed on those rare vanity drops in a PUG as there always is *that one asshole* who rolls need at the end.
---
I think reversing the commands works because of the GCD from shifting. You can't cancelform immediately so, even if the command is valid, it just doesn't do anything.
---
    /cancelform [nostance:1] /cast [nostance:1] Bear Form /cancelform [nostance:0]
---
This should shift to bear from any other form but also cancel bear if in bear, right?
---
Chill nerd
---
Don't remember on first account. Second account in Vanilla was Kudenwic. Night Elf hunter.
---
&gt;hotdude
---
Thats what i menar, i tought 2 hours was slow
---
Lol you realise Ret is A tier right?
---
Adding multiple difficulty modes to Raids and Dungeons was lazy design by Blizzard. It broke immersion and trivialized the content.  Pathetic.
---
