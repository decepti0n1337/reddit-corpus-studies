Was looking forward to trying some exploration. Visiting [the Deadmines secret](https://youtu.be/TypwFz9CakA?t=310) is one of my best memories from vanilla.

---
I've worked in tech for a long time now, and I'm a huge fan of the [CODE Mechanical Keyboard](https://codekeyboards.com/). I have a Razer Basilisk mouse, which I've turned off all the lighting on using their software.
---

---
Great question!
---
No it's not. It's a game whose servers were kept online for 15+ years despite there being absolutely 0 new content for the game.
---
Yet people are crying that Classic will die very quickly if there's no new content added.
---
Just push all realms to TBC Classic and open up a single Vanilla-only realm for the diehards that wouldn't play TBC in any case to transfer to and be ignored forever.
---
yeah, I thought leveling as prot is more fun than leveling as ret. but my memories of that are from the late 40s and up. Probably I was ret until then.
---
You didn't watch the other video did you?
---
Yeah I forgive you. Can you forgive me for being an autistic dirtbag? ♥
---
No Paladins were harmed in the making of this image... maybe.
---
Flying mounts aren't nearly as unpopular as you think. They even tried to remove them in WoD and the backlash was so harsh, they quickly made an achievement system that unlocked it even though the world wasn't really built for flying like Outland and Northrend were.
---
Fortunately you can’t be on two continents at once so it’s irrelevant.
---
You probably want to pick a class that you or the other person will enjoy playing at 60.   Yes, the journey to 60 is part of enjoying the game but eventually you reach 60 and then, hopefully, you can continue playing together and having fun.
---
48+ give honor to people who are already 60. That's why I listed that range and said it would suck to be in it during phase 2
---
Oh shit I have been had
---
Private servers won't ever go away I'm afraid, there is always going to be a crowd who want a different experience from what Blizzard supplies.=
---
Ive read less than 1 percent of players reached max rank during vanilla. It will be a small group for sure.
---
So... you are admitting that it's immersive after all? Thanks, that's all I needed.
---
Remindme! 40 days
---
It’s spelled incite
---
Stealth is probably a good idea, my M is missing a leg and the O is becoming a C as well.
---
I've been on the fence of whether I'd want Vanilla, TBC and Wrath servers or if I'd like Vanilla with improvements on it and I really feel like it'd just ruin vanilla adding onto what it already is so I'll stick with getting separate servers for the other 2 expansions.
---
IDK but I laughed
---
I gotta be honest with ya, playing BGs for 16 hours sounds like fun. I wish I could do it haha.
---
I already have
---
‘MUUUM! TOILET!’.

That episode is pure gold, then to think the creators thought people would hate it..

It’s disable permanently before world bosses exist.
---
Someone gets it every week.
---
This is some solid input.  I respecced according to your build and I agree, it's much more powerful.  I also agree about aoe grinding.  There just aren't going to be aoe grinding opportunities in classic.  Thanks for the reply.
---
I think you need to have righteousness up most of the time, and to be able to judge righteousness to generate a big lump of threat (in lieu of a taunt).
---
But you might be able to start with wisdom up and judge it on him right away, then put righteousness up and use it for the rest. I don't know if it's worth it (e.g. do you get more mana back than you spend?)
---
You could put blessing of wisdom on, I guess.
---
I think consecrate is important for a paladin tank -- I would start with 11 in holy (spiritual focus is good, so you can heal yourself while getting beat on if you have to (in the world, not so much in dungeons); then get consecrate) and then go into prot.
---
It'll be a long haul until you get your other threat abilities, though. I guess sanctuary at 41 and holy shield at 51. But then you should be in good shape. (Paladin is a long haul in any case, I guess!)
---
Not a single streamer in Oceania region.  
---
  
---
Yay !
---
Fortunately r/wow doesn't seem to allow as many shitty, low effort memes. The content over there is generally not great but that's more related to my personal issues with the game rather than what people post.
---
TBC requires Flying and it's not nearly as unpopular as you think. Also, transmog, achievements, and the dungeon finder with cross-realm and instant-teleport weren't a thing in TBC.
---
I feel like they'd charge for transferring a character from Classic to TBC.
---
AtlasLoot, some map and gathering things, some kind of bag addon, auction house, threat meter. Not too much else, going to avoid having too many
---
I think you're confused on how layering works.  The starting areas will still be a disaster as a layer allows a whole servers population in a zone...
---
Private servers aren't going to be able to come back when the new copyright laws in the EU (that the US is also being lobbied to sign) come into effect.
---
For sure. Shaman are my favorite class. Unfortunately they are Horde only and I hate the Horde.
---
I never had the oppoprtunity to play Vanilla. I would like to roll a healer in Classic. What are the best healers?
---
&gt; with itemization to make some off specs more viable
---
Don't limit it to Kara though. Introduce these types of items as dungeon blues and MC epics and stuff too. Doesn't have to have entire tier sets or anything, but make it so that a semi-casual raider can hodge-podge a moonkin set that might not be top DPS but allows him to carry his weight. 
---
It would be fun to think up all the stats/equip bonuses they could add that would make them viable but couldn't be cheesed by other classes or what-not. Not an easy task but I'd love to see them give it a go to shake things up after 2 years or so of classic.
---
Which ones are the ones to skip.? The none colored ones.!
---
Warrior arms does decent in pve and fury does decently in pvp, it's not that bad in either case, gear matters more in casual pvp and pve.
---
Should be doable.     
---
People will come if they can expect the PuG to actually clear MC - anyone that isn't okay with the reservation part won't bother, but there are always folks that just don't care.
---
So, the most difficult thing would be to find regulars and build a good reputation for your PuG group with them. You won't be able to carry a MC PuG alone simply because you're a tank.
---
If you have that core group though and a reputation that you regularly clear MC, you'd be totally fine with that plan.
---
Having said all that - it would be way easier to just find a guild and be main tank there.
---
Nope. I know people who had their name changed for having accents. It also just looks fucking stupid.
---
Reason #524 as to why mages are the best class.

I believe the ultimate solutions is to decide not to a give a fk. Two of my most played retail server are chock full of streamers and I think they are totally easy to completely ignore outside of the occasional steamer shitshow at dmf or similar. If people get all excited to latch on to a streamer, why should I care?
---
If you want an optimal PVP spec you are going to be extremely gimped in raid PvE as a Warrior. If you want an optimal raid PvE spec you are going to be extremely gimped in PvP.
---
For PvE you need Bloodthirst, for PvP you need Mortal Strike... You can't get both.
---
Man, wtf are these topics?? How is made-up custom funserver type of content as equally important as layering? Can you just leave the layering thread up as a sticky??
---
once you put them in, it's pretty impossible to get rid of them again. i'd prefer they just don't put them in in the first place next time ;)
---
same with dungeons; they made wrath heroics far too easy. that was a mistake; which they tried to rectify with cataclysm's heroics. people complained they were too hard and they ended up nerfing them to appease the wrath babies, who were the only ones still playing at that point, the hardcore people having unsubbed.
---
once the mistake is made, its hard or impossible to undo it. thats how wow fell; mistakes were made, sometimes because we asked for it, sometimes because activision made them, sometimes due to a slight change in game design philosophy, like 'bring the player not the class'. and once the mistake is made, that's it: the people you pissed off with the mistake have unsubbed. try to reverse it, and the people who are still subbed because they liked the mistake will unsub.
---
Your comment about reputation hits home to me.  I think your point is really good. Credibility is hyper-important when it comes to leading a consistent pug. I know a set schedule is important too but I hope I’ll be able to work around that.
---
Well if we get TBC Classic, which is FAR more likely than anything new, then it will certainly have flying.
---
That’s my biggest issue tbh. What if I reserve names on a dead server
---
&gt; My biggest concern is schedule, I’m committed to play a lot of hours each week but am unsure I can commit to specific(s) nights each week.
---
That's understandable. You might still want to check out the guild recruitment threads each Monday on here or try to find a guild on your server after launch with a schedule that might fit your needs. Certainly would make your life easier.
---
A good guild can easily clear MC within two hours, so that might be a factor to consider if you're unsure that you can commit a specific day each week.
---
&gt; IMO, 20 solid players can clear MC as long as the other half isn’t straight afk.
---
Absolutely. 20 solid players would probably be able to clear it even with the other half being AFK – though with some difficulty.
---
I'd like to see your numbers on that. Every server will have at least 40 hardcore raiders, I'd imagine 80 though. I'd take forever to get 80 warlords, much slower than the raiders are going to get gear.
---
The Classic enterprise isn't about learning from mistakes, especially when not everyone agrees they *were* mistakes - it's about giving players a near-identical experience compared to the past, warts and all.
---
hot
---
Play on a pve server issue fixed?
---
The best part of vanilla (especially pvp) was before BGs came out.
---
 Really?  Stupid zergs in Tarren mill?
---
Lol Peter Griffin is that you? Shallow and pedantic. That's not a bad word to describe these forums tho.
---
If you use scatter within 15-20 seconds of your freezing trap ending, then your scatter is going to be half duration. Yes, you can still use it to interrupt. But then your scatter will last 2 seconds and you basically can't freezing trap for the next 15-20 seconds, unless you want a very short freezing time and start the DR timer again. 
---
If you use it as an interrupt first, then go for the trap, your trap will be half duration but at least when it ends, you won't have anything to restart the timer again (except if you use sleep or helm) so you should be able to get a full trap when FD comes off cooldown (not really sure though cause apparently it's not a fixed 15 seconds window starting from CC end but more like a 15-20 seconds window).
---
Holy crap! Thank you! Just gave me something to do on this quiet Sunday night.
---
Where does it say that we can only reserve 3?
---
Lets say 1% of server pop is hardcore raiders.   Pop of 6000.   That means that there's 60 hardcore raiders on that server.  It took me a year of farming MC to get full tier 1 on my shaman.  A year is potentially 52 high warlords.
---
Pretty sure he played vanilla in real time lol. Not a fan or anything but I know he’s main’d druid for a long time.
---
They won't be able to actually gauge the amount of people who want to play. I have a feeling it is going to be underestimated. Only people with an active monthly subscription will be able to participate in the stress tests. I know what I'm about to say is empirical and therefor doesn't have the data to back it up, but I don't feel like it's an isolated case at all: I have many friends that will be playing Classic, but have absolutely no reason to be subscribed until then and therefor cannot participate in the stress tests.
---
Yes. These are the healing pants!
---
I vote rogue as well, specifically undead
---
!RemindMe 41 days
---
TLDR: how much does the human weapon skill really matter for warriors?
---
I’m playing alliance warrior. Very likely I’ll be playing protection at 60 and if I have enough gold, pvp with friends and family.  REALISTICALLY, how much will playing gnome impact my tanking ability.  I’m also curious about what theory crafters consider true impact of non human fury warriors. For this conversation let’s say I was not going to invest in +weapon skill gloves.
---
Most of the glowy gear can have that effect turned off, or set to different colors that would compliment your set up.
---
&gt;maybe the community could create some kind of "constitution" or something

---
My favorite part was always "Arcanite Reaper, Hoooo!", but this part is great too.
---
Lol no opportunity to backstab do you even rogue? Vanish/kidney or gouge if your not using deadly, cheapshot, and their are a ton of daggers one for every 9 level.
---
Im going to be spamming "invite me to asmon layer" so people think they are on a streamer server.
---
What do I want? Classic+ ... new level 60 content. Will we get it? Nah
---
To be honest I think blizz already has an idea of what their design philosophy would be for classic+ anyways because the classic wow project started off as "pristine realms" which were essential retail realms with classic design philosophy changes.
---
You will have to gather a group to form a core first.  At that point you've basically made a guild in all but name.
---
To go down the bullet points one by one:
---
1) Depends. If they did it in a Phase 7+ / 1.13+ manner, then absolutely. I'd be hyped as hell for that. But, if they did TBC Classic...
---
2) Heck no. I could go on and on as to why TBC just sounds like a bad idea...but I'll just leave it at that unless someone would like me to elaborate as to why. If they had to make TBC Classic, it would *have* to be separate, or there would be hell to pay, having seen and talked to a lot of people who vastly prefer Vanilla instead of TBC.
---
3/4) Oh yeah.
---
5) I mean, there are just so many dirsctions you can go in terms of new content. 2.0.1 added tons of great ideas that could be refined further for Phase 7 and beyond, even if Outland itself...didn't.
---
There's the Caverns of Time and Karazhan, which could easily be remade and would make up an entire phase of content by themselves, along with many of the great balance changes that 2.0.1 added. And there's way more beyond that which could be added. Theres tons of zones, dungeons, raids, and even a battleground that could be repurposed from unused concepts to great new content. Hyjal, Emerald Dream, Kezan, Grim Batol, Quel'thalas, the WC3 version of Outland, Uldum...hell, you could even add new races in the form of high elves and goblins. There is so much that the Classic team could do with post-Naxx content.
---
Decursive, I think.

no changes

Sure if that's your perspective you'd have more success on the official forums.  I'd rather have new discussion here than a never-ending bitch fest about layering.  We all know about it, we all know the pros and cons already.  Talking about it endlessly isn't going to solve anything here or change any of that.  No one cares that you still dislike layering the day after tomorrow.
---
9 levels seems like a pretty long upgrade path tbh.
---
Seriously. This thread is fkin bonkers. That time period in vanilla pre battlegrounds was by far the most authentic, and fun experience I've ever had in wow. If it were up to me it would be like a couple years before bgs we're introduced. Enjoy the world pvp while we have it. It is something special.
---
Reminds me of a funny moment from Cata.  
---
A new guy joined my raiding guild, introduced himself then instantly proclaimed that he did his whole rotation on his Razer mouse with heaps of buttons.
---
The GM instantly Gkicked him, we all had a good laugh.
---
&gt; but at least when it ends, you won't have anything to restart the timer again
---
In your mind NOT having something available to you is a benefit?
---
 Bruh I ain’t stepping back into classic I’ll be pulling some MJ moves with my night elf huntard
---
They will ask for help and [Kor Kron](https://www.korkron.com/) will come and defend them.
---
It all depends on your guild. I'm sure if you're cool and inform the raid leader that you're going to be passing on all healing gear and cloth to roll on your tier set or another BiS they'd be cool with it I'm sure. Again, all depends on your guild.
---
Because we actively choose not to engage there once we have Rewards for doing it in battlegrounds
---
Talking about it endlessly every day is actually the exact thing that could get it to change, lol. You should take your custom content ideas to the retail forums instead.
---
They won't remove all the layers and create a shitshow.
---
Dont let the character copy, have them completely separate just like any wow+ content would be separate. Make the museum people happy and keep the original promise as pristine as possible. There is no benefit besides people not wanting to level a new character to connect them as I see it and it really touches on the integrity of this rerelease to have most of not all of your server leave for TBC.   
---
It must have really felt lonely if you did not buy TBC in the beginning and having a copy to TBC servers would recreate that feeling even if not to the same level, as the original character will still be there.
---
Back in classic one of our guild officers (warlock) and a couple others got to GM island, I know not how, but they ported in have the guild. I went on a level 1 character I had just made and ended up leaving him there until Cats or so when I deleted him to make room in that server. 
---
I would occasionally log in and dick around. You could get inside a few of the walls in the basement. But there wasn't much to do. If you died there your ghost spawned in the barrens and you couldn't get back.
---
I thought this was pretty funny also.
---
Warrior gets groups easier when leveling allowing for more social play.
---
&gt; harassment and griefing on a pvp server
---
HA HA I'm about to burst dude!
---
Can I join your guild?
---
garrisons
---
Since Classic will be using the retail raid frames, you don't really need an addon for that. Unless you want one that does very specific things.
---
Many times when there is a calling for TBC servers or wow+ people sometime call for being able to copy a character to TBC. That is not really what they promised with this rerelease and if anything it should be entirely separate, no copying that is if they are to keep their original promise. If they rerelease TBC and/or add wow classic content it should be on new servers that has nothing to do with those that we get now.
---
Bindings are for the MT always. If you are running your own successful group, then this is a non-issue. The raid doesn't happen without you.
---
My original was a skinner/LW Druid.  I’ll probably do that again.  But I’ve been debating grabbing mining instead of LW until I hit 40 for the mount money.
---
How is that ridiculous? World boss fights were some of the most contested events on servers, having multiple world bosses in all of the layers would ruin that.
---
Yup. I foresee them making massive overhauls to retail to give us the Classic + that everyone wants. If Classic is a HUGE success, they’ll have 2-3 years to work on an expansion to try to capture the Classic numbers before they inevitably move to another game.
---
This isn’t azerite power. You can’t be “years behind”. People who dedicate time to the game will get good quick. Now THAT will be an eye opener for whoever thought training for a videogame by playing the bootleg version would give them a huge long-term advantage.

You're a part of the people that have given up and will accept anything Blizz throws at them. Layering isn't required at all. This is the guy claiming he's sick of reading up on layering so much. Solutions were brought up repeatedly. The same whining got Classic announced in the first place. The current president of Blizzard was clearly against it a year before that. How come that changed? Someone like you could've been standing in the crowd then and go "See, I told you it won't change, stop whining about legacy servers!". Just say you love layering, man, don't try to confuse people with that other nonsense.
---
Noted, unfortunatly can't be easily avoided.
---
But will improve my work in the future.
---
I agree. Just throwing some things you might see Blizzard do to copy Classic. I think retail is already too far gone though.
---
Glad you could see your mistakes.
---
Was sarcasm. They're more important than Kazzak.
---
Nelf hunter every time
---
I don't love layering, but I accept it as necessary.  You aren't providing a whole lot of value beyond the oft-repeated "layering bad, my idea good" without actually having an idea.  For the record, some of the more popular ideas I've seen around here are pretty fucking terrible.
---
If you find there are new things to say about layering (doubtful), make a new thread.  This isn't the place for that discussion.  There's nothing new to add.
---
Have you posted this feedback on the official forums so blizzard will see it?
---

They came with item additions in most cases.  Shows how much you know about the game you are criticizing.  They also revitalize the d2 economy preventing it from getting stale and driving players away as they "already have everything".  Even if, strictly speaking, it's not content, you don't really address the rest of the point I made.

Every game this year keeps diverting my attention.

Ahh the cycle of cancer, that takes me back. I camped people until the logged out or spirit ressed then camped them at the gy with res sickness, iv never played a pirated server and I intend on doing the exact same things as I did back in the day.
---
I'd /gkick this guy long before I had any issue with the ret paladin. Who you play with is far more important than what you play with.
---
Looks like that guy just killed Falcor.
---
Thank you
---
What?! Get outta here that's just crazy
---
Orc for sure. 25% EXTRA stun resist. You have an inherent 5%. An Orc has 30% chance to resist stuns baseline. Know what counts as a stun in Classic? Everything. Grenades, Bombs, magic effects like Hammer of Justice, Bash, Concussive Blow, Improved Concussive Shot, Warstomp, Intercept, Infernal Stun, Impact Stun, Blackout, Kidney and Cheap Shots, Tidal Charm
---
A flat out passive, permanent 30% chance to resist the overwhelming majority of hard-CC in the game
---
And PvP trinkets don't remove stuns. But ours removes Fears. Is logically Orc is BIS.
---
Downside: Orc looks so bad.

I have this mouse and it rocks. Games and productivity.
---
It's nice to see the correct answer.
---
All of the pertinent information exists on the default retail raid frames.  This was not the case in Vanilla.  The only reason to use a different raid frame in Classic is for aesthetic purposes.
---
I know, I know, but it just HAS to be done
---
In tbc, a rogue 5 manned main tanked Gruul
---
I really hope this toxic culture is not as prevalent in Classic. 
---
People should play what they want because they like the class, not because it is the best DPS, Tank, or Healer.
---
False. We don't need new solutions every other day to entertain you with. Just pick any of the top 3 and you're good to go. They're all no-brain but probably cost a little more than phasing us in and out randomly to manipulate the population numbers for that extra bit of $$ you can squeeze out of the hardware. And people like you being okay with it lets them do it. 
---
That's the same reason we're gonna have far less GM's and right-click reporting. Because it's some automated compromise that if people don't seem bothered by they will implement. You tolerate those compromises. To me, it takes away from the game's integrity. These things add up. If enough people express dissatisfaction with them, they will be more likely to remove them. So if you don't care personally, don't participate in discussions about them, simple.

at least 17 of the 20 people i know playing Classic are in the same position as your friends...

Yeah I deleted the thread because I realized it always triggers the GCD. It's just that if you're waiting for GCD you can shift out of it and it will restart the GCD. Really clunky. Thanks

Sarkoth gives ~500 total exp and is crucial for hitting 3 before leaving the den after handing in boars (level 3 being crucial because you really want first licks on sleeping peons while farming familiars so you can get the follow up pick quest)

Not a skip

In fact one of the most essential Durotar quests. (Sarkoth respawns quick on classic and has mobs to grind if theres downtime)

Thanks for the warning, bro.

Its not about the colors or lack thereof on your keyboard either though.  No reason to be condescending about people’s aesthetic preferences.
---
I played tons of rogues till I tried shaman in classic... oof
---
Yeah I see that, but he made a comparison that orcs will resist 6 times MORE stuns than any other race, if one race resists 5 as per your example then 25 stuns more to 30 is not 6 times more, it's 5.
---
I didn't mean it as a warning. There's nothing toxic about Chinglish. He's just a strong player with a good sense of humor.
---
Original question was this:
---
&gt;  was wondering if I could raid as enhance ?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Would a guild even consider having me? 
---
Telling him to go resto is off topic
---
The stock raidframes are *alright*. They aren't perfect or very customizable but they work with mouseover macros.
---
If you wanna stick to MOs and just wanna replace the frames, Grid2 is probably your best friend unless we're talking full UI replacements akin to ElvUI which is also decent.
---
If you want an all-in-one solution, things like Healbot, Vuhdo and similar addons work wonders as well. Used Healbot for years and loved it quite a lot, but I heard Vuhdo is a bit more customizable? Can't tell you about that.
---
Clique is also a thing - it basically provices more in-depth mouse over macros, combining it with Grid2 seems to be a popular combination. 
---
It's also a good idea to get a Threatmeter as should every class; don't be the silly goose and pull aggro off of your tank. Don't mindlessly heal people when they pull! Having actual numbers and bars to see your threat is really helpful.
---
Something that'll be less popular to recommend: Get a "Dps"meter like Details!. These can track not only DPS but also Healing, Overhealing, Deaths (and thus why they happened) and other, important metrics. Many only use em for DPS but they really provide decent feedback on how well you're doing, why certain things went wrong in fights and some more.
---
Do you think shaman is better?
---
Durotan died for this
---
No, dude, this is not how math works.
---
Jill makes $5 an hour, Jack makes six times more than Jill, how much does Jack make?
---
If you don't say $30 per hour, you need to go back to elementary school
---
I see, well I've seen what happened with classic EQ servers being "multi-box-power-gamed".  Friend was playing on a EQ classic server for more than a year and showed me how some of the world shared content was completely snuffed out by the guilds that lock it down the minute it respawns.  EQ has way more world shared content though.  
---
I know WoW made Kazzak and Azuregos spawn on slightly variable times to stop this behavior, because back during vanilla I use to camp a lvl 1 over at Kazzak to check for him from time to time.  This time around I think everyone will be doing stuff like this.  I mean WoW exploded after vanilla and it's possible classic wow will have more players than original vanilla on day 1.  I'm sure certain world based aspects of the game will feel much different than original vanilla release did, especially because of the known farming value certain parts have.
---
Just wanted to know if Blizz had any plans to deal with this style of stuff, and I guess the layering is one of those things.
---
Smh
---
/spit
---
Lmao at the people nitpicking this. I can understand not having alliance icons on a horde logo but every other complaint is just obnoxious. Good work bud.
---
&gt;I hope they keep this in the game.
---
They removed it in Classic and the recently released retail patch 8.2 unfortunately.
---
shaman is better if hunters know how to sh-it on rogues with good flares in pvp.
---
I FORGOT ABOUT THE RAGE POTION!! I was already planning on being Herb / Alch on my warrior but I'm going to pump these baby's out for tanking.
---
TBC would need to be a separate server with character copy. If they roll the Classic servers to TBC then we are right back where we started.
---
It's also fairly pointless for any class that can equip Staves.
---
What part of

&gt;I'm not interested in tanking raids as I’ll switch to holy. But for levelling and 5 mans I plan to give it a go as I love the class fantasy.

If I play immediately on launch, I'll level a hunter and use the method to get Lesser/Greater Magic Wand. Once I have those, I'll switch to Mage and go to Teldrassil and do every possible Darnassus rep quest.

Won’t use any for my whole leaving experience. At 60. Probably just a damage and threat meter, maybe get a ui one

Where was this?
---
Go play a hunter. There is no arms PvE spec. The only 2h PvE spec is 2H fury and it is only truly competitive as a horde warrior.
---
If you want to go big, just run dual wield fury like swifty did in his 1v1 duel videos.
---
Ktm and bigwigs (DBM) are needed for raiding

---
If I go with horde it'll be a troll. I love their lore and they have the right aesthetic for a survivalist. Plus their racial is amazing for DPS.
---
If I go with alliance then I might do a dwarf. Something about being as tough as the stones themselves is pretty appealing.
---
🧐hmm, yes. Shallow and pedantic.
---
And both of those are far more forgiving than mammothly long DND campaigns. You die once, oftentimes all together and quickly. Game over.

What’s your point?

should be, haha very very good at gold making.   Nearing 7 million currently.
---
I'm playing on K3 right now, theres an entire Horde guild dedicated to ganking lvl 20s in Redridge. That being said I also played vanilla WoW and it was definitely a thing back then too.  Sorry but I just gotta say it, if you can't stand it then you need to play on PvE servers
---
I'm talking for the twink levels theirs always a knife that will be at the end of the 9 path the 19 bracket has the assassins blades which will out shine any sword till about 24 just because the stats are mental.
---
That’s so cool!
---
This is true. But I jizz my pants with Halo I guess
---
I use the same method to heal everything, even stuff not in my party in a BG/raid.  I either mouse over a frame or someone in the world and use the same actions.
---
Neither will be ported to Classic.
---
Same. Next weekend I’m going to the Halo Outpost convention in  Philadelphia

B. Except they don't consider it unfortunate because also D.

I found this [guide](https://youtu.be/UNHSOBkCYBk) helpful.

Just google it man the wording you should have used is orcs resist 6 times as many stuns as other races plain and simple, not my fault you  think this is only about maths dropkick
---
I love layering Hah.
---
Definitely C
---
You need to be a bit special to think people were better at wow 15 years ago... Also Modern WoW tactics are far more complex than in vanilla.
---
Raids will be steamrolled as quickly as gear allows it, the skill level is much higher, and all tactics are already known.
---
IDK man a lot of people play on a few pservers for a long time in both vanilla and wrath.
---
As opposed to the idiots that think vanilla raiding was harder than modern raiding?
---
Bring extra pants
---
Shamans come just below Warlocks for me. Whether or not I play one will probably depend on whether my guild decides to go horde or alliance.
---
Will TSM be available for Classic?  I used it when I used to play retail and is by far one of the most useful addons I have ever had.
---
I like the copy idea a lot. For sure within like a few months most Classic servers will need to be merged, full transfers, or linked.  But for sure many classic servers will stay alive if you allow the people who want to keep pvping, leveling alts, staying in classic migrate to larger servers.
---
The sith were always the good guys.
---
He's one of those.
---
Probably a dumb question but, Does this replace the ui for all characters or can it be set to only replace it for a certain one? For instance if I wanted to use this for my UD char and the Elfwood one you previously link for my Druid?
---
When you go from one continent to another, what happens?  You get a loading screen.   Guess what you are loading.

Same

It was always my opinion since BC was first announced that they were rushing the new expansion because vanilla was way more popular than they thought it would be.  They had lots of content still unused, and lots of guilds were just getting into naxx when BC release date was announced.  
---
I would like to see a longer vanilla that could have been if BC wasn't pushed so soon.
---
It depends on your level and professions, check out frostadamus on youtube he has made some videos on where to grind mobs for gold in classic.
---
Slower, but not necessarily more miserable. You basically treat ever mob like you're ganking them, which is something you can do to relieve boredom when leveling combat specs as well (useful when watching your HP).

Careful not to cut someone with that edge.
---
Pvp feral sucks. They won’t have changed the hit box bug, and you do low burst, have no cool downs, no slows, your pvp gear is kind of everything focused and it’s a pain to get enough hit. Resto pvp is great, flag running is a blast. 8/12/31 is the way to go. 
---
Priest is super fun, you haven’t lived until you hide behind a tree and mana burn the other healer oom. And you are the best 1v1 class, you can main heal, or support and heal, or dps and heal or just kill stuff and outclass Druids in pve and have more gear options. 
---
Druid can stealth with a rogue and flag carry priest is better in every other department.
---
All white items have some use. Let the AH be your guide or wowhead when you encounter said white items
---
just wanna say ty to all the tesponses they are all appreciated
---
I think you would keep a good number, but not that much.
---
Doesn't mean it should.

They've said most likely, but not at launch.

I really don't know much about LuA but maybe your wouldn't need a whole addon. Maybe this could be made using weak auras? Ask the guys on the weakauras discord

I think you can just disable i to be fair. Faster ground mounts, instead of flying teleports/stairs up to a few locations.
---
lol, man I really need to watch the south park wow episode again, it's been too long
---
The only issue with a Fury build is that while yes it isn’t “terrible” in PVP like prot, the main issue is the reason people bring warriors is to slap healing debuffs on people to bring them down. 
---
If you’re going to PVP just in world pvp and AV the the absence of it is fine. But premade vs premade WSG could become a struggle without MS debuff. 
---
That’s the real dilemma of a warrior and why a lot of us will end up paying 100G per week to raid/PvP.
---
#\#nochanges
---
It doesn't require flying.
---
aren't there a couple of neutral goblins in duskwood or were those expansion additions?
---
1.13 ALL THE WAY
---
TBC killed Azeroth! It killed world pvp! It's NOT the spiritual successor to Vanilla. Vanilla deserves new content that builds WITHIN THE WORLD we learned to love.
---
That said, I have NO PROBLEM if TBC gets a rerelease. But it needs to happen LONG AFTER Naxx and Phase 6 has been out. Back in vanilla, TBC came out WAYYY too quickly. Barely anyone had gotten a chance to kill KT before Blizzard rushed out a brand new, world-destroying expac. That kind of cannabalistic release schedule cannot happen again.
---
I think it should be something new not a rehash, as we know they plan on releasing classic TBC. Going from kara to kara seem unwise.
---
There are literally areas in TBC you can't reach without flying.
---
Nahh just copy the servers and progress one as TBC what you got is what you got.
---
LUF is the bee's knees. I've tried Grid, tried VuhDo. Nothing beats LUF. It has raid wide healing prediction, incoming damage prediction, aura &amp; buff tracker, pet frames, mouseover/clique support... I can't go back to low tech frames after using LUF for years.
---
I've heard that fresh TBC servers aren't viable. I wouldn't want to purposely damage a TBC server.
---
But if you allow copying over it's just as cannabalistic as transfers. The end result is the same, history repeating itself. The Vanilla world dies.
---
&gt; After Naxxramas is released, do you want any other content released?
---
A lot of folks push for post-naxx content that are sidegrades to existing naxx gear. While that idea is somewhat interesting, I don't think it holds out for the long term. I'd think folks would not feel the same motivation to wipe night after night for a sidegrade.
---
Talking more about power creep/power differentials: they aren't necessarily bad. Becoming more powerful is what makes an RPG...an RPG. On one hand, it feels cool to walk around BGs in naxx gear, or destroy PVE content. But on the other hand, if you never reset everyone to the same level, then a certain small group will dominate PVP and PVE simply because they've been around the longest. Retail wow probably resets everyone to the same level too often, but a time-infinite vanilla wow experiences with 10 tiers of raiding is probably too hard for a newbie to break into.
---
I guess my answer is: not really. I'd only be interested in post-naxx content if it were upgraded gear. But then, we are looking at 5+ tiers of raid content. New players won't bother or will skip over multiple tiers, cheapening the experience. I'm not interested in side-grade gear post-naxx.
---
&gt; Do you want TBC: Classic released? Would you want the current Vanilla "Classic" to remain separate?
---
Yes to TBC: Classic. Great game. Classic should remain and be separate. 
---
If and when TBC:Classic comes out, many folks will stop playing classic vanilla though. Server merges may be required. I still think that's a lesser evil than taking classic away from players AGAIN. 
---
One interesting thought - folks seem to like fresh servers/server resets. There might be a way to incorporate that with the release of CTBC somehow.
---
&gt; Would you want new content released, splitting away from TBC, essentially making an "alternate" WoW timeline/expansion series?
---
Maybe, but I think TBC got way more right than it did wrong. I'd be OK with it released as-is. It would be great, actually. That said, I'd also be OK with a 're-do' of TBC (re-use content, but restructure systems that create problems, like flying).
---
&gt; Would you be interested in content based on existing Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdom zones (Hyjal, Caverns of Time, etc)?
---
This would be super cool to do if wow classic split off into its own timeline, yes.
---
&gt; Would you be interested in new content that doesn't raise the level cap and/or doesn't increase stats on gear, therefore just being new content for the sake of having new zones/dungeons/quests to explore with minimal stat advancement?
---
Nah.
---
Its hard to say exactly what I want. There are so, so many directions Blizzard can take with this. I think its foolish to throw all of TBC and WOTLK away. But it might also be foolish to use **all** of these expansion's ideas (esp WOTLK) again.
---
Honestly, just get into the habit of mailing all the white items to a bank alt. You will quickly pick up what sells on the AH and what doesn't.
---
There is also a quest in Loch Modan that sends you into the Badlands for herbs iirc, it ends up letting Alliance alchemists get the faction only [https://www.wowhead.com/item=9030/restorative-potion](https://www.wowhead.com/item=9030/restorative-potion)  
---
careful though since if you drop alchemy you can't relearn that potion again.
---
Maybe you should work on your reading comprehension.
---
&gt; Everyone else will see what you're actually wearing
---
I'm not advocating for retail transmog. God, you #nochangers are fucking idiots...
---
Just run sword
---
They're definitely not. 
---
Also note that multiple layers means more players meaning the resource to player ratio should be normal enough not to worry about.
---
If you're worried about single players abusing layering to gather extra resources it's hardly a short term problem worth crying over, the mega-nerds will always find a way to be on top.
---
I would also be surprised if there isn't some kind of layer-phasing cooldown implemented that stops players from jumping layers frequently.
---
Fury PVP isn't that bad. With good gear you could wipe some faces up. I destroyed BG's with raid gear and a fury build. IMP intercept deep in the Fury tree is nice. Deathwish+Recklessness is a blast (mind you only once every 30 minutes.)
---
My reasoning going back to my first post was that the game is already easy, so you are complaining about a difficulty difference that won't give you what you want, a more challenging game. Now you could argue "but the talents make it easier, therefore therefore therefore". But even without those talents it's still going to be a cakewalk, guilds are planning to kill Ragnaros within 2 weeks time, do you honestly believe the margins are so close that those talents will make up the difference? If that were true then the game WITH those talents would feel very difficult. It's math. You can't go from easy mode to hard mode in a game like this based on marginal increases in dps/hps/etc, you have to add complexity like the raid tiers after MC.
---
&gt; Kara was obviously the next stop after Naxx. I think it should be a 20 man raid that that tier 3 was missing, with boss difficulty/item drops of around BWL to AQ levels, with smaller 3 to 5 piece sets with bonuses tailored to the meme specs. I think another 5 man dungeon would also be in order, with a variety of Vanilla style itemized (i.e. wacky stats and fun effects) that just sort of spice up the gearing meta without nullifying the previous preBIS process. Lvl 60 class quests for all classes, maybe even one for each spec, would be a great way to add fresh fun and gear without tipping the power curve. More relics/totems/librams in general. More OH items for feral druids and hybrid 1h pally/shammy.
---
Yeah, this would be very fun.
---
Check this out: https://discord.gg/KpxxuNT
---
This is the link for the classic druid discord. It's run by the big name guide writers (Taladril, Shendo, etc) and is a highly detailed repository of information. They have a bunch of the most common specs listed in the FAQs and guides channels, as well as gear lists, video guides, and other nifty things available. 
---
What everyone else said is right though. No resto talents required to level. The best hybrid spec is the 0/30/21 "HOTW" spec. When I level my druid, I plan on going feral until 23, dropping 5 points into furor in the resto tree, then finishing off through HOTW. Then, depending on how much tanking, healing, or PvP I've been doing, I'm going to either finish off the hotw build, or I'm going 14/32/5 if I've been tanking at all commonly. 
---
Just my 2¢.
---
&gt; I loved BC as my favorite expansion ever, but you can't release Classic BC without shutting down Classic Vanilla, or else the populations will split and hurt both. There for I think we shouldn't have expansions.
---
This man speaks the truth.
---
As another commented posted, a general rule of thumb in PvE for raw healing is somethibg like Paladin/Priest &gt; Shaman &gt; Druid.
---
As for PvP, each class has different kinds of utility. IMO finding a class utility options that fit the way you want to play the game is the way to go.
---
Druids make great flag carriers. They're pretty durable and very mobile. Entangling roots and nature's grasp are great. Bash and feral charge give you a good amount of control over a fight.
---
Priests are able to dispel magic effects on allies and enemies - the only class that can dispel magic effects on allies for horde, and those are very common. You have mana burn. You can also use power infusion to synergize with mages and warlocks.
---
Shaman's windfury pairs well with rogues and warriors. Grounding and Earthbind totem give you a ton of control in both solo and group pvp. They also have a tooon of burst potential as well as a slow from frost shock and an interrupt from earth shock.
---
Paladins just have so many options. Cleanse, blessing of freedom, blessing of protection, hammer of justice, etc. Make paladins a very desirable addition to any group. They're just very tedious to level.
---
&gt;once the mistake is made, its hard or impossible to undo it. 
---
yup. that's why i always say TBC was when they jumped the shark. once you jump it, you can't go back.
---
Sure, but more infrequent than swords.

Why does it *need* twelve thousand to be viable? Seems like a poor word choice given actual vanilla server pops.....
---
I think it would be interesting to have the main focus be tier sets in the post-Naxx raids. Alot of specs didn't get represented by T3 that well, and making some OP tier set bonuses doesn't powercreep stats as much as it powercreeps tier bonus- which is the whole point of tier!
---
Name res requires server......

Any decent mechanical keyboard fits the bill, vortex is a pretty popular brand (pok3r, race 3), or ducky, but there's lots of options out there.  Personally I use the vortex race 3 tkl (https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=3917), some pictures have the color key caps in but it ships with the default grey... the color ones come in a little bag and you can swap them in if you prefer.  For mice, zowie fk1 looks pretty pretty solid, and not like a gamer-tool.  Those are the two I use, and they don't look "razer mountain dew" at all, but there are other options out there if you just look around a bit.
---
Jesus christ vr wow. I'd never leave the house again. What would casting spells be like. Place the cast bar somewhere on your screen and poke abilities with one hand and aim in the other?
---
Do you have a source for that? I recall him talking about starting zones being a consideration for why to use layering but not that it was limited to starting zones.
---
A trivial amount in the grand scheme.  Though I tend to disable them anyways.
---
More Def = higher chance for revenge to proc naturally, without spending more rage on shield block. Less rage spent on shield block means more rage for sunder and shield slam (if you have it)
---
Plus the idea of tanking with zero defensive gear assumes that you have a top notch healer.
---
The bottom line is you should adjust your gear based on how hard you're being beaten up by mobs. There's a balance to find between threat and defensive gear.
---
Hunters literally just lost their ace in the hole ^^

Calm down it was a mistake.

Anyone on the beta was able to test how the engineering MC helmet works? Do you need:
---
1/ To be out of combat yourself
---
2/ Your target to be out of combat
---
3/ Or both?
---
There are a lot of great PVP talents in the combat tree, like Improved Gouge, Improved Kick and Improved Sprint, so it's not 100% cut and dried. Still I prefer mostly subtlety.
---
What is this screenshot, out of curiosity? Something from a dev build back on retail?
---
That's an Orc, friend.
---
Takes a lot for learning and setup though.  Only really recommend if you are a huge AH person.  I've used it for basic stuff like posting and getting prices but honestly it's overkill for just that.

haha

I'm going to run to the Barrens and start Chuck Norris jokes.

Same here, but I might be able to squeeze into a US East server and raid up to midnight in that timezone before leaving for work.  
---
Gonna suck swapping my sleep schedule to sleeping when I get home though.

"Laughs while invincible"
---
There most likely will be. You should look for one now and roll on their server at launch
---
That's armor type specific. Mail doesn't get any quest shoulders (dungeon or otherwise), until the the late 20's as horde and the mid 30's, as alliance. but you can get [crafted shoulders at 20.](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3481)
---
Trey gets incredibly worried that every episode of south park will be the last. He said in a doc about them that he fears the fans will hate and completely reject the new episode (at the time).
---
Because everyone will be geared out in full naxx bis 3 weeks after launch and the rest of the game before that doesn't matter. 
---
At least according to this sub.
---
Yeah the social aspect of it was great. In my situation, I had a strong support group of friends and family in these tough time, as well as a hobby that I was passionate about. WoW was an addition to these things which helped support me in these times. Just wanna clear it up that I didn't block out bad memories with a video game and then bottle them up and never address them. Thankfully it isn't like that.
---
I'd like to see a source for that as well.
---
Sapper charges are great for PvE.
---
For tanking daggers have best threat until thunderfury which 99% wont get.  For pvp weapon skill does nothing.  Now if you want to pve and dont want to get edgemasters your talking 10%+ less damage vs bosses.  Weapon skill is hard to come by for warrios and 305 is huge compared to 300.  It doesnt matter much vs trash or normal dungeons.  63/skull bosses is where you need it.
---
Shman and druid are equal in healing vanilla. A good player with skill can take a druid and out heal a shaman but it requires skill. A bad player will suck equally whether druid or shaman. Priest in pve has always been top dog healing with holy palsy second.
---
depends on your style of healing and what works for you.
---
Back when I played retail I used the following
---
Unit Frames/Raid Frames: Gird is the best but the default ones from ElvUi are Fine   
---
Click to Cast: I used clique but a lot of people like to use mouseover macros   
---
Damage meters: get one that also tracks heals (most of them do) Details! and Skada are some examples
---
Boss Mods: DeadlyBossMods and 
---
Aura addons: Weak auras let you track procs and cooldowns
---
and I think  most unit frames let you track it but if not get something that tracks your 5 seconds rule
---
Others have mentioned things like using LOS on ranged mobs and using marking.
---
But I will pick up on one thing you said:
---
&gt; Heroic strike shouldnt be used at all unless you are generating rage faster then you are able to spend it with Sunder
---
Actually no, not even then! Assuming a pull ends where no mobs were beating up the healer or smacking the dps too much, then finishing up with 100 rage is far greater than finishing up with 0. Pool your rage tanks! Save bloodrage for the downtime when your healer is drinking to delay the rage decay. Having 50+ rage going into a pull means you can establish aggro much faster and your DPS can be a bit more aggressive. Being more aggressive means the mobs die faster, which means the healer uses less mana, which means you have to wait less between pulls, which means you can pool more rage.... you get the idea.
---
The other thing I like to do is do an initial sunder/revenge on skull, and switch over to beating up X, as soon as skull turns to the rogue, I taunt (If your #1 dps is a ranged, then position yourself so the skull has to walk by you to reach them). By the time taunt wears off it's pretty much dead. Now the DPS can go ham on X without much fear of pulling aggro. If you can get this technique right you can save lots of rage. The idea of saving taunt for emergencies is only sensible when you're still learning the basics of tanking or you're with terrible pugs.
---
The bottom line is that you should be aiming to cause just enough threat to keep the mobs on you, and no more. Burning rage on mobs that you have a big threat lead on is just a waste.
---
Night elfs have best threat until thunderfury and have increased dodge.
---
No, it won't be uncommon to see and it goes against preserving the game's authenticity, therefore it is a logical argument against it. However, "the nerds are gonna have lots of gold anyway, let them abuse it" remains an illogical argument. 
---
My point in relation to Kazzak was that they used it as a distraction from the impact of having layering present even for a few weeks, as if thorium, black lotus, devilsaur aren't valuable enough. I wouldn't rather see one or the other being abused, I'd rather see neither being abused by getting rid of layering altogether.
---
None of the good solutions to layering involved long queue times or any of what you wrote. It's funny how you bring up the potential negative effects on the economy after being in support of allowing the "nerds" to free farm multiple layers worth of devilsaur for weeks. Maybe read up a little more on what people are suggesting or try to form your own suggestion before you rush to conclusions.
---
Haha that's good. I do know that I had a fairly similar experience with a guild in classic, but a way better experience on private servers. I don't know if it was my age, or the game being new or something. I'm looking forward to being in a great guild full of dudes I know, this time around. Should be an awesome time in August. I honestly think it's going to be even better than original classic man. At least in some ways.
---
If looking for healing and not utility don't pick druid because they are the worst healers.
---
I have the same idea! Im excited to run around mining nodes and getting upgrades on my gnome mage. The thing im still tossing up is PvE or PvP.. I feel like PvE will be a more relaxing experience
---
Dang coming above 100 is impressive!
---
Even though we're all familiar with the game play and it'll be easier this time around, what's really important to me is that community. It'll be great getting that back. I'm glad you're stoked on it, I'm still convincing more friends IRL to check it out. It's a great way to spend time with IRL friends that are across the country.
---
just use the free 3 days on the 24th you're subbed :)
---
Assuming this is Illegal Danish. Gosh, haven't seen these videos for years. Look what's coming out of the woodwork...
---
Hemo is very solid too since you typically have 10 melee.
---
“Headset on, World off”! I’m truly sorry you went through all this but I am glad you are able to pull some positives from it! Nothing better than zoning into Azeroth after a bad day.

I'm pretty sure September 11, 2001 is the beginning of the new world
---
I love all you people so much right now
---
Well for one, it would probably get them more subscribers if they told their fan base that GMs would make appearances.
---
And blizzard loves money.
---
Negative impacts to the economy that are negligible to the average player, is my point. I'm not gonna throw a fit over the state of the market for a short period after launch.
---
Idk why you expect me to give you suggestions that's not what I'm here for, that's what you were supposed to be doing, but you didn't. You just claim these mystery solutions don't come with the things that I listed... So, what's the magical fix then?
---
Explain druid then
---
Thanks for sharing this and sorry for your loss man. Just my two cents: The cool part about picking games up when you're older is all the things you appreciate as an adult that you didnt as a kid. It makes you appreciate how you view the world differently, in a virtual setting.  Given this, you'll play differently and therefore get a different experience. So game on, brother, and enjoy!
---
Never played the original wow as a kid so itll be all new to me! Excited...
---
This is a really good idea. Thanks
---
In the outside world, he's just a simple geologist.

You forgot the best one:
---
3) log off, log in with your bank alts and sort out your mailboxes / auctions. by the time you are done with  that the camper has moved on and you can go back with your playing character and your time has been well spend, while the ganker was wasting his time.  a double win for you
---
One of my favorites too. I actually found a new way there back in vanilla which I hadn't seen anyone else done before: I walljumped all the way to the top in the last room where the ship is. It took crazy long but eventually I just ended up on top of like a mountain and jumped down with slow fall

That was Lore's response after the initial backlash - it CLEARLY states that the starting zones' spawns were a major concern. Further down, it CLEARLY promises no phasing or cross-realm zones. That's EXACTLY what layering is. Layering goes directly against that promise right there. This was it, the big blue post at the time. They left it on that note up until layering was announced after the secret media circle jerk meeting. 
---
(Notice using Kazzak again as an excuse to keep it going all the way until phase 2, as if there's nothing worth to contest in phase 1)
---
*"However, realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable* ***when hundreds of players are  swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs****."*
---
Disguising sharding as a tool to help players move out of the starting zone. An alternative to dynamic respawns which pservers tried and people abused to the point where they'd sit on top of a pig and kill it repeatedly rather than move and quest. So I bought that, thinking it's a solution for the starting zones, such as Durotar. Turns out they just wanna monkey us around and juggle players back and forth to achieve higher efficiency out of their servers and it has nothing to do with people getting out of the 1-6 zerg at all. Pretty much exactly what current retail WoW is with phasing. 
---
I'll just do your research from now on in the future, pal, you're welcome.
---
I hope you mean the *new* default raid frames and not the ones from actual Vanilla that are so bad Blizzard never once thought of bringing them back for Classic.
---
Grid shows you indicators far more advanced than just debuffs and buffs, plus mana bars, distance, direction, incoming heals, enemy targeting, etc - all in the smallest most efficient way possible.
---
I've run into other people that didn't or don't like Grid, but when I ask them how much they configured it, most don't even know half of what it's capable of.
---
They announced it a few weeks ago.
---
Within the world is right! Things have become so disjointed, retail WoW is just a lobby game now sadly. Keep new content on Azeroth as we know it! MAGA!!!
---
A lot of stores still carry old battle chests. Heck, my GameStop still had a Cataclysm box on the shelved last I checked
---
Rush to 60 &amp; kill ragnaros

Are rocket boots a thing in vanilla or were they introeuced in tbc/wotlk? With the speed buff of rocket boots you were able to fly to gm island with slow fall, from the end of the sea behind Teldrassil.
---
Is right click reporting a thing people are complaining about?
---
It's going to be the 60 set, anyone stating otherwise hasn't paid attention, gear isn't being modified, they are being released in their "final" form. Spirit of Aquamentis or w.e the offhand is won't reduce spell cost by 25 flat mana, etc.
---
I believe in the Classic+ route.
---
Releasing expansions TBC/wrath etc is probably going to happen at one point down the line as separate servers etc but although I do think that would be the safe choice I still believe that Classic+ would really be amazing.
---
My idea of Classic+ would be something along the lines of: 
---
the obvious introduction of new content, adapting concepts such as rep farming and daily quests (excellent features from TBC) with maintaining the same level cap. Introduction of new dungeons that at the difficulity level of a herioc dungeon in TBC. As this will follow the vanilla design philosophy then it can be kept very hard but accessible (think scholomance but twice as hard?). A talent rework.. I know you are all frowning at this but what is even the point of keeping trees such as balance, feral, prot pally (just a taunt?), enhancement shaman etc.. so uselss? I understand that part of the magic of Classic is to stay the exact same but this is Classic+.
---
Obviously as anything the ideas that I just mentioned above for Classic+ are unrefined and from the top of my head so it is not at the best version it can be. but my philiosophy is that we should be adapting some of the features that was introduced in TBC in a way that matches classic design (no arena, no big talent overhauls, no flying, no change in stats, expertise, resilience etc..)
---
I want the best for the game and not change it to be another modern WoW type of thing.. What do you think of my ideas? would that be a healthy thing for the game?
---
I would rather 12AM personally. Right after everyone gets home from work/school means the server is gonna be extremely packed. They are essentially releasing the game at peak hours lol.
---
Lokhtos Darkbargainer  in BRD sells a lot of raid-their crafting items. Along with the recipe for the Sulfuron Hammer.
---
Someone told me you could MC him to trade in vanilla, but I’m not sure if that’s true. 
---
The only way I’m familiar with is grinding Thorium Brotherhood rep. As I’m fairly certain he only sells specific recipes at different reputation levels.

Gruul killed with a rogue tank in TBC: [https://www.engadget.com/2008/05/20/the-tanking-rogue-strikes-again-5-mans-gruul/](https://www.engadget.com/2008/05/20/the-tanking-rogue-strikes-again-5-mans-gruul/)

---
Hybrids are supposed to be worse in any single role than a pure. Rogue tanks could be better. I think rogues should be able to tank — for the duration of Evasion. (Which means not getting one-shot if a boss manages to hit.)
---
But rogues aren't typically thought of as a hybrid class, or having a hybrid playstyle. (Someone made a 31-point talent tree for rogues in classic WoW that was focused on bandages, but obviously it was never implemented in the game.) For actual hybrids, stats got better in WotLK. I think that was when crit and hit ratings were merged for physical vs spell. At some point, the difference between +spelldamage and +healing was reduced, and finally eliminated.
---
That gave healers a bit more versatility, even if it not let people be hybrid with talents. The damage-version of Vengeance (I think there was another version after?) gave tanks a little bit more versatility, though that was eventually removed along with most tanking stats — which one might think would encourage players to be hybrid. (I am not sure it did.)
---
A good, but long, explanation of why WoW couldn't have hybrid tanks: [http://daughterofankh.blogspot.com/2010/03/evolution-of-tanking-towards-cataclysm.html](http://daughterofankh.blogspot.com/2010/03/evolution-of-tanking-towards-cataclysm.html)
---
The title is a pun, or play on words; basically, predictable threat mechanics result in threat becoming unimportant in a game, and possibly forcing large, dramatic changes to tanking.
---
One of the challenges for Blizzard was the powerful talents in the middle of the trees, like 21-point talents. It threatened to make everyone cookie-cutter. Like being able to get Death Wish (+20% damage cooldown) and Mortal Strike. A "hybrid spec" should not be thought of as the one that picks the best talents from all the trees (like dagger rogues did in classic), but rather one that sacrifices effectiveness in predictable fights with predictable role for players, for greater effectiveness when things go wrong in a fight.
---
\&gt;if the max level is 80, the strongest talent should be around 50
---
And when you have 30 more talent points after three more expansions?
---
Talents are more of a choice when they aren't directly comparable; when you can't say one talent is better than another because they're for different things, not just "higher dps". For classic WoW, is Presence of Mind a better talent or a worse talent for a frost mage than Ice Barrier?
---
While I consider WoW to have gotten worse over time (without having played the later versions), I don't think changes to talents are much of the reason. Things like more instant-cast abilities, and out-of-control mana efficiency, were more important. (Changing mounts to a 1.5 sec cast affected thngs like instanced PvP; but was this change made because druids to change to +280% speed flight form instantly? Compared to base +40% travel form in classic.)
---
Mostly they burst on alliance side cause no ele, horde side they focus on curses and dispel with felhunter cause no pally dispels.

Of all the Rogue specs for PVP, I'd rate Combat somewhere around 5th place.
---
1. CB + Prep Daggers
---
2. Seal Fate Daggers (with Vigor if you have the Nightslayer set)
---
3. CB+Hemo Swords
---
4. Premed Daggers
---
5. Combat Swords/Daggers
---
7. Seal Fate Combat Swords
---
8. Hemo Premed Swords
---
I’m curious if the game is going to feel broken with naxx gear too. 
---
I wonder if you put freshly capped players vs those in pure BIS side by side for every xpac, which would have the biggest power level gap. My hunch is vanilla but I’m not sure.
---
You definitely can't read. It's me ending my post quoting you stating what the game is about, determining what's fun for others.
---
If you're unable to even understand that, of course you will think that I'm arguing to prove my superiority. I don't have to look into anything because it's not true. I understand and respect all ways of playing and enjoying this game.
---
That will depend on market research later on, I imagine.
---
But you should not expect a static Classic to stay popular forever. Eventually most will drift away unless there is some kind of new content or patching or updating or something.
---
So it's not like you have the choice between splitting the player base with TBC or having a viable vanilla Classic that lasts forever. The player base as a whole with either move on to TBC or move on to other games.
---
"PvPer's will have a secret blood pact to never attack each other and just camp the opposite faction's lvl 48 players regardless of the fact that if one single 60 decides to kill other 60s they will be getting a huge lead on honor which forces everyone else to do the same thing, not to mention the 60s who go after other 60s will be where the 48s are thus protecting them, and even giving the 48's a piece of the honor"
---
2 lvl 48 hunters, rogues, warriors, or any 1 of those with a healer kills a 60 mage outright for starters, depending on the level of potato involved.
---
What is the best Spec for prot paladin to make it work? (Specificially, for low level dungeons and even Strath at higher levels).
---
Who can run away from a druid? if anything it is the druid that can run away from anyone.
---
Just the ones who care about the game, don't worry about it. 
---
So what custom content would you like to see after Naxx in your own version of WoW? :)
---
When will be the next stress test and will every one have access (even without a subscription)?
---
The default ui has no threat tracking. In vanilla tanks do not generate a lot of threat. As dps assuming you are not a shit player and or significantly less geared than the tank you will be easily able to pull off the tank. Pulling off the tank will result in a wipe 9 times out of 10. No guild out there will let you wipe raids a dozen times a night just because you don't want to download a threat meter.
---
Not putting a threat meter in the default ui was a big oversight IMO. I don't see how vael is even possible without one.
---
Development will ALWAYS shift where the money is. Blizzard will absolutely do whatever they have to do to make money from Classic if the audiance is big enough.. for better or worse they will either go for the route of what the Classic playerbase want or just the route of their own which always ends up badly.
---
EU #1
---
Point one: that’s your opinion. Others love world PvP and know that BGs will kill it off to an extent.
---
Point two: balance. If horde are camping WPL for honour, alliance honour farmers will come counter camp. Also group up. Also get a guild who work together. Also make friends. And, also I really cannot stress this enough, roll on a pve server if not being able to play because you’ve been camped by a high level concerns you. It is legit the OG experience that we have asked for. Warts and all.
---
Point Three: Yes this is understood. So what? Numerous expansions where you had to PvE to get gear to PvP
---
Playing EU is your best bet
---
From my understanding it is concentration talent is like the bread and butter of paladin tanking which resides in the holy tree.
---
It's shit, long CDs, no CD reset, 0 burst
---
Don't add to a broken game. Fix the game.
---
Im rolling on a RP servers, so im safe from streamer AIDS
---
Quality shitpost!
---
Do you think PvE servers will have PvP guilds, or at least organized premades?
---
Thank the Lord for that
---
Hier ist normaal
---
I think you you mean 18 - 22k total people on a server in vanilla. Obviously not online at once, but I made that pretty clear already. My stats come from warcraft realm stats. Where do yours come from?
---
If she really was interested in playing the game she'd learn the controls.
---
Lol waiting 1 week 
---
"Hi I'm lvl 43 and i got a bit bored so i came to welcome you with an hour long killing session"
---
The advice is "go the extra mile", because the cookie cutter classes won't try as hard.
---
&gt;tl'dr: I plan to level my warrior with alchemy/herbalism and cooking/fishing/first aid with a survivalist mentality.
---
You'd be far(far) better off going with mining/blacksmithing. Same mentality, only actually... useful.
---
Even vendoring leather is good to lvl xD I'm torn between herb/alchemy and herb/skinning (early on) to lvl xD
---
Roughly correct
---
Well, I don't think naxx level gear should be the standard, I think it should be the rarest and hardest to get - meaning that almost all new raids would be sub-naxx level gear. 
---
What I'm advocating for is effectively more raids of the same structure of loot, and different stories/locations/bosses/mechanics. And sure, more variety of loot in terms of stuff for different classes and specs, but with equal or lesser drop rates than their core vanilla counterparts. 
---
The system stays the same, the outcomes are largely the same, but there's a fresh new coat of paint on it with a story to check out every patch, in a way that does not invalidate what already exists, and simply gives an equal alternative. 
---
Also, new mounts?
---
Swords is the fastest but if you are on PvP servers and aiming to PvP alot then it really is a bad idea.
---
Going lets say Hemo although would nerf your damage by quite abit, you would still be able to kill mobs fairly quickly with a garrote hemo rapture opener with deadly poison on. The dots will melt any mob especially when sub provides you with stronger dots.
---
Not to mention your ability to control alot better in dungeons when need to be or your ability to PvP. Overall alot more fun than spamming sinister strike and hoping for the best.
---
Bear in pre-BIS is a better tank for Rag than a pre-BIS Warrior.
---
Genuinely can’t tell if I’m being trolled. Bravo
---
If you don't want griefing, don't play a game with open world PvP.
---
From what I heard they’re even behind Balance, but I was surprised at that.
---
You are indeed correct!
---
I got a free pass for 3 days of BFA, in my launcher. I'm hoping that counts as an active sub during the stress test.
---
That was my plan, but GF and friends want to go Alliance. So it's rogue for me!
---
I for one, am really looking forward to the addon the allows for looking for group. You don’t have to use it if you don’t want to!
---
How do you get 52 high warlords per year? It's not like it is arbitrarily locked to one person per week.
---
Not to mention that it takes 12 weeks of being in the first honor bracket to even reach rank 14 at release.
---
illegal danish was never funny
---
It’ll be 8g 49s on average.
---
That's what lead to BfA, so this is obviously not the solution.
---
I don't think Vanilla has this issue as bad as future expacs that have resilience. Most classes can function in PvP in dungeon blues, even when everyone else is in AQ/Naxx. Even Warriors can Mortal Strike something and still be useful.
---
In TBC, you just die instantly unless you have 300+ resilience. Even if the other guy is only wearing dungeon blues. God help you if he has raid gear or Gladiator gear.
---
Vanilla PvP is a lot more balanced that people give it credit for.
---
Don't even try to go against the circlejerk on this sub, man. The neckbeards will overpower you
---

---
Are you talking about classic or private servers?
---
Sadly for all you Classic+ boys, Blizzard shareholders will never greenlight a leap of faith that large. They were barely even persuaded just to let a few devs reverse-engineer Classic.
---
I'm just laughing my ass off at all these threads.
---
The skinning vendor price legend is particularly handy, thank you!
---
Died long ago.
---
Id like to see them timecapsule orginal classic, then release a classic+ where they develop content with horizontal progression (the same level cap, new raids/zones developed with similar to current content item levels etc), couple with them re-desiging TBC onward, but re-using the assets, and sticking to core classic wow pillars (Such redesiging BC zones to work without flying)
---
No, I don't think I will.
---
What I will do is try to clear up a miscommunication that we seem to have had. I'm not here to argue whether layering is good or bad, I'm here to argue that you are in fact, an idiot, and also a bit of an asshole.
---
Don't get mad at people asking you for a source. It's your responsibility to back up your claims, its unreasonable to expect everyone who reads your opinion to go and find proof of it by themselves.
---
Also, when you do provide a source, you should probably make sure its one that backs up your claim...
---
Teleporters / stairs.
---
&gt; If people really want to see a continuation of the spirit of Classic WoW development, they should be asking for WoW 2.0.
---
Classic+ would be WoW 2.0
---
Put all the new content on new servers, and let people copy their account over once.  It should be obvious to everyone that corrupting Classic Vanilla servers with changes would be a bad idea.  But that doesn't mean that Classic Vanilla philosophy can't expand into new content on separate servers.
---
So you take someone else's configuration. They get shared. But yeah, if you're lazy, just be lazy. Your performance will suffer and your UI will be ugly, but you do you.
---
You're right. Blizzard making ret pallies competetive in TBC is what ultimately lead to LFG/LFR, ilvls, progression reset every expac, personal loot, multiple dungeon difficulties, complete removal of talents(you know, even though TBC *added more talents*) etc.
---
Fucking moron.
---
No.
---
Fire, water and other substances lol. I hope you mean energy drinks.
---
Powerful isn't a thing, they could be 1000x more POWERFUL. Do they apply to this . NO.
---
They apply to images, songs, etc. Pservers' server code NOT blizzards, thus on what grounds do they claim copywrite?
---
According to that  4chan post from the supposed Blizzard employee, they're spinning up classic TBC and Wrath re-do's as well. Granted, it's 4chan, so... Mountain of salt.
---
What I'd hope is we could see TBC again, but wait an extra year.
---
They can’t be undead.
---
This is incorrect. I only have 500 children.
---
4 weeks then 2 weeks.
---
Then what instead? Perpetual Classic? You HAVE to know that'll get boring after 4 years.
---
I'm sorry you're being downvoted. Most of the people here are so used to using addons to clear content that the idea of not using them is frowned upon.
---
Nice man.
---
My normal method for harder mobs, or even normal mobs if you need to give your pet a break, is to turn Growl off, start DPSing, and send pet in a shot or two later. Helps a lot having a BM pet for increased pet damage, but not necessary.
---
You more or less ping pong yourself so you don’t out range the mob and they run back to their spawn point. And you only need to trade maybe 2 or 3 hits for an elite if you kite properly. 
---
This allows your pet to just melt face while you hold aggro.
---
Just don’t forget to avoid clipping your autoshots. A timer here would be beneficial.
---
What is this called?
---
"Care about the game" meaning "Being able to report racists and idiots", right?
---
Only the people in fear of being reported, and who spin a false narrative of mass reporting abuse against conservatives.
---
Nah we can keep reporting.
---
Didn't play on the beta but it should have no level cap, thats the way it was all through the game. I used it a lot as i played twinks from vanilla-cata
---
Nice to see that you have understood!
---
On the discord there was a guild recruiting for 11am-2pm raids
---
If only ZG was as pretty as MC
---
That's a severed dwarfs head so I guess it's ok.
---
Enhance has lots of better options in the form of 2h axes and maces.
---
The casters, not so much.
---
The only time I ever see this bullshit is when people make a post complaining about it.
---
Do what you want, the min/maxers don't give a shit.
---
Yes if you are skilled the whole party can do it at 22. I was always told on my leveling shadowpriest that I needed to be X level to do X dungeon. Always healed them (as shadow) like 3 levels below what people told me was possible. 
---
Hint: bring a few mana pots
---
Yes
---
not typically
---
Hahaha the feels.
---
Well, I guess we’ll never know since what we are getting is by far the easiest form of mc/ony/BWL that ever existed in vanilla. 
---
I tend to think things were a bit harder with 40-man raids than people now a days tend to say, because private servers are such poor representations.
---
Nice try GM's
---
Well yeah, it's strange it's like if you are saying that you won't play with addons they downvote you...
---
Can't watch the video at work but my 2 cents: 
---
In regards to Teldrassil, my biggest concern is lvl 3 and opening the Crown of the Earth chain. When I do the spider sacks uncontested, it opens me up to having bear form in under 4 hours and only having to kill 2 named mobs, with a multitude of FPs unlocked.
---
Even taking as long as 50 minutes to finish it puts me even with other options for dealing with congestion.
---
Me and all of my 17 wives are outarged at this.
---
Something to keep track of your coldowns such as manapotion and grid for smaller more efficient  raidframes. The default ui is large in a 40man raid. You need to see fire around you.
---
Well, for folks waiting for classic to launch, maybe take the time to watch a few good youtube tutorials on Vuhdo.  I don't think it is that complicated, but everytime I needed it to do something, I guess I did look up how to make it do that and learn more about the addon.  For example, when I tried disc priest, needed to set up atonement tracking - it did that.  When I played resto druid, I wanted my hots as bars rather than icons - it did that and made a huge difference.  Also does keybinds, macros, casting, etc.  Really an amazing tool.
---
Sounds about right..
---
Invite Asmongold layer!!!!111
---
I assumed, your suggestion was meant to meet OPs question, instead it seems you offer something completely different.
---
He asked for a reckoning build, so he wants to do dmg in pvp and you offer him a build, where he should heal in pvp, but which is good at farming, which holy reckoning isn't very good at.
---
Regardless, SoC is a waste, if you don't go for crit, you will do more dps with rightousness and more reliably with no ap and tons of spellpower.
---
Some things are true, you won’t raid as meme specs.
---
Naxx will be very difficult to get into
---
I only remember arms warriors in raids.
---
Thank you for this. It actually made me consider priest more than I had been. A dynamic playstyle sounds fun to me, the more engaging the better.
---
Classic -&gt; TBC -&gt; Wrath repeat. With the option to copy (not transfer) over to the next level.
---
Never until WotLK, basically.
---
Hey dude - will be on PvE EU, will decide once the server names are released.
---
I though its common knowledge. They clearly said, "we heard you". Who do you think they heard? Retail players or Nostalrius community?
---
You forgot everyone is going to quit after they hit level 40 and get but also everyone is going to quit BFA forever to do Classic end game
---
This was actually a pretty good shitpost and I really loved how I felt reading it. You've changed my day, sir. You have indeed changed my day.
---
It all started when I went to the store. This was actually a pretty good shitpost and I really loved how I felt reading it. You've changed my day, sir. You have indeed changed my day.
---
It all started when I went to the store. I go to the store. A car is parked. Many cars are parked or moving. Some are blue. Some are tan. They have windows. In the store, there are items for sale. These include such things as soap, detergent, magazines, and lettuce. You can enhance your life with these products. Soap can be used for bathing, be it in a bathtub or in a shower. Apply the soap to your body and rinse. Detergent is used to wash clothes. Place your dirty clothes into a washing machine and add some detergent as directed on the box. Select the appropriate settings on your washing machine and you should be ready to begin. Magazines are stapled reading material made with glossy paper, and they cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from news and politics to business and stock market information. Some magazines are concerned with more recreational topics, like sports card collecting or different kinds of hairstyles. Lettuce is a vegetable. It is usually green and leafy, and is the main ingredient of salads. You may have an appliance at home that can quickly shred lettuce for use in salads. Lettuce is also used as an optional item for hamburgers and deli sandwiches. Some people even eat lettuce by itself. I have not done this. So you can purchase many types of things at stores.

If I drive around, I sometimes notice the houses and buildings all around. There are also pieces of farm land that are very large. Houses can be built from different kinds of materials. The most common types are brick, wood, and vinyl or synthetic siding. Houses have lawns that need to be tended. Lawns need to be mowed regularly. Most people use riding lawnmowers to do this. You can also use a push mower. These come in two varieties: gas-powered and manual. You don’t see manual push-mowers very much anymore, but they are a good option if you do not want to pollute the air with smoke from a gas-powered lawnmower. I notice that many families designate the lawnmowing responsibility to a teenager in the household. Many of these teenagers are provided with an allowance for mowing the yard, as well as performing other chores, like taking out the trash, washing the dishes, making their bed, and keeping the house organized. Allowances are small amounts of money given by parents to their children, usually on a weekly basis. These usually range from 5 dollars to 15 dollars, sometimes even 20 dollars. Many parents feel that teenagers can learn financial responsibility with this system.
---
Now I will talk about farm land. Farm land can be identified by some common features. They almost always consist of a very large patch of dirt with small green plants lined up in very long rows. You may sometimes see farm equipment riding over these rows, like tractors or combines. These machines help farmers grow more crops in less time. They are a very helpful invention. Some different types of crops are soybeans, cotton, corn, tomatoes, tobacco, and lettuce (which I mentioned earlier). Most crops are used as food, and can be defined as either fruits or vegetables. Some are commonly eaten raw, after being rinsed in water to remove any dirt. Some are often cooked, which helps give them a more pleasant taste and makes them easier to chew. A very versatile vegetable is the potato. It can be eaten raw, or it can be cooked in a variety of ways. They can be baked, and many people like to add butter to them. They can be mashed, and a lot of times brown gravy or milk gravy is poured on top of them. They can be cut into thin strips and fried. Typically a large amount of grease is required to prepare potatoes in this style, but they are easy to make and easy to eat. You can order them at several fast-food restaurants. Potatoes can also be boiled, stewed, and scalloped. There is a wide variety of options available to you when cooking potatoes.
---
Some other types of crops grown on farm land are used for other purposes. Cotton is used to make clothing (which I also mentioned earlier). It is a very versatile and inexpensive material for clothes. Such items as shirts, pants, socks, and underwear can be made from cotton. The process of converting cotton from a cotton plant to clothing is fairly complicated. Today, cotton is harvested more efficiently through the use of the cotton gin, invented by Eli Whitney many years ago.
---
Tobacco is another type of crop. It is used in making cigarettes. A lot of people smoke cigarettes, even though many medical sources have identified them as harmful to people’s health. Warnings are printed on cigarette packages reminding people of possible dangers resulting from smoking. Cigarettes are available in several brands, including Marlboro, Salem, and Virginia Slims. There is a brand called Kool, but I don’t know whether they are still available at most outlets. Tobacco farming is a large industry, and currently there is debate about it. Recently the government decided on some regulations that cost tobacco companies a large amount of money.
---
If you notice, some farm lands have animals living on them. Most of these are cows, and there are also pigs, sheep, and goats living on farms. Some are raised for the milk they provide. This milk goes through several processes to ensure that it is not contaminated before it is made available to consumers at stores (which I mentioned earlier). Another use for farm animals is meat. Three popular types of meat are beef, pork, and chicken. Beef comes from cows. Pork comes from pigs. Chicken comes from chickens, but you probably knew that. These animals are raised to become plump and healthy, then they are killed, sometimes at slaughter houses. The meat is then removed from their bodies, cleaned, and made available at a variety of stores and restaurants. Sometimes this process can seem gross, but it is part of an advanced ecological food chain on earth. Just like birds eat worms and tigers eat deer, human beings eat cows and pigs. The main difference is that we don’t eat animals raw. We cook the meat to remove blood, fat, and germs from it. We also season our meat with salt or different kinds of sauces. The end result is food that is very tasty and is healthy for us.
---
Farmers do not like trespassers. If a farmer sees one, he will sometimes shoot at them with a shotgun that he owns. Trespassing is against the law. Laws are created by government to prevent people from living in fear. They are meant to provide safety for citizens. Our government in America consists of a legislative branch, an executive branch, and a judicial branch. The legislative branch makes laws based on the concerns of citizens they represent. The executive branch consists of the President. This person enforces the law, and he has certain other duties like declaring war and approving bills prepared by members of the legislative branch. The President is also considered the leader of our country. The judicial branch interprets the laws. This branch consists of the courts and the trials held in them. Here a judge and jury determine from evidence presented by lawyers whether someone is guilty of breaking a law. Initial law enforcement takes place among police officers. They are the first people to encounter situations where a law is being broken. If a criminal (law-breaker) becomes too violent or hostile, they will use guns or mace or nightsticks to administer immediate punishment. Their goal is to bring the criminal under control, so that he can receive a punishment determined by members of the judicial branch of government. Punishments mostly include time in jail, but they can also include fines and, in extreme cases, the death penalty. There is controversy surrounding the death penalty.

Children play with toys. This is common to almost all kids. Toys come in a very wide variety. Boys tend to like cars, action figures, and toy weapons. Girls tend to like dolls, toy kitchens, and make-up. Both of them like building or assembling things, be it with Legos, blocks, Play-Doh, or something similar. Toys can be found at most stores, and these days entire stores are dedicated to selling only toys. The most popular of these is Toys ‘R’ Us (with a backwards “R”). Their mascot is Geoffrey the Giraffe. Children love to go to Toys ‘R’ Us and look at the wide variety of toys available. Most children receive the greatest quanitity of toys on their birthdays, or during the holiday season in December. For the majority of children, this holiday is Christmas. For Jewish children, the holiday is Channakuh. Either way, the kid gets presents during this time, and most of these presents are toys.
---
Holy/Ret is not a pve/pvp spec. Prot has key talents for pvp, which you cannot ignore. Holy/Ret is a pve spec, which heals in raids and can farm very well.
---
Holy Reck, his version 3, is called the swiss army knife spec for good reason. It can heal well in both pve and pvp and is very good at dealing brust dmg in pvp as well.
---
Backlit keyboards is pretty much completely in the domain of features every decent keyboard is seemingly required to have. Fortunately you can turn it off on basically every single one, or at least make it really dim such that it allows you to see the keys well while not being a punch to your eyeballs or look overtly eye catching.
---
I'm curious why you can't let your business partners see a gaming keyboard and mouse though. They must be some hardcore conservatives in their field if they would think less of you for your choice of keyboard and mouse.
---
The pro mouse looks fine actually. Nice one
---
Most likely characters on the seasonal realms would be transferred to some persistent realm, same as they handle this in Diablo. 
---
I don't see what's so bad about 'losing' your character after two years or so? There's only so many times you can raid the same stuff over and over again before getting bored.
---
I think he meant vampiric embrace, which is not typically used. Its usually not worth the debuff slot
---
Ah yes I remember using something like Gatherer back in the day. 
---
Thanks again, I’m sure others will be just as appreciative
---
I have a question regarding professions. I would like to know how you choose and if it´s based on your faction/race/class. My memory of vanilla was that warriors used blacksmith/mining and healers used alchemy/herbalism, pretty much. But is it that simple?   
---
My plan is to play either pala/priest/warlock so my first thought was to go with mining/engineering.   
---
What would you recommend and what do you remember was the strongest profession back in vanilla?
---
Thank you got this. Topping meters doesnt mean anything to me, as long as I am useful. I care more about successful completion than personal numbers so I'll do whatever I need to.
---
Racecar looking bad gear. Lawl
---
This was amazing.  Thank you sincerely
---
Seriously, people have cleared all content with these off specs fine, the meta of vanilla including these specs has evolved a lot since 2006. I'm considering Moonkin or Shadow Priest because they have the coolest class fantasy to me and seem interesting just because of the extra effort you have to put in to farm consumables and what not for every run
---
I'm glad I could help!  Keep an eye out for my crafting and secondary profession gold making guides in the coming week!  Also check out the guild rec. feature if you're still guildless.  Great guilds are what really complete the vanilla experience IMO.
---
Hemo is fine from about lvl 45+ (although you suck vs multiple targets). I wouldn't go for it straight away though.
---
Pretty close
---
Yes it will
---
Run to Orgrimmar to set my hearth.
---
Nah like I said before: I have to bring costumers in my office. People I don‘t know. It has to look professional so a gaming mouse looking to flashy can‘t be there. It‘s sad but that ho it is
---
tauren rogues with their thunderfury's will be op

My razer nostromo is busted.  If it has lights on then it doesn't send key commands.   I keep the lights off and the keyboard works fine.  Guess thats a win/win situation.
---
Bartender is the only addon I'm starting with.  I like to have my keybinds match on screen to my gamepad and 12 button mouse.
---
Wait, you’re telling me a community on Reddit is highly unstable and reactionary?
---
Where did you find a 1.13 Version of EzDismount?
---
Nice
---
Pvp:
---
Slow dagger in the MH and fast dagger in the OH if you are dagger cb/prep, sealfate or combat daggers.
---
Slow sword in the MH and fast sword in the OH if you are combat sword.
---
Slow anything in the MH and fast anything in the OH if you are hemo cb/prep or hemo "toolbox".
---
Google any 1.12 rogue guide for these specs.
---
You could swim there trough fatigue!
---
&gt;First and foremost you can't play a meme spec.
---
I agree with one of your points.
---
Is there a difference in threat needed to pull a mob off the tank if you're in melee Vs ranged distance?
---
I remember something like 1.3x being mentioned but it was 14 years ago...
---
I'm for Classic+. I will never play TBC again.
---
I will repeat the mantra 'If it stays true to the vanilla philosophy', but what exacly this entail needs to be worded and defined over time, and to stand scrutiny. A reoccurring megathread on this will likely develop into something concrete a majority of C+ers can stand behind, be it thread# 12 or 55.
---
When they changed their minds about language servers they said they were planning the July stress test to be global, with region specific and language specific realms.
---
So I expect you might see the download this week or next weekend.
---
DL Tanking is the best (read: least downtime) spec. 
---
So generally (with no respecs) you go 31 affliction
---
[Here's](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/05) what you look like at level 14
---
[Here's](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/350020001) what you look like at 20.
---
[Here's](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/350020051) what you should look like at level 25.
---
[Here's](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/3500200512201) what you should look like at 30.
---
[Here's](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/35002405122010051) what you should look like at 40.
---
1-10 you use the imp, dot + shadowbolt
---
11-20 you use VW to keep you from dying to unexpected shit (and he can offtank a mob while you fear-kite a second mob -- dots on both). 
---
30-39 you generally use Succy since her damage is way better than the VW. 
---
40+ you use Succy with all abilities turned off, and drain her mana to keep your uptime at Hunter levels of 100%
---
From there you can go Demo or Destruction, I usually go Destro for better dps in dungeons / and some better PvP nuke. 
---
In general: early levels open with Immolate to keep aggro off your imp, then CoA then Corruption (can do Corruption first until it's instant, since spell knockback sucks and you should get it off by the time the mob gets to you). 
---
Generally you only use Siphon Life if you're killing two mobs at once / it will run most of its duration. It's basically mana-neutral if it runs its full 30sec duration. 
---
Getting a good wand from quests, dungeons, or the AH helps you a lot in the 6-20 grind. 
---
Protip: Shadowbolt costs loads of mana for the damage it does, so if you wanna not drink/eat a lot, avoid casting it too much. Stick with Drain Life for the most part.
---
You forgot this one:
---
“I simply DO NOT have the time to play this game like I used to, so I will be playing very casually and only playing around 45-100 hours a week”
---
My favorite version of wow is definitely tbc. I love the classes of tbc, blood elves and the professions. 
---
TBC is proven to be successful, I am not in favor of making something completely new, especially not from current Blizzard.
---
As for if they should retain vanilla I am not so sure. It will depend of the population I guess. I wouldnt want the community to be split up. Imgine half guild wanna stay on vanilla and other half wanna play TBC.
---
I think they should make a rotation pf vanilla - tbc - lich king. Then they can decide to either start over with vanilla or make something new
---
I would argue that it doesn't attract retards but rather it is immediately obvious if a hunter is bad while this isn't the case on other classes.
---
Not top but still ok dps
---
I'd like additions. Classic was still undergoing balance changes when TBC was released. As long as those changes remain in line with the Classic philosophy i'm on board. It could balance such as paladin buffs lasting a bit longer or better scaling for hunters. 
---
There are missing quests such as the mount in Un'goro, class weapons are limited to Warriors, Priests and Hunters, Locks and Pallies have the mount quest though.
---
Azshara needs fleshing out, different raids could be potential content or more dungeons. Even new questing zones. Lower level ones would be nice to aid leveling.
---
MoveAnything isn't needed in the new client.
---
I got bored reading this post. I skipped to the last line. My apologies.
---
Or how he summons scorpions by using arcane explosion lol
---
Haven't been here for a while. So WTF.
---
I stopped reading after the first line
---
My dream scenario:  
---
Let vanilla play out for a while.  Release the patches somewhat slowly, and have a longer gap at the end so guilds can realistically clear it and hardcore guilds can finish Atieshes.
---
Release Karazhan as a 100 man raid.  That's not a typo.  Large group content is the cornerstone of vanilla, and it should be emphasized, not pared down like future expansions did.  This forces a new type of social cooperation - interguild cooperation and coordination.  This raid should drop loot that is better than naxx gear by a meaningful amount, but not drop gear that obsoletes prior raids.   In particular, it needs to be careful with tank weapons (MC), and trinkets (BWL) .  It should only drop a couple items per boss despite the increased size.  It should be tuned hard.  
---
Release zones on kalimdor/EK that have been previously explored in cata.  Uldum and mount hyjal would be particularly interesting.  These zones should contain a new 20 or 40 man raid that includes a lot of "Horizontal progression" style items.  These are designed to create interesting gameplay for underperforming specs.  Think a paladin tanking set where a set bonus gives a taunt effect, or a trinket that gives a massive amount of arcane spell power.   I'd also like to see resistance based fights here that are tuned harder than the ones in vanilla were.  Ideally these fights are shadow and arcane based.
---
I'm not sure if these are possible, but they would certainly be interesting ideas that are in the spirit of vanilla.
---
I recall making fat stacks being 1 of 2 people on a server with a particular Enchant-Weapon world drop for **months** 
---
That shit single-handedly funded my epic mount.
---
Bullshit, all Bungie Halo games were great.
---
Playing around with that sort of stuff can really help as well, that's true. The issue in the specific case with Tethis was that I didn't have much room for that sort of thing, because there were a lot of orange mobs around, so I needed something pretty stationary.  
---
I never really used Raptor Strike in vanilla, unless for some reason I had to be in melee. But I'm definitely going to try my hand at melee weaving in classic :)
---
I recommend Warlock. Leveling is a great experience, dots are fun, free mount is a nice little bonus.
---
Virtuous and inspired. You were well ahead of your times.
---
You assume wrong. Running over traps is unrelated to batching- it is due to position interpolation.
---
This is also most likely not due to spell batching but due to how flare is implemented.
---
RemindMe! 42 days

yep. Confirmed by blizzard the other week.

90% this (lets go with 40man kara!). New post Naxx content that follows the Vanilla design philosophy. 
---
More 20man and 40 man raids that compliment each other with unique sets, but are not all just "Naxx but harder", release catchup raids with side grades , increase the size of the world, but without making old content useless by fleshing out the missing zones and areas that are in the original world.
---
I'm super excited for vanilla but hold your horses little fella it'll be ok
---
17??? Weak. I’m in the late 20s.
---
Got to pump those number up.
---
Im working shifts so its find to get guild with early daily raid times.
---
Found one in eu which has raid from 10am-1pm.
---
Go on wow classic discorts and look at guilds and find some with raid time that suits you.
---
Only problem is not faction i wanted but change is good.
---
damn you'd think that since youre calling these absolutist opinions out there wouldnt be as many of them in the comment but nope still seeing about 1/3 of 30 basically mimiking youre post, makes me hope that I just have a shit sense of irony
---
“You will never see naxx”
---
For most people on this over-prepped hype train, this is probably true.
---
You forgot the part about me being the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end.
---
Also, druids are bad, fight me.
---
Added in 2.0.1 as a talent.
---
This was legitimately funny.
---
Goblin on top of one of the walls in the ogre encampment in Alterac Mountains! I want to say he sells Frost Oil recipe? Also a leatherworking(?) merchant near the northern end of the giant wall in Hillsbrad.
---
Yeah, forever... right into a guard or a flightmaster or another member of the opposite faction. Druids have next to zero world PVP potential.
---
All true. What's your question?
---
Good info.  Thanks.
---
As far as I remember the file editing couldn't get you banned because in reality, you were actually not on GM Island, people who would check you out, would just see you swimming randomly in the ocean.
---
Not entirely sure tho.
---
There was a file editing method which removed the water or something like that, and you could get there faster, each time you would relog, the server would read the client position and spawn you underwater.
---
Stinky cheese is the best kind of cheese, and who wants to be sneaked up on by a bear while eating cheese? sounds good to me.
---
Classic runs better than the old Vanilla client, according to what I've seen on my machine and what I've seen another person report.
---
Same here, as a male Dwarf.
---
Aye, i remember that as well, isn't it basically the same as when a rogue has dots? He vanishes, disappears for a second then the dot brings him back visible  
---
After careful review of the video Rogue side I don't see anything wrong / different of waht I experienced with my hunt in the past. The flare never triggered instantly and the vanish "made you" insensible to unsealth mechanics for a gcd after activation.  
---
Then again, I might be wrong, I'm just giving my memories and opinion
---
Oh, so you mean what people are saying is unrealistic? Nah, come on.

https://discord.gg/x8z7tgT
---
&gt; Anyone else feeling more excited about Classic WoW now that they've realized this? 
---
No - i used add ons in Vanilla, what is different with Classic ?
---
Yea fair call. I believe Tethis has a decent length leash and there are a few brief spots you can try my previous suggestion. I’ll have to give your method a try, looks like fun!
---
You can also run cheetah, maintain SS and concussive, and circle him with your pet maintaining DPS. You have to sacrifice a bit of your DPS as you can only really autoshot reliably when concussive is up, and you can’t send your pet in for a little while in order to build your threat, but still doable! Just takes a while... a threat meter really helps here.
---
Maintaining a frost trap would definitely make it easier :) best thing about vanilla, so many ways to achieve the same thing haha.
---
When I was soloing this on my 29 Hunter twink (Pserver admittedly - I had nowhere near this capability in vanilla lol), the above two methods was how I managed the non elite Jungle Stalkers, with the cheetah circling method for tight spaces.
---
And here I was favoring rogue last week, back to the drawing board we go!
---
&gt;In TBC, you just die instantly unless you have 300+ resilience. 
---
 A fresh 60 in vanilla dies way faster to naxx geared opponents than a fresh 70 does to full season 4 pvp gear opponents. Resilience doesn't increase your damage.
---
100% me. Like, I'm not a student anymore, so I will not play until 3am. Only 2am.
---
There is always Sigil, which is free.
---
Honestly if you take Improved Sprint it's not that bad. It's definitely not a 1v1 spec, but it's a good BG duelist.
---
I used Combat Swords in PvP because I couldn't be asked to pay the respec cost. Worth.
---
Plus it is not contested content and it makes your leveling a little bit smoother with the food buffs.
---
all very true, thanks for the summary
---
walk to the first NPC and accept his quest
---
My concern with new content is that if you end up with Classic servers, and then Classic+ servers as well, and then re-releasing TBC and then making TBC+ and so on, you either need to force people into the new content, away from the Classic that they wanted, or you'll split the playerbase, and people will get separated because some will stay behind and others will move ahead. Friend-groups and guilds would likely break apart, and servers would get underpopulated. (Even if it is optional, and you can copy a character to the new server, you would still have to choose where to spend your time - with old friends or with new content)  
---
So even though there are several directions Blizzard could go, in terms of new content, I think it would be a mistake to choose more than one.  
---
&amp;nbsp; 
---
Furthermore, TBC and later expansions were, the way I remember it, pretty fleshed out (correct me if I'm wrong). There wasn't a lot of unused content in Outland and Northrend, in the same way that we had all the unused areas in Azeroth (See u/ChromedDragon 's posts), unused instance portals ("The Other Stockades" instance and the portal at the end of the canal between Old Town and the Trade District, both in SW, the one at the end of Stratholme). And how about places like the demon-infested areas in Southern Winterspring and Southwestern Blasted Lands? Redoing Karazhan, and including the crypts. Grim Batol? Tyr's Hand and Hearthglen could be used more as well. Lots of unexplored possibilities  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
So bottom line is, if we only go one path, and I think we should, it should be Classic+, not re-TBC (despite how fond I was of TBC - Nagrand was my favorite zone in WoW history)

---
Keep classic 60, there was unfinished contet wich can be added without the need of any class balance or expansions! Here's my wishlist:
---
-Azshara Battleground
---
-20 man Kharazan, without Blood Elves
---
-Gilneas pre-Alliance
---
-Uldum pre-cataclysm
---
-Furbolg keeps in Felwood/Azshara
---
-Stormwind channel district: prison and portal
---
-Stratholme unused portals (they had to lead somwhere)
---
-Grim Batol pre-cataclysm
---
-BRD has not enough quests, it could be expanded a little
---
-Fix existing itemization, specially T0/T1 and hybrid PVP sets
---
-Allow stuff that was fun but not OP, like spell damage rogues and hunters (basically, allow weapon procs, poisons and Arcane Shot to scale with Spell Damage, like it was before "fixes")
---
-Etc
---
dont play on a PVP server if you want to avoid this.

Also incorrect: I have 14 wives and 3 husbands.
---
Listen here, son. I once did a BFD run with 4 shadow priests and a warlock. BEST TIME EVER.
---
you sure you want it ? Guy on the video has Indian accent
---
Depends on value, greater fire prot pot recipe is rolled between members of the group same goes for flasks etc.
---
Minor value stuff is given away without a hassle
---
&gt; The game will have a definitive end state and they won't be scrapping your progress for the next tier expansion. 
---
The people who think this could not possible happen may get seriously disappointed, no one knows what will happen when we get to the end of classic and no promises were given.
---
All of tempest keep is flying only I thought...?
---
Don’t worry your pretty little head about it
---
Basically all I know about classic WoW shamans: [Frost Shock!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5mD1n4v2JA)
---
But Unbreakable does have that sad music when he has to spec for healing for raids. You're saying that resto (using whatever stats raid gear gave you, which might include +healing) was better in PvP than enhance?
---
If you dont like wPvP then play on a PvE server?   
---
Problem solved.
---
Warlocks were barely hanging on in the last two seasons with item inflation, particularly rogue pve gear being dominant for pvp.Their only top tier arena comp in season 3-4 was in 5v5 (druid warlock priest mage rogue).  
---
In season 1 and partly through season 2 warlock druid were the second strongest 2v2 comp behind druid hunter, and the #1 3v3 comp with druid hunter. Luckily for most other classes this meta wasn't established for very long before viper sting and DoTs got fixed, allowing resilience to reduce their effects. 
---
The class didn't stand out over the life cycle of the expansion. Druid is pretty much the only class that remained consistently on another level than others.
---
Pretty sure they're trolling, yeah.
---
Probably should keep the ankhs..
---
Its Enhancement.
---
Unless they forget that DHKs didn't arrive with the original honor patch. Then they will be going against the original game to have them.
---
I care for usan bolts 100 meter run. No one cares about a fucking 1 meter run. 
---
WHO CARES FOR 1-6 SPEED RUNS?!
---
If you ever played on a release date you will know that planning a route is waste of time; to many people...   If you wanna do a guide, do a propper one, like 1-30 or 1-20..  Even 6-10 would be more usefull.
---
Damnit, Archer!
---
I would call my comment unrelevant, since ive been leveling most classes in under 5 days.
---
Shit examples. Neither LFG nor LFR was "fixing the game" because neither existed beforehand. You cannot "fix" something that is *not in the game*.
---
&gt;How can you tell what needs fixing and whats not?
---
Things that are already in Classic, which are not working as intended. It's not fucking rocket surgery.
---
The TBC release date made it hard for a lot of guilds to keep raid rosters. People didn't even want to raid T2/2.5 for gear since it was all being reset.
---
Lekker gewerkt pik
---
Doesn't hurt to tell people you have the profession, but you don't need to ask for permission to need on something you actually need.
---
"I would't call"***
---
("\*Well, obviously not just ONE viper sting")
---
I am playing Rome Total War 2 with Divide Et Impera mod, dismantling my structures in EvE Online as I want to unsub those accounts and not manage a wormhole when classic comes out.
---
And hopefully squeeze in a full run through of Dragon Age Inquisition before release. 
---
So... Trying not to think about it. But it is hard.
---
&gt;The only version of the game not focused on farming mounts.
---
No version of the game is *focused* on farming mounts.
---
In a kind world only blacksmiths would roll.  
---
It will depend on how much the pattern sells for on the AH, how many people you accidentally end up with that are greedy shitbirds, and if people even mention professions to begin with.  For any dungeon past 50 I recommend it be run with friends, as to avoid such nonsense.
---
Are they BoP or can they be bought off the AH?
---
Depends on what you changed. If yuy edited the terrain and objects in Westfall to be like GM Island (copy pasted terrain + trees + houses) then yes, you wouldn't really be on GM Island. This was the only way to get to places like Emerald Dream since it didn't actually exist in any accessible world (it had its own mapID). However, if you only flattened the ground and removed the water between teldrassil and GM Island, you would end up where it's actually at and if you logged out, restored your files and logged back in you would still be at GM Island.
---
When will the Zerg settle and be normal? Like I can easily just chill a week if that makes it more normal
---
My guild has a private server where we just finished raiding up to Naxx last weekend and reset everything to lvl 58. This weekend was MC and Onyxia in whatever gear we'd been able to grab during the week.
---
All I want to is think about it :-D haha
---
Imprisoned for ten thousand years. Banished from my own server. And now, you dare enter my layer? You are not prepared.
---
I plan on doing the Fed-EX leveling route for the first character. This means you skip all 'kill X boars' quests and only take delivery quests. You then run around the map to pick up all the zone xp and flightpaths of various zones.
---
True. Maybe I should start watching some netflix series.. I recently started playing Crash Team Racing to spend the time fast and also I work a lot where I have time to listen to the podcast, so that helps quite a bit as well :-)
---
there a night elf one?
---
Go to TBC ofcourse.
---
-Streamers
---
Nice thanks for the recommendation! I'll definitely have a look at that. I really enjoyed classicast where they had some of the early designers join as guests - it was super interesting so I also ordered the book by the first level designer, which will be a great read I think.
---
If you do remake this, can you pls link different sizes for download? love it... Lok'tar ogar!!!
---
Go level up by exploring
---
Word, John stats? Countdown to classic has several hour long interviews with him specifically about every facet of the game he touched. You’ll really enjoy it
---
Do you have some favorite episodes / episodes where there are guests from the designers of the original WoW? And MAN there's a lot of content :-) . Thanks a ton!
---
Mount first;) one and then two! And then I take the power back and go engineering;) with a pocket full of mats!
---
Leave Classic alone. Separate TBC servers.
---
Just never add flying.
---
Why? If you get rich early you just flip items on the ah as the economy inflates. Then profit.
---
The problem with capping at 60 is new players. 
---
If you cap at 60 and add more raids and dungeons you're stick at a conundrum, do you keep increasing ilvl of gear ? 
---
The ilvl of Naxx gear is already insane compared to a fresh 60. 
---
Imagine you start playing classic a year or two after its release, by the time you ding 60 there may be a few raids after Naxx , by then the ilvl will probably be 100+.
---
World PvP would be atrocious. Planned PvP would also be atrocious, ilvl 58 vs ilvl 100. As a fresh 60 if you wanted to PvP you are basically forced to MC -&gt; BWL -&gt; AQ -&gt; Naxx -&gt; beyond. If you don't have groups to carry you then you'll need to do each of those raids on rotation for a few months each to gear up to be able to raid the next one up etc. Maybe then you can actually PvP.
---
My hype has died recently with hunters being broken, literally unplayable in pvp.
---
level
---
Dwarf has fear ward
---
Naxx geared people will roflstomp bad geared people easily no problem. Since damage scales a lot more than HP you will find that if everyone has naxx gear people will still die much faster than if everyone was fighting in earlier gear.
---
Full naxx gear lock soulfire can crit for 6k+
---
It really depends. Usually, BoE's went to the one needing it, greens were always needed by default. It's different with high value items or BoE epics, like flask recipes. If you go in a dungeon looking for a specific recipe or pattern, you should clear up the loot rules beforehand. I'd never fault anyone for rolling for the Spellpower or Titan flask, despite not being an alchemist. It's basically your epic mount, key for your guild, etc. 
---
Getting the flask recipes early on even justifies re-speccing into alchemy as it is such a valuable item for the guild that you're in.
---
hunters being broken how?
---
I'm playing FFXIV to de-hype, pass the time, and keep my mind off Classic.
---
I like your style, I’ll make sure to look out for you and slam a chain lightening into your dome 😁
---
I'd wager that's exactly why they opted for a Tuesday launch. Splits the playerbase pretty nearly so the starting zones won't be as overcrowded as a traditional launch
---
As someone who leveled a paladin to \~48 during classic, but didn't play a shaman unless it was like to level 5:
---
Shamans had by far the better quick (1.5 sec) heal. Shamans also had an interrupt on a 6 sec, talentable 5-sec cooldown, and a lot of shamans were Tauren with War Stomp.
---
Paladin's 1.5 sec did about the same hps as a caster's dps. Of course this could vary; the paladin could be afflicted by Curse of Tongues; the caster might have +damage gear, and the paladin none; either player could be suffering spell pushback from damage; the heal target could have Blessing of Light for a small boost in healing. Basically, you had to use Holy Light, 2.5 sec cast.
---
So, Earth Shock the first heal at 2 sec. Locked out for another 2 sec. Starting casting again at 4 sec. Paladin could get 100% uninterruptible from damage with talents + concentration aura, but often didn't have both or either. So let's say the paladin gets hit at 5 sec, spell pushed back by 1 sec (compared to 0.5 sec current, if the mechanic even still exists). Spell WOULD complete at 7.5 sec.
---
But with talents, Earth Shock could have cooled down by 7 sec.
---
Original WoW didn't have a casting bar for enemies; that was an addon, then it became standard, which probably helped with identifying spell pushback. So if the Tauren shaman knows or guesses that the hit at 5 sec didn't cause pushback, they can Warstomp at 5.5 sec, and then shock at 8 sec even without the -1 sec talent. Cast doesn't complete until 12.5 sec even without any pushback from damage at all.
---
Paladins could stun. But shamans had Grounding Totem, and the only abilities paladins had that could clear the grounding totem before using Hammer of Justice were Judgement and talented Holy Shock. And Hammer of Justice didn't even destroy the grounding totem, which could block other spells. Of course, if the shaman guessed right (and paladins could be pretty predictable when they basically only had one offensive ability), the grounding totem might still be fading in when the paladin used Hammer of Justice.
---
High-level damage seals had significant mana cost. Paladins often used Rank 1 Seal of Reckoning for this reason, but Seal of Reckoning had a certain proc-per-minute regardless of weapon speed, and a slow weapon meant a large loss of damage to kill a totem.
---
Make a new character and clear naxx with it.  Do for all classes avalible for your faction. Then commence mass world pvp in pve gear.
---
It can't be literally nothing because it is 2-3 hours.
---
classic+ would be great. there are bunch of unfinished/cut content in azeroth that should be used and expanded on.
---
This is the shittest post in shitpost history.
---
Also getting high warlord means playing 24/7 sharing accounts for 5 years nonstop.
---
Well in single player games maybe but in mmorpg its nothing and really it is imo casual.
---
Depends if those 2-3 h are spent chilling thats casusl but if they are spent on efficient min-max to progress asap then that wouldnt ve very casual
---
How dare you
---
I completely forgot about these. Now I get to be orc and sort of undead when I feel like it. Nice.
---
This summarises this sub pretty well, I almost don't recognise the game sometimes. I can get stressed out because of all these posts and then I have to stop myself and say to myself "Wait, my experience playing this game isn't close to what people make it out to be here". The game is much more chill than what this sub makes it out to be. If you are a new player reading this, honestly don't listen to what we are saying here. When you get to that login screen just do whatever you want to do and not what some veteran told you on the forums.
---
&gt;literally 
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
2-3 hours a day is pretty much all the time left in the day when you've taken care of everything else. I don't see how that's casual. If you're 15 then yea maybe it's sort of casual. If you're an adult 2-3 hours a day is a pretty big deal.
---
I mean, it's something, but nothing really substational. 2-3 hours are needed just to immerse yourself into the game,  after that the real gameplay starts, but oh, you just done playing for today. It would feel like metaphorical blueballing.
---
it is impossible to play the actual game on a NORMAL server.  
---
NORMAL servers are not a valid option.  
---
get this idea out of your head that wow can be enjoyed without ganking or griefing. you are plain wrong.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Are debuff priorities confirmed? I thought that was just a pserver thing.
---
They said this is how it behave in their reference client, which doesn't dismiss the fact that it was a bug back then - and it was fixed later as a bug, not a feature change !
---
You expect them to teleport around or whatever modern WoW is like?
---
oh yeah ... the day I picked Warlock back in the Day just because he looked cool and stepped into Tirisfal Glades ... next thing I know BC happened ...
---
His processor is a U model so ot's a laptop
---
Funny that your comment is the at bottom
---
“I want to play on the Naxx patch forever and at the same time play TBC forever and at the same time play WotLK forever and in my spare time have my copied character try out post Naxx content, then on weekends I want to play on fresh servers so I can experience it all over again.”
---
Casual is a matter of perspective. For someone that is a hardcore player, 2 hours every day doesn't seem like much. For someone that plays 5 hours a week, 2 hours every day seems like a lot.
---
Yeah i agree with you just saying in mmorpg its nothing there are people playing 16 hours per day.
---
WoW is not a sandbox, it was never designed to be played forever on a single patch. 
---
What are people suppose to do when they killed KT for the 10th time?, just keep playing pretending doing the same content over and over is fun?, it that T3 armor set really special when everyone has it?
---
Keep the game on the same patch forever will result in the same problems retail has, there is no sense of achievement when everyone has everything.

We are **The Remains**, a semi-hardcore guild with experience in several MMORPG's. Looking to return to one of the first MMORPGs we played. TL:DR We are looking for progress, but that essential community feeling is just as important. **Playing Horde on EU PVP server, raiding days Tuesday and Thursday 19:30 till 22:30 with a possible Sunday evening progression raid.**
---
**What are the goals of The Remains?**
---
*Primary goal : Enjoy all content on a high level*
---
**We will accomplish that goal, by these sub-goals :**
---
* Enjoying all aspects of the game
---
* Become a friendly environment for our WoW members
---
* Focus groups on different aspects of the game
---
* Being part of a focus group, doesn't exclude you from other guild content or switching groups
---
* Have a good reputation on the server because of who we are and what we stand for
---
**What can we offer you?**
---
* A nice and friendly environment to call your home
---
* A teamspeak server to communicate with eachother
---
* A discord server for discussing WoW or anything else you'd like
---
* Site and forum to stay in contact outside of the game
---
* Raiding times will be Tuesday and Thursday from 19:30 till 22:30 (CE(S)T) and possibly Sunday from 20:00 till 23:00. Other evenings we will organise things as well, which will be discussed at a later date
---
* EPGP guild loot system
---
**What do we want from you?**
---
* Friendly and mature behaviour towards the guild and others
---
* For hardcore players your commitment
---
* For casual players your warmth and kindness
---
**What are the pillars of The Remains?**
---
* Being a close community
---
* Work together to accomplish common goals
---
* No mass recruiting, we recruit people with the same goals and attitude, not to become a zerg guild
---
* Respect, to eachother, to others and from others to us

the gear balance post AQ is so f-cked up that they would have to enforce an item squish into classic just to open the option for + content
---
Not to mention T3 was so powerful that it was still present in T5 and early T6 content. Including guilds like STARS killing Illidan when the Asia servers finally got TBC with half their raid still in T3
---
It will boil down to 3 sceanrios
---
a commercial success that leads to changes in a classic + way
---
a commercial success that leads to TBC as it is cheaper and a tested system (TBC trippled its subs and got the game to the 10mil sub mark)
---
a failure that will rot and eventually die due to the lack of interest. Unlikely but factually a possibility that has to be mentioned.
---
Only in the later version 'could' you hope to return after 10 years with no changes and nothing new to adapt/learn - and only if the servers are still running
---
I play an hour every couple of days and hope to knock out as many world quests as possible. Sometimes I schedule an evening and play... TWO hours! (9pm to 11pm) instead of watching TV and/or conversing with my wife.
---
Some games are just timeless. Like if you want to play Ocarina of Time in 2019, you can just fire up your old N64 or download an emulator and get right into it. 
---
But WoW in it's original state (and all MMOs in general) became a different game as time goes on and expansions change the base of it, until now there has been no official/legal way to go back and play them.
---
Unfortunately, a lot of modern games have DRM will become unplayable in the future. Diablo 3 for example, it's all online, even if you are playing single player. In 20 years time when the D3 servers have been shut down, you won't be able to play it again unless Blizzard make some substantial changes to the client. They really did consider that consequence of DRM.
---
A large part of what I am looking forward to in Classic is that everything you do or obtain will matter, you can obtain a good set of gear, take a break from the game for 5 years, come back and your character will still be relevant. Classic WoW will be around for a long time, as long as there is enough interest for at least one server.
---
I played rogue in TBC and can confirm this was possible, my source is only my memory though so.
---
What are the advantages of grid over Z/X-Perl?
---
It won't be hard for MC-BWL-ZG-Ony-AQ20, and won't be impossible for AQ40. I'd however expect most pugs to be cautious about meme specs. I.e. stick to healing.
---
Or find a guild because the game is a team game :)
---
sure, but getting 5 years of subs with literally 0 effort is a more logical choice for blizz rather than devoting hundreds of developers to creating new game content for classic, that might not end up being popular.
---
Opimal mouse-clicking UI I guess :D
---
What bullshit? People have different ideas, expectations, playstyles, etc. I think that it's very positive that all the different points of view can live in relative harmony in this sub. What OP did was literally "Wow this subreddit, some of you play Alliance and some of you play Horde, MAKE UP YOUR MIND!". Many of the things he said are not even contradictory. Priest is the top healer and druid/shaman/paladin will be expected to heal. Those are not contradicting. 
---
For some people, the game has a very fierce competitive aspect (those going for server first, high rank in PVP) while some other people can/want to play at a more relaxed pace, focusing on other aspects of the game (in example, leveling and the social connections). They are not at odds as there's room for both.
---
Who the fuck is telling you hunters are trash tier PvP? lol.
---
Ive just been soaking in the diskussions on this sub the last months.
---
2-3 hours IS casual for such a game. 
---
You only can do a single dungeon in that time IF YOU'RE LUCKY.
---
Other times you either sit near a mail box and do auction or maybe 2-3 quests.
---
Easily count 1 hour of this as flight travel.
---
And it is very very casual.
---
Something real starts at 6 hours a day, actual proper gameplay is 12-14 h/d.
---
Then why post about it on a public forum? Keep it to yourself next time then
---
What are the advantages of VuhDo over Z/X-perl?
---
&gt;do not have a place in pugs
---
Of course they do. Not many spots but 2-3 are mandatory for a pug, because tranq.
---
&gt;they are pvp trash tier
---
Lol. Can't be more wrong.
---
\[classicforums\]: Tanking as anything other than Warrior is illegal and also impossible and also meme.
---
no one will invite you ever and also you are a memer and also this is very bad and very inefficient and warrior is also 4% more efficient and 4% less meme.
---
ps: warrior only tank in classic thanks
---
smart use of: Tidal Charm +  Ingi Granates + the gnomish net-o-matic projector = wayne naxx geared guys
---
Grid is old. Get Luna as your UI mod. It shows how much healing you'll receive or give per spell. Or get Elv-UI as I'm sure it'll get ported to classic.
---
what amazes me is that guilds kept us kids in back in the day.  i was 15-16 but i was an immature little shit lol, i played with 2-3 RL friends of the same age and we fucked around so much.  We were ok at our role in raids, but we trolled quite a lot too
---
our guild leader was a mother of 2 kids and i constantly used to say she was neglecting them and being a bad mother because i knew it pissed her off, and we got threatened with gkick quite a few times.   I'm told that a few of the officers actually didn't really like her and they secretly found our trolling hilarious so they kept us haha!  but honestly if i was making a guild now i'd have 18+ only, i'd just feel weird playing with younger people
---
Depends on how the servers play out. It may be hard early in if people are saving lock outs for their guilds. It will get significantly easier a few weeks after launch when people have their alts at 60 to run with as well.
---
I actually think that hunters are one of the best PvP classes but only in the first couple phases. Not being able to consistently raid will hurt you a lot and once people start getting BwL gear hunters start to fall off the scales. Only a couple hunters are needed in raids maybe 3 so it will be hard to find pug spots at times. 
---
With all that being said, hunters are a fun class and if you want to play one you should. Just understand that not consistently raiding will hurt you more PvP wise rather than the hunters actual PvP limitations. MC hunter loot will be OP in early phases. Plus, a bonus side is a lot of classes (mainly melee) don’t know how to fight hunters!

Hi, /u/alfatems

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cdfgfq/what_are_your_favourite_memegimmick_specs/). 
---
&gt;I hear a lot of people
---
Where? Mind posting some links? 
---
In any case, to summarize: 
---
* Hunters are really solid in PVP, especially wPVP. 
---
* In raids, they are fairly good until AQ, where they start to drop in the rankings compared to other classes because of scaling issues. Other classes get a lot more from each drop than hunters do, which means that at the end, they may get relegated to tranq/nightfall bots. If you just want to raid MC/BWL, you'll be fine.
---
* The class is really fun to play. The ammo and food mechanics are very RPGish and there's charm in making sure that when you leave town, you're stocked in both. The class itself has a high skill cap.
---
* There's a long list of bugs still pending. While some have been fixed, some remain and may potentially remain, as they are present in Legion and BFA.
---
Considering what you've said, hunter is indeed the best (or great at least) class for you.
---
If you are an engineer I would argue you will take the helm over the cane
---
Swapping weapons enforces a gcd
---
swapping armor doesn't
---
not to mention that the staff isn't exactly a best weapon regardless whether you look at it as a caster or physical dps class
---
How does hitting 60 early provide you with an enormous head start in the gold and gearing game? Am really just curious as I might consider doing it myself lol.
---
&gt;2-3 hours IS casual for such a game.
---
"Casual" has a pretty distinct definition, you don't need to make up your own for WoW just so you don't look like someone without a life.
---
I’m too rich to read this
---
ah yes, and if they’re going to where the money is would they rather
---
•release two expansions which were proven to be more popular than classic, basically 0 dev work
---
•release new classic servers every ~2.5 years which private servers have been doing for a decade without diminishing interest, also 0 dev work
---
•release something like classic+ based on guesswork from forum posts which would require hundreds of developers and they would have no idea how popular it is
---
 I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.

enjoy your deserter buff
---
For a PVE mage, how important is engineering? 
---
I plan to be tailoring + other. Does an mage need eng damage in raids when they already have aoe spells?
---
Heard enchanting is nice, but others say it’s a money sink hole and just slows you down for no benefit. What about just enchanting for the disenchant?
---
Also the people asking "I haven't played games since Vanilla, can I play Classic on my Geforce 6800 Ultra?"
---
8am here, nearly perfect. Wake up and enjoy a coffee then play 16 hours straight.
---
That will undoubtedly come in handy! Thank you
---
You could start minnig + tailoring and hoard the bars until you are max level and then switch to engi. Picking engi while levelling with no way of getting mats besides buying them is pointless.
---
it is casual. you are just SUPER casual.  playing an average of 2-3 hours a day is not hardcore. if you think so, you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
I’ve played way to long to read this peon message!
---
Yea I think it's gonna be the best bet... For some reason it seems blizz wants no hunters in classic.
---
 I'm still laughing so hard
---
\#1 Don't be afk
---
\#2 Don't suck at the basic's of your class
---
wait for it
---
\#3 Butter up the people who actually matter

... priceless
---
The only things that are missing in this cliché list is the ''bend over for the guild leader'', ''bring consumables for other more important people'' and ''bring conjured water for the cast classes'' ... lol
---
Saaaamme ,  and in doing so, I've found that I quite enjoy ff14. Everyone's praising it as the best mmo on the market right now, and I'd have to agree. Its unfortunately a very slow start and it's a bit overwhelming for newbies imo, but once you get past that initial jump, wow what a ride ;)
---
Were fishing pools in the beta? I know they weren't added until a later patch so I'm wondering if they'll be in phase one
---
His point is that the community on reddit is full of elitists trying to convince people what the right way is to play, that way will make SOME players enjoy the game far less or drive them away from it
---
So it's the classic experience then. Because I saw one hunter in a thousand players.
---
one of the
---
People are dramatic. Sure hunters have a few issues that need to be fixed before launch if we want them like they were in Vanilla, but even in their current state, they'll still do fine. Hunters are one of the if not the strongest solo classes in PvP early on in Classic and will still be competitive in the later stages too.
---
I've had the default screensaver for years. No more. Thank you stranger!
---
Is it possible to twink in classic?
---
Have you played back in vanilla?  No one will have alts raiding week 3 lol. If I remember right it took me a month to hit 60 and I was leveling every day.
---
Uh some people find fishing fun man. Some people like RPing in towns. One of the main draws to wow was how many things you could do. You could definitely PVP in 3 hours. Assuming you work and have a family or friends devoting more than 14-21 hours a week to any one activity is a TON of time.  
---
When I was 20 I could play like it was a full time job. That’s just not a possibility anymore, but it doesn’t mean I could have real fun playing...
---
&gt;-Stormwind channel district: prison and portal
---
That portal was actually supposed to be for player housing, a concept that was much later realized in the form of Garrisons.
---
They beat mages, locks all through MC and beat locks all through BWL. They do good damage early on.
---
I know alot of guilds will want one at least to buff warlock shadow damage.
---
good :)
---
It’s not mine, but thank you. That’s quite a compliment. I do hope to develop a theory so universally and critically acclaimed one day though. 
---
As for minor grievances, when do you start teaching your classes start? Always good to learn from experts.
---
you can also get an 18 slot bag from ONyxia, which also isn't unique. But, you have to roll agaisnt a lot of pople, so don'T bank on that.
---
Personally, I'd jsut go with runecloth and wait for travellers backpack drops, as a tailor though, you can easily make mooncloth bags yourself. Bottomless is simply too expensive in my opinion.
---
Note: you also have to be running at a high speed to ignore the trap, otherwise even with slower interpolation the server will record your position at the trap at least once since you are being in its range longer.
---
To me it doesn't seems like it's the same leeway range back then as it was on the beta.   
---
Can anyone confirm this?
---
Who cares? Just have fun and let others have fun.
---
why yes, people do share differing opinions on the internet
---
i ain't gonna sacrifice my health that much lol
---
My buttler chuckled while reading this post to me.
---
releasing TBC would be making the exact same mistake again. In my opinion, if anything is added after Naxx that wasn't in vanilla, it should be on seperate Classic+ or TBC realms.
---
Yeah but will a raid with 30 or so switch to English for benefit of the handful of nonspeakers?
---
A full clear yes but I wouldn't be surprised to see plenty of pugs up to Huhuran.
---
The high-end estimate of 2-3 hours a day is 28 hours a week, since I started working at my current job I've been averaging 27 hours a week.
---
Is somebody who spends 28 hours a week working out doing so casually? Is somebody who spends 28 hours a week learning Spanish doing so casually?
---
This is where perspective comes in. The person you're replying to is wrong in assuming that this difference is due to a _lack_ of perspective, but you're wrong for the same reason. There's no agreed upon definition for "casual" and "hardcore" in this kind of context.
---
Personally I think "hardcore" and "casual" have little to do with how much you play, and more to do with how you play. A random somebody playing League of Legends for 60 hours a week is very likely far more casual than the professionals playing for 40 or 50 hours, for instance.
---
It's pretty nice being able to watch a tv show at the same time tho
---
You already spent like 800-1000gold on an Arcanite Reaper, 450-600g for Lionheart, 400g for Stronghold Gauntlets (only if you splurge as it isn't mandatory). Lots of folks will pay another 50-100g to get their stuff crafted by a trusted crafter who has the patterns ready and set 10days into the server.
---
So one crafter having 50 people come to him for Lionheart and another 25 for Arcanite Reaper and you can do the math on how well this stuff sums up.
---
The 25.000g were for Titanic Leggings which is patch 1.10. 
---
However you still can make metric fucktons of gold early on via various means.
---
1. Playing AH
---
2. Running Maraudon incessantly
---
3. Be a knowledgeable tank running people through strat UD keeping unneeded crates and BoPs
---
4. Do DM:E duo runs (however this is Phase 2)
---
5. Hunter solo tribute runs
---
It really isnt hard to get couple thousand gold in the beginning if you know how and invest properly.
---
Remember, every 30s Elemental Fire will become worth 5g later on.
---
Every 100g invested into Elemental Fire will make you 1700g later on.
---
Any spec, regrowth - rejuw on tank
---
They were pretty popular in vanilla, so I don't see why not.
---
There's no real reason to waste 5 levels getting furor when you could be getting amazing +damage talents like savage fury or HOTW. I would even go into balance and get omen of clarity before taking furor.
---
I'm for expanding on Classic in a similar way to OSRS. Maybe also use a similar voting system for new content. Keep TBC servers separate if they ever come to exist.
---
Good guide. I think I would add one thing to it though, a small warning when it comes to taking two gathering professions, be it skinning+mining/herbalism or mining+herbalism, bagspace. 
---
 Bagspace is the biggest obstacle on a new server. On an older server I would go mining+herbalism in a heartbeat( have done it before and actually found it fine using a toggle macro like you described, you learn were nodes are so don't have to spam it all the time). You would earn gold quickly and could upgrade to big bags fast so bagspace is not a big issue.
---
 On a completely new server however bagspace will be a major problem for a long time. 14 and 16 slot bags are not going to available for a long time. People are not going to sell stuff like traveler's backpack in the AH until they themselves have a set of them themselves.
---
 Not sure what I will do myself. I had planed to mining+skinning on a warlock. Considering shards taking up some space as well the result would probably be I would be unable to pick everything up( can't return to a vendor or mailbox constantly) until I hit like level 35-40 or something and bigger bags are available. It's very tricky.
---
seasonal classic servers. new cycles, going through phases 1-6 again every couple of years. And seperate servers for classic+ or whatever else they might release for players who get bored, but on the same subscription, of course.
---
&gt;2-3 hours a day
---
That...is insanely casual
---
I just started this past week but I've got over a day logged on my archer already. I agree with the slow start but to be honest combat feels faster and way more interactive than vanilla WoW. Easier too, solo and group content has been a mindless breeze so far. I'm having a blast, and the fact that it supposedly gets way better later on is just icing on the cake.

2: These guys are literally not fighting back, this is not PvP, this is just PvE grinding.

3:  Blocked.
---
have your genetically engineered catgirls read it for you
---
You wont be invited to raids if your a meme spec because you need to tryhard to kill bosses but at the same time raids are so easy that 20 blindfolded monkeys can finish the raids.
---
What happens if the population of classic gets decided into three different games? TBC, classic and WOTLK?
---
What happens if those servers start losing their casual players because of population issues? What happens when the casual players start losing interest? You’ll get private server population levels filled with the more hardcore players. Those populations don’t really make activision-blizzard much money. Good luck keeping them open once you need to explain those numbers to your investors.
---
They won’t let their latest cash cow die - I don’t see any other way to keep it alive but to do a classic + system. There is a huge market for this. Don’t forget that WOW is a “live service” and people need content to return. How long will you be able to keep charging people for decade old content before the casual players start complaining? 
---
This sub sometimes forgets this game is carried by the casual population staying subscribed.
---
Keep in mind in burning crusade this was changed that only the people who were that profession can see and are eligible to roll on said item.
---
Thank you for saying what I was thinking. Have a great day :)
---
Oh okay that's good to know. I am eager to play, but I know I will never be following the big zerg so I would rather be able to enjoy the game under "normal" circumstances. If that's after 24 hours - great! I was concerned it might take a week.
---
&gt;quit BFA forever
---
I mean that's kinda true, I'm going to quit BfA until it's over. That doesn't mean I'm giving up on retail completely.

Cook? Clean your home? Shop for groceries/clothes/household supplies? Leave your home to socialize with people outside of WoW? Literally any other hobbies? I mean, FFS, shower?

How can there be *nothing* else to do outside of work/WoW/sleep/repeat?
---
Man, you had me on all of these comments until that last sentence there. I 100% thought you were serious.
---
Most of us are all in the same boat. We loved Classic. We really enjoyed TBC and WotLK. My guess is that they'll make progression to TBC and WotLK after a couple of years each. Who knows? One thing is for sure, though. They won't just sit on Classic and do nothing going forward.
---
My point was only brand new server is going to have very little gold floating around.  It will take quitena bitnof time for wealth to really accumulate.
---
Really? I always heard hunters were the most played in vanilla due to being an easy leveling class.
---
Watch the pure pwnage YouTube series. It’s kinda cool at set the stage for vanilla time.
---
Classic and TBC should be different realms. Keeping classic seperated from TBC would mean you could experience both endgames in rhe same evening. Upgrading classic to TBC would be a wasted opportunity.

People act like playing WoW is in a fucking vacuum and players are programmed like bots/sims. Most people aren't the top 1% where all these little details matter. 
---
God I can't wait for classic to release and tons of these people realize most people were like 14 years old when it came out and didn't have a fucking clue but had more fun than any other game despite it.
---
we're not talking about any hobby. we are talking about gaming.
---
He literally starts this by saying “According to this sub:” which means that he acknowledges that this is the ramblings of the 10% of the classic wow population that posts on here.
---
Its a pretty good combo. When the lock ahs thebvoidwalker you can go full feral. The lock will be able to hold aggro on 2/3 mobs and you can just beat them down. The occasional heal will help the VW stay alive.
---
First: PvP means PvP - if you can’t handle the heat, roll in a PvE server. 
---
That said, I suspect largely the reason this is happening is the impending shutdown of those servers. I’ve been guilty of setting up camp in RR and making life hell for the sport of it. Usually because horde queue times have been over an hour, and at this age in the server cycle it’s a good method to summon their level 60 mains for a fight. 
---
Nothing needs to be done to combat this - there’s already a solution: PvE servers.
---
Literally just "I made a game, did I mention I make games? Please ask me about my game"
---
I'm glad you enjoyed it onakaxy!
---
That sounds like a good plan!  The added money along the way as you level will help you afford your skills, upgrades, mount, etc (although don't under estimate the mount!)  
---
Then once you hit 60 you'll be able to buy a lot of the leather for close to vendor prices.  You could even farm rugged leather and sell it on the AH in order to afford the lower level types of leather since rugged leather will go for more money.
---
Oh, great catch newacount!  I'll be sure to fix that :)
---
we're not talking about any other hobby, we are talking about gaming. its one of the most time consuming hobbies. and 2-3 hours a day on average (that usually means an hour some days and lots more during the weekend), is casual.
---
Hunters are by far the easiest class to level particularly beast hunters that can pretty much watch netflix while their pet murders everything.  Because of this you get some truly trash tier hunters at max lvl who still have a newb level of skill and don't understand basic game mechanics or how to efficiently dps when every ounce of damage counts.
---
Fubar of course.
---
This addon changed my life.
---
...in raids
---
Why are we touching kids now?
---
Hunters dont seem to scale aswell as other characters so the more progress you make the less of an upgrade items are for you compared to other classes.
---
While lvling and in pvp(assuming you can kite) hunters are extremly easy and kinda op. I lvled a hunter to like lvl 52 on a private server but i quit because everything was so easy that it became boring for me. You will win almost all your pvp fights and questing isnt a challenge cause your pet can tank 2-3 mobs easy. Your biggest challenge while lvling is from 1-10 because you can get a pet at lvl 10.
---
It’s pretty laborious. Def spice things up by running some dungeons as you go.
---
The oldschool RS model I think works, and Blizzard should really look to the successes RS have had to base their Classic model on going forward. 
---
One of the most common complaints I see about Blizz as a company is that they dont listen to their fanbase, not sure how true that is as I dont normally weigh in on shit like that, I just like to play, but I think for Classic to be a success, they will have to really listen to the people who play the game about how to further develop, as they are the ones who know it best. Thats what Jagex do with Oldschool and it works.
---
Thank you for the reply! Do you have any idea about the farming potential for this setup? We thought it would be neat if we could earn gold together by farming and running lower level instances.
---
&gt;you should clear up the loot rules beforehand. I'd never fault anyone for rolling for the Spellpower or Titan flask, despite not being an alchemist. It's basically your epic mount, key for your guild, etc.
---
Yep, in a pug clearing it up beforehand is a must. Like you write recipes like these are worth so much that it's unreasonable to think that a pug group, people who don't know you, are just going to hand you their epic mount. 
---
 Back in the day I would have passed even when in a pug group but today knowing what I know about the game I just can't give away an item that is worth so much to a stranger. If it's talked about beforehand, that the recipe is reserved, it's another thing. If I don't like it I can just not join the group.
---
They were but they basically got shunned for 5 mans because noone wanted to deal with the famous "Huntards" or "Hunterloot". They got spammed with invites for UBRS though.
---
&gt;This is so true. I've had arguments with people here insisting that 2-3 hours a day is casual.
---
Everything is relative. What might seem hardcore to you might be different to someone else. If I'm a 50 year old woman who plays for 3 hours a day doing professions and world quest with no pvp or dungeons does that make me hardcore?
---
Damn, I need to step my game up. I'm still at 16 wives. Oh well there's an other 40 days or so to correct that.
---
I never rolled need to vendor/auction stuff. But apparently, if enough gold is involved, common courtesy goes out the window.
---
DAS, CM Storm, or Ducky
---
They say it the same as the reference client.
---
You need Wim. Thank me later.
---
Very interesting! Got a preferred prot build (with maybe a link) at 60?
---
not really, but for the first few weeks of classic I will be
---
Well, the STV and 70 billion rogues thing is not sooo wrong ...
---
Also, everyone is going to hit 60 2 weeks after Classic is released.
---
They said before the 13 August. That's all I've got.
---
Looks WAY worse on beta imo.
---
Good points in the video, but what’s with the completely unrelated background of some guy from some movie?
---
Dang, thats a pretty good guide, thanks for that!
---
Is it best to take one mob at a time or to dot one up and fear him away while killing the second? I guess three mobs would be too much with dotting 2 mobs up and fearing them again, while the main mob still deals damage?
---
exactly my man, exactly.  last time i played (last year) i was a resto druid and was consistently top 3-5 HPS with by FAR less overhealing than any of our priests and shamans.  on legacy logs during MC and early BWL (for that server) i was placed reasonably well on most bosses.  I performed better than tons of priests, palas, and shamans just because i tried.  I didn't even have the "best" spec, or play in the "optimal" way.  I had the regrowth crit talent and used it quite often for example.
---
these people that say "X class sucks compared to Y class" are moronic imo.  You don't say to a guy "rofl don't even bother going to the gym mate your wrist circumference is only 7 inches".  Situations are never optimal
---
40: "Finally! My pain is over."

"Fuck that, I'm not falling for this twice!"
---
This is why im buying the actual cartridge for games on my Nintendo switch even though the games are available on the store.
---
Hunters are amazing in pvp.
---
As for meters. Hunters beat mage/warlock all the way until 1.8, and even with them until 1.9. It's a fucking joke that people think hunters do bad, if you actually average up the dps  of all the raids from launch to naxx is cleared, hunter is gonna be just around warlocks and slightly below mage. 
---
And 2 hunters are obviously needed for tranq.
---
The worst thing about being a hunter is the competition for spots. There won't be as many raid spots for you as there will be for a mage, warrior, rogue or warlock. 
---
If you intend to pug raids and not join a guild? I'd say your chances go down drastically. Having no evidence for having done MC prior to a pug (BoP loot on your character) will hurt when they're very likely to get spam-whispered by hunters. If you also don't have tranq shot already? Sure, it drops before you need it, but still. Pugs want an easy and smooth run, and bringing in a person who hasn't done MC already is a risk. Not a huge one necessarily, but a risk they might not want to take.
---
With all that said, this is Classic. The raids aren't mythic+ uber mega hard mode. I think you certainly *can* find pugs. But if you're not on a highly populated server, you might not for several weeks at a time.
---
I'd agree that hunter is a good class for you. Great class for world content, and has a lot of options when it comes to soloing instances if that's your thing.
---
A bit of a joke on the “kill x to get y” quests, like why do so many of these boars missing livers!
---
I play feral and just heal.
---
I'm not even going to bother with a second set of gear while leveling. 
---
Just look at the stats of lvl 40 items, you are not going to miss anything important. 5-6 int isn't going to make a difference.
---
This is the dumbest shit i have ever read about wow Classic. It's one of the those moments where you're not sure if the person i joking, or just on a whole other level of retardation. Same vibe as SJW
---
This also means if you aren't trash as a hunter you are actually really good and you can get raid spots fairly easily.
---
A warrior that stands in the fire or pulls aggro is gonna get kicked. There is no "a good hunter is better than a bad warrior", because there won't be bad warriors in raids.  
---
Raid progression with current tier gear is hard. You don't get to slack except if you're getting carried later in the phases. There will be competition.  
---
Maybe wow is not all "ultimate 1337 players with all consumables \[...\]" (nice strawman btw), but if you don't farm your consumables or can't concentrate when you're playing, you're not gonna raid.  
---
That being said, again, I didn't even say you shouldn't play hunter because it's a bad dps, I'm just saying that if you pick hunter, you ARE gonna be bottom dps. It will happen. It's not a reason not to play the class, but it's just the case.
---
My sacrfice Will be the 6 Times i Will snooze my alarm until im already late for the third Time in the same week, or my gf pushing me outside of the bed.because m'y alarm rang 4 Time on 2 minute
---
Hey there rRobban, thank you for the feedback!  You're right, bag space is a big obstacle to overcome.  I'll add a section about that!  
---
I hadn't thought about the fact that 14-16 slots are going to be hard to come by at launch!  Usually bags are one of the first things I invest in, although I tend to make do with 10 or 12 slots until I got 60.
---
In going to be leveling a lock as well for my main and I'm a bit concerned about the whole shard thing.  I think I'm just going to limit myself to 3-4 shards at a time.  Even then, that's 3-4 slots less than other classes (plus a health stone!)
---
Absolutely, but I am not worried about the competitive people because I know they will enjoy themselves. The post is about this sub setting unrealistic expectations of what the game is going to be, which I think is harmful for new players.
---
As demonstrated countless times on every possible channel on twich and by every player who got into beta, layering is pure shit. It will be shit and remain shit for as long as they can think of implementing it and use it to fuck up the servers. It doesn\`t even matter if you or your dog don\`t have any idea about it.   
---
Its shit.
---
Will the items in the bank alts mail not expire after a while?
---
You are also going to be playing a priest?
---
I should probably mention that I am an ex "hardcore" raider in Classic and BC and I believe you are full of shit, sorry.
---
I have seriously no idea what you are doing in the first 2-3 hours after logging in if you only afterwards start for real. Afking in your city of choice for no reason?
---
wtf, they are really doppelgangers
---
Pservers were notoriously blizzlike these past few years: K3, Nost, LH, ND, SH all had 1x leveling progression and item drops.
---
However if you know how to make 50g-70g/hour the second you hit level 60 you will have quite a lot of gold to invest into other parts of the game like elemental fire/earth, fireblooms, Greater Eternal Essences, Large Brilliant Shards, Wool Cloth etc. etc.
---
Continue to suck at LoL
---
No idea really but I doubt it'll be an issue. The goal of laying was to make a playable launch that looks blizzlike, so blizzard will make it work that way.
---
A feature/mechanic doing exactly what It was intended to do.. hahahahahahah
---
I would say entertainment is different than other hobbies. I wouldn't call someone a hardcore tv watcher if they spend 2 hours in front of the tv every day.
---
Best OS. EVER.
---
I mean if OP is a good tryhard player *and* the pug leader knows it - but it's almost the same as being in a guild :D
---
That is easy, your arrow / axe / sword or firebolt destroyed that liver so it's unusable...
---
HOWEVER...
---
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR FINDING 3 ZEVRA HOOVES AFTER KILLING 17 ZEVRAS!!!!!   I aimed for the HEADS, never touched their bloody legs....
---
There will be 2-3 hunters in raid usually but like 10 warriors and 5+ rogues. So you will get geared quickier which helps a ton in PvP and also lowers the gap between you and real dpsers.
---
Also hunters are great for tranqs, kiting etc. Work on your class strengths, do not go crazy for dps while sacrificing utility. Always be ready with tranq, do good job kiting and take care of your pet so you don't pull addictional trash every minute and you will have your spot in raids (reputation is a thing, even in pugs, remember that).
---
My friend will play a warlock on a PVE server. We will play together. Should I roll a hunter or druid or paladin? I find paladins boring, I'm a okay hunter but I'm a quite good feral druid and love playing druids.
---
It is to express how i feel :)
---
Really excited for TBC in ~2 years.  Definitely going to be loving Classic until then.
---
Id say good hunters usually have to go the extra mile to prove themselves.   All that said a good one is scary in pvp and won't be ashamed bof their spot on the damage meters in pve.
---
Healers are always good when you duo but don't tunnel vision to much on leveling, pick the class you think will be most fun to play at max level.
---
Wow, all hardcore players are nolifers then.
---
You are greatly overestimating the voidwalkers manapool
---
&gt; but if you don't farm your consumables or can't concentrate when you're playing, you're not gonna raid.
---
this is so not true at all for average players and guilds.  In our guild last time i played we only kicked one person and it was cause she constantly complained and stirred up shit with officers and the GM.  We had a few slackers and they simply lost out on loot council, but if they were fun people and signed up/showed up then that's fine.  you really don't need 40 tryhards to complete vanilla raids
---
&gt; because there won't be bad warriors in raids.
---
this is statistically impossible.  even if only the top 10% of players performance-wise were ever in raids (which is definitely not the case) then you still have a relative distribution from 'good' to 'bad' within each class.  The 'good' hunters will do good dps, the 'bad' warriors will do lower dps.  Maybe in AQ and Naxx the warriors will still pull ahead, but the hunter dps will still be relevant
---
I aim to be top 3 dps in my guild in MC and hopefully BWL, i've already theorycrafted out my spec and gear which are both unorthodox.  Tested it on retro wow, where my dps meter didn't even count my pet properly and i was doing 400-500 on the raid boss dummy... without even dire maul items.  I'll be up there no problem in my guild
---
&gt; I didn't even say you shouldn't play hunter
---
yeah fair enough i was addressing the crowd with that really, people imply it's almost worthless to have in raids outside of tranq shot and kiting just because it does like 50dps less
---
Isn't the entire reason behind layering to help with overpopulation during the initial launch? Which is why its only around for phase 1 etc.
---
Yea the amount of people who bought a 1050ti over an rx570 or 80 is just sad lol, the 570 and 1050ti are the same price in my country but the 570 is 50% faster lol.
---
I love this.
---
I'm on the phone right now, let me get home
---
I'm 26.. I guess I can still get hyped :-D
---
How much of an upgrade is the whirlwind weapon for warriors? I'm going to be duoing with a priest friend to 60 and won't be server first but will be pretty fast. If I'm an efficient quester, is it worth the time it would take to do the questline with him helping, or should I just skip it?
---
Honestly with MQP you are still barely viable, druids can never be optimal for anything but healing.
---
There's a post showing the horde spawn from saurfang on this sub.

Maybe they'll remove spell batching in a post naxx world.

I'm in a Star Citizen group where I see people posting at least every two weeks asking if their spec will run the game, and they have a recent high end one. I'm not sure if they are trolling or bragging or just plain stupid.
---
I can go without sleep this night, it's fin.e
---
Summarize any sub, forum, or even trade chat and it's very easy to draw extreme conclusions.
---
Realize the loudest voices never represent the majority.
---
What? Hunters were fine to good dps through BWL and aq. You only need tranq shot for how many fights? There’s only a couple I can even think of. Is this really the meta now cause I’ve never heard this? Like basically what I got from this is hunters are good for mag and huhu lol
---
For classic, yes. If they're going to go down the same road as last time amd release expansions that make the game worse though, I'd prefer they just leave it as classic and not bother.
---
I fully expect people to be regularly PuGing MC. There isn't many gear check fights and enough time has passed that most people will either have Curse Addon or know what the mechanics of fights are. 
---
Things like BwL or higher, honestly it really depends how people figure out how 'geared' you are. It's easy enough to turn away the hunter in greens but if he's got a half mix of blues and MC epics? Still may not be enough DPS for Raez if he's not paying attention.
---
Can anyone tell me when it releases in eu (like germany/france) please? I saw two times already, is it monday to tuesday like midnight?
---
STVietnam is a vanilla thing.
---
You should just roll a PvE server if it bothers you so much.
---
Those lowbie ganks are usually the start of the giant organic PvP that happens in wow world PvP.
---
lol if you think you'd have a PvP trinket available every time you need to get Melee off of you.
---
some have to learn it the hard way lol
---
Everyone knows if you kill a Zevra the wrong way their legs explode. This is just basic knowledge.
---
I kind of disagree. I think it depends on how yo uplay/intentions and whatnot. I play guitar a couple hours per day because its summer holidays but I'm still a casual guitar player because I don't practice anything demanding I just chill and try and learn any song I feel like playing. In Overwatch, I would have considered myself a hardcore player when I was spending 3-4 hours a few times per week scrimming and looking over replays in order to improve and climb. Now in League, I play it for  a few hours a day, but a large majority of that is for fun with my friends playing casually, and I'd definitely consider myself a casual. I don't think its about time investment but rather how you use the time and your mentality.
---
Sure you can. I believe in you.
---
True
---
It's not clear yet how feral dps even with pummeler will fare, since there is quite a difference (up to 33% iirc) between pservers and beta in favor of the druids. However, the difference does get smaller with the level and it might converge on lvl60. 
---
P.S. please avoid the word "viable" it is a terrible term as raiding with empty slots also works.
---
Full feral is the build.
---
Like mentioned there is an etiquette for dungeon groups to allow the person with the profession to get the item (this isn't guaranteed as some people will still roll need) but typically it'll be asked of you to link the profession.
---
They can effectively MT most of MC and Ony.  
---
BwL wont work, but AQ and Naxx bear tanks are very decent !
---
Depends entirely what you want to do. If you're set on playing Druid, but want to raid, just spec 0/30/21 and heal. Most guilds won't care if you aren't more heavily specced into Resto since you don't really get much more by going deeper than 21 points. You essentially lose 10% to your healing spells and Swiftmend in exchange for 20% more intellect. That's a pretty solid tradeoff and why Heart of the Wild is considered to be one of the best talents in the game. 
---
If you want to PvP, 0/30/21 is also one of the most popular PvP specs out there, so you'll be set there as well. And whilst cat DPS won't really blow anyone away in raiding, it's perfectly acceptable in PvP. Druid PvP in fact I consider to be one of the most rewarding and fun elements of the class. You really utilise everything in your toolkit.
---
Pretty sure Monkey or CT used to do this already. I definitely had an addon that showed HP5 and MP5
---
How did you turn the game model into a printable file?
---
This is so old it's great, one on my favs from the past!
---
RIP Woodhouse
---
MCP is only needed if you want to DPS (with any sort of effectiveness) in PvE (raids specifically).  They’re not required for any other aspect of the game.
---
You forgot to capitalise Gaming. 
---
#RealGamersRiseUp
---
Yeah let me tell you right now that those hunters are bad. They can easily do 500-600dps on that fight in BWL gear.
---
I would almost agree with you had it not for how corrupt catholic churches are nowadays. Stereotypes sadly don't spring out of nothing.
---
There definitely needs to be some additional pumping involved. *giggity*
---
I don't know much about warlocks, what is it that makes the ones you mentioned so strong? Do I need to be dispelling them?
---
Don’t worry. Rogues still don’t have a chance against hunters.
---
Faerie Fire works that way.  They cleanse roots/snares but don’t disappear.
---
The smelting part completely clashes with my experience.
---
When it comes to ore vs. bars in the AH, what matters most is that you can use smelting to get skill points.
---
That means that ore will always be more expensive than bars, since you can get skill points out of it by smelting if you buy them right as you get the new smelting skill.
---
That's especially true for Bronze, which has 3 different smelting actions associated with it. Only those who don't need smelting skill points will buy the end product, so out of everything in the production chain, Bronze bars are the cheapest.
---
If anyone's interested in a Dutch (actually Flemish, but what's the difference right?) guild to run anything from world pvp to raids with, hit me up in a PM. We've got 45ish members so far and are a bunch of laid back dudes and girls in for some classic fun. Invite your friends too, the more the merrier. 
---
(Low effort message intended)
---
Totally agree. Classic + would be so cool.
---
10% dont fuckin bullshit
---
What class would Benedictus play you think?
---
Grid2 has way more customizability. atleast the current retail version does. If the full addon can be transfered to classic, it will be the toptier raidframe addon. (along with vuhdoo if that also gets transfered over to classic)
---
Grid2 wants a word.
---
\&gt;You will never see naxx
---
To be fair this one is probably true for me
---
I think a big part of this disagreement is why people keep repeating the dps discrepancies. Like, yea, a survival hunter will literally do 10% the dps of a min-maxed mage or warrior in AQ/Naxx.
---
In PvE? Only in raiding, because the DPS is almost the only thing that matters here. 1 hunter or maybe 2 is needed for Tranq. shot.
---
In PvE outside of raiding? A FANTASTIC CLASS.
---
PvP? A FANTASTIC CLASS.
---
So, you're great at all PvE except for raiding. You're great at PvP and you bring a unique utility only your class have which makes you valuable for raids anyway.
---
So.. Hunters are a great class :)
---
Fuck. I consider myself a big gamer and I don’t even play video games every week. 
---
I think you’re just out of touch with reality. 
---
Yes, I play fuck all compare to people who play “a lot”.  But gaming isn’t some magical beast that somehow is special and different. 
---
Someone who runs every day runs a lot. Someone who plays games every day games a lot. 
---
Someone who trains seriously for marathons and spends their weekends doing runs is hard core. Same applies to video games. Even if that mean you’re only doing 10 hours a week. 
---
Going beyond “hardcore” isn’t a reason to move the goal posts of hardcore, it just makes you a no lifer. Which is fine. But let’s not pretend it’s normal for someone with a balanced life to spend more than 14 hours a week playing video games or something.
---
&gt; Because ambushing that mage with 20% health left and 3 mobs on his butt isn't one sided at all?
---
But I don't do that.
---
Exiled [H] | NA (EST) - PVP | Wed/Fri/Sun 6-9:30* | Semi-hardcore | Loot council EPGP hybrid w/ decay + minimum
---
INTRO/ABOUT US:
---
We are a mature group of men and women. Many of our members are returning seasoned WoW veterans, some experienced through AQ40 + Naxx in original vanilla, some through raids of the latter expansions, others were high rated RBG + arena junkies. Some people are new. Our top 45-50 players will be our core progression group. We will then start building our second 40 man raid. At the moment, we have 60 confirmed members (not all of these players wish to raid with the core progression group - we still have room). Though we are a semi-hardcore guild, we aim to be one of the best on our server, keeping up with guilds that consider themselves "hardcore" and maintaining an active world presence. People will know exactly who we are.
---
We are a Raid first, PVP second guild, though have a very strong emphasis on PVP. We WILL be leading BG premades and world PVP raids on Alliance towns. We will create, join, or support our server's honor-cartel for those that are interested in PVP-only, once the honor system is introduced. You will find us dueling outside of Orgrimmar. We are looking for challengers. Bring your A-game :)
---
MEMBER EXPECTATIONS:
---
Age: 18+ 
---
Attendance: Show up early to raid, first pull @ raid time
---
Gearing: Be in pre-raid BIS gear, along with BIS enchants.
---
Pre-raid: Arrive with proper consumeables for every raid. You will be expected to know the raid encounters. Take time to read about, learn, and watch videos of them. Raid Leaders and Class Leaders and will be available for additional support and discussion, but YOU are ultimately responsible.
---
If you do not know what your class' BIS gear, enchants, and consumables are, we will tell you. We also have resources/instructions for boss encounters. We will help to prepare our raiders.
---
With that being said... We believe in building our members up, not be tearing them down for failures. A failure on a member is also a failure on our leaders and officers. A failure is an opportunity to make both our members and officers even stronger. We are only as strong as our weakest link, so we will do everything we can to prevent failures, but also make sure that any faults are ironed out and given instructions as long as the member shows effort and commitment to learning and improving. Nobody is perfect - everyone makes mistakes. Though, this is vanilla - it's not rocket science. Show up, do your job and have some fun with the boys (and girls) and then go dominate some alliance.
---
Loot
---
We will be using an EPGP/Loot Council hybrid, with main tank/main healer prio. We believe it is the fairest way to distribute loot with both systems balancing each other out while used together. 
---
Members will be able to earn some EP for simply farming materials for the guild bank. Amount of EP earned for farming still TBD. 
---
RAID SCHEDULE: all times are EST
---
Wed 6:30-9:30, Fri 6:30-9, Sun 6-9
---
Many of us have known each other for 15+ years. Some are family members and close family friends. We are looking for like-minded individuals to join our team of PVP-hungry progression raiders!
---
Thank you for taking the time to read about us. Please PM me you are interested or have questions.
---
Yeah competitive vanilla wow is like a competitive drooling competition
---
Does using a MIDI controller for WoW hotkeys require any roundabout trickery, software, or anything? I've been wondering about using one of these, since the plastic USB pedals on Amazon seem like they would break almost immediately.
---
&gt;The post is about this sub setting unrealistic expectations of what the game is going to be
---
These expectations are a mix of our past experiences (which differ) and the ones from private servers, which have had many years to polish the meta. It's true that it wasn't exactly accurate, but the retail meta won't be very different. And, again, people can play competitively, but you're the one extrapolating your experience unto others.
---
In example, for me, vanilla was definitely not "chill". I can, however, understand that my experience differs from the one that others had.
---
&gt; 400-500 dps is Average DPS for warriors in MC btw.
---
for the first 3 seconds until they die, at least in my guild haha but we meme around in raids quite a bit.  bloodfury + a couple of windfury procs....
---
i'm sure warriors will be beating me later in the game due to the nature of how they scale more, but people act as though hunters are hopeless DPS at all stages.  some other guy literally just said they do 10% of the dps of warriors lol
---
Not new to wow, but tauren warrior- mostly tanking dungeon from lv 30 up.
---
Right?  I remember in my raiding guild the druids were great healers.  Always top of charts and we even had to innervate the priests and mages all the time so we couldn't use them ourselves.  Not sure why all the criticism.  Only thing that sucked was no ooc Rez in 5 man's.

I don’t agree. I also think that “watch tv” is probably very poorly defined. My wife puts on the TV while she cooks, she can’t see it, she can’t watch it. But that time would be recorded as “watching” despite the fact it’s on for background noise like a radio. 
---
Not to mention twitter, texting, Facebook, working from home, studying etc all done in front of the TV. 
---
That time is not the same as playing wow. 
---
TV is passive.
---
All of them are fine. Lock/Druid is pretty underrated imo. Good AoE potential with Bear with Fire shield+Thorns and Rain of Fire. 
---
You also have the option of a weirder playstyle where you do affli+balance and dot everything up and just run. Corruption+Agony+Moonfire+Swarm is enough to kill mobs your own level. You kind of have that option with Spriest+Lock too, but it comes online a bit later.

But would you give DKs for that, because it's as dishonorable as ganking a level 20 because in both cases the players being ganked were entirely defenseless? 
---
In both cases it was utterly unfair.
---
Would you give all a DK once a group of 10 inflichts damage on one player? Because this is even worse than ganking a lowbie.
---
What about pulling mobs onto an AoE farming mage who dies to your pulled mobs?
---
It's pretty shite without
---
&gt;stay true to the principles of Vanilla
---
Yeah, stuff like layering is definitely staying true to vanilla. I'm not at all convinced that the team understands what made vanilla great.
---
Run the pet across the green shit, just like dps does ?
---
Yeah I realize I overlooked the reckoning in the title and just thought he meant a PvE and PvP viable hybrid.
---
But going deep prot on a paladin isn't really worth it. You're only really going to counter a rogue, warrior or feral druid. And having an offense that relies on you getting hit and crit isn't really a good idea. Especially how you need to not attack to drop your reck bomb.
---
next people will be remembering World of RogueCraft and Serenity Now.
---
I recall seeing a blue post that said the opposite -- that they would be releasing the server names before the release. 
---
Either way they're giving a few days to reserve names so server names have to be available then.
---
then you are obviously not a big gamer. Context dude, it matters. MMORPGs are the most time consuming type of game. So comparing it to running makes no sense. Why even compare it?
---
also did you mean that playing video games 10 hours a week hardcore?
---
WHAT? But everyone on reddit says druids cant tank and only innvervate machines for mages???? 
---
\*i'm a druid since 2004-2019, i know fine well they can, great to see some real evidence.
---
Alliance is the only faction you can raid with. But Alliance is ez mode for raiding, so you have to raid as Horde, because Horde is the easiest faction to raid as.
---
Paladins are a meme class but OMG have you heard how well Paladins can heal?
---
It goes on and on. Great post lol.

I'd go for a compromise. A MKP run only takes a few minutes. Keep a few in the inventory and use them if a boss has a  burn phase or maybe if it's a very promising try.

I did think like you when I first saw it (the same with [Mordor in LotR(https://www.tor.com/2017/08/01/tolkiens-map-and-the-messed-up-mountains-of-middle-earth/#comments), although [IRL Indonesia does look a bit like Mordor upside down](https://old.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/2oyveq/tolkiens_middleearth_on_the_bottom_of_the_pacific/)).
---
But actually, according to the *Manual of Monsters* (which is not canon, but still applies), those mountain ranges were raised by the then-benevolent Black Dragonflight to reduce eh.. race-mixing and wars.
---
&gt; It was not always so. Black dragons were once earthwarders, caring for stone and mountain and using their formidable abilities to cause the rise and fall of terrain. They were to watch as the world of Azeroth changed and to `maintain boundaries and lines of delineation between the races` so that none would fall to war over land. They maintained this purpose for a time, living in relative harmony with other races and shaping the land to better use.
---
&gt; Deathwing used his power over earth and stone to force obedience upon his minions. `He lowered the mountains and allowed the races to intermingle.` He ruined fertile land and destroyed other terrain so that the races must fight for food. Deathwing’s efforts gave birth to an occupation that has remained with all races since that day: war.
---
You're right. Sadly vanilla wow raiding doesn't hold a candle to the level of difficulty of even collegiate level drooling.
---
IIRC they fixed the pet pathing which was the biggest inhibitor.
---
Skarm has a video on it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BirMIEA1oVI). My spec in Classic will be [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505002130312215-05501310501). The reason why I take a couple of cat talents is that I'm planning on doing PvP as well, and I don't plan on tanking anything higher than dungeons. However, there's some flexibility in what you take. Some event spec 1/29/21 for a single point in Nature's Grasp for PvP, but if you're rolling Horde War Stomp can substitute for Nature's Grasp by giving you enough time to cast a quick Entangling Roots. 
---
Also, for general Druid stuff, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFE3UGAwEs) on macros, and this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6mt68/followup_to_10_button_or_less_a_casestudy_with_my/) for more macro goodness. There's going to be a hell of a lot of potential in macros for Druids in Classic; for example, they'll allow you to effectively drink potions in shapeshift forms by instantly shifting you to caster form, drinking, then shapeshifting back, all with a single click, and all at instant speed.
---
If you start the quest at level 30 and finish it ASAP, it's huge. If you can finish it at 37+, you can just farm the Ravager in Scarlet Monastery.
---
I put Elfwood up on this reddit about two weeks ago. Check it out, might be what you are looking for.
---
Not much practice needed, when we are going L12-&gt; instance grinding only. Well getting the few pre-q's done for weapon upgrades. Going to be quite boring other than that you have people to talk to in discord, but its super effective.
---
A potato can run WoW. You'll be fine.
---
While I would like either option, I do not see them doing both. This splits the community and leads to both player bases being miniscule.
---
Also, WotLK had the largest playerbase of all of WoW's history. Wrath support among this subreddit might be miniscule, but overall it is heavily clamored for and there have been leaks that hint they are planning on doing the original trilogy (classic -&gt; TBC -&gt; WotLK).

# &lt;Informal&gt; [NA][A][PvE][Semi-Hardcore]  MORNING EST
---
**INTRO:** This is a brand new Semi-Hardcore guild being made from the ground up. I am looking for dedicated people who want to get in and clear content. It does not matter if you are new to classic or a veteran, All I want are dedicated players willing to do what it takes to down bosses. If you can do this, I want you on the team.
---
**GOAL:**
---
\-week 3/4 MC clear
---
\-Clear all content quickly and efficiently
---
(example: phase 1 should be 1 raid night, except for off day ONY)
---
\-Clear Naxx, full T3 guild before BC release
---
**EXPECTATIONS:** I value maturity and honesty above all else when it comes to my members. I expect everyone to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave. I want everyone on and ready 15 minutes before raid begins. During progression I expect full consumables to help us get the kills we need. 
---
**LOOT:** Council and roll decay. Some loot is too important to be simply bought or rolled for. Others are not so much. So we will be using a mix of these 2 systems.
---
**SCHEDULE:**
---
**RAID TIMES** \- EST, MORNING

Berserking is undoubtedly awesome.

All top end game weapons are swords, alliance doesn't have "kinda edge", it's not even close man.
---
Fear ward &gt; Tremor, its absolutely mad that you somehow believe tremor to be superior. What?! How?!
---
Tranquil air can't even be compared to salvation, salvation ALONE makes alliance superior to horde in PvE all throughout vanilla, cmon dude. 
---
Alliance are far superior in all tiers, for all types of guilds, I don't care what you say that's just how it is. It's not even close.
---
Y'all have been looking for a guild for so long now. What's up?
---
You can have a dog though. Rogues don't get dogs
---
I think many on this subreddit started playing in TBC / WotLK which is why so many seem to want these expansions. But for the rest of us who feel TBC was the beginning of the end, I sincerely hope that your ideas gain traction in the community, even for those who began playing in the expansions. TBC is so different than vanilla, that I have a hard time understanding why anyone would want to ruin the game all over again.

"Arthas dead! I'M BORED!! Cata? NO, REEEEEE!!!"
---
Depends on your spec.
---
But usually you'll use either Sub Dagger MH, or Combat spec. Most rogues level as Combat, which is probably the best/most efficient leveling spec.
---
If your Combat, the MH weapon you use is the one with the highest base damage. So if you got a crappy lvl 15 green sword, and a blue level 25 dagger with higher flat white damage (flat damage, NOT dps), use the dagger in your MH. USUALLY, a sword will have higher damage and slower attack speed than a dagger, 9 times out of 10 (slower the attack speed, the higher the base/flat damage usually). Which is why you'll usually use the sword MH (or Mace, whatever is best that you got).
---
So if you're leveling Combat, use Dagger, Sword, OR Mace in your MH, depending on your gear. It really doesn't matter which one you use, as long as it's the best/highest flat base damage weapon you've got.
---
If you're leveling as Sub, then you're going to either dw daggers OR dagger MH with sword/mace OH if they give good enough stats (+agi, +crit/hit, +attack power).
---
Ay the UT collection one, I got one aswell they’re amazing
---
Das tight ma dude

Can you do elwynn next?
---
Just prepare to level insanely slowly guys, it's a slog but really enjoyable if you don't set expectations of leveling quickly
---
You can do it with Clique also. I did it.
---
I overwrited the same mouse/buttons combination for the "same action". One with the spell to cast and the other one with the mouseover macro to call the same spell.
---
/2 He doesn't know PepeLaugh
---
Absolutely, I've seen it happen countless times.
---
whats your reason for rushing to 60?
---
to rush a twink to 60?
---
please enlighten us 
---
sure if speedleveling is your thing go for it
---
it was an example to illustrate how mich time you can spend on one char.
---
pugs wont happen for a long time, unless you count the first 1-4weeks where guilds run mc and search for attuned 60es to fill up the raid
---
Not if he wants to raid!

**&lt;The House&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Progression**
---
**&lt;About Us&gt;** &lt;The House&gt; is a guild of friends and colleagues that are excited to come back and experience Vanilla WoW over again. Our members have a wide range of experience with WoW, from little to no experience with the game, to being part of hardcore raiding guilds, along with experiencing different expansions throughout the lifetime of WoW.
---
**&lt;What we provide&gt;** We want to build an inviting environment where the guild can grow together and foster the mindset of constantly improving yourself and your character. We are accepting of all experience levels of Vanilla WoW, it’s a game, we’re all here to have fun.
---
**&lt;What are we looking for&gt;** We are actively looking for members that want to progress through end game content, but not at a hardcore pace. Our members have lives outside of the game, so we want to build an atmosphere of a progression-based mindset, but without the 14hr a day dedication it takes to clear world/server first content. This would mean making an effort to obtain appropriate enchantments, bring consumables for fights we may need them on, taking advice from more experienced players to improve your rotations, and overall have a positive attitude.
---
**&lt;Raiding&gt;** Loot system: Primary focus utilizing DKP EP/GP, but with loot council when appropriate Raid Times: Our current raid times are tentative, but we’re looking at raiding Sundays and 1-2 times during the work week. Most of our members are located in PDT and CDT time zones. - Sundays @ 10am PDT/12pm CDT - Mondays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
**&lt;Recruiting&gt;** We’re actively recruiting all classes and specs. Our current roster is available here. docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11SwJzLCkaBUkC-kSb4CgqUHf3Kzp8bguZ230MyBYQ70/edit?usp=sharing
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/9jsKYD3
---
If you have further questions, please message me or join our Discord.
---
The biggest inhibitor is spell batching.
---
Having ice trap not go off when people walk right on top of it is ridiculous and absolutely *not* how it was in vanilla.
---
Money does not validate knowledge. 
---
If you buy a £5000 guitar, you're not going to know more about guitars than someone who plays a £200 guitar. It has no correlation.
---
Leeway works both ways, your arcane explosions hits larger area IF you are moving.
---
Just an insane amount of customization. Almost every single aspect of the frames, you can modify in some way. Moreso than any other raid frame.
---
**Raid Schedule: Tuesday - Thursday ; 9 PM ET - Midnight ET.**
---
Tuesday’s main raid night. Wed/Thurs for Progression. Likely only using 1 night a week for a long time as most content can be completed in a few hours.
---
**About :**
---
Our guild is comprised of a core of raiders from various WoW Classic Servers. We enjoy raiding, BG pre-forming, and wPVP. We are looking for players who want a stable environment with a semi-hardcore raid guild. We don’t enjoy waisting our time, or yours for that matter.
---
We believe in smooth and efficient raiding. Our guild has proven experience in all raids (except for Naxx).
---
**Our accomplishments:**
---
1. Multiple Rank 13 and 14 players
---
2. Experienced Leadership with pre-made BG groups
---
3. Experienced Core clearing everything except Naxx
---
4. Veteran Leadership - our leaders have been there and done pretty much everything in Vanilla
---
5. Active, friendly core available upon launch!
---
**What we expect:**
---
1. People who can make our raid times
---
2. People who want to devote time to improving as a player, but also their character
---
3. Show up for raids with consumes, enchants, and having read/watched strats
---
4. People who enjoy ranking and PVP - note this is optional
---
5. Must be willing to show up for 90% of the raid and have 300 engineering.

Voidwalker does not really hold threat all that well in classic. There's also a mana issue.
---
Private servers have been there for years, and I think people will want to play the official classic/tbc/wotlk servers for years, even without new content. Sure it isn't free like private servers, but there will probably be a lot more players on the official servers.
---
Posts like this more likely just don't understand reddit is more than one person with multiple varying opinions. 
---
It's a funny post, but these arguments are made by different people with different takes on different situations.
---
Yeah, there are just so many special cases, so the most common ones might have to do.
---
And yes, communication is often difficult
---
*Laughs in dystopian*
---
They are the optimal MT for threat based fights
---
The fact that it’s even a thing to say a class is not good without a 3 use item you have to farm from a lvl 30 instance is just the most absurd shit LOL. 
---
I’ve ran with Druid tanks for quite a while now since my RL buddy rolls feral and tanks all our 5 mans. Zero issues , now I would say raid tanking they are better as an off tank imo because of crushing blows. But to say you can only tank having X weapon is just some silly reddit min /max bullshit.
---
Once you can get your hands on a warden staff and your pre raid bis you will do just fine tanking at 60
---
There is a lot of.merit to this. I think it's part of the reason ElvUI has so much success in retail. It gives you pretty much everything you need barring damage/healing meters and weakauras.
---
I'm torn between which Hunter I'll roll. Night Elf or Trolls, they both have potential but it'll be down to what my friends want. So far it's looking like an Alliance first character.
---
Tbh if they arent as strong as in pservers, thats just good. They have always been extremely hard to counter with most classes, and pservers they were arguably one of the best pvp classes
---
&gt;faction only
---
There's an equivalent quest chain for horde from a troll in Kargath that lets you learn the same recipe.
---
Literally had someone reply in a thread saying that everyone clears MC in boe greens and there's no point to doing naxx since it'll be on farm the first day is released. Couldn't tell if he was trolling or just delusional.
---
No
---
This.
---
I'm so excited to crawl through the mud to level and achieve something, unlike retail where they offer me to be max level for IRL money. Long live the days of hard MMO's!
---
 Interesting. 5/5 Fel concentration can be reached at level 24. Seems early for drain tanking but I'm by no means an expert. If hardcore players have crunched the numbers I guess it will be the optimal way to go then.
---
 I enjoy the gameplay using the Void though. What I have done earlier is rush to 2/2 imp drain soul and then switch to demonology for 3/3 VW.
---
 Think I will go that route in classic too even if it's not the best. Respec to draintanking later on. If there is no option to macro delete shards using normal bags I guess I will skip rushing drain soul. Go 3/5 Corruption into 2/2 healthstone, 3/5 Embrace and 3/3 imp VW. That's completed at level 20. Play that for a bit and then respec into draintanking at around level 30 or something.
---
You've never played reckoning, did you?
---
You get stacks from every single crit, even spellcrits. The two main reckoning specs are holy reck and ret reck.
---
Holy reckoning is a pve/pvp hybrid build, which allows you to heal well in pve and pvp and do big burst damage with reckoning. The holy reck pvp playstyle is to just sustain yourself until your reckoning is fully stacked up and then unleash a 4k+ reckoning bomb. It works against pretty much every class unless they are very highly geared casters, who deal 2.5k crits.
---
Ret reckoning is a pure pvp build, which combines the basic burst dmg of a deep ret build with reckoning bombs. It's very specialized, but if used under the right circumstances, it's the most powerful burster in the game. It's just harder to use direct ret bombs here, as you can't afford to just sit there and heal yourself like a holy reck, but if you get a full reckbomb, you'll oneshot nearly everybody. But ret reck can also play like a deep ret for the most part and enjoy occasional double or triple hits thanks to reckoning.
---
Reck is certainly stronger vs fast attacking classes, especially ret reck, but it works against everybody.
---
I played BC on a computer held together by literal scotch tape using an AMD 4850 having to blow a desk fan onto it to keep it cool. These kids dont know about the struggle these days smh.
---
I agree. I'd say that he game really changes once they start walking around in Dragonstalker though. At that point they all become *very* noticeable since they're 80% purple with frickin bone spikes coming out the top of them
---
Payo was murdering folk with it in the beta duel tournaments. But that's lv40, so idk.
---
You're going to play effectively for 17-18 hours a day? Impressive
---
it's almost as if 100k people are on this sub and have varying opinions and experiences
---
Lol at the ”youre already lost if they get to your deadzone”. Thats a whole lotta bullshit. They still have a wide range of cc to deal with that, and even with the new ”leeway shenanigans” they are one of the most powerful pvp classes there is.
---
Mage is the winner in terms of both Utility and Damage. Warlocks can summon and offer pet utility and health/soulstones, but Mages bring unlimited food and water, the best CC in the game, and very respectable AE damage.
---
Two possible leveling builds I’d consider for  dungeons are your typical Frost AE build (which picks up chill on Blizzard for added Control) and a lesser known “dungeon Arcane” build which I believe has the highest damage potential potential in a leveling dungeon group.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2502050310031531-5002313102-003
---
This build focuses around beefing up Wanding and Arcane Explosion, then adding PoM pyro and buffing Fireball and Flamestrike at later levels. I’ve never personally tested this spec, but if I were playing Classic in a group of 5 committed to dungeons only, I’d spec my Mage this way.

**Black Fantom Depths:**

# Fantom
---
i think they meant like just for the end there lol
---
Link what you think looks good. If it's just for WoW Classic, you won't need a beast.
---
The usual path one will follow as a hunter in the end game is:
---
1. Preraid- Blackcrow LBRS crossbow/AV crossbow
---
2. MC&gt; Rhokdelar bow from Ancient Petrified Leaf quest line from Executus
---
3. BWL&gt; Ashjre’thul Crossbow dropped by Chromaggus
---
4. Naxx&gt; Nerbuian Slavemaker Crossbow dropped by Kel’thuzad.
---
OFC this is just a guideline path
---
Xbow of smiting is pretty accessible
---
To make this even MORE classic, I am moving back into my parents basement... Just like when the game first came out
---
Awesome thank you! The talent builds are much appreciated. Great info.
---
Half the people in this thread are unable to spell MCP correctly. Can you really expect reasonable advice from someone that cares so little about their post?
---
Op-check out these guys- they are both experts in the class and DO respond to questions.

Yeah I'd like to see a breakdown of active hours watching compared to background noise. I have Netflix on all day on the weekends but I might actively be watching 10% of the time.
---
The point about druids, pallies and shammies is kinda true. Priest are generally better healers and you can't raid as any of those unless you're a healer. However resto shammies chain heal rank 1 spam is great for group healing. There is a spot for ONE enh shammy in any given raid provided that they have Nightfall, which is gonna be really damn expensive to get. 
---
In pvp elemental is great and same goes for ret pallies and all druids though. As for streamer drama, well I don't have to worry about it since all the popular streamers play on US servers and I play on EU.
---
No, that's totally different than killing a lowbie, because the level 60 can come back and get revenge.
---

Are you interested in a full desktop (Tower, Monitor, Mouse, and keyboard)? or a laptop?
---
I would like new content added but carefully...  
---
My prefered method would be to keep the slow ilvl progression from the vanilla raids. Increase the level cap by 5 just to signity a new tier, this will make previous content a bit easier due to scaling against the bosses, and keep the slow ilvl progression.  
---
Expand the old world and slowly move into TBC and have the progression go slowly, the reason why things got out of hand was level jumps and huge ilvl changes.  
---
All raid progression should require previous gear so that you have to progress through the content. have some dungeons that might give some off set items but no gear on par with the high tier raids.
---
Hunters, especially dwarves and orcs, have every advantage against rogues, provided you're somewhat PvP specced.
---
If you lose a 1v1 to a rogue, you either got outplayed quite massively, the rogue got very lucky, or the rogue outgears you a lot.
---
this would make you behind the zerg
---
Did I just get whooshed?
---
Thank you for the response! Assuming I get stuck in the pack, would you recommend staying Fire over Frostbolt spec?
---
Almost all of the dps increase from the xbows is from their slower speed, which is so you can not clip your autoshot while using Aimed Shot. As long as you can find a slow enough bow (3.0+) there's not a big difference, however there are very few such bows (or xbows or guns for that matter).
---
Personally I'd say if you want to use certain weapon types for roleplaying/aesthetic purposes you're not really the min-maxxing type to begin with, so maybe consider a spec like BM/Survival and use arcane shot instead of aimed shot while focussing more on melee weaving? It won't be as good a dps as using aimed shot (probably 20-25% less in fact) but you might end up having more fun.
---
**&lt;IRONFIST&gt; -- Horde -- PvP -- North America Central Standard time -- DKP -- Adult/Casual**
---
I'll make this short and not toss a bunch of BS fluff your way. IRONFIST is an adult guild. What does that mean to you? Well, **we understand you have a job, family, kids or a life and those take priority over a bunch of internet people**. We also get that you play the game to have fun, and not listen to a bunch of toxic people talking crap and ruining the experience. So, with that said we are pretty laid back and understanding that shit happens. We are not kicking you out for missing raids and honestly we do not care what spec you roll, just that you are having fun.
---
**Toxic people** on the other hand. **We remove them**. Most of us are in our 30's + and honestly, do not have time for that crap anymore. If your intent in life is to flex your internet peen, then go somewhere else.
---
**We raid on Tuesday and Thursday (around 8-1030pm CST)**, and we plan to run other events and PvP as well.
---
Our loot system is a modified Zero-sum DKP with out of raid gains for doing things that help the community such as: Running people through dungeons, PvPing, contributing to repairs or contributing to consumables etc. The OORDKP is \~5 dkp a week.
---

---
**&lt;Shut Up and Color&gt;[NA][Horde][PvP]** We are a semi-hardcore raiding and PvP guild planning on weekend raiding, world PvP, and battleground premades. Our guild is primarily age 30+ adults.
---
**Raids: Saturday and Sunday 3pm to 7pm EST / 12pm to 4 pm PST** (very likely we won't need this much time once we get some gear until AQ). Optional weeknight evening raids for 3 and 5 day reset content may also be planned. 
---
**Loot: Loot Council** for 40 man content. 20 man content and PvP items will be /roll. 
---
**Expectations:** We want to complete raid content efficiently to not waste people's time. We expect raiders to be on time with appropriate consumables in a PvE raiding spec. We would like to start raiding 1.5-2 months after launch and expect raiders to be 60 within 6 weeks to support this. 
---
**Recruiting:** We are looking for people interested in any or all of our guild activities, as well as more casual players just looking for some people to run dungeons and bgs with. 
---
**Current raid needs** (for casual or PvP members we are recruiting any class/spec):
---
Fury warrior: medium
---
Other classes/specs: closed

Ahh yes, maybe blizzard will fix that and give everyone pets.  My warrior needs a priest pet.
---
Seal fate daggers is sooo overrated compared to a 16/12/23. I mean its fine but you can do better.
---
Context dude, it matters. Relative to my social circle, people who like video games will go months without playing. 
---
Yes, wow and mmos in general require a lot of time. But I know dudes who are gym junkies who can’t make time for the gym every day. 
---
The idea that spending a *couple of hours daily* on a hobby is “casual” is laughable. 
---
Sure, on the scale of pro gaming through to hobbyist, 2 hours a night on wow is low tier. But it’s not the lowest tier and pretending the baseline is ~the same commitment as a part time job is a joke and that’s the whole point of this post. 
---
Why compare video games to running? Because they’re both hobbies.
---
A desktop for sure, and i would need everything but my $500 budget only covers the pc really. I can get away with a cheap mouse and keyboard for a bit untill I have a bit saved to get a quality one.
---
Pirated server scum are such entitled whiners.
---
The actually classic client has BfA as backend, anyway it has the old maps in the client. Old Outland / Emerald Dream / Azsahra crater .... 
---
My deepest hope is, blizzard finish this things, they are didn't back in the days, and bring this as after-naxx content. Without new 10 level to do, or something like "here we go again to bc -&gt; wotlk -&gt; cata".
---
What does that mean?
---

30 guild runs and zero drops. Doesn’t seem pretty accessible. But hey, don’t let that stop you from downvoting. Asshole.
---
&gt; 3000 players per layer equates to 500 people in each starter zone, and that's assuming a perfectly equal split of races. Crowded, but definitely manageable.
---
when does this every happen Duratar will easily be 1000 in this example, same for ewyn forest
---
What do people write these novels on here????
---
Lots of great insight in your comment, thank you. Im hoping/assuming a more organized/mature community within classic would be able to make 'okay' pug progression, but we shall see
---
These are available at Uniqlo, they have an entire Blizzard collection including Hearthstone, Overwatch, Starcraft, and there might be some Diablo but I don't remember. I have like 8, they're super comfy.
---
Collapse sounds promising! Ret Paladin!!!
---
Sure, but the people who play ~10 hours a week aren’t likely to be auto piloting like that. Maybe they are, but if you’re so glued to wow you don’t step away to eat, you’re not playing a “normal” amount of video games.
---
Sorry, I didn't make myself entirely clear
---
For whatever reason the boat needed multiple stops before it eventually took you to GM Island, one of those intermittent stops was the boat flying in the air somewhere in Stonetalon
---
I believe if you google "boat to gm island ownedcore" the top result is actually the one I used or one similar to that, it mentions the boat taking you to multiple places
---
Just a quick search yielded this.....thoughts?

according to this thread 3 different raid frame add-ons are by far the best haha
---
not really, also there is always a zerg, the size is just different
---
&gt; Scatter, Wyvern Shot and Freeze Trap all sharing DR.
---
Was it like that in vanilla?
---
I love learning scaling techniques/new bar transitions and just playing those casually on my bass here and there. I think I've gone months without even playing a song before
---
ahh the good old people should be able to play the way they wanna play, as long as its the way i say is fun
---
The meme spec thing keeps me up at night. I want to be invited to groups, but I also don't want to be the 9th Mage in a 40 man raid. I also know that classic raid bosses don't drop tons of loot and I hate the idea of never gearing up because you're constantly competing against several people playing the same class. I still have no idea what I want to play and this is a huge reason why.
---
Blizzard PR isn't an argument.
---
&gt; Everyone should play how they want to play.
---
what a concept, seems this sub hasnt changed much lol
---
I think they had to bend the game a little bit to make the jokes work and thats fine. In the end its not a guide its a comedy show. I loved it 3000.
---
I think you'd be better off making seperate thread and ask there, higher chance you'll get a response.
---
&gt; You will never see naxx
---
But after two years, everyone will be fully decked out in Tier 3.
---
Blizz confirmed at least scatter+trap share DR on 1.12
---
I am in the Classic+ camp with one caveat ... now ilvl increase. I think they can add loads of cool gear that alter the way you play your character (with cool abilities / set bonuses) without adding tons of power creep. I also think they can add content that makes the "meta" a little more interesting (instead of trying to make all classes "viable" and therefore making them slowly all the exact same ... they make content for all sorts of different classes).
---
I deleted my original warlock at level 55, couldn't play him. Now I know why, thanks for guide, gonna resurrect Charzilla in Classic. Lok Tar Ogar!

---
Thanks for the help! Ill give it a try.
---
i am still thinking if i want to go heal again or go warrior tonk ? .... sign
---
That's because he was trying to right click his mount buff to dismount, before attacking. It was very common to see people struggle to do something as basic as dismounting back then. Most people refused to play with addons and vanilla without Ezdismount is a very different game.
---
Hey, let me float a hypothetical by you. I don't get off work until around 22:30-23:00. All other things aside, would I even have a chance to get invited in raids coming online late pretty much every weekday? Or would we be wasting each others time and resources?
---
I would look at a cheap AMD AM4 board (\~B450) and a 2600 series CPU, they are clearing those out now with very competitive pricing. GPU could be a Nvidia GTX 1650.
---
Actuall age to of most classic players, nice.

Hey, I stayed with a Ross in Britain back when I was a kid. Is this you Ross C?
---
Considering there will be 20 rogues 19 warriors in every raid hunters are greata
---
I dunno people were pretty shit in vanilla i think it could work but then again fuck knows what your dps set is if any
---
Not sure how addons will work in classic but generally some form of:  
---
\-Totem timer  
---
\-HealComm (Shows your incomming healing to other healers with the addon to avoid overhealing)  
---
\-A good Raid UI (I prefered Luna on pservers as it had HealComm built in but I didn't main a healer)  
---
\-Damage Meter (Setting it to Damage Taken so you can keep track of who is eating shit at the moment)
---
\-Snowfall or a variant of it (Cast begins on key press not key release as usual)
---
Probably many more, but those are a few that come to mind, though keep in mind, I don't know how many, if any, are being fit for classic or will even work with classic's new API.
---
Almost certainly, yes (I'd be very surprised if you couldn't open the case or the motherboard didn't have a pci-e slot, though it doesn't specifically state it).
---
Though IMO, if you are tech-savvy enough to open up a pc-case, click in the graphics card, close it back up and install the drivers without somehow fucking it up, you are tech-savvy enough to just build your own pc and save yourself some more money (or at least get a lot more bang for your buck). Go check out /r/buildapc or /r/buildapcforme /r/buildmeapc /r/buildmeadesktop etc.
---
Ok thanks for your help!
---
Thanks again and I’ll be rooting for you in the world first 60 race
---
"Absolutely" fits nearly always as an answer.
---
I've changed class so many times now. Even tried on pirate this spring and got beta and tried Shaman, Warrior and hunter.
---
So far I've managed to change from Rogue -&gt; Druid -&gt; Mage -&gt; Warlock -&gt; Druid and then decided on Shaman. For weeks I wanted Shaman. Now all my friends and GF wanna roll Alliance. So back to Druid.. And Warlock..
---
But now I feel like Rogue..
---
Assuming you mean server time - in which case, you won't be home for the first half of the raids, possibly more if we factor in the time to get home etc. That's a bit too much to miss im afraid. I think if you work that late, your best bet is to look for late night raiding guilds - im 100% sure i've seen at least one pve guild that did late nights, let me have a look and ill edit this post with a link.

Well, I played vanilla on an RP PvP server and I was always allowed to play feral, even when I asked if I should go healer or not. We had a semi-casual raiding guild and nobody really cared what specs other people had even when dps-meters displayed the offspecs lagged behind in dps.
---
Now, it may be different because "offspecs are freeloaders, wasting other people's time" memes are actually taken seriously on pservers.
---
Luckily for you, I think the average community in Classic will be different. There will be a few elite guilds striving for speed runs and world firsts. But below that, there will be a good number of casual raiding guilds for whom fun and community counts as #1. This is the type of guild that may ask you to spec healing during progression raids or for some fights, but generally don't care about sub-optimal specs as long as it's only a handful.
---
No problem
---
Can we take it down a notch? This has always been a thing.
---
I am a Ross C... but this may be a 1 in 26 coincedence because I can't really think of a kid staying with us.  what year was this and what's your name?
---
&gt;Blizz couldn't have ~~people having fun with off meta stuff~~ *obviously broken mechanics* so that's probably why it was nerfed
---
Me: "no u"
---
Priest, 2 locks, hunter and warrior starting out SM:Cath (I'm one of the locks). The warrior is an idiot, sticking in arms stance with his 2hander, we dps can't do a thing without pulling agro since he's also puling them 4 at a time. The priest is yelling at him to do his job, but he keeps posting damage meters showing how he's really carrying the group and we don't know how to play... Then we see in general chat "hunter LFG Cath." Insantly the priest kicks the warrior, invites the hunter and says "this is happening." The warrior bitches a bunch before getting booted from the zone by the game.
---
So the hunter comes in, we run with 3 hunter pets, an imp, and 4 dpsers. Between pets tanking and hunters kiting, control is no problem. Meanwhile the priest is just going nuts with Holy Nova. The mana efficiency of hitting 3 tanking pets, 2 hunters taking damage, 2 warlocks who are life tapping furiously, and 4 enemy targets is off the charts. Fastest Cath clear of my life.
---
I'd second that that would run it.
---
I think it’s more reasonable to define casual and hardcore by comparing one’s time investment to that of the average person playing. 
---
The baseline time investment for different hobbies is different based on the nature of the hobby. I would bet the average hardcore runner and guitar player wouldn’t play 12hrs a day due to physical limitations 
---
I would expect the average person who consistently plays Classic WoW and doesn’t quit to be playing around 10 hours a week average. 
---
The nature of classic WoW demands more baseline playtime than other hobbies, unless you’re just okay with leveling and doing some dungeons which I find to be pretty boring. If you have only a handful of hours a week to play games then I think there are hundreds of better ways to spend that than playing classic.
---
I was a shaman when if first started playing in 2003 and I'm going to be a shaman now.  I played a lock a bit, and raided as a DK. But shaman Imo is a class the plays vastly different in Vanilla than it does in later expansions (also it's pretty neat that it is faction exclusive) and I just can't imagine maining as anything else.
---
The only thing I like better about tbc than vanilla is the class balance. Every role that a class was supposed to have was viable.
---
Honestly if they are still looking after months shouldn't touch 'em with a 10 foot pole.  Likely could never keep them happy : x.
---
This sub has turned into nothing but a circlejerk in the last few months
---
It's also only on your base healing. So you only loose like 40 healing per tick of your rejuv, and 40 healing per healing touch.
---
Is there any other UI that TKing made that you might have kept?
---
NugEnergy. It’s not the prettiest addon, but it does exactly what you’re looking for. 
---

---
Can't wait for meme spec guilds to clear entire raids.
---
I feel like there are 3 types of players who play Hunter.
---
1) Those who think the class is "easy" so they invest little time in how to play it optimally / efficiently and are rarely skilled / dedicated players (90%).
---
2) Players who know how to play the Hunter but still struggle getting all of the macros, rotations and "if this, then that" type macros - these players will be great in the long run (9%).
---
3) Absolute beast mode players who have all their "drop macros" down to a T, know all the best pets, where to find them and how to utilize them and are near perfect when it comes to "weaving" auto shots. There's only a handful of these players on every server (1%).
---
This is me
---
I blame common core and double think.
---
Priest. Druids suck
---
What's wrong with that argument? I used to play 100+ hours/week, now I'm going to play casually few hours a day except weekends totaling in 40-60 hours/week.
---
dont even need max engi for sappers
---
Thank you. I played a druid in BC and wrath and just not sure if that is why I want to play one but I know it was very different in vanilla.
---
I asked it because, Pitbull unitfram 3.0 (TBC-era) got that feature. With my priest, in AV, I casted Pain on everyone who was targeting my raid members. I ended up with over 1000HK (at least 200HK over the 2nd best). And then, Pitbull 4.0 came out and they removed this feature. I would like to have something similar. Never found satisfaction after than. :)
---
Everyone says Mage is better AoE.  But doesn't Warlock AoE do more dmg just is horrible in soloing bc its all fire based and can't control the mobs in open world?
---
No, fresh starts are fine. Can't give blizzard liberty to mess the game up.
---
Just a shame you don't get a sp boost from blood fury in classic. But it does provide potentially far more AP with the vanilla version, too. Huge boon for fury warriors.
---
They don't even reply. But I've seen this same post on discord and here every week.
---
Thanks for the insight. Ill check it out!
---
I love both classes too and Druid is my fav. PvE healer out of the two but Priest is definitely my fav. in PvP. Priest's tool kit is really well rounded both offensively and defensively which makes everything a little bit less of a struggle.
---
Druids have a few drawbacks. They're susceptible to dispels, have no 1.5s cast like the other healers do, and no real defensive cooldowns for their group other than being able to peel a little bit with feral charge and an occasional root.
---
Yea, but those are different roles.
---
I must caution that  Bear form is/was unrealistically overpowered on Private servers, doing 30% more DPS than classic beta bear form, scaling to only 87% at lvl 60. It does throw off how bear druids perform.
---
I don't understand the love behind the 0/30/31 spec. You lose your only burst heal (from Resto) Or your big "group" love from LotP, you lose efficiency for shapeshifting, and you lose Nature's grasp. 
---
You can 1v1 decently as 1/29/21, but make no mistake, you give up a lot to be able to do "everything" in PvE.
---
This is classic though - there will be a lot of hardcore players who can carry most meme specs like feral-without-MCP. Unless you're running cutting edge content and/or raiding, you won't need many consumables.
---
I must ask - Why go feral if you can't run the item that makes it "work"? Why not roll a Warrior/rogue who doesn't need the consumable farming hours to be efficient?
---
Don't roll pally unless you want to heal man, I leveled one to 60 on private server and quickly realized how boring it was. Rerolled mage instantly
---
He looks like he had a great time though, good life choice right there.
---
Yeah, I've played it.  I know you can get a charge and immediately use it, but the way to play it is to hold onto charges and drop them on a target.  Thus, you stop attacking to wait and drop your reck bomb.
---
Didn't say it didn't work against everybody, but it's more a counter to rogues/warriors/druids that hit you fast and build reckoning charges fast.  You're not going to be building reckoning charges fast against a mage or warlock nuking you from a distance.  Maybe you use the rogue attacking you to feed charges on the healer you're attacking.
---
Being honest, I would actually expect less coordination. Pserver players are usually all of a similar mindset and definitely have a larger percentage of skilled raiders all consolidated on a few big servers. Classic, on the other hand, will have a ton more people, many brand new to WoW and Vanilla, meaning you're not going to have as many strong players in one area to lead and organize stuff.
---
You won't see many pugs clearing AQ40 or Naxx. It just takes too much coordination.
---
In PvE you will heal with both. PvE heal specs are playable in PvP, but you wont be good alone.
---
Astrologysts announce the year of Classic. Mage population decreases by 90%.

**TGIF is Recruiting for 1-night/week raiding!**
---
NA-PvP | Friday | 10pm-1am EST | Semi-Hardcore
---
Discord: https://discord.gg/zeUCYFm
---
DKP Based Loot System (loot council for legendaries)
---
Recruiting: Holy priests, holy paladins, warlocks, and other exceptional applicants
---
Intro: TGIF was created by a few typical, mid-30s, former raiders. After searching for 1-night a week raid guilds, we found none that fit our mutual availability...and so TGIF was born! TGIF was created to provide busy adults with the opportunity to see Classic WoW's raid content with the most minimal time requirements - 1 night, 3 hours a week (even during progression). We understand that the limited raid hours may result in slower progression in the later phases of vanilla, but we're excited to build a community and progress as efficiently as we can during our raid-time. Also, we think that there are probably a lot of other talented players out there who want to tackle Classic, but don't want to have to push work, sleep, or family obligations to the back-burner.
---
Expectations: Given the limited schedule, we need to have strong participation and preparation. We require a 75% participation for raids, though we are flexible with RL schedules if something comes up. We will start raiding as soon as we have a critical mass at 60, hopefully 2-3months after launch
---
**Schedule: We will raid Friday from 10-1am EST (7-10pm PST).**
---
Optional Scheduling:
---
Organized PvP Premades
---
PUG Raiding: 40man raids will be hosted on Saturday/Sunday for any unfinished content, and no TGIF preference given to those who can or can't attend.
---
20 man raids TBD
---
If you are interested in joining, please join our discord or send me a PM with questions. See you in Azeroth!
---
same here.. I was 100% sure that I was gonna roll UD mage.  Then I thought about UD warlock because that was my main in vanilla.  But I will be playing alone most of the time, why not go hunter?  But hunters scale badly.  I will get into groups easily if I play priest?  There's going to be so few tanks that people will be begging for my tank warrior to group up with them.  I'd love to be a stealth rogue and brew my own pots as herb/alch and vanish into thin air when I feel threat.  
---
Morning after, rinse and repeat.
---
And no parents to pull out the plug!
---
Sure:
---
ARMS TREE:
---
Deflection 5/5 (5% Parry chance obvious choice)
---
Tactical Mastery 5/5 (retaining 25 rage points when you switch stance is mandatory for stance dancing)
---
Anger Management 1/1 (In addition to its tooltip this talent generates 1 point of rage every 3 secodns, which is good at pulls
---
FURY TREE: nothing.  
---
PROTECTION TREE: we'll focus at first at going down the tree.  
---
Shield Specialization 5/5 (required for Improved Shield Block)  
---
Improved Bloodrage 2/2 (required for Last Stand)  
---
Toughness 3/5 (Those 3 points could be also placed on Anticipation for extra defense and avoidance, but I'd rather go for effective Health first)  
---
Last Stand 1/1 (it's a nice "oh shit" button, and also allows you to survive damage bursts you don't quite have the gear to live through yet, 10 mins cd is a bit punishing but well, most big cds in vanilla were LONG)
---
Improved Shield Block 1/3 (the second charge is the real benefit here, you don't really need to place anymore points here)  
---
Defiance 5/5 (bonus threat is always good)  
---
Improved Sunder Armor 3/3 (also results in bonus threat, most useful at pull)  
---
Concussion Blow 1/1 (required for Shield Slam)  
---
Improved Shield Wall 2/2 (your shield wall goes from 10 to 15 seconds. That's HUGE. 30mins cd but at least let's milk it for whatever we can)  
---
Toughness 5/5 (more Effective Health, yes please)  
---
One Hand Weapon Specialization 5/5 (more threat, thanks)  
---
Shield Slam 1/1 
---
TOTAL 51 points.  
---
The 9 points left are kind of a whatever you prefere.  
---
Anticipation gives you up to 10 defence. It equates to: -0.4% to be critted, +0.4% to be missed, to dodge, to parry and to block. So it's 1.2% pure avoidance (miss+parry+dodge), the block is negligible because of shield block and reduces the chance to be critted on if for any reason the shield block charges get eaten up. Strong talent imho.  
---
Iron Will is another interesting talent, at 5 points it gives you 15% to resist stuns and charms. PvE wise that amounts to stuns. I'd say, it's a good quality of life talent, being stunned sucks, but since it's not reliable you'll have to gear accounting for incoming stuns anyway, so you can skip it safely.
---
Improved Revenge  is good, I'd at least take 1 point here to at least have a chance, you can invest more if you want.  
---
Improved Shield Bask is the same thing as Improved Revenge, I'd put at least 1 point here.  
---
Improved Taunt is another good QoL talent, with at least 1 point you can Taunt for 3 seconds, Mocking Blow for another 6 seconds, and then Taunt again for another 3 seconds and the mob will stick to you. Your healers will appreciate this talent.  
---
You can also go and take stuff from Arms now. mainly Cruelty for extra threat,
---
Thanks for your help.
---
pfft fuck tywin, i bet he was a prot pally main tanking raids cuz he was GM.
---
Why? You can't gank druids and rogues if they don't wish to be ganked.
---
Lowbies can't gank level 60s if they don't wish to be ganked.
---
Seems that you should punish 60s as well as druids and rogues.
---
ill go mining / engi as a base and once i hit engi 300 with a small stockpile of grenades/sappers/pseudo-jeeves ill drop mining. 
---
herbalism after that to sustain my pot addictions.

Couple looking for semi-HC, or above casual but not HC guild.
---
tl;dr: prot warr and holy priest duo (one with massive wow experience, and one with no wow exp at all, but boy does she have motivation), alliance side, semi-HC, EU timezone
---
ME:
---
- male, hungarian, 31yrs old
---
- human protection warrior. Flexible enough to be happy with either MT or OT role
---
- 12 years of xp, out of which 6 was on private servers
---
- raid leading and class leading xp, interviewing xp, loot council xp
---
- cleared everything up to 4 horsemen, came to finish what i've started
---
- willing to take up on more responsibility. I like the management side of wow, not just the button mashing
---
HER:
---
- female, 33yrs old
---
- dwarf holy priest
---
- around 2 weeks of experience... yes, this is Her very first time ever playing wow. She cleared Deadmines for the first time yesterday. I envy her :) Multiple years of xp in various other mmos, such as Metin2
---
BOTH OF US:
---
- raid time should be around 8pm to 11pm EU time
---
- 2 raids a week with an optional 3rd or 4th would be the best, but we are also fine with 3 times a week if it speeds up after the progress period
---
- pvp server preferred, but willing to change our minds for a good offer
---
- ingame, we wish to focus on pve with regular raids, and guild 5mans
---
- similar attitude to our playstyle. We had our time in HC guilds, farming 4 hours a day for frost pots, rumsey rum, felwood flower, etc. We are not looking for such. You can expect us to bring necessary consumables, like elixirs and mana pots, resistance pots, flasks, but in no way we wish to go over a certain point.
---

Hope to hear from you very soon :)

The „two continents only“ point is probably one of the most important ones. The original two kingdoms made the world of Warcraft feel like a world. Everything that came after made the world effectively smaller. We got „Outlands of Warcraft“, „Northrend of Warcraft“, etc. but it stopped being the „World of Warcraft“.
---
Ideally, new high level zones and quests would lead you back to old places, where new areas have been opened up for the new content. New places to discover in old places would definitely make new content really interesting.
---
I know theorycraft v.2 does on private servers, but idk much about classic addons yet.
---
Do you not know what an outlier is?
---
It's a ~7% drop, bad luck dosen't make something inaccessible.
---
Nonsense, you will heal and that will be the end of it.
---
both will not be good alone? Ugh thats tough. I was giving that edge to druid with stealth and bear form and all that.
---
I was told that odd striped zevra hooves are bad luck. But it’s hard to count all the stripes when they are alive and kicking you.
---
Do triggered affects use spell batching? because I don't believe that's how it works. Thinks like traps and flare(once down) no longer batch but do checks at certain intervals to see if anyone is in range to trigger the event.
---
So flare would originally get batched on it's initial cast, and unstealth anyone nearby at that time, then afterwards during the 30 second duration, it only checks for others at certain intervals. So it could be possible to stand in a flare then macro a vanish into cheapshot before the flare interval could trigger, since vanish isn't on the GCD allowing both vanish/cheapshot to happen simultaneously.
---
That said, there is one particular PC that seems to be on a pretty major sale. ArsTechnia has an article listing some of the deals. Try using camelcamelcamel.com (an amazon price checker) to make sure that anything that looks like a steal is actually a steal, though. All three of my last prime day purchases turned out to be permanent price cuts, so I'm always wary now.
---
you sound like you are missing some obligatory cc ... shaman didnt get hex until later
---
Thats why I messed around on pservers the last couple months. I decided I hate playing every vanilla class other than rogue and mage and picked rogue from there.
---
Why is it that your circles are more into tbc than vanilla? Have they started with tbc or before?
---
Still less than private servers having 3000 or more in each starter zone.
---
This is launch day durotar 101: make a beeline for sarkoth. Finish cutting teeth on your way back to town. Ding 3 with turn-ins of sarkoth2 and cutting teeth. Grab vile familiars, lazy peons, and (optional, skip/don’t finish if zerged)-scorpids+cactus apples. Hearth or die back to valley of trials when done with lazy peons and VF. Head back to cave for counterclockwise loop finishing medallion (group for tag if needed) and thazril pick. Hearth if you didn’t do so previously, otherwise die back to camp for turn-ins, ***or*** do a little trick and death warp to razor hill, grab quests, hearth back to VoT, turn-ins, grab senjin breadcrumbs on the way out. Accept quests in senjin, and so on...
---
Tl;dr—sarkoth is the first thing you do, without question. Under no circumstances is it a “level 3, maybe 4” quest as you put it. If you make it to level 3 or 4 and have not done sarkoth, yes, you need to skip it, because you fucked up and are behind the curve and need to catch back up.
---
Cry more
---
He will do less tps but as a starting tank you’re going to care a lot more about not dying than keeping a mob off some random DPS.
---
Almost all of them, but we'll get there.
---
I’d rather tap Thor, I guess?
---
I love that you believe a 93% chance not to drop means you’ll get it if you believe hard enough. Look, that is one players real life experience and is a legitimate point of reference in the context of “easily accessible” and just how many hunters will be walking around with it.
---
ahhh i never did an American Exchange unfortunately!  first trip to the US was 2015 for a wedding :O

that would have been one hell of a coincedence!

If you have the profession and will learn the recipe then you roll need

If you don't have it...roll greed

Warlock
---
&gt; Leeway means that you can be mounted running across the top of the map in STV and you can still hit someone in booty bay.  
---
&gt;Layering means that when you log in wow will be single player, and only if you spam "invite asmongold layer" can you see other players.
---
accurate
---
&gt; having to blow a desk fan onto it to keep it cool
---
I used to have to do this too to play WoW.  Then I learned I could clean out the built up dust on my CPU fan and didn't have to have an external fan blowing on it all the time.
---
Don't forget that we also want to the devs to make new content for Classic.
---
Most people you know sleep 12 hours a day? Lol
---
Warriors dont have a better uptime. A fury off tank will do more dps than they lose by having the hunter wingclip
---
It's a hybrid spec that just happens to be top-tier after you have 30% crit.
---
Okay awesome.  My friend is rolling mage so I eventually want to go PI spec to boost his numbers so we can /flex on other mages lol but thank you for all this useful information. You are helping me make a decision for sure.
---
Which class do you consider the worst class for PvP? I don't just mean meme spec, I mean overall classes.
---
/r/unexpectedheroesofmightandmagic
---
Are you seriously going to use an inferior weapon due to RPing ?
---
*SMH*
---
You forgot the part where the game is only for the hardcore true vanilla players, but welcomes new players
---
&gt;You will never see naxx
---
Also, everyone has completed AQ40 and Naxx in a top 0.001% guild and killed every boss in about half a second. 
---
You can't kill anything in pve without the 10000 world buffs and consumables available to everyone and if you don't grind your life away and spend 3 extra hours every raid night getting these buffs you can't raid, you can't do dungeons, nobody will talk to you and you should uninstall because you're trash. In fact, you won't be able to even kill boars without at least rallying cry so just hang out in town until then. At the same time, you can raid at level 30 in full gray gear because vanilla raids are so easy and you don't even have to try at all.
---
Further, any change is a slippery slope towards Classic ending up like BfA. In-game clock/calendar? Please, you might as well add the LFG tool in already. Fixing exploits and bugs that were removed from vanilla in the first place? Not on our watch, gods damnit, next thing you know classes would be homogenized and LFR will rain down from above to rend our souls and turn azeroth into a desolate wasteland. #NoChanges... Except remove leeway and spell batching so people can hit rank 14 in STV on day 2 of release by doing world PvP. After all, they were crap in vanilla and we don't need them anymore... But #NoChanges. 
---
Also, the only thing that matters is the community aspect of vanilla remains intact, but if they change the way a crag boar walks around dun morogh at all NOBODY should play or will play the game because Classic is therefore ruined.

To build on that, if you don’t know anything about building head over to /r/buildapc and there’s a ton of people and do a search on recent builds in your budget, and read the replies
---
Buy me a drink first
---
Got my 3 days as well, ended up spending 3 hours on making a UI, then logged off again.. Can't wait for Classic!
---
Play on a EU server and raid during the day
---
You can probably clear all of MC with 40 ret pallys. There are some Rag kills where the tank is halfway up the damage meters.
---
If you don't mind turning into animals, I think that from what you've given to us, as far as information about your intentions go, druid shall be more suitable.
---
Especially when it comes to world-pvp. The option to stealth, breaking snares and simply running away means you'll be incredibly hard to kill.
---
The things priests can bring to the table, that druids can't, are also quite nice (manaburn, offensive- and defensive dispells) but they are of little use in situations where you'll find yourself outnumbered and outleveled, which is really common in World-PvP.
---
Druids also have nice hybrid-specs with the various 0-30-21 builds.
---
&gt; As far as raids are concerned (and this is in order of importance)
---
You forgot the most important one.
---
- Can you find people?
---
Are you me? I had Gforce but yea, a literal fan blowing into the open case to play BC. Lich King kept crashing so it was either build a new rig or quit. Didn't have the money for a new rig at the time.
---
A casual alcoholic. I like that, I’m going to use it.
---
Why would he quit his good guild to play with a bad one?
---
Odd logic
---
In a little over a month, we will all be doppelgangers on that blessed day
---
If he dies, he dies
---
Smart choice
---
It requires xpadder and a little setup but I made a controller config for my wife that works with our xbox and steam controllers.

Dungeons have phat lootz. For warrriors, who are very gear dependent, those phat lootz will help tremendously in the questing and grinding process of leveling up. Tanking at level 30 is not considered "early". There are dungeons starting at like level 16 and up. If he was an alliance warrior, there are some really nice 2 handed weapon drops in the Deadmines dungeon, which can be tanked starting around level 18.
---
LR is never better than Trueshot+BM talents, unless you’re either bot using a pet and get trueshot given to yoi.
---
Engineering is the master profession.   If you want to be a serious raider or pvp at level 60 you should have it

Here's a little video I made during my time aoe leveling as a mage:  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_KXdfFnXV6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KXdfFnXV6A)
---
It is very much doable but the current melee leeway mechanic is making kiting very difficult. You got that as well as spell batching which also adds another layer of difficulty. Most of the time you have to play it safe by pulling fewer mobs.
---
Depends on what kind of PvP you're doing. Warriors are unquestionably the worst class in 1v1 but wreck face with a support team.
---
Fuck I didn’t see that there’s a post just like this 20hrs ago
---
I actually can't wait to keyboard turn all the time and drive people crazy. They'll hate me but I'm only enhancing the accuracy of their vanilla experience.
---
Yours?
---
Friend bought me a month for 8.2
---
I think I took 12 portals in the first 30 minutes of questing.now we have a running joke about portals. Now that I'm relatively caught up in gear it's pretty fun, but I just do arenas and RBGs.
---
Damn casuals, I'm staying up until August 37th!
---
Who comments on a post that they were to bored to even read?
---
I would take the lock for dungeons, they just bring better utility.
---
I mean ret pala is a good fit for Jaime since he is handicapped and all
---
I have a 4 year old laptop that ran the stress test just fine, don't worry yourself too much about the quality.
---
Why would you be in westfall as horde though
---
Horde have a super low level dungeon in org. RFC. And from what people tested in the beta the mobs are easier to kill in dungeons than they were on private servers meaning with how good people have gotten at wow over the years it ends up being one of the most effective leveling methods if not the most.
---
Ive been playing retail to satisfy me pre classic. I started 2 weeks ago and i havnt played since TBC. 
---
I feel i need to defend retail here: it is extremely unfun for the first 10 hours of gameplay. I hated it. Now 40 hours in I am loving it and plan to play alongside classic.
---
I dont know how they fucked up the initial experience (especially if you use 110 trial) but its horrible. 
---
Not saying everyones gonna like it but I can say it takes a number of hours to get into.
---
Hmm, I am not on the internet for the first time! I know how these battles work.  
---
No u
---
See I played a druid in BC and wrath and loved it.  I have never played a priest but have always wanted to. I love healing so both are good for that.  I will honestly probably end up leveling and playing both.  Thank you for your comment.
---
This guy thinks real life experience of random people who are more likly to go complain on the site when they don't get it, than actual percentages....
---
I just started, level 6 so far. My first impressions are it being less than exciting.
---
I've played a tiny tiny bit of private servers, just from 1-12, and on a race/class combination I wont play for quite some time in classic. Gnome mage for me, since I plan to play orc warlock at first.
---
1. It leads to thazril pick—an easy, fast-respawning, already on your way quest that gives 1s50c. That’s a massive amount when non-casters are aiming for a vendor weapon upgrade, or any class wants to train skills at 6. The only other quest in VoT that gives gold is cactus apples, and that has no follow up, so I would skip it first every time. 
---
2. With a counterclockwise circuit, you can complete lazy peons, scorpid tails, cactus apples, and vile familiars without any backtracking. The only two that are mandatory are lazy peons and vile familiars. If you get to the end and have completed those two but not scorpids/apples, that’s fine. Die back to turn-ins and pick up thazril pick and medallion. You can finish scorpids and apples on the way to the cave, die out the back to razor hill, pickup quests, and hearth back to VoT for your 4 turn-ins before your run to senjin.
---
&gt; All of which are wrong and against the rules.
---
Again, no.
---
\[Orcish\] "culture" /spit
---
Yeah I believe it’s for the Arcanite Dragonling. 
---
The higher your engineering level, the higher it’s level. 
---
Even though I’m healing I need one to help max DPS.
---
Oh goodness, this will be me...
---
Found the Russian
---
IMO, yes.  If you're able to devote that much time to gaming, you're a hardcore gamer.  The game doesn't matter.
---
The great Sultan has appeared
---
Recently re-subbed.  And started playing my dh again which i only got to 120 then quit. In a week ive Got 415 ilvl. Flying. (Had part 1 done) some of the New raid and some mythics. All in 2-4 hours daily only. 
---
Now its certaintly not Classic, and never will be as fun, but i dont see why all of you are hating on bfa.
---
Toastie Maker. So you can make some healthy(?) food fast.
---
You realize MC is so easy it's a joke?
---
After ZG, BWL should be a lot easier and possibly puggable.
---
Yeah, I was thinking of playing it as an alt so it would be prot 5-mans and some ret pvp/pve. I assume that that is possible :p And if I really like pally, I would heal occassionally for gear to be used in other specs.
---
 I will be playing casually anyway so it will take a while before I start raiding and will be avoiding hardcore players/guilds. I just want to have a fun and relaxing time, I don't need to clear MC as fast as possible of something like that.
---
extra stamina and stomping always seemed like an amazing fit for a warrior
---
I dont understand these grief posts, just play the game
---
none
---
I feel privileged belonging to that 0.01%.
---
I was considering getting a PC upgrade to a 3700x and 2080 super, but then I look at my 6700k/980ti and it's going to run Classic fine and plays The Division 2 (only other game I'm playing now) perfectly fine.  Probably won't need anything crazy for the time being.
---
I totally understand how you feel!
---
Sadly there are fewer PVE guilds than PVP, and even fewer late night raiders. I think your best bet is to check guild discords &amp; keep an eye out closer to the launch day
---
In the early game nothing will be puggable.  Later down the road you can do MC, Ony, ZG, and AQ20 with pugs.
---
Are we talking a real pug or some high end guild running their alts through bwl?
---
Two days playing with friends? Because that's my reality! Lmao
---
Well, to be honest ... TBC was a better game than vanilla, but vanilla was the better RPG of the two. The world just felt (and was) way greater, the prevalence of world PVP and the substantial amount of elite quests made the world more dangerous (especially on PvP servers).
---
The best game (imo) would be vanilla with some TBC (or even WotLK) tweaks to gameplay. You should definitely try to get them to try classic out. I'm sure they'll enjoy it, especially since you seem to be a rather tight group.
---
God have mercy on our souls.
---
but if you find yourself a healer to level with you you'll be a god
---
Hate my job. Have extremely high anxiety. Just want to play the old game I grew up with.
---
Anyone from pservers (for whom the vanilla is being made for at the first place) wants spell batching. (At least i would be surprised, if someone does). Most people wanting spell batching, never experienced it at the first place. To satisfy both sides however, it should be lowered to 200-100ms. Game will feel much more responsive, while keeping the unique interactions in pvp. If it doesnt get lowered, people will cry about it, once they try it and it will eventually get changed later
---
Rages and goes to sleep
---
Pending if they announce a TBC: Classic at Blizzcon this year.  But that's probably my plan, just start rolling alts and gearing them up and get a taste of all classes in the era.
---
Thats casual since you dont mind doing other things for fun while sacrificing progress or efficiency.
---
Yes, I"m with this. The Naxx gear starts to get a bit crazy and I would encourage a slight nerf to that gear while still keeping it better than AQ40 and allowing for the raid to still be completed.
---
Any new gear implement would need to have this ilvl as the cap. No gear could exceed this level as it just starts to get absurd.
---
I agree with some new 10/15 man raids and some new 5 mans. There are many possible locations for these raids to be plugged into. You can make the gear try to fill in whatever holes there may be for all classes. Have cool smaller sets (3-5 pieces) and maybe new crafting recipes.
---
Problem is if they use the same way as classic we will have the end of WotLK. It had dungeon finder, 2 / 4 raids were at best mediocore, power creep is real (loot and story wise)... I don't like that idea at all.
---
*flash of light* x∞
---
Hunters are the easiest class to level and get by but one of the harder classes to play well.  Therefore a lot of people assume hunters suck because most of the people playing them play like a turret.   Hunters won't top dps meters and will get lower and lower on them as other classes do more and more dps, but in dungeons and raids hunters bring a lot of tools and can save many wipes by kiting/traps/pet and probably the best class at pulling because of FD when you accidentally get more than you wanted.  Same for pvp, hunters can be lethal if played more intelligently than most hunters will play.
---
In aq40 for example, in addition to the aspect of the wild, i will always take hunters with me despite the low dps as a hunter who can beautifully and quickly pull trash is an absolute form of art.
---
NE is the best alliance starting zone, you're gonna enjoy it
---
Wow, what a great help.
---
Bobby B approves of this meme.
---
Base this, y tho?
---
WHY HAVE I NOT SEEN YOU? WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?
---
This guy gets it.
---
Warriors auto attack 15% faster and can spam hamstring just as well as a hunter can spam wingclip.
---
And no, warriors don't lose nearly as much dps as decent hunter would. Hunters aren't made to melee, they have no way to scale melee damage
---
Exactly, that's why it really doesn't matter what dps specs you bring unless you're trying to speedrun it.
---
I saw someone stating MC on fresh Private Servers is getting cleared week 1 on a regular basis. Still not sure if this is true because people nowadays just know what to do or not.
---
Both can heal and PvP with 1 spec. For progression you should respec, but that is like 2 weeks per raid release. So like 8 weeks.
---
Druid PvP is a lot of patient DoT usage, kiting and abusing bear form, with the added bonus of great mobility for flag carrying or holding bases. Priest PvP is dispelling, you will always be with the group, healing a bit but mostly dispelling. Priest are much more teamfight based Druid shines more moving in and out of them as appropriate.
---
I don't want content.  
---
I do want all the graphics to be redone like BFA is doing in their war front areas.  It would be a massive interest to play the old world of Warcraft with BFA style graphics.  They are doing the same thing with WC3, and I see lots of other activision games getting the new overhaul recently.  It would mean the world of Warcraft would be new again if they had BFA textures, doo dads, and world terrain instead of the art assets they made back in the very early 2000s.
---
I’d have Tywin Lannister as my GM any day of the week.
---
nah, it's not a feature bloat. this shit sounds so cool! you'll be an actual tracker and this sounds much more fun than a don on the minimap
---
Oh it will be cleared on the first one or. 2 days that's for sure. Just not by your average guild
---
Yes I did look at a couple of heart of the wild builds and NS builds that could handle both PVP and PVE. Thank you for your comment.
---
Definitely planning on using this. Thank you for your efforts!
---
Litteraly me. And my wife is playing priest too, and horde is "ugly" she thinks.  I either going mage, lock or warr.. im about to just let my wife decide what i will play of the three. Lol
---
Isn't it great?
---
Look at you getting triggered because someone joked about your favourite game.
---
Except when he defends kid touchers
---
14-32-5 for leveling and 21-30-0 for endgame is what I'd do as a heal-priest.
---
The difference between pvp and pve is not so much the number of talent-points in each tree but what to actually spend them on. There's several talents about you resisting effects or damage or getting some benefits of being hit or improved mana-burn. Those are usually useless in PvE.
---
So for doing both you'll usually take PvE-talents that also have some benefit in PvP. Like lower mana-costs, stronger buffs, more healing, etc. but you don't spec aggro-reduce.
---
Anyone trying for late game is likely to get Ash.
---
For the stats, chance of no drop is:
---
&gt; C=(1-.7)^x , where x is number of runs.
---
So if we look at 100 guilds running 15 times, 66 of them will see 1 or more Ash drop.
---
By the stated 30? 89 one or more.
---
So yeah the 11% that run 30 for squat have it rough.
---
If we assume 3 hunters per raid, within 15 runs 22% of hunters trying will have Ash not even counting doubles. (Obvi at meter tryhard 2 it's 33%)
---
I've been playing on pservers a bit to test stuff out in WSG and it's REALLY helped to lock down what I want to play.  I started at 100% hunter/mage but honestly I didn't feel like I played either well and with the nerfs we know are happening for hunter, I kept looking and have found that I really love Warlock and Warrior pvp, so I'm pretty set on going with those two as my main and alt which also conveniently sets me up with a pretty easy first and alt choice as the warlock will be cheaper and easier to solo level to fund the gear to make warrior leveling more bearable, lol.
---
Lannisters?!?
---
Where is Bobby B?
---
I'm 99% on class to go warrior, but I'm just flip flopping on going Human/Dwarf/Gnome.  I'm going to raid and we're all people who have cleared Naxx in vanilla, but we're mainly doing raiding to get gear to PvP.
---
So part of me wants to look good on raid charts and go human, but the other part of me wants PvP utility in a Dwarf or Gnome.  It's just that I need to get past the painful start a Gnome warrior has with such low strength compared to a Dwarf or Human.
---
I ASK YOU, NED, WHAT GOOD IS IT TO WEAR A CROWN?
---
I think this belongs in a nother subreddit
---
We had two druids, a warlock and a shaman tank. We did Gnomeregan 4-man with that group and were not overleveled for the dungeon at all. I was the primary healer bit the other druid also used mana wisely for heals etc. here and there.
---
The shaman actually continued tanking and we did all the dungeons up to Zul'Farrak with him. We had a power base trio of shaman, warlock and druid and it was the greatest wow-experience ever.
---
They also have very little scaling past MC due to their pets. If youre in naxx and geared, a fury warrior OT will do so, so much damage than a hunter dpsing normally. You can literally rank 1 wingclip nonstop, attack speed doesnt matter
---
My 3 free days says 'game time' so I'm saving it for the stress test. Not having to pay for a sub is quite convenient.  
---
Anyone know if this is possible or not? If unsure I'll gamble it anyway since I have no interest in BFA.
---
&gt;Morning after, rinse and repeat.
---
No truer words.
---
I’m playing ret regardless. Every other class is easy. I want to have to work for my damage.
---
High end guild running their alts.
---
I have seen some good prime day deals on this [prime day deals master list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/cdh5pz/prime_day_deals/). There are deals for gpu, cooler, hard disks.
---
You missed the $50 BNet gift cards for $40, but they might come back.
---
Calm down
---
There are plenty of people who never played on a private server that have been wanting and are excited about Classic coming out.
---
To say classic is being made for private server people is just wrong.
---
If you want a true "vanilla experience" don't use a leveling guide, since they didn't exist at release.  But do go find a quest database when you get stumped where you need to kill enemies.  I was using Thottbot (bought out by wowhead) to get all my quest info.
---
But look up dungeons in each zone, get all the pre-req quests and do them all.  Try to explore new zones as well and expand out.
---
Sounds about right, I would go a step further and say that this is what retail players who are against classic believe.
---
A 2019 knowledge Ret player could probably hang with 2005 WOW dps players comfortably.
---
Unfortunately you compete against 2019 WOW players rolling mage, rogue and warriors.
---
Played all my time in Vanilla and early TBC as a Ret pally. That was through AQ40 and into Naxx. I would swap spec and gear when needed but I did most raids as Ret spec because I was good enough and geared enough role switch as needed.
---
By the end of vanilla a well-equipped ret pally could dish out pretty good damage but threat mitigation was a real pain. I had Rag's hammer and the 2.5 set (AQ40 set) and the burst damage I could do would pull aggro off of tanks on the regular if I just opened it up. I'd be right there on the damage meters with the DPS classes and had nothing but the bubble to drop that aggro. Fun, but not sustainable.
---
Depending on where you live you might work more hours/week compared to a lot of people, at least in my country if you work more than 8 hours per day you are entitled to overtime pay, we also start 1-2 hours earlier and probably have shorter commutes to work leaving more time for games in the evening. 
---
A lot of your free time is up to you to manage, plenty of people will put the game before certain IRL activities like not exercising as often or doing housework. Hell I'm planning on paying for a maid for 3 months when it launches, and I work out at home.
---
Everyone doesn't have your schedule, and I'd wager having a schedule as busy as yours is rather uncommon, family or no family. Maybe it's common where you live, it's not where I do or the surrounding countries.
---
yeah my undead warlock will also be inhaling some of dank fel fumes from all these demonic spells he'll be casting
---
I mean you do get to play wow modern with your subscription.  So it isn't all doom and gloom.  People can bounce back and forth, from replaying classic to seeing the latest wow patch.
---
Available. But probably not working for weeks after release since they won't have opportunities to test them.
---
But they downside though....
---
Before I read your thread, I was pretty sure that I'd go Priest. But now that I've given you some arguments for Druid, I'm really not that sure about it anymore! :o
---
In other words, are you using your position as a tank without scruples? How about equal chances for all?
---
If the tanks get all keys first, it won't do you any good if they don't want or have to do these runs anymore.
---
I envy you, so much
---
Yea i know i am trying to help him get a feel for what each class can do. Dmg output will still be mostly the same on private and classic
---
I bought new monitors, downloaded every rad wallpaper possible, have made a google docs guild roster and facebook group, recruited a number of people, filled in race/class/role/professions for everyones intended classes, compiled useful leveling guides, macro guides, pvp videos etc for each class, and  am now trying to setup the DKP chart.  
---
I gotta be honest, I'm running out of things to do now too.
---
&gt; you either need to force people into the new content, away from the Classic that they wanted
---
That is the reason why the designers force people to play the current patch content, there are so many catch up systems, and it is more fun having everyone playing together instead of separately.
---
Don't forget Goblin Rocket Helm also DR with Sleep effects, which means it also DR with your scatter and freezing. This really hurts the utility swiss army knife vibe of a pvp hunter. And the 1v1 cc potential ofcourse.
---
I can say, as having played 120: retail sucks. There is 0 challenge anywhere
---
Underrated post
---
Source?
---
Mc is a not a good "measuring stick" to use for a raid or class viability.
---
It's a joke of a raid
---
I have 3 days reserved for game play. My 3 and 1 y/o might have different ideas about that
---
I wish you all the best then and best health for mother and child! 
---
(play the hell out of Classic WoW)
---
There are quite a few updates that aren't Crossbows after Rhok, they're just not BIS.
---
You’re suggesting they should listen to the people who have been proven wrong about what vanilla was actually like? I’ll pass.
---
I’m from retail, but I’m also from ACTUAL vanilla. And the fact that I don’t play on private servers says nothing about my passion or excitement for the game.
---
Was anyone able to find any "proof" of this being in fact a bug? Like an old video or something?
---
I agree with you. Especially if Classic will be separated from Retail and players will return with NO interest in the current day WOW.  Price should be less than the normal sub.. not because it's less of a game, but because we will return to play 14 years old game ffs. It's like if GOG would charge us 60Eur for the recent Diablo remastered re-release they did not long ago.
---
Looting does not appear to be tied to spell batching, the FrameXML auto loot code has a delay in the code because if you loot too fast you get disconnected.  If you play without auto loot it's much faster than vanilla was without auto loot.  You don't even need to let the window appear in classic if you have auto loot on in classic, just right click the mob and move on.  
---
There's also an add-on called Speedy AutoLoot that will let you loot as fast as you can without being disconnected.
---
The key parts unless reserved should be rolled. Doesn't matter who should get them first in a group unless you only need one it should be discussed and courtesy passed to said player.
---
I'm wondering if there has been any discussion on raid healing as 0/30/21 - it looks fine for 5-man &amp; 10-man but  looks like all is might be good for in raid is spamming HT all day, for the most part. Untalented Rejuv is just too mana-inefficient.
---
Nice! The shaman is pretty set on healing, but I’ll definitely give him the option. It’s cool to hear that shaman tanks are viable for 5 mans.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Wasn't stacking SP and a 1hander as ret not terrible? Thought I saw a video somewhere about it
---
Assuming tanking.  
---
Feral dps is [higher in Private servers than beta](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/possible-bug-feral-base-damage/205737). So, while it is possible to avoid using MCP while raiding occasionally on private servers, I do not expect this to hold true for classic. All tanking classes take time. Either you farm gold for repairs, or you farm MCPs.
---
Buddy and I ran arms wars and pvpd heavy. Real cool with other pvp wars from learning together. Used to squad up and zerg dungeons on ventrilo drunk as fuck blasting iron maiden and shit attacking aggressively Contra 3 style. Ended up in world pvp a lot.
---
There are no raid bows in the game with a speed more than 2.90.
---
During Cata I dutifully volunteered to do night time feeds and stay up through the night.
---
Baby fed, being rocked in pram whilst farming nodes. Easy mode.
---
What are all these landmasses other than Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms?!
---
They have less scaling then other classes, not very little. Also they scale well through bwl. And yes a good warrior will do more damage than a hunter, but a hunter nightfalling will cost the raid more damage then the warrior. Go look at a some parses, decent hunters can't compete for the #1 spot on meters, but they aren't doing shit damage in naxx either
---
You can also hamstring pretty much nonstop as well, geared you can hamstring nonstop and still have rage for better skills

***Overview:***
---
Emporium is recruiting members who want to clear end-game content while having a fun time. Our core group currently consists of 28-32 year old guys from Ontario, Canada who love WoW and want to build a fun and competent raiding group. The majority of our members have played since Vanilla and combined have cleared all raid content; from Vanilla Naxx to BFA Mythics, our guys have extensive raiding experience and know what it takes to clear content.
---
At the same time, all of our members are complete BEAUTYS and know how to have a good time. For example, during my visit to Germany during Oktoberfest, myself and a few friends went to drink in the Hofbrauhaus in Munich. While enjoying numerous beers, we noticed that several groups of guys were singing some drinking songs, and I was quite sad that we did not have our own drinking song. So, I decided that we should sing "O Canada" while swaying side to side and raising our beers. Great time. Great leadership skills. One of the many reasons you should join this guild.
---
To note, other members have: passed out in Mexico on the beach without sunscreen, fell asleep in a bathtub after eating copious amounts of In-N-Out, got married to his high school sweetheart, and was almost accepted on to the Amazing Race Canada.
---
In conclusion, Emporium aims to be a guild that has a great time playing WoW and killing bosses. One of the main aspects of Classic WoW that we all miss is the community aspect, and we are looking to build a great group of guys and girls who want to not only "get Purpz" but also meet some cool people that will eventually be called your friends.
---
Shoot me a message, or hop on the discord if you're interested.
---
(NOTE: I did create a recruitment thread previously, but I could not for the life of me remember the login info to that account...SO! If you messaged me previously, shoot me one again...this forgetfulness is not indicative to my leadership skills. One time thing. Honest)
---
The 2005 players returners will also learn the new meta from your 2019 players.
---
Once they get their feet wet they will surpass the ret
---
Yea exactly, that's why I plan on playing on a pve server, wpvp was just never my thing. And yea, wotlk minus lfg would be nice. It's kind of a shame because the original dungeons of wotlk were pretty face roll, but the last 3 introduced with icc were actually challenging, especially halls of reflection. I remember how refreshing it was to have to coordinate and actually use cc again, but that was the patch that introduced lfd, so it was very bittersweet in retrospect.
---
Yea mythic raids are sooooo easy and 0 challenge.
---
My pally has so much dkp, I'm taking getting both Thunderfury AND Sulfuras
---
Now you're playing with portals!

Have you played diablo 3 season?  The way serakh explained losing the character isn't how it works really.  It is that most of the population of D3 plays exclusively seasons to get the experience of a fresh reset and trying to top the greater rift leader board.  So, the fact there is no achievements or leaderboards in wow classic may be the big draw back of doing seasonal resets.  People can't compare to someone else to see how they are winning or losing a non existent race.
---
TBC was my favourite content, so please yes give us TBC. Also we can keep separate realms.
---
I know there are ppl who do not like TBC, but they usually says the flying mount killed the world pvp, idk man i was playin til vanila but everytime somebody mentions world pvp i always remember when a higher lvl player tried to gank my alt or i was attacked by multiple players, or i was questing and killing npcs on 50% health and got attacked by a rogue... i dont really miss that :D Also with epic flyin there was pretty easy to localize and gank ppl if you wanted.
---
But what i liked in TBC was the PVE content, we got 5 raids at release, karazhan!!!!, amazing attunement quests, heroic dungeons, also reputation rewards really ment something. Kinda useless class specs like prot pally, shadow priest, boomkin started to shine properly. 
---
On the other hand the pve still needed plannin and brain to build proper raid groups (no raid buffs, only party buffs), like spread your shamans, tank groups, melee groups, caster groups, healer groups. Also CC needed in PVE, even on trash, not like in later content where you basicly aoe tanked/aoe damaged /aoe healed everything.
---
As a PVE player these are my reasons. I want TBC, and yes i would not come to play classic (vanila) if i would know there is no chanse to try TBC aswell.
---
I did not really care about PVP but as i remember a lot of ppl liked arena what is released in TBC.
---
On WoTLK, i did hate this expansion, but just as a lot of ppl do like it i would say the same as the TBC, keep the TBC realms and let ppl transfer to a new wotlk realm their characters if they want.
---
Also i would like to see new vanila server starting when TBC is released, i mean yes there are some ppl who do not like TBC, let them retry classic with a fresh start if they want, thats the whole point in wow, to adventure, to level your character/gear. If you reach the end then there is no point to log in anymore. Yeah i know you can make alt characters, but it is not the same, when you start on a new server or you boost your third alt char through bwl with your guild...
---
&gt;Then the whole nochanges community arrived and wanted it in without thinking about the consequences.
---
Oh, that's just a tip of the iceberg. The community did not yet realize the biggest batching issue. The server processes the information every 400ms, that's absolutely true, but the client receives the information instantly, and the according animations/sounds begin to play realtime. That's why it feels fairly smooth, not like some shit game with 400ms ping. 
---
But you see, when your client knows what is going to happen ahead... I'll just say that one of the  fairly prominent streamers nowadays was banned on AT because of the vanish scripts.
---
I'm assuming you are a tank here but :
---
Screw those Nancy healers who keep me alive! Fuck those guys.
---
I'm a healer btw, feeling no love.
---
If it's a pug then you get to roll with everyone else.  As a tank or healer you'll get more shots due to the ease of finding groups.
---
"because the DPS is almost the only thing that matters here"  
---
Hehehehehe no.
---
Or a bag!
---
No. Not when you're group is full of PUGs. Every single person there needs that key just as much as you.
---
what's the point of playing a non-esport video game with a perfectionist mindset? it's fun to be the underdog, it's fun to play an underpowered class and see how far you can go against the odds. it's a fucking video game, you can do whatever you want. no one is forced to take a ret into a raid or join such a raid. there's such absurd animosity towards people playing niche classes IN A VIDEO GAME.
---
Druids are good at running away. Thats about all they can do though. No heal spec is good for solo PvP.
---
Well, if people want TBC and Wrath...they get it with flying, dailies, 2 difficulties, LFD, Azeroth meaningless, etc.
---
The OTHER way is Classic+, be it a modified TBC and Wrath...it's Classic+.
---
This is the MAIN REASON not to go back the old path.
---
Because TBC and Wrath were NOT expansions to Vanilla, but a REPLACEMENT of Vanilla.
---
Want more Vanilla-like gaming after 2 years of Classic? Well, that is Classic+, like it or not.
---
Want TBC and Wrath as they were? Well, the player base will drop like a rock. Half the Classic won't play TBC, and half of what is left after TBC won't play Wrath.
---
Want a modified TBC and Wrath? Well, that is also a form of Classic+.
---
I simply cannot see a BETTER way than Classic+, optional TBC servers and permanent Classic servers.
---
or we can all scramble for key pieces and do 5 times as many LBRS runs, your choice
---
Spreadsheet is wrong too. Suggesting to skip Solvent Spirit and not get sticky glue? Hmmmmm.... suggesting to skip encroachment because it is “often crowded” and has no follow up? At this rate, the only quests this guy will recommend are the ones that completely lack competition *because the quest is shit so no one does it*. 
---
Really bad info all throughout the guide. Sarkoth a level 3 or 4 ***must skip***? Seriously? Sarkoth should be the first quest you complete unless you get boned by login times. Period. Addresses razor hill building shortcuts instead of mentioning even one relevant, skippable quest (scorpids? Apples? Tiger fur? Lost but not forgotten? He mentions nothing other than sarkoth). 
---
Like you mentioned, the annotated map of grinding spots is all over the place and pretty bad. Suggests grinding the centaurs that cast a mega hit chance rebuff on you? Suggests grinding the always competitive tigers on tiger island? Suggests grinding high level trolls with fucking heals and pulls of 2-3 mobs? Suggests grinding NE cave near Org at what, level 6? Level 8? I can’t remember. But good luck. You will get raped inside that cave at 6, even at 8 should you even so much as glance in the direction of Gazz’uz. 
---
I cant really recommend a video less than I would this one. I’m surprised that spreadsheet isn’t premium. At least then I would understand the incentive to put out a 5 minute video full of utter nonsense.
---
I know and I think with it being so popular at launch that is a great option to have and maybe leveling a priest after when things die down might be better.
---
dang that would be sweet

Leveling my Tauren Druid.  Getting skinning and leatherworking started.  If my calculations are correct, I should be able to turn light leather into wands easily around level 10.  That should help me start multiplying my gold considerably.
---
Yes that's what the poster said.
---
Quality meme!
---
Can confirm. Ret paladins have resting AFK face.
---
haha I 💯 % agree
---
Sorry! but its a legit debate between the two lol
---
So basically anecdotes vs numbers?
---
Or you can give me the key, your choice.
---
The game has changed...
---
No one will be using a sulfaras in raid (they won't want the debuff).  If you do find a spot as a ret you will get a nightfall.  Your damage will be near the bottom of the meters and the tank will do a lot more threat than back in the day.  You would never have to worry about out TPSing a tank these days (assuming your tank isn't bad)

The one crummy thing about it is that it has a hard drive instead of an SSD, so load times will suffer and it will feel generally "slow." Luckily it is very simple to replace a hard drive with a cheap SSD, and reinstalling Windows is easy to do. If you literally only play WoW, you might be fine keeping the hard drive - but otherwise, I'd buy a cheap 2.5" SSD (256GB or higher) and swap out the hard drive.

---
We don't know if TBC is something they will do. All expansion private servers have really suffered with their retention rate. Vanilla is the only one that has retained a sizeable playerbase.
---
"Are there not bear asses to collect?"
---
Oh nice, i didn't know that! Where is this from btw?
---
Orc crushes undead in classic. If the servers move on to TBC then it's a completely different story.
---
That's old enough to farm on a hunter.

Father of a 6 month old. I can’t do dungeons in fear of having to leave halfway through but depending on her nap length I might get a few 2-3 hour stretches a day!
---
You also forgot that you can only truly appreciate vanilla if you start your assessments with "These kids..." and/or "... in my time" and played XYZ expansion on a custom built vacuum tube board with a Ti63 as co-processor and a modified Volkswagen Beetle fan unit for cooling.
---
Honestly this was just a compilation of you dying to not playing well, not because of leeway.

I'm 34 and my hype is so flamboyant that I'm annoying my friends with classic wow memes and vanilla pvp videos multiple times a week.

The current 3 days free offer expires July 28th, so you will not be able to use it for name reservation.
---
The key is a massive money maker so no bueno from me, sure if you are apart of a guild and are likely going to be there for every UBRS and further raids then sure but a random tank who doesn’t plan on doing anything with his time shouldn’t be given the key first.
---
I was talking about the 2005 players coming back to the game.  They won't be 2019 players until they get schooled
---
It’s Garrosh!
---
PM'd you as well.
---
Like every youtube channel tested this in the beta and it ended up being slightly better than questing for all but questing hunters and aoe grinding mages last I checked.
---
so wait, is it the 27 or 26 in North America?  why does it say 26 "in the America's".
---
What the fuck
---
What is your raid schedule going to be?
---
just remembered reading somewhere that you can see when a frostbolt is about to crit you because there is something different about the casting animation finish. Don´t know if that was a load of crap tho.
---
About seven million of us stopped playing between wrath and warlords, if that isnt enough evidence idk what is.
---
If Charles Dance told me to go holy, I would. In any other case though...
---
I’ve been playing on pservers for years now and I hate spell batching. It’s slow and unresponsive and feels worse that a pserver... blizz needs to lower the latency or remove it.
---
You don't see any benefit to completing more keys faster for the community as a whole? Do you enjoy LBRS that much? Or do you take offense to the tank being designated? In that case give the keys to the dps. It doesn't matter so much as long as key pieces are concentrated to 1 person at a time
---
sadly all there was died off quickly after cata, some made it to wod but there are very little left
---
1 that comes me to mind would be https://www.goldgoblin.net
---
its made from 1 guy, he also streams and is based on making gold etc
---
Whining about whining. Good job OP.
---
#LF hardcore guild
---
(Pref gnome) mage here, lots of wow experience, both raiding and high lvl PvP.
---
Vanilla Pserver experience (no AQ40 or naxx experience yet, have cleared *everything else*)
---
LF a mature guild with similar goals of pushing server first upon content releases, who will also have many members rushing 60
---
LF a guild with lootcouncil , based off attendance and contribution to the raids/guild.
---
I plan to be tailoring/alch, and drop tailoring for engi around phase 4 (will be max engi prior to first time we try for cthun, extra engi dmg x40 ppl is ridiculously great)
---
Pls msg me on discord to see if we might be a good fit and where I can apply! @Phenotyx#4544
---
This sub is filled with people who talk out their ass and lie constantly. Hunters are great. Simplest thing I can tell you is to just play one and find out if you like it or not, because really that's what's gonna get you to 60 and push you to raid more than anything else.
---
If Classic+ can just be TBC and WOTLK redone into one continuous package, that'd be my preference. I personally think that the design of these expansions had very good aspects and would thrive in the classic RPG dangerous world that we all love.
---
Just to name a few thoughts to make the perfect WoW:
---
- no flying mounts, ever
---
- no dailies, ever. Bi-weeklys or monthlies can be acceptable
---
- TBC talents and balancing where it felt like everything had a place
---
- WotLK dungeon and raid design, minus the difficulties 
---
- scaling to be toned down to a point where resilience isn't required but the PvE and PvP is more or less balanced
---
- some QoL things like continuous gathering once clicked would be nice.
---
- add some more graveyards in those terrible areas.
---
This. If you're getting to &lt;25% HP during your gather then you're doing it wrong.
---
Oh good. Glad I'm not the only one doing that in this age bracket.
---
Only if tbc is reworked to no longer accommodate flying mounts. Remove increased level. Remain 60. 
---
I loved tbc but it was the start to many downfalls, arena resilience and flying mounts comes to mind
---
I’m taking the week off :D
---
50
---
Me and the crew took the week off. We play for either 6 days straight, until one of us dies IRL or if the host’s wife threatens with divorce. We’re doing this old fashion LAN party.
---
what about buffed and vanion ? are they any good ?

###[&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt; | North America | Alliance | PvE | Casual Raiding + Social](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse)    
---
#####Newly formed guild recruiting players of all skill levels interested in a casual raiding experience and having friendly people to play Classic with.
---
***
---
&amp;nbsp;    
---
**&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** is a North American based casual raiding guild occupying *Server-TBD*. As a guild, we look to maintain a focus on understanding and supporting your guild mates as we all traverse Classic raiding together.&amp;nbsp;    
---
A lot of us are experiencing vanilla World of Warcraft for the first time and want to see what the raiding scene was like back in 2004, without [Dives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvIYRrgZ04) hounding us for moar dots. We're not looking to be server first, but we are here to make progress (and friends!).&amp;nbsp;    
---
If this type of raiding experience sounds like something you might be interested in, we have some more information below, as well as a link to our [website](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse) and [application](https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnDRnPgowE?i=R405lvVd). Thanks!&amp;nbsp;    
---
#🔎 What we look for in members 🔎
---
* Mature individuals who are willing to be kind and understanding of each other in order to create a comfortable guild environment.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Players who are looking to clear raid content, but don't want to push themselves for server first.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Social members who are ready to hang out and run some dungeons or chill out on the Minecraft server. We want Classic to be what we all have in common, but make friends for other games here too!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Members that will be proud to be a part of **&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** and care about the reputation of the guild they belong to.&amp;nbsp;    
---
#📜 Requirements and Rules 📜
---
* You are required to listen in on Discord during raid time. We also ask that you have a functioning microphone and that you either use a well configured noise gate or use Push-to-Talk instead.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Show up to raid with a good attitude. This includes patience for newer vanilla players and a strong willingness to learn!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Be kind to those around you, both in and out of the guild. We care about our reputation as a guild, and we expect you to as well!&amp;nbsp;    
---
#📅 Guild Events 📅
---
**Pre-Launch:** For those of you that are looking to make friends before launch, be sure to stop by the Discord and say hello! We're all here to make friends and play some games at the end of the day. Wouldn't it be cool to start Classic with some buddies?&amp;nbsp;    
---
**Launch:** On launch day, be sure to show up and enjoy the launch with everyone! Make groups for leveling, introduce yourself if you haven't already, and have fun! We'll be attempting to create the guild within a few hours after launch.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**Post Launch:** Immediately after the game launches, we're all just trying to have fun and hit level 60 together. The plans for raiding are laid out down below. More specific information will be available closer to our first raid night.
---
#⚔️ [Raiding](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse/games/WowClassic/docs/1569043501) ⚔️
---
**Raid nights are every Tuesday and Thursday, 8:00pm - 11:00pm Central Standard Time (CST).**&amp;nbsp;    
---
Raiding begins November 26th. Members are expected to have reached level 60, acquired adequate raiding gear, completed the required attunement, and be versed in raid mechanics by this time. This gives members three months to enjoy the content before you have to be raid ready.&amp;nbsp;    
---
We don't expect everyone to have perfect attendance; Life comes first. That being said, we really appreciate a heads up when possible, and we do expect you to be present more often than not both physically and mentally.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**We're looking for people to play roles, not classes! Play whatever class you believe you will have the most fun playing! Roles are first come, first serve as we establish the guild.**&amp;nbsp;    
---
For raid composition, we're aiming for a Main Tank, an Offensive Tank, 2 Alternate Tanks, 8 Healers, 15 Melee Damage, and 15 Ranged Damage. Roles will be assigned as you join the guild so that we know what we are looking for as we continue to recruit.&amp;nbsp;    
---
The loot system is a rotating loot council.
---
That about sums it up! Below is a link to our website and application, again. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this post, message me, or find me on Discord at **Marotheit#7401**. We hope to see you soon!&amp;nbsp;

My SO is rolling rogue, so I plan on making a druid to play support. Your post is my line of reasoning as well. I'm planning to play druid not so much for myself, but for others.
---
confirm guild wars 2 was smooth, logged in as soon as servers opened and i dont think i even disconnected for the next 12 hours
---
No. But the problem there is the diablo style: let’s create something once and keep milking it by upping the variables... ALSO not fun to 70+ iq people.
---
&gt;Most people aren't the top 1% where all these little details matter. 
---
In classic, it's literally no one. There is no bleeding edge of raiding in this game, no matter what anyone tells themselves, no matter how many hours they put in.
---
Idk what that means but it sounds intimidating and I’m a little frightened
---
You're bringing a fixed group mentality into PUGs, slight increase in availability isn't worth it to individuals.
---
Mother Teresa.
---
Probably refering to how several classes had major talent changes in cata. For example, H. Paladin whent from single target tank healing to aoe healing everything.

This should be more than enough to max out classic wow, and you should be able to play any modern game on reasonable settings for a few years to come, though I had to skimp out a bit on storage to keep it within $500. You might want to upgrade to a bigger SSD or buy an additonal HDD if you need more storage.. You don't have to build yourself, and buying a prebuilt is indeed easier, but building yourself yields a few advantages. You can customize it how you want it, and it's easier to upgrade. You often get more performance per dollar. Prebuilts often make compromizes that leave a lot of performance on the table, even if the specs look good on paper.
---
You could of course head over to r/buildapc if you need more advice.
---
If the group decides to give the other two gems to the person that won the first one, fine. Their group, their rules. But beyond that, they're greed items anyone should have the right to roll on.
---
It's sad that you think this is a rational argument.   The circumstances you are describing aren't the same.
---
Frys
---
I’m not saying I support this, but the fact remains that once you start getting BWL gear, MC and Ony and ZG and AQ20 become face rolls so this is pretty accurate. I always put my game face on, but I know a lot of DPS who would /follow and auto attack at certain points because some trash and bosses got melted so quickly.
---
The cd gives you around 3-5 gold pr. day, so it's probably going to take 1-2 months to before you see any profit. I would get the epic mount before I start investing in professions on alts.
---
Idk about you but I like being able to mount up 0.2 seconds faster than the actual cast time.
---
Yes, why should unfair lowbie PvP be punished, but not unfair 60 PvP?  
---
You either want both to be punished or none or you are a hypocrite and only want one to be punished.
---
I seem to recall for the felwood stuff that if you all opened the plant tot he loot window, but waited to loot untill every one had it open, you could get more than 5 for things like tubers.
---
I feel this sub has a pretty good balance between memes and relevant discourse.
---
It's worth keeping skinning for resist cloaks if no one else in guild is going for 310. But otherwise/after it's an easy drop in endgame.
---
I know I'm keeping herb on my hunter main for instance runs, but if it doesn't synergize you can make fine gold with CDs instead.
---
It's also always worth considering Engi on your main.
---
Short version, it depends. I'm using a 35 alt, but if you're not making better use of the main you might as well.
---
Illegal Danish is the quintessential WoW machinima and should be required viewing for all classic players
---
My guild leader in retail just switched to being super serious wanting to be top horde guild on a horde dead server...
---
nothing is worse then poor leadership wanting to do "serious progression"
---
Ty for this video :)
---
MCP is like a 30% damage increase. I would not play a meme spec unless I had the time commitment to at least be middle of the pack DPS with consumables and buffs.
---
That being said if you decide spam and abolish poison people might look past your a warrior tripling your DPS.
---
Good luck clearing UBRS with just tanks and healers.
---
G600 is incredible in every sense of the word. It's so durable too (mine broke after 6 years of far too much use) and I replaced it with another one.
---
It's a little harder to find now but absolutely worth the search.
---
And yeah you can disable the lights on it easily so it can be both business sensible and flashy fun.
---
"You do realize" you are annoying
---
My 1.8 year old spoiled me, he sleeps 12 hrs a night and has since he was 3 months old.
---
So to wreck that wonderful schedule we just had our daughter born a week ago, talk about doing a complete 180...I forgot what lack of sleep was.  I should be ready come August 27th!
---
I don't understand why they would jump through hoops to put in server batching.  I mean unless they are going to go to everyone's house and give them dial up and or DSL internet with 2.0 MBPS connections, it isn't going to be a recreation of 2004-2006.
---
Played pservers for years, spell batching sucks. It's an not some kind of intentional design choice, it's an artifact of the hardware and network infrastructure that existed prior to 2004. Those "unique interactions" are pointless. I hate on modern WoW as much as the next guy, but the overall feel of playing the game is lightyears better than vanilla or pservers.
---
To make it more difficult and not so druid-biased I feel like I should interject the reasons as for why I'm currently more biased towards priest:
---
There's quite a bunch of things that make healing dungeons as a priest way more comfortable and also make it like it can contribute more.
---
One of the things is wanding. You can do damage without having to spend any mana and are very flexible about when to do it and when not. As a druid-healer casting spells or going into cat-form either drain your mana or are too unflexible. So you end up just standing there doing nothing whatsoever when no healing is needed.
---
Another one is the out-of-combat-rezz. Huge time-saver incase someone dies.
---
The least important one is fade. It's just really good to save your own and thus your whole parties' lives if things go wrong. Often times others have ways to compensate it, like mages frosting the mobs running up towards you but if noone intervenes, having a tool to give you that much needed breathing-room is very helpful.
---
So for a dedicated healer I feel priest simply has it much better and can do more things besides healing that benefit the group.
---
But on the other hand the priest will never be able to say: "Screw waiting for a tank! I'm gonna do it!"
---
Yeah it’s crazy. But doesn’t aoe also benefit from leeway? As in you can nova people from pretty far away if you’re both moving? I think the trick is to always stay 3 steps ahead of your enemy instead of the 1 step you’re used to.
---
I think people can agree on some core concepts that separates vanilla from other expansions, and I think the world could easily made much more dense if vanilla style ways. I think more world events like gurubashi or fishing tournament could go a long way, and with a little more broad itemization options the memespecs could be relevant without disrupting the general state of vanilla.
---
The bigger problem to me is that I don't think many people trust the current blizz to follow through with this, or that they have much intention too. Rereleasing vanilla is already pretty much an admission that their new content is meh after stating they didn't even want to do this, basically creating an alternate timeline of what wow could have been is a real kick in the balls to their entire modern Dev team. I don't see it happening as much as I would like it too.
---
Not quite week 1 but it is close.  Typically the first MC clear occurs somewhere in the range of days 9-11 on pservers these days.  I know of several hardcore guilds that will be targeting a week 1 MC clear on classic.
---
What would be so bad about having to level 60-70?  Agree with you about the flying mounts.
---
Drugs?
---
You can reserve gems with pugs. Master loot before every gem boss. My plan will inform everyone of this before I invite to group.
---
I can't speak to the reputation-gated recipes in general, but I'll offer one thing about alchemy on a 35 alt. Access to an alchemy lab and recipes for flasks would be an issue, but if your primary angle is transmutes, then it might not be a big deal to you?
---
Just play arms warrior with 2H mace and PvP like his grace Bobby B.
---
GODS WHAT A STUPID NAME!
---
nop, i dont even remember vanilla too well, just seen videos of actual vanilla footage in other leeway threads
---
Go in looking good, come out feeling good.
---
There are plenty of proper Catholic churches around with plenty of normal, moral priests.
---
It's just some stupid shitheads bringing the image down. Like with everything ever.
---
Everyone likes to ride the meme bandwagon because "hurr durr funny" but it's far from the truth.
---
Even for the sake of efficiency sleeping is a good idea I’m doing a 3 hour sleep cycle which is what I used to do when I actively farmed gold for money
---
6 dps tho.. vs 2 tanks. if tanks get them then there is more likely going to be room for all the dps, key or not
---
There is so much viable speccs as warlocks. Depending on gear and playstyle. Bad gear i would go soul link, later on sm - ruin or destro.
---
Hey those RTX shaders make it look like real life!
---
I main Horde on Retail and after this, it looks like I'm going to keep my old ways. Will feel bad letting go of my Mag'har Warrior/Blood Elf Paladin to go full Orc but it's the one true decision.
---
Just google...
---
Anyway:   
---
- Sm/Ruin 30/0/21 (overall efficient)
---
- Sl x/31x (tanky as hell but overall less dmg)
---
- Destro x/x/31+ (bursty) 
---
i guess these are the three core pvp specs for warlock.
---
If that comment annoys you then you are in the wrong place...
---
THe thing is... Hunter is THE hardest class to master in PvP. But when mastered its REALLY powerful and good. But not many people will get there because theres a lot of intricacies in the class. Such as pet management, range management etc that other classes dont have to master more or less to the same degree.
---
Also as the father of a 1.5 year old, he’s back to waking up super early after a week of not, what is happening how do I go back!?  WTB sleep, PST.
---
Trying to pick a mouse. A few good sales
---
Honestly unless you were dying on purpose to try to show leeway is a problem just learning to play the game better will have 10x the impact on your leveling that leeway ever will. I honestly feel like its the former, but I've seen worse players so I figured I'd mention it.
---
Small group challenging is great - I love the M+ system and the competition that it breeds. Sure it eventually settles into a meta, but for someone that plays retail very rarely, its a decent challenge, with a decent reward when I do play.
---
It's not worth farming up to level 35 for the small amount of gold you'll get from xmute professions.  Take those ~2-3 days /played and just farm gold on your main.
---
No. Classic is easy enough for many suboptimal things to pass
---
I was getting bummed out about Classic since I’ve been hyped for so long.. I needed this. Thank you.
---
Hunters will always get 1-3 spots because they have invaluable utility with sufficient (not good) dps. They do about 60% of the dps of a good warrior in naxx, but the warrior can’t tranq or kite.
---
The tank mentioned was being out TPS by a ret pally.  So he clearly wasn't maintaining the highest possible tps
---
you can get one of your rings in pvp and, you can get the 2% chance to crit trinket as well from dungeons. I remember your other ring being easy to get as well but, can't remember what it's from. I'm telling you for 100% certain. Elemental shamans are very easy to gear. One of the easiest classes. Especially since your second trinket can be Hero charm. Which is from a puggable 10 man.
---
Also remember that a few recopies for Alchemists are BoP, so it is arguably better to just ask your guild alchemist to craft the potions for you if you give them the materials. As for making gold, I personally always found Mining to be far more profitable.
---
I'm sorry your grace. I was trying to think of a name quickly so I could post something and ended up just glancing over at my Kubrick collection. I know it's not nearly as good as yours Bobby B.
---
THE GODS MOCK THE PRAYERS OF KINGS AND COWHERDS ALIKE!
---
Blind doesn't work on pets?
---
Are you really planning on spending the 240 hours required to level to 60 PLUS the additional time to farm gear?
---
It's almost like this sub is made up of multiple different people. Weird.
---
I can't tell if you're trolling or not.
---
Dwarf and Orc certainly have a benefit from racials, but hunters are still at the mercy of rogues in pvp with full cooldowns up.
---
Hunter trinkets are useless vs them, rogues can evade most pet dmg, they can keep hunters nearly perma-stunlocked and disabled with blind/gouge..... with full CDs, a hunter can't even escape stunlock opener for christ sakes. Orc is the only thing that helps there.
---
If you truly think hunters win all the time when opened by rogues, then mate you just haven't been playing in the real world
---
Retail Vanilla. It's a hunter using Beast Lore to see the armor value of Maexxna. There's another screenshot of magmadar showing the exact same value.
---
You know leeway also means you can aoe them from farther so you don't need to wait for them to be 8 yards away to nova.
---
This is a very fair point. But i would imagine most of the servers pop will be pserver people after half a year to a year. Or the “noobs” will follow pserver pros lead.
---
Man, I resubbed a month or so ago and starting leveling a priest. Shit was ridiculously, mind-numbingly easy and boring. I could spam smite and solo elites with ease (it gives an absorption effects each cast)
---

I'm going to be a ret paladin in classic just to smite this incredibly accurate hate.
---
I never implied otherwise, just said spending that much time makes a person a hardcore gamer.
---
Does the word "hardcore" carry an extreme negative connotation to you that you're somehow reading my comment as abandoning responsibilities?
---
Yeah, I'm not saying every church out there is corrupt but that's the premise of a stereotypical joke.
---
Dwane smashes their heads in
---
Hey mate. Thank you for the reply!
---
&gt; I must ask - Why go feral if you can't run the item that makes it "work"? Why not roll a Warrior/rogue who doesn't need the consumable farming hours to be efficient?
---
I'll answer your question. My mate (whom I will be leveing with) has less time to play than me and she doesn't like PVP at all. Hence she will be making a character on a PVE server. I like PVP alot and my solo-play character will be a orc rogue on a PVP server. When my friend is able to play, I'll switch to the PVE server and play on a character that works well with her character. If I didn't have a second character on a PVP server I had time to farm Pummelers, however I really like PVP and don't want to give up on playing on a PVP server entirely (which is why I have limited time to play on a PVE server). 
---
I hope that answered your question:)
---
Burn my long hearthstone cool down immediately cause I don’t know what it does.
---
[31/20/0](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsVikobAtzc) Disc PvP.
---
You mentioned you have a mage buddy. I'd probably hold off a bit on this spec until the mage is geared and his burst becomes scary. There's not as much point to speccing PI for PvE in the first content phase since casters really start to shine in BWL.
---
[21/30/0](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsMboZbAtzzbVx)
---
This is a little bit more geared towards early PvE content when your gear isn't great and you need all the extra juice you can get. If you really wanted to you could take one point out of Spiritual Healing and put it in Spirit of Redemption. It's one of many cases where personal preference and playstyle shapes your spec to suit your needs. I really wouldn't spec SoR for PvE though, it's more of a PvP talent.
---
He's not going to make it to level 60 so it's not really a concern.

**&lt;Imperium&gt; Recruiting, Semi-Hardcore PvE / PvP / wPvP Guild.** **Server Type: EU-Region PvP (tho if you are from NA thats totally fine, too!)** **Faction: For the Horde!**   
---
**Who are we?** Here at **Imperium** we believe in **the journey and comradry** that vanilla offers. We share the long-time goal dream of thousands of players that wanted to make retail classic servers a reality! Since we all now have achieved that goal it is time to take the next step! **In our guild we want to encourage the social aspect of the game**, aswell as playing every bit of variety it has to offer. (PvE, PvP, wPvP, Grinding) Of course this doesn't mean that we want especially Grinding and Raiding to be a mind numbing auto-pilot experience. **We like to keep things fun and challenging!** Putting all the above mentioned things together we created Imperium with **a simple vision**: **We want to create a mature raiding and pvp community, we want to endure throughout the whole journey and we want to have the most fun possible while at it!**   
---
**Who are we looking for?** We are looking for a variety of people, no matter the vanilla background you have, no matter the schedule you might have, we want you to be a part of our awesome community, to enhance your and our vanilla experience, together, no matter the time you will be able to spend in the game!   
---
**What are our goals?** We want to clear every vanilla content and acquire all the awesome epic gear that is there. While we are at it we want to have as much **fun** as possible also doing wPvP and PvP so the Alliance will get to fear us! We want to create a strong bond between our members **making the journey an unique experience**!   
---
**What do we expect from you?** We want to create **a mature guild environment**, meaning you should at least be 20 years or older. **You do not need to have played vanilla to qualify for joining us! :-)**  If you are new to the class you will be playing on retail classic that is totally fine. It would be awesome though if you are **willing to improve on your class**, this can of course be done in conjunction with your respected **class-leader, who will be able to guide you**.   **Participation** on our scheduled raids and if you so wish, PvP and especially wPvP activities.

---
I was surprised the Horde wasn't mentioned at all. Marketing I guess.
---
Yeah, but in an indirect way.  There are a lot of posters that feel it necessary to squeeze in details about their wife, kids, and job into their posts somehow as if anyone here gives a shit.
---
&gt;I don't understand the love behind the 0/30/31 spec.
---
I do. I would spec 0/30/31 if only I could =D
---
Bosses have 2000 less armor?
---
Almost everything deals less damage?
---
We start with 1.12 itemization rather than progressive itemization like private servers does?
---
Did you live under a rock for the past two months?
---
I just wanna back you up here:  I'm from retail in both "actual Vanilla" (plus later on mop through bfa), and I also play on pservs.  I've raided up through AQ40 on them, and I'm practicing one last run on the latest FRESH right now.   They should not listen to the pserv people any more than they should listen to people with shoddy 15 year old memories that never touched pservs.  Both sides get things wrong constantly, and NEITHER side is made up of award winning game developers.   They should listen verifiable facts and their own knowledge base.
---
Any two classes are a great combo.  There is no reason that you shouldn't play what you want.
---
Agreed.
---
Allows me to keep enemies targeted for dispels as a priest, melee for mana as a paladin, etc or generally just watch the progress of the fight. Of course I don't ever main a healer so this experience is just from alt raids.
---
Not if he wanted to heal
---
Has it Already been developed for classic?
---
I think the dailies in TBC were fine enough before Quel'danas. There were faster ways to get gold and they weren't mandatory for reputation.
---
But then why would I use clique
---
Pretty much. Hunters were farmers and you would hardly ever see a legit hunter that tries to raid.
---
I'd like to solve the puzzle! NI
---
Literally refreshing this subreddit and doing practice runs for level 1-20 on a private server.  I've been watching a lot of Asmongold highlight videos on youtube taken from his stream, along with a ton of other classic videos, in the meantime.
---
I've got where my friends I started saying I was going to go warrior, then had another warrior (dps) friend, so I leaned more towards being a tank.  Then had two friends who wanted to go druid and paladin, but now they both backed off to hunter and rogue.  So, our group is lacking a healer to fill us out, which makes me consider rolling a druid myself.
---
I might end up rolling a druid alt, I had been debating on Paladin or Priest as well to have a healing alt.  Druid seems interesting enough that I can touch in just about every other spec, granted with meme potential.  But having a stealth tank/dps/healer is pretty cool in my eyes.
---
Damn, how can you even afford playing? and I thought 1 kid was enough of a hole in one's pocket, 4 is like a bucket without a bottom.
---
Ah yea that’s the best one too
---
I'll go through this one at a time, having some experience with Pservers over the years (and a main Priest).
---
Priest;
---
Surprisingly solid levelers, 7/10 (in terms of speed, ease) 
---
Pretty cheap/inexpensive to level, skipping the spells you don't need from trainer and only buy spells you do need, and not very gear reliant at all (makes it easier to have 100g saved up by lvl 40). Except for wands, but you're going to use the BFD wand until lvl 50+ anyway lol.
---
Easy to heal any 5 man while leveling as Shadow spec 1-58
---
Ok open world pvper's, 5/10
---
At 60, the best 1v1 PVP spec in game with Shadow, and decent holy/disc specs for healing PVP and premades
---
At 60, best healers in-game (except for maybe paladins post-nax). Every guild needs them, and every raid needs plenty of them.
---
At 60, don't expect to PVE as Shadow (some guilds take 1 and only 1, post AQ40. Competitive spot ofc.)
---
Terrible farmers @ 60 (noone is sure what Lasher farming is going to be like come Classic anyway)
---
Very fun Vanilla class with a lot of nice little niche spells/touches, such as Mind Control, Levitation (slow fall but better), Dispel Magic, Mana Burn, Silence, and ofc Benediction.
---
Druid;
---
VERY strong levelers, 9/10 right behind Hunters. Expect to see a lot of server first lvl 60's be Druid come Classic.
---
Stealth, Bear, heals, great with soloing content/leveling
---
Free travel form which is a god-send blessing while leveling, and can even justify putting off getting your mount immediately @ 40 (or can help soften the blow if you reach 40 and can't afford your mount right away)
---
Can heal practically any dungeon in feral 1-58 with an int/spirit set, can tank any dungeon 1-60
---
Can DPS/Heal/Tank and get into any group you want no matter what that group needs (biggybacking the above)
---
Solid Tanks at 60 but rare (1 for every 4-5 warriors.) This can be viewed as a pro or con. Most guilds will have one, but those same guilds will only take 1 at most. Very competitive spot.
---
90% of the time for lvl 60 PVE, you'll be resto. Resto druids are the worst healers in game, And are said to be the most boring since you can't/won't realistically use any HoT's in a 40 man, just spamming different ranks of Healing Touch. Some people love it though /shrug
---
Arguably one of the best PVP classes in the game, with inarguably the best Flag Carries in WSG premades, Resto very strong and slippery in premades, and feral spec very solid in WPVP, 9/10
---
No actual Res, only 30 min cd BR.
---
Balance spec is non-existent.
---
Final thoughts;
---
Overall, you'll probably have more fun and an easier time leveling 1-60 with druid. At 60, you'll probably have more fun with Priest if raiding/PVE is your primary goal. If PVP is your primary goal, it's a tossup between Shadow spec and Druid class.
---
Wow thank you for the links! Yeah that makes a lot of sense! Thank you!
---
You do realize that you only need 1 person per group to have the key, right?
---
There's no lack of videos showing Onyxia tanked by Priests, Shamans and whatever. So This is obviously not correct. People were just bad at the game and needed resistances to cope with the damage. Deal with it.
---
Ya'll be crazy.
---
But good look trying to leveling with the inevitable server instability on launch!
---
*lvl 26*
---
“Wait why do I have an ability that says “Shoot”?
---
Me when I first started
---
Shamans have purge if you’re talking about offensive dispel.
---
There will be room for exactly 1 shadow priest per raid,  but trying to raid as anything but a heal specced paladin, druid, or shaman will get you rightfully laughed at and benched until you respec.
---
That might be doable though
---
dont worry. if you dont have the time to farm MCP you wont be raiding as feral
---
#No Sleep Till ~~Brooklin~~ Plaguelands!
---
Horde, my man
---
I want an expansion. A full expansion with new level cap, new zones etc. But made with the spirit of classic. Expanding classic, instead of building and morphing it. No flying, dailies, raid difficulties, lfg, lfr, catch up, arena, cinematics. Just classic with new content. Learn what worked and restart. New boss fights are awesome for example in retail.
---
Nothing huge, but me and some guy I played with on a server went to Deadmines as Horde and couldn’t get a full group, so we went as two. I was a 24 rogue, he was a 23 mage. He could sheep, I could sap, so we combined what we have to get as far as possible. 
---
After like 6 tries, we killed the first boss, I’ve never felt stronger. All this being said we are both newbies!
---
Just to be clear, I never said blizzard should listen to retail vanilla players any more than private server players. 
---
They should, as you suggested, use their own data and experience.
---
&gt;/bow, you peasants 
---
FTFY
---
Spoiler for Game of Thrones: &gt;!Jaime Lannister looses his hand in the show. That's the guy who is replaced by the paladin in this meme and thus why he can't be Ret with "one hand".!&lt;
---
Uhh, hadn't thought of that, that's clever :) and just keeping it slowed as much as possible, I assume? But how do you keep the aggro on the pet if it's running rather than attacking?
---
If you like pvp, you can think about being able to shadow meld and then mind control the enemy.
---
Also starshards is supposed to be good for a smite priest (so I’ve read, I don’t know myself)
---
Mobs have a chance to break CC early.   Like every second or something, they get a roll to break out.    Did people not know this?
---
A rogue with skinning and leatherworking too.
---
the key is a common bottleneck. just seems to make sense to me to concentrate keys on the other common bottleneck in groups: tanks and/or heals
---
Rejuv is always inefficient tbh because you can cast it on multiple targets with no cast time. 0/30/21 works fine until probably AQ and after that I honestly don't know enough to say if it will no longer work. Most of your heals are going to get sniped as a resto druid anyways. The reason they are looked at as the worst raid healer is because priests and paladins will always snipe your heals with their lower cast times and you don't bring the utility that Shamans do and certainly not the group healing when they get CH set bonus.
---
Might as well just hot up people and be prepared to heal tanks during high damage phases.
---
Hey, I added you on Discord. But could you confirm if you are in NA or EU? My guild seems to fit what you're looking for, and we're EU. Looking forward to hearing from you.
---
I listen to the podcast every week and he does an excellent job.  His main problem that I really don't like is that he never asks follow up questions.  He'll ask a question and the person he has on will talk for a few minutes and eventually change topics to something that precipitated whatever Josh asked or something else more relevant to their role on the team (John Staats in particular).  Then, Josh will just ask a totally random question he has written down that has nothing to do with either topic.  I feel like he's ignoring people he has on the calls in order to ask the questions he has written down already.
---
It's still the best classic podcast out there.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAmXZPuS7L0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAmXZPuS7L0) 
---
Onyxia was never hard. You were probably just bad at the game back then.
---
but isn't that what you'll be doing in WoW? Grinding out the same endgame over and over? Grinding out mats e.t.c
---
Haha yes exactly. The OOC rez. I totally forgot about that.
---
Go with the wife.
---
Friends may and up bailing on the game after a while, but as long as your wife is playing you are free to play as much as you want.  
---
My wife and I have played a lot of MMOs together, and while we aren't always grouped up (and more often than not just doing our own thing), she likes that if she is having trouble with something she can just ask me to come to where she is to help her with an elite mob or run a dungeon with her.
---
True. I did adjusted to it in the end and I was consistenly aoe without dieing for most of my leveling. It just that this leeway shouldn't really be like this in the first place otherwise everyone has to adjust to it.
---
Activated my 3 free days yesterday. I've had a hard time to find a game to enjoy before Classic comes out. I'm just going to start from scratch and see where it'll take me. I'll probably sub from here as well, might as well do it.
---
I stopped playing regularly when Cataclysm released. It's for sure a whole other experience now. I have full heirloom, which I barely even know where I got them from. Fast leveling and no challange whatsoever. It's on rails, as you said. 
---
The difference with this and Classic is that I don't feel grounded to the game anymore, if that makes sense. The feeling of progression has faded. I'm not a part of the world and I'm not participating in the experience in the same way. 
---
It'll do for now. However, I really like the environments and the improvements to graphics. It's a beautiful game. That's something!
---
Max one, build all BoPs, then reset and max the other. 
---
Probably do gnomish second for the gadgetzan teleport.
---
Farming MCP doesn't take long. How would you have time to raid for hours if you can't spend an hour at 60 farming MCP?
---
Legion launch was flawless and I don't think classic will have more people.

[&lt;Traffic&gt;](http://trafficguild.us)   **Horde** - West Coast
---
**Raid Times**:  Tue/Thu 7 - ~1030pm PST
---
**Loot System**: Loot Council + (Guild Website explains everything). [We have our own real time loot tracking backend system](https://gfycat.com/goodnaturedscrawnyasiaticgreaterfreshwaterclam) to allow our loot council to make consistently fair decisions when disbursing loot. 
---
**About us**: Traffic is a guild geared towards the working adult that favors a west coast evening starting time.  Current foundation is comprised of experience high end raiders that cleared all content from Classic, TBC, and WotLK.  We plan on clearing everything in classic, while fostering a culture of transparency and fairness.
---
**How We Run Things**
---
 - Fairness and transparency: Consistently show up and you will get gear. Our loot system is designed to make sure everyone who consistently shows up to raid gets geared out.
---
 - Progression Oriented: We're going to clear content, and have fun doing it. As we put dungeons on farm, we'll be placing raids like MC on (non mandatory) off nights to focus on clearing new content. We expect people who show up to raid to give it their all.
---
 - Just Hardcore Enough: Real life always takes precedent over the game. Our main focus is progression, but we're understanding and empathetic towards folks who need to step away or miss guild events. 
---
**Recruiting** 
---
 - Raid Leaders
---
 - Everyone

But it doesn't matter if you didn't have Naxx gear if Naxx wasn't released: my point is that you had the best gear of the moment, you were in the top PvE guild, probably knew most of the hardcore/best player of the server, had very flexible playtime and it made things way easier than for average player and even then, you admit it wasn't that easy.
---
And yes I totally believe you had way less time spend on your priest if you almost immediately got BWL staff + a few ZG and MC item immediately after you hit max level because your guild was farming those instances by then. Again you knew the right people and where already outgearing 90% of the players and add flexible time.
---
The problem is you just don't get the difference between you, who were in a top50 world guild, ahead of the curve since day 1 and playing more that 30 hours on average and even more than 40 when needed and the new player who will play 10-15 hours on average and 20max who will struggle in the middle of the pack facing people with way more experience and stuff.
---
And yes, raid will be easier but for everyone. During vanilla people weren't clearing MC two week after the release of the game which means that when honor was released, average players weren't ganked by people with epic item. When BG was released, people didn't have people with Nef staff one week later. And it also means that blue PvP set is stupid to get as PvE stuff will be way easier to get.

(by the way it's a bit comic you boast about your time efficiency if you bought gold)

But you ain't running UBRS without DPS so you might as well give them the keys early on.

**About us**
---
Omega is formed from friends who raided together on private servers. We will be taking a smart and efficient approaching to raiding while progressing through all of the classic WoW raid content. This means that we value your time and for example we will only enforce the use of consumables when they are required not for raids on farm. Our method of loot distribution will be mostly EPGP with some items being distributed by EP only, more details are on our discord server. Our main objective is to build a strong guild community and progress together from MC to Naxx in an efficient manner. You can expect from us

If you played vanilla or on a private server, listen well and perform in raids, don't have all the time in the world but are able to still adequately prepare for raids and want to raid from MC to Naxx with a great group of non-toxic people, Omega is for you
---
Hehe :-) sounds like you did some work to make raiding work out!
---
Yes.
---
The hunter PvP trinket breaks stuns, dude. 
---
Hunters are heavily armored and have high amounts of health. You won’t die in a CS-Kidney. 
---
I’ve played a ton of both hunter and rogue. Rogue mostly on the dueling pserver, and hunter lots on K2. In full Dragonstalker I had almost 5k health. 
---
But yeah, if you stand around aimlessly then you’ll get bodied. Between Scatter, Flare, Traps, Wing Clip and possibly Intimidate if you’re fully control specced, you can kite a rogue to high heavens. And if you’re PvE specced you can tank them for a while with Deterrence. 
---
Hunters are by far the strongest rogue counter if they’re played at equal skill levels.
---
Do you wanna live in actual cities or mud huts?
---
This is so fitting, I was just looking at the classic bis lists and coming to the same conclusion myself. I also really like how Benediction can become a DPS weapon on command. Looks like Priest is the pick for me.
---
Dispel is SO CRUCIAL in pvp.  Control is on the "Mount Rushmore" of deciding factors in who wins a group fight.  The other factors IMO being Gear, Skill, and Terrain/objective relevance.  
---
It's what makes paladins such great healers- being able to dispel a vast majority of CC effects from your allies and clear everything from yourself on a 5 min cooldown is nuts. 
---
Priests are top-tier PVP support class for this reason but are also squishy so a good priest has to always watch for threats and make sure to preserve themselves.  
---
I haven't PVP healed as a priest much but there are a few lower-tier Disc and holy talents that help you a lot, boosting your PW;S, making you pushback immune when crit, healing some damage when crit, etc.  
---
Playing pserver level 60 PVP extensively, an equally geared warrior vs a priest is a tough matchup for the priest because you'll never be able to get a fear off.  That being said, the warrior will be rage starved due to your shield and not doing damage at first so you'll have a window where you can get some damage onto him and try to create distance.  You rely on your friends though, especially if you're geared with a lot of +heal you just wont' be able to do enough damage and he'll wear you down, especially with the MS debuff. 
---
But with any friends nearby they hopefully will peel the warrior off you.. plus it's on you to kind of avoid getting into that situation in the first place.  I notice the squishy types in PVP staying on mounts a little longer to ensure good positioning at the outset
---
That could be interesting still.  I just like challenges, so once you beat deadmines on heroic, or on mythic, how do you get more of a challenge?  The modifiers are pretty polarizing on modern wow, because it makes some dungeons dead keys on higher levels, while other dungeons are vastly preferred.  Anyways, I was just hoping for more 5 man content and making the old dungeons harder with more damage and health was one simple way I thought the game devs could do with out working overtime on new art assets or loot stats.
---
I need these macros in my life!

What has Goblin that its worth spending 500g or hours of farming to respecc engi?
---
This comment is like the epitome of echo chamber subreddits.
---
BUMP! (Even though reddit doesn’t really work like that).
---
This still desperately needs attention. It was not mentioned anywhere in the hunter issues blue post—neither “not a bug,” nor “fix confirmed,” nor “working on a fix.”
---
Closest thing in that thread was a reasonable upvoted non-blue reply. Give it likes, in addition to supporting all mentions of this issue you see across various community sites. 
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/hunter-beta-issues-update/223166/5
---
I agree, spell batching was a dumb mechanic to try to bring back. Why anyone would want a laggy unresponsive game is beyond dumb. 
---
Since it’s here to stay, they need to lower the spell batch window to like 100 ms, so the game feels less laggy.
---
You'll be shocked to realize only one in twenty bear has a butt!
---
I'm going through the same struggle. I just want to hop onto a private server and practice leveling but I can't even decide on a race/class or stick with one before level 20. There's so many things to factor in like raiding/dungeon potential, bg prowess, farming potential, solo potential, what professions to go, shit's just getting mad. I know for sure I'm going alliance on a PvE server as world PvP (while I respect it) gets old quickly and it'll be more a hindrance given my limited playing time. I want to DPS or tank, healing looks really unappealing given you spend most of the time looking at health bars and fighting off anxiety basically.
---
Warrior - Cool class design/aesthetics, I prefer melee to ranged but they're very gear dependent and frankly rubbish in solo play., but I do like the idea of the leveling challenge and fury dps looks fun and engaging and can pull off high numbers. I can tank while getting my BiS and basically swing my big dick by locking out rogues/ferals from joining the group and rolling on gear. A definite maybe.
---
Mage - 100% the best class on paper (great in all aspects mentioned) but the play style doesn't interest me at all, plus my preferred race is male human or night elf and human casters look meh
---
Druid - Most interesting class in the game. Would roll one 100% if it not were for the fact kitty feral is so gimped and relies on farming gnomer for that mace and power shifting. God damn it blizzard.
---
Warlock - They're very strong no doubt but the class feel just doesn't fit with me. I don't like the prospect of fighting undead in BG's as well, or farming shards. 
---
Priest - Have a soft spot for shadow spec as an undead priest was my main in WotLK but I would be forced to roll a healer no doubt, plus I'm rolling alliance this time around and would miss out on devouring plague.
---
Hunter - My main in TBC (Orc) and first max level. Would rather play something else this time around but I respect the fact they have the best end game farming and are insane in BG's and solo play. The huntard rep they have is undeserved, I have a lot of respect for high end hunters.
---
Paladin - I have a soft spot for Ret, my alt was a Belf pally in TBC and I really enjoyed the theme of the class. It's just a shame I'd be locked into healing &amp; wearing cloth or else I would likely roll one. The reality of being a big dick 2h swinging holy warrior of justice doesn't live up to the dream in vanilla, at least.
---
Rogue - Stealth is fun but that's literally as far as my interest in rogues go. No AoE, having to compete with warriors/other rogues for gear while also being very gear dependent. Just not for me. I'd maybe level one as a fun alt if I were on a PvP server but that won't be the case.
---
Of course its a compilation of him dying, how else is he gonna show leeway being impactful?
---
Getting over the fact that the guy showed us his worst pulls you can clearly see leeway working here. Its counterintuitive, it looks bad and its use is justified by a problem that isn't present anymore. If any other game had a melee mob that could hit you from that far away, it would be called a poorly made game.
---
&gt;It's in a terrible state,
---
Terrible?  ROFL!  Why is it terrible?  Because it's more akin to Vanilla, than your shit pirated server?  Fuck off then, and go back and play on the ez mode Russian server.
---
Mobs having a chance to break CC.  Not a bug.
---
Mobs not immediately being hit by Blizzard Slow.  Not a bug.
---
Cone of Cold's area now covering your entire screen.  Not a bug.
---
This is how shit worked in Vanilla!
---
Just use throwing weapons as a hunter
---
Yes, it is also why you can sometimes run all the way in doors if you don't use your mouse or move your character.  Some reason the game doesn't think you are inside yet until you change direction.  That reason may be what you are talking about this interpolating thing a majig.
---
Totally.
---
Also Tywin tho
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=47MazYDnmaU
---
im trying to avoid all video content so i can enjoy classic with enhanced nostalgia.
---
however i did expect them to change game here and there but didnt expect them to  nerf dungeon mobs so much that it actually changes the fastest way to level up
---
There on only 6 playable classes per faction (come at me druids!) so just assign each class to a number and roll a 6 sided die. Lets the fates decide.
---
I just requested off 3 days for launch. My body is ready.
---
Grinding mats is common mmorpg factor.
---
Once you have all the gear you want from a raid: you can stop raiding and start shrekking scrubs instead of endless increasing gear.
---
Also this gear lottery vs. defined loot tables is not fun at all.
---
Is 12.5 instead of 10% stun resist really that much better than wotf?

He came to the island like a fish.

---
muhahahahahaah
---
Hey if you log on as often as me I'll gladly pass the key pieces to you. Tanks and Healers are and should be pals. We can always sub in one of the bajillion rogues if someone drops group unexpectedly
---
I've been here before. I thought in terms of efficiency and racing. It runs the game quickly. Take your time and do everything. It's really all about the journey in these servers and not the destination.
---
They're Canadian
---
Doesn't help much when you can be gouged or blinded and restunned endlessly. If the rogue has prep up there's really not much a hunter can do. In theory they have a decent shot. But in practice a rogue will jump a hunter during a mob fight and when the hunters CDs are up. Vast majority of hunter players will be startled and get taken to task. 
---
You're talking theory I'm talking practice, and even in theory unless hunters are orc with trinket sitting on a flare, there really aint much they can do. And no one on planet earth goes intimidate + scatter build. Cmon mate. You can't cherry pick perfect hunter scenarios then argue hunter are great counters.
---
Private servers are kinda like masturbating. It scratches the itch but you know in your soul it's not the real thing, and it kinda feels shameful.
---
Using purge in low-level pvp was the best because so many people had no idea a Shaman could do that. Used to love purging whole groups from the bushes before moving in to heal.
---
Check out Executus Gaming on YouTube, he does tons of duels and BGs on private servers and he mains a warrior.
---
Step 1: Farm high level dungeons for gear.
---
Step 2: Get flasks and pots
---
Step 3: Look up what spec is best DPS.
---
Step 4: Hit the 1 button your rotation requires. Not in some cases you may need to hit 2. 
---
You rarely even need to move in vanilla raids. Learning how to do DPS will take less than a day for someone who hasn't played beta or pservers.
---
Warlocks do have an AoE fear, but it doesn't come till 40.
---
Intimidating Shout really is an interesting warrior skill. For the longest time I was a strict "thou shalt not IS in a dungeon" but it's actually one of the most useful cool downs you have so long as you play smart about positioning. It's great in SM and Strath Live when you can LoS pull packs way down the hallway, then IS to keep them busy and are pretty sure they won't agro.

================
---
**&lt;No Offense&gt; Alliance | NA-PVE | Late-Night Raiding Guild**
---
* No Offense is a group of old school raiders that just want an enjoyable gaming experience. We are currently running Heroic Raids and obtain AOTC on every content tier in retail, and we plan to do the equivalent in Classic WoW.
---
**Late-Night Pacific Time (PST PDT PT):**
---
* The guild tends to log on after the kids go to bed and log off around midnight.
---
**PvE:**
---
* Because we have kids and jobs and we enjoy raiding, not corpse camping streamers and being called terrible names by kids younger than our children.
---
**Alliance:**
---
* We currently raid as Horde.  So we're mixing it up!  Plus - Paladins!
---
**What we are looking for in members:**
---
* 1 Warlock, 1 Druid
---
* We are currently looking for social members, and raid alternates.
---
* We are currently filling our second raid roster
---
**Raid Scheduled:**
---
* 8:30 - 11:30 PT Wednesday/Thursday
---

Classic is using the retail wow macro API, there wont be any automatic conditional scripting.
---
That's not a PuG raid. That's just filling spots.
---
A PuG raid is 40 randoms joining up to raid. Also, blizzard has said they will ban/disable LFG-like add-ons. Also, gearscore means nothing in vanilla because many BiS items are blues/lower level stuff.
---
There’s gonna be a sizable population of classic players who don’t play retail. And I’m willing to bet this population will grow once people have the choice. 
---
Being able to play a mediocre game you don’t like isn’t really worth the 15€.
---
Classic or updating eventually will simply cause a problem. Consumers pay for something and don’t get anything?
---
Pugs for naxx trash are pretty common too, since it drops a lot of good stuff
---
One might say it goes both ways.

**Looking for a NA PvE Casual Raiding Guild for Adults (or at least mature players only)**
---
I'm a vanilla vet (raided MC,BWL, ZG, AQ20 and was MT for a lot of it).  Quit somewhere around TBC because I was in university and had to focus on school.
---
I want to heal in endgame and plan on running either Shaman or Priest. (I've done warrior/mage/druid all in the past)
---
I have a job now, and a wife so I can't no life this game like I may have wanted to in the past BUT I still would like to make it work with my schedule.  I would not be able to raid on friday or saturdays due to my social schedule but I would be able to raid other nights preferably after 7 to MAX 1130-12 at night.  I'm not looking to be hardcore but I do want to progress through the content as PVE is what I loved about this game although I do enjoy BGs with a group.  You'd get a guild member who is very chill and community orientated who would be able to hold is own in raids (used to be warrior class lead so i know how much of a pain it is at times).  Life at 60 I wouldn't be able to give a crazy amount of time but I can commit to raiding 1 or 2 times a week (wife approved).
---
Haha yes, we should. I was only kidding though :)
---
Good point. I think I could have done a better job makeing my case in the original post but its too late for that. lots of vitriol in this sub
---
https://classicdb.ch/
---
This brings back some good memories.
---
Well stupid answer, stupid topic. You proved my point here
---
A surprise to be sure
---
What are you talking about? This happens on private servers.
---
They ought to build off of the game as it exists/ed at the end of Vanilla, instead of adding 10 more levels and forcing everything to scale to 70/80/90, etc. There are plenty of chances to build content off of 1.12 Azeroth, some of which were done already. I wouldn't mind seeing those reconstructed off of the original maps + art from Vanilla at level 60.
---
Show those videos. 
---
The way I remember things from vanilla, was like this in your video.
---
You think you don't, but you do?
---
I like more as much as the next guy but I'm sooo tired of everything being about the more characters. It seems like every questchain I complete is just leading up to a cutscene with lore characters. I'm just working to help the lorecharacters in their path. 
---
What about my own path? I just want to be an adventurer again! I want to complete mundane tasks and explore the zones. Not fight Sylvana's war against humanity...
---
You as a guild, don't want to run too many hunters in a raid.  The reason being they don't add as much as bringing another pure DPS class.  In PVE, a ranged DPS is good if your raid is healing light, so that may be one excuse to add a hunter over a melee DPS.   
---
In PVP hunters are always bosses no matter the phase.  Having a ranged conc shot, viper sting, and ranged physical damage that beats up on all clothies is just amazing.  
---
Hunters have great gold farm and just all around solo mob grinding potential in their tool kit.  Just as long as you remember to feed your pet, buy ammo, dismiss pets before jumping down, and roll on every 2h stat stick in a dungeon group.
---
Yep. Can't wait to wake up to Mulgore again &lt;3
---
It's unlikely that it's working professionals with a family putting in those kinds of hours in any game. Personally, I only have my girlfriend and myself along with our dogs. I work 8-5:30 Monday-Thursday and then leave work at about noon on Friday. Monday-Thursday I can typically spend 3 or 4 hours playing games and we'll usually do that together. Friday afternoon I can usually spend the whole time playing games, along with most of the time during the weekends.

To run DM

Played Gnome Warlock in classic and TBC, went mining+engineering, would recommend!
---
It looked to me like he was just standing there to show the range of the mobs melee attacks.
---
Good to have alternatives as well! I played mage and hunter in vanilla (and druid tank in wrath), and all other classes’ talent trees feel so alien to me. It’s great with a discussion, makes you understand what makes a talent bad/good/mandatory. Thanks!
---
What about the end of season rewards? Would there be no season 4? Would they keep looping through season 1-3 rewards? Would season 3 keep looping? Would they make a slightly less impressive infinite season to keep repeating?
---
First Sunken Temple in a grp of equally clueless ppl. We finished it in like 3 hrs. Navigation was fun.
---
Spell batching is the new phrase for shit play.
---
"God dammit fuck spell batching why didn't my silence interrupt the cast time when the spell was at .1 seconds from finishing"
---
I just want that old feeling of deserving and hardship. Current WoW is a breeze. Im overpowered, im never in danger, and every class is oversimplified. 
---
If you pull too much in classic, you die. You must be tactical or methodical. I want that.
---
You min-maxers never seem to realize dps isn't all there is
---
If you wanna reread (or, likely, read my comment thoroughly for the first time) , youd see why there's almost always more than 1 even in naxx. 
---
There's a reason top private server guilds aren't completely 150% rogue warr lock mage lol guilds   bring boomkins and hunters too even tho the dps isn't nearly as close to rogue/warr/lock/f mage because they are versatile in the utility they can offer. A boomkin can save your raid with an extra Brez or (during trash pulls) hibernate or snare a mob, a hunter can trap , or kite and FD at a safe location .
---
Idk why it's so hard for people to accept, vanilla was *not* some dps race in terms of raids... You didn't need 100 extra dps from a boomkin vs a mage it literally didn't matter 
---
Idk man maybe try to step out of your box a bit! Play some private servers and see how alive these off specs are (pretty much other than ret and feral lellll)
---
I need to know when the servers go live so I can plan my pregame hibernation.
---
No, that's your interpretation, but if you'd played the beta or the stress tests, you would know it's wrong. Players get Layered quite aggressively and no Layer ever reaches a "full" server population on its own.

---
**About**: RMoG has experienced leadership intent on building a strong, cohesive community that clears content efficiently. We're building the guild with the long term in mind, when it comes to both content and building a community. Most would consider us a semi-hardcore guild. We don't care about server firsts, but we do care about holding raiders to high expectations and not letting dead weight drag us down. 
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution &amp; guild bank management
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
\- 1st MC will be 4 weeks post-launch                         
---
 **Recruitment**: We're currently accepting applications for exceptional players of any class. 
---
**Apply**: You can apply to the guild via this link, which is also available on our Discord server: &lt;[https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA](https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA)\&gt;

Its being discussed this week on our website, most likely Sunday/Wednesday 19:00 -23:00 CET
---
I mean not unethical if you tell folks, but I'd probably not join under those circumstances.  Also you being a tank is irrelevant to the situation.
---
Lol no they weren’t. Did you even play legit pservers at 60? I can tell you didn’t
---
That's why you don't do anything below the difficulty you're interested in, it makes the game much more fun
---
The main differences are more grinding, required pit stops to WC or DM (staves) and SM (bonebiter) to keep weapons up to date and splitting a few zones into more parts to come back to at a higher level. I have a gnome warrior speed leveling guide I'm working on that I might post after launch. I basically just went through the best routes to figure out what a warrior could/couldn't do and adjusted from there. I couldn't find anything comparable online.
---
That's not what he says at #6.

 Post-Naxxramas Content
---
* After Naxxramas is released, do you want any other content released?
---
Depends.  If their plan is to make a TBC: Classic, then no, just roll it right into TBC: Classic.  If not, then I would love to see them take an alternate path.  Maybe Kara in classic?
---
* Do you want TBC: Classic released? Would you want the current Vanilla "Classic" to remain separate?
---
**Yes!!**  I absolutely loved TBC.  With the exception of any type of dailys and FLYING!  I thought they made a ton of great improvements to the classes, hybrids, etc.  I loved all of the dungeons/raids and pvp.  I would be fine with either, character moves to new realms or just continue the same server.
---
* Would you want *new* content released, splitting away from TBC, essentially making an "alternate" WoW timeline/expansion series?
---
Depends, as stated above.  If their plan is TBC, go that route.  If not, absolutely!
---
* Would you be interested in content based on existing Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdom zones (Hyjal, Caverns of Time, etc)?
---
Yes!
---
* Would you be interested in new content that doesn't raise the level cap and/or doesn't increase stats on gear, therefore just being new content for the sake of having new zones/dungeons/quests to explore with minimal stat advancement?
---
I think I would be ok with either, depending on how they did it.

---
There is also a delay to vendoring, how do you explain that if not batching?
---
That looked the exact same as your video, almost.
---
The *only* fight in the game I use resistance gear (as averse to just pots) for as a mage is saphhiron. You'll be absolutely fine mate, I assure you.
---
The layering exists just so that doesn't happen
---
Since dungeon experience is buffed compared to private servers (I believe 2.5x XP on elites compared to 1.5X xp on elites on Pservers), dungeons should be very good for the first time through because of all the quest experience and a decent group grinding spot as well. Since warriors are so gear dependent, a couple additional pieces of dungeon gear picked up in a 2nd or 3rd run could make grinding in the open world much more bearable.

you will be   , very very squishy even with BIS blues . and purge is huge .
---
looks great, nice job
---
I'd personally roll a hunter twink for farming, but you can still do quite a lot of stuff with mage too. Played both in original vanilla.
---
Most noticable difference would be for example BRD where the dwarf/hound packs will net you, while on pservers they don't have that spell. The hounds in DM can be done even naked. 
---
You still can easily aoe grind to 60, you just need the right grinding locations and hope you are alone because of the long respawn time.
---
I actually didnt know this. and its pretty impressive that its the top post on the main subreddit which didnt even allow classic discussion for a long time

I will never be able to move and convince that many people since i dont have a a 50k+ follower like him

**Member Expectations** We are recruiting players who share our commitment to success in Classic WoW. We are looking for non-toxic individuals who want to level together, and begin raiding within a month or two into classic. Players who can keep a mostly consistent raid schedule, and have fun in between.

**Raid Info and Schedule** The guild will use a combination of Loot Council (first few weeks in new content to gear up MT and heals) and settle into EP/GP. All EP/GP information can be found on our guild website and discord. 
---
    [Raid times will be Tu/Wed/Tr](8:00PM - 11:00PM PST.)

It doesn't matter man. Horde don't have access to fear ward and they do just fine
---
I'm not saying the OP's logic isn't stupid, but nobody is going to care if it's the tank, healer or DPS that has the key. You ain't running UBRS without a tank or healers either.
---
Make sure to crank up the ingame music!
---
It launches on midnight at 27th in Paris. It's still late 26th evening in the US at that moment
---
Same.  First mage, then Druid, now probably Paladin.
---
Could you PM me with more details please, thanks.
---
You prick it doesn't even play the video haha
---
I don’t know what you’re looking for, bro. We aren’t getting a 2019 game. We are getting a 15 year old game in 2019. And I just looked at OP’s video from vanilla he just used in a comment and it looks pretty damn close to what he experienced.
---
It still runs terribly on just about any pc lol.
---
Potentially hunters could be god tier in PvP but that's only because the potential is there but so near impossible to attain. You'll be needing to manage your pets, aspects, the deadzone,  and traps on top of your typical skill rotation which in tight situations will be enough to make your head explode.
---
All else though they're pretty fun to play. Their DPS is generally on the low end unless you're hopped up on every buff imaginable so not much of an asset in raids, but as you mentioned if you'll mostly be playing solo then they're one of the best classes to roll next to warlock.

Yous welcome
---
AFAIK FD is currently bugged and doesn't work occasionally in the most recent beta version. So basically, you'd FD and the mobs would just start yelling "FAKER!!" and keep wailing on you. lol
---
&gt; there wont be any automatic conditional  
---
There are tons of conditionals that work in modern wow, e.g. \[help,dead,nocombat\]
---
before you get into run local.
---
then stuff to get character levels   
---
/script SendChatMessage("Level "..UnitLevel("target")); 
---
Then stuff to cast spells by name
---
 /script CastSpellByName("Engineering");SendChatMessage("I'll create items against mats, look out: "..GetTradeSkillListLink(),"CHANNEL",nil,GetChannelName("Trade - City"));CloseTradeSkill(); 
---
it looks like all the pieces are there already
---
True. But when it comes to logins? Cause we all know how that went day 1 of beta.

Big in Stormwind &lt;BiS&gt;, NA PVP-Alliance, CST LF High-End Raiders
---
Introduction: BiS is an Alliance guild that is comprised of officership and many raiders with pserver+retail KT clear/ late Naxx and numerous Cutting Edge experience. Our goal is to create a guild culture that focuses on high-end PVE/PVP gameplay and a sense of urgency to progress through content but most importantly a place to call home for all of classic.
---
Ambitions: Server firsts, while we all used to be in 5+ raid days/week we aim to take it a step slower and labeled as semi-hardcore.
---
Schedule: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays 7pm-10pm CST. Will most likely stick with 1-2 days (Tues/Weds) until AQ40/Naxx but will utilize Thursdays if there were hiccups in clearing the instance. Sundays will also be optional 20-man/alt MC+BWL clears once the aforementioned instances are on farm.
---
Loot System: Suicide Kings for class specific items, DKP for everything else
---
Member Requirements:
---
\-80% or greater attendance
---
\-Mechanical Awareness in Raids, DPS+Meter Padding will always be secondary to this
---
\-Farm the necessary consumables prior to raids.
---
\-Able to minimize toxicity in a social context
---
\-Reviewing our strat materials/videos ahead of time that will be posted on the website. (website in progress)
---
Current Needs:
---
Warrior: High
---
Rogue: Closed
---
Hunter: Closed
---
Druid: Closed
---
Mage: Closed
---
Priest: Closed
---
Warlock: Closed
---
Paladin: Closed
---
 Currently we are looking for 2 Warriors (DPS+Occasional OT)

you would need to spam this button (because of castsequence going 1 at a time) instead of just pressing the button once from macro above.
---
&gt;don’t want to be efficient in every aspect of the game.
---
Good for you. 
---
I don't want to be efficient in any aspects of the game except the ones that let me try out silly stuff like levelling engineering twice. The "worth" is irrelevant. 
---
You do you though.
---
Saving.
---
It's at least possible to get 60+ fps a lot of the time now. It used to max out at like 30 and then drop from there as the server instance got older, that was pretty terrible.
---
I immediately skipped to 3:40 in the video. At 4:01 and on he takes like 4 melee hits as soon as he moves into range and then backs away rooted mobs. You can see them as they do 36-42 damage. This is exactly what happened in your video.
---
Y’all are right. Clearly every hunter will have that Xbox. Because that was the way it was back then, right?
---
All those players walking around without them clearly had a bow equipped for looks. 
---
7% drop rate is obviously “must drop” status because probability is reality.
---
Christ, nice work lad.
---
I intend to fix the horde one in the near future. Though I think I need a small break atm xD
---
I really liked this one:
---
Blizzard are doing Classic only because how BfA flopped.

---
Just wanted to let you all know I'm also putting together a guild.  Check it out if you're interested.
---
\*\*Intro\*\*:  It's hard to describe my group of bozos.... but they are awesome.  We are mostly comprised of people with RL obligations (jobs, kids, family, etc.) and varying levels of tryhard status.  However, one thing unifies us: \*\*All Alliance Must Die\*\*.  If you're looking for a home that is.....\*lively\*... and very self-selecting (we don't bother with an application -- it's sink or swim with us and all based on proof/merti), then check us out.
---
\*\*PvP Stuff\*\*: We will be killing Alliance all the damn time since we are a majorly PvP focused guild.  We have a shit load of grizzled PvP veterans and World PvP enthusiasts.  We are going to be a massive horde of degenerates regularly pillaging Alliance towns and ruining their day.  If you suck at PvP or don't know how, that's fine --  we can teach you -- so long as you believe All Alliance Must Die.  
---
\*\*PvE Stuff\*\*:  Week night raiding. Probably start around 7:30PM CST/8:30pm EST.  Killing 15 year old robot bosses isn't exactly fun, but since it can give us loot to help us kill Alliance quicker it's something we obviously need to pursue.
---
\*\*Member Expectations\*\*:  We're not expecting you hit 60 in a week, lol.  We're expecting you to be easy-going, not be a dick to guild members, and not be edgy/racist/homophobic/political/controversial ..... but then also expecting you to want to crush Alliance so hard in the world that they want to uninstall the game.  WoW isn't hard to learn so I focus on having good people rather than only good players.
---
\*\*Classes\*\*:  We are recruiting everything but uh, we actually need DPSers and warriors badly.  We have a shit load of priests and druids... and still want more though.
---
\*\*One Last Thing\*\*:  Obviously, we don't take ourselves very seriously and you'll need a sense of humor.  However, it's your mistake if you assume we suck.
---

I’ll just heal endgame and collect all the ret tier gear. Hopefully...
---
I'm getting seriously pissed off at how people presume that any and all delay is caused by spell batching. This has nothing to do with spell batching. Stop this absurd fear-mongering of spell batching for the love of god.
---
I could be mistaken but I think castsequence will only try to cast the next spell if the last one was successfully cast.
---
What mage ganked this guy so bad? C'mon fess up.
---
\^
---
Blizzard, look into this please.
---
Yah that works to cast the highest version trained.
---
But the problem is, level 24 lowbie can't handle to the best version I can cast.

Your comment was toxic and was rearmed in kind. You don’t want a response don’t shitpost. Or if you do at least the balls to not passive aggressive your way out of it
---
25% extra stun resistance makes a huge difference. Easily the most OP racial and best bet for your warlock. Why does this have upvotes?
---
Going by the countdown timer it will be released at around 6pm in American on the 26th anywhere east of the UK will be 12pm 27th onwards.
---
This is how it worked in classic. You can do this between tics. Same with bleed effects. You won’t get kicked out of stealth instantly just because you have a bleed effect on you. This happens on the next tic. Therefore you can vanish and cheap shot if you time it before the next bleed tic. You can have a bleed on you out of combat and enter stealth and quickly get a cheap shot in on someone before the tic. This works for lots of things like consecration aswell.
---
Look at that crappy frame rate.  It's the authentic 2004-2006 experience!
---
That's one element of Vanilla that we can't reproduce in Classic unless you still have 15 year old shitbox that still works...10-15fps with the graphics settings turned all the way down.  For those of you with antique machines, I hope some of you try running Classic on it and post those choppy laggy videos.
---
&gt;I also want to be able to pvp and have some ability to do things in the world without respecing  
---
Do you want to pocket warriors (paladn) or carry flags (druid) ?  
---
&gt;I would like to raid heal and choosing a class that will be desirable for raids and 5 mans is important.   
---
Paladin. But keep in mind you have to get to 60 first, and paladin leveling is incredibly boring.
---
&gt;For open world pvp with a warlock what would be stronger?
---
A healer. Literally anything works.

If I remember there were some ways to get there but most youtube videos are from private server stuff
---
Correct. Everything while a party is moving has the extended range.
---
I kited King Bangladesh from his spawn along the road north to near the last bridge into the next zone. Oh I can't wait to kite elites across zones again lol.
---
he meant the other type of conditions, were it checks the targets level/Hp/MP to place the correct level of buff/Heal on them. These type of macros were tested on beta and did not work.
---
They didn't allow it because it was private servers, which are not allowed here either. You can discuss classic freely on /r/wow
---
I'm sure someone could sim it, but Ii I remember, in Vanilla white damage was about 40% total cat dps, so you do about 13% more dps with MCP vs no weapon.
---
Ahh Oki so is that the way candians speak English? I work with one and he does not sound like that.
---
Scroll up and read the comments from players remember vanishing and cs in flare.
---
This edit is clean!! I can appreciate the effort! And as long as it's a GOT reference before season 8 I'm happy!
---
I can‘t decide and it is stressing me out big time. I change my mind twice a day. Right now I‘m planing to play holy pala human. tomorrow it‘s going to be undead rogue I guess and next week I will be 100% sure to play tauren hunter
---
Cast sequence would get stuck until it could successfully cast the first spell.
---
(you would want reset on target not time anyway)
---
Cast sequen in Ascending order would mean I cast each crappy version until it failed, which on a high level player means I'd run out of mana before getting to the max version that worked for them.
---
Cast Random spam would mean that I waste mana putting crappy version on high levels.
---
yes, the high level of the spell, not the highest level possible to cast on the target. 
---
Eg. Power Word: Fortitude Rank 6 can only be cast on level 60 players, and would fail on level 59 or below.

&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance
---
Introduction:
---
Nostalgia is a raiding guild with a casual schedule, but a hardcore raiding atmosphere. We are built from a core of former top NA raiders that no longer have the time to commit to a rigours schedule, but still want to experience all that WoW Classic has to offer. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible.
---
Looking For:
---
    High Need:
---
     -  Rogue
---
     -  Hunter
---
     -  Paladin
---
    Medium Need:
---
     -  Warrior
---
     -  Mage
---
     -  Priest
---
     -  Druid
---
    Low Need:
---
     -  Warlock
---
We are actively recruiting all players, of any class, that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at the level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be.
---
Raid Schedule
---
Friday - 6:00pm to 9:00pm PST
---
Sunday - 5:00pm to 7:00pm PST
---
Friday will be our main raid night, and Sunday will be a spare night intended for extra progression during new content stages.

My daughter's the same age and sleeps just as well.
---
Enough so that my wife almost called in sick to work this morning --- because the baby woke up for 20 minutes at 2am last night (last teeth coming in - went to bed at 8, and I got her up for daycare at 8)
---
Idk, I saw our pally win ironfoe one time.
---
Wow, 22 iron spawns, that's ridiculous!  Yeah I think the scarcity will be good for the economy in general, especially for the gatherers, haha.
---
you are correct.
---
1.12 patch, so innervate is baseline.
---
Feign death.
---
Hunters are not trash in PVP they are just not that easy to play. People who play well in pvp know how to screw you over because of the deadzone. But don‘t expect to play against pvp experts 24/7.
---
To such an extent that the racial +2 agi on a NE makes them the only "viable" choice for hunter
---
Damn it,  I had talked myself out of rolling warrior since that's what I did in vanilla, but this reminded me of the sort of tanks I had to deal with.
---
Let people play how they want.
---
its decent, new wallpaper, thx!
---
People will play it for a few weeks and realize it’s the same old shit they have been playing for the last 15 years. There will be a point when they realize the nostalgia from the content pales in comparison to the original feeling of witnessing the technology and engine for the first time. Remember, what made wow amazing was how smooth it ran and how massive multiplayer gaming became a reality. It was a mainstream Everquest that every type of gamer could play and compete in. That feeling will never come back.
---
I’m torn between rogue and warrior. (Or even try my hand at try-hard feral dps/OT). I have it narrowed to melee dps though.
---
Call it what you want, but it’s better and more accurate than pservers.
---
reddit!
---
Nope. Enough reports and automatic suspend.
---
Hard to say, Blizzard is finally admitting their fuckups with Retail so we might see another legion like expansion where we really get back into it.
---
However, you hit the nail on the head. I think if OSRS didn't have any updates, the game would be long dead. I remember Pre-Ge there was like a max of 20k players on a day, now it's at about 79k.
---
I think people don't realize this about classic, some updates would be great if in similar fashion they were polled.. then again.. most of the new content on OSRS however (looking at you zeah) is dead pretty quickly. So it's hard to say?
---
Well if it help you then in my view the Alliance is the Old World (Europe), the "classic good guys", viewing the world as their birthright and non-Alliances as savages. While Horde is the New World (Americas), the underdogs, a ragtag of groups banding together to survive vs the Alliance. 
---
I'm really suprised that people from the US don't overwhelmingly play Horde. The connection between Orcs-Slaves, Tauren-Natives, Trolls-Jamaican/Inca and even Undead-TraitorEuropeans isn't very subtle :D
---
No, you're talking about auto-squelch, which prevents you from talking in public chat channels, but it's not in Classic in any case.
---
it does not, it breaks levitate though, but that’s a priest spell
---
Thats unanswerable because no class sucks in all kinds of pvp. But hunters are good in all kinds of pvp
---
Source: he is a pope in the Catholic Church, of course he fucks boys that’s what they do.
---
Yes it makes more sense to give to a tank which is why you do it in a guild group, but for random group you need if you need, you don't sit and argue who it "makes more sense to get". But as a tank you can just reserve the item, it's not a big deal most people who do lbrs rly don't care about it.
---
SM/Ruin 30/0/21 rules for PvP. However, something I see people doing is putting 3 points into Curse of Agony, but I always felt like putting those 3 points into Curse of Exhaustion was more useful for PvP, especially when you're fighting against warriors and rogues. The cool thing about the SM/Ruin spec is its also really viable in PvE. I think the only PvE spec that is considered better is the 9/21/21 raiding build.
---
Amazon workers are striking for better treatment today, don't cross the picket line and support a greedy company while their workers fight for a better world.
---
Some people think classic is going to last for 14+ years completely unchanged too.  Now I'm no rocket surgeon but I don't think *any* game has ever survived that long without new content to revitalize it.,
---
Lol
---
+ add in the “picking a name” in the mix
---
None? I've played mage a lot on pserver and very glad I've already chosen to play a rogue instead of this shit class.
---
New content should be embedded into the existing zones. No new ones that split the active zones people are playing in. Maybe a new Naxx-style 5man dungeon near Tarrens Mill with active pvp battles over the dungeon entrance with eg. an elevator in front to create a choke point.
---
Raid-gear post-naxx should not be better than naxx-gear - not even a single strength point - instead you could just have different themed gear with exact same stats. The power-creep beyond naxx would just brake the game completely.
---
The design should be about having a good and new raid and the bragging rights if you clear it / the exotic looking loot that comes with it and not additional power.
---
They could introduce crazy boss mechanics that require completely new itemization. Imaging a boss that can only take holy damage! The pala and holypriests do the DIEPS while the rest of the caster have to destroy the constant adds. Tanks have to solo lightbulbs that heal the raid for home much damage the tank has absorbed. Imaging the new theory crafting! So many items that where seen as not to be viable will now be farmed, because the meta changed for what a class is looking for, revitalizing old content.
---
Blizz can't do these kind of boss fights because the game is about the gear-carrot on a stick in front of you and every class and spec and mechanic has to be fair for everybody. The classic crowd is used to imbalanced stuff and additional content that does not come with downsides like flying would be highly welcomed.
---
Good luck trying to get in a serious guild but if you want to fool around in casual meme guilds go ahead don't go dwarf priest.
---
Thanks! Too early for me, but it seems most guilds opt for that sort of time. :/ I don't know how anyone with kids can focus on a raid before 21:00 CET!
---
I want to see 'think-you-do'-guy's face on classic launch day...
---
Does vanish immune work in the classic beta or have the changes to modern wow “fixed” that?
---
But "I remember" LFR in vanilla. Yeah we should totally do that again. It has made the game such a great place!
---
/s
---
Life eh eh eh… finds a way.
---
My opinion is that these weren't a problem until later.
---
To use a simple analogy, those features introduced in TBC were like a small amount of chocolate, a delicious desert on top of the meal that is Classic.  Retail is like living off of a diet that is 98% chocolate.
---
Chocolate as desert = good.  Chocolate as your only source of food = bad.
---
Oh sweet summerchild, you might remember the old days but this is a new age of gaming.
---
How can you not be good at DPS in vanilla?  For most classes it's a one button rotation.
---
We know bby. Hence “roll of the dice” if you find out after launch. If your entire guild rolls on a server hoping to avoid spergswarm only to find out 4-8 hours into launch that asfandstaytips are there, that’s fucked up. They need to disclose before launch because their stream isn’t more important than other people’s enjoyment of the game.
---
I never knew what spell batching was called, but basically everyone knew the effects. So taking it out would change my playstyle dramatically and it wouldn't be the same game at all. I'm sure it wouldn't effect the bad players at all, but for those who dialed in their movement and have a full understanding of most classes, the removal of spell batching would be a tougher pill to swallow.
---
Sure play what you think is fun. I don't that's what he was asking.
---
He said he's rolling a warlock on a pvp server. The warlocks biggest threat is the overpopulation of Rogues, then warriors. Combined with everything else this would give him a 40% chance to reduce stuns.
---
Other classes and other types of servers completely change the race answer, so I disagree that it would just be humans vs orcs.
---
From my judgement, it is worth it to get the Staff of Westfall and Bonebiter. 40% more dps than achievable comparable weapons for 10+ levels, which are 14 hours and well over a day played, respectively. A few hours of slightly less optimal leveling at 19 and 38-40 is worth it IMO. These weapons wouldn't be replaced until 30 (Bullova) and 52 (Un'goro quest). You need to work the route so that you have the quests though. This means Westfall-&gt;Redridge-&gt;SW-&gt;Westfall and a trip to Desolace for alliance.
---
Are humans not the best if you are into min/maxing healing done?
---
No, you don't get my definition. And downvoting like a crybaby is just rich.
---
By _your_ definition, if advances in understanding the meta push the ability of a particular spec beyond what they were commonly capable of when the raids were designed, then every other spec is less "viable." That's absurd.
---
_The_ definition of viable is not up for debate. A DPS spec is viable if it can produce the kind of damage that the fights were tuned to require of DPS members.
---

Looting is so weird. Sometimes box pops up for a bit, sometimes a flash. Felt unsatisfying during beta.

**Incarnation** \[A\] | NA-PvP | Mon/Tues/Weds | 7-10 pm PST | Hardcore | loot council
---
Hi everyone!
---
&lt;Incarnation&gt; is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community. If you take the time to talk with us you'll see our passion and that we're taking this seriously.
---
**About Us:**
---
We have a solid core group and are looking to add a few more exceptional players to our roster. Our leadership core contains the following: multiple top 20 KT kills, Rank 14, multi season gladiators, complete private server progression, and competitive world rankings in other games.
---
We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations. All the information is out there, such as boss mechanics and dps rotations. Even those new to classes/specs will be held to a high standard. We expect before applying you research and understand the basic mechanics and rotations of the class you're applying for.
---
**Expectations:**
---
We're currently fine tuning our raids weekly to ensure once launch comes we progress with minimal delay. Incarnation has an in house instant 60 server we use to ensure every member exceeds standards. We expect our members to be knowledgeable about each encounter and have adequate consumables available for progression.
---
**Recruitment:**
---
Rogues - High
---
Warriors - Medium
---
Priests - Low
---
Paladin - Closed
---
Warlocks - Closed
---
Mages - Closed
---
Hunter - Medium
---
Druids - Closed  
---
**Application:**
---
Apply on the website [https://www.incarnationguild.com/](https://www.incarnationguild.com/)or join us on discord at [https://discord.gg/St9mCuP](https://discord.gg/St9mCuP)
---
Thank you!
---
Communism. Not even once.
---
You act if dps is hard to find LOL
---
Of course they are memeing, the 3950x isn't even out yet and won't be by launch.
---
I could never understand why people do this.
---
Someone says something, then you claim the complete opposite to win an argument..
---
Lol sorry
---
Everyone used buffed back in the day. I dont know how it is now but i liked it then
---
Dwarf is ideal but most people know that. Odds  are good that there will 2 or more dwarf priests already in your guild. Dirty secret about ally priests was that the best were usually nelf.
---
So I will see a thread from you in 2 months:  
---
"Im lvl 20 after 56 hours, is this good?" or you turn to guides after tops 2 hours.. The later is my guess lmao.
---
If a guild has a ret pally use nightfall then they're doing things very wrong. I'd rather have a ret paladin trying to ret their little heart out and a warrior using nightfall than the other way around because the uptime is significantly different.

**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** Horde - NA – PvP – Semi-Hardcore w/ Loot Council
---
Raid Times: Monday, Wednesday at 8pm CST. 
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** is a brand new guild created by long term players who raided into Naxx when Vanilla was live. Lately we’ve been on private servers. We are older now and realize that life sometimes gets in the way of this game we love so much. We can’t play at all times like we used to so we need to make the most of it. What makes Vanilla WoW so special is the journey and the community you enjoy it with. We are building a family and we hope you consider joining us if you’d like to be a part of our team.
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** will be focused on competing with three day guilds while maintaining a two day weekly raid schedule. We are taking a few days off for the initial push to 60. We are currently planning to do Ony/MC exactly one month after launch. We will make the most of our raid times and expect all of our members to be prepared and consistent. We may not exactly be a server first competitive guild for phase 1, but we plan to clear all other phases within the first lockout they are released. As we evolve we will rival most hardcore guilds through later phases while keeping our raid days to a minimum.
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** is recruiting both extremely experienced and newer players who are willing to grow and develop with our team. All members are expected to handle coaching well, and be patient with loot. It comes so slowly in vanilla but it will come. Every person in the raid team will be expected to come with consumables and flasks for progression. We also anticipate having some newer players in the guild so we need patient members who are willing to help guide and assist our newbies.
---
On our off nights we plan to do 20 man raids or PvP. We love both organized battleground teams and world PvP.
---
If you’re interested in joining our team please contact us on discord for more information.

It depends which way the wind blows that particular day.  Sometimes you'll get downvoted and cussed, others upvoted and agreed with for the exact same comment.  Which is great, but also infuriating, because it always swings hard one way or the other.
---
I've said various things from the OP at different times and been massively downvoted and called an idiot or shill, and yet here we are.
---
shows up at 29:17 BBC time
---
it's pretty damn close. i didnt notice that first time watching it. probably a stock sound effect though
---
Nope, I used to tank exclusively. It's just funny how most of them think they deserve special treatment.
---
No need since i already got it one but thanks for your made up concern :)
---
I used to moonwalk all the time on my rogue lol
---
Some general tips for each class is: hunter:taunt pet when they use trap, demo shout rogues to Get them out of stealth, bait frost nova vs mages or nade when they start casting, berserking vs warlocks, and always try to keep hamstring up on your enemies. Another good tip is whenever you Get ccd or your enemy pops all his cds f example mage pops arcane power and starts casting, you can use your Shield Wall if you are okay with using it for a pvp Encounter(30m CD). And lastly you dont really wanna use rend in pvp since it breaks the fear from your piercing howl or intimidating shout. Usually you use those to fear and bandage up and also drop combat and Get a free charge off+extra rage from it
---
Spriest are awesome but I’m not sure I want to compete for the single raid spot.  If I am going to heal, I don’t really want to play a priest in pvp, especially on alliance.
---
You are probably right about most people not caring. The majority of them will just get carried through UBRS anyway. The minority here in this sub reddit are the ones pitching fit about it. That same minority will probably be the people carrying the casuals anyways
---
There are multiple pservers with their own implementation of lack of thereof. If the video author played on one it may be true for that one but necessarily for other.
---
Same. I think between my full time job, gf, and need to take care of myself I can only dedicate maybe 30 hours a week to the game like a true ultra casual!
---
Some people think they'll first lockout clear MC too.  People who've never played vanilla or pservers and plan to follow 1-60 levelling guides.
---
I can’t fucking unsee it now...
---
Sadly beta is over, so we don't have a client to test with. Both of the clips are from the final day. I also don't personally know Perplexity.
---
I would be very happy if any new raids they made were 20 or 25 man raids though instead of 40.
---
May Le Toucan forgive me for my mistake. Truly an enigma how I made such a mistake.
---
The sister banging seems like something a Pally would do though.
---
Thanks for the taking the time to make and post the vid. It’s helpful to see this in practice.
---
Not my experience.
---
That ring is like hunter bis right?
---
Sorry bro, you already proved you don’t know what you are talking about because you are saying private servers are better than actual vanilla. 
---
Spell batching and leeway exist in classic just as they did in vanilla. I played in vanilla and loved the game, and the fact that I’m saying I want actual vanilla already proves my opinion is better than yours for the game and community.
---
Do us a favor and go talk about what you don’t like on private servers.
---
Any links you’d care to share?
---
what are you crying about?
---
If it went to a dps instead would you change your mind? The goal here is to get into UBRS faster, not fawn over the glorious tank.
---
Yep, that's our job. Protect the healer, dps and casters I always stay ready lol they usually stand behind my traps.
---
Some reason the druid travel and water forms really seem to pop on this, maybe coz i main druid :p.  Amazing work
---
I wasn't talking about the visuals :P
---
For sure, the lure of tanking keeps pulling me to warrior as well. I just tell myself that no running warrior will open up the option for more non-meta dungeon runs which are always fun.
---
Made what up? My own experience?
---
Good try.
---
It was a grind, to say the very very least
---
Done, will change the link when I make the revision though.
---
prefaced with opinion dude. Not like im pushing anything on your particular group
---
Sorry that 95% of the responses we get could have been filtered out by just simply reading our post. So we have to deal with guilds that are Horde, Casual or allow meme specs. We've talked to a few good guilds but there is always something, either on our end or theirs, that causes us to keep looking. One guild we both liked and were in talks with the GM, but they already had a full roster of mages and asked if my friend REALLY wanted to play mage, other wise they would have been happy to have us join. But much like our decision to play alliance, we're also pretty adamant in playing Warrior and Mage. Thanks for your interest though~
---
Haha, thanks!
---
He's not playing well, but it's still fucking retarded.
---
i am a caster dps 
---
in my last guild i literally got the thorium rep to make nightfalls for my guild so i could have that uptime.  
---
ret pally uptime isn't terrible.  Like i said, i would choice to have no ret pallies :)
---
Because a lot of it is up to gear and consumables.  Though it's also true people can completely drag their feet and fail on a 1 button rotation, I just meant it's not very hard to not be 100% effective.  You almost have to try or stop pressing buttons.
---
So now 20 hours a week is 10-15?  There's no struggle for 20 hours a week, that's well above a casual play time.  Go look up Ooze SPriest youtube info on how to play the game at 10-20 hours a week.  He actually has a pretty decent series set up for each class.  Each phase you're still gathering pretty substantial gear.
---
I know you keep saying it's impossible.  I'm saying it's possible.  I was at the top percent of players, but I also know what it takes to get to a 90th percentile of performance with less than half the effort to get there.  If you do planning, play efficient, mix in raid gear with PvP gear and are dedicated you can do it.  You can't spread yourself thin if your goal is the PvP grind.  There were plenty of less geared players who were better at PvP than me and were dressed in much less gear.
---
But in reality, rank 11 is only for pretty mounts for all factions.  And going 10-&gt;11 was a pretty significant jump, from my experience hitting rank 10 three times effectively.   If you're doing it just to get a cheaper mount, you're more efficient just farming 50g an hour and you can do that in less than 20 hours for your mount. Even more, doing the whole rank 11 grind you might as well just do the Winterspring tiger mount rep grind and get that mount to be extra unique.  
---
The whole PvP grind reality, rank 7 and 8 will get you 4/6 of your blue PvP set.  That's a much easier rank to get.  We had people in the guild at that rank who would only PvP on honor weekends.  With the 1.12 versions, the blue PvP sets are real strong.  All you're missing are shoulders/helm.  You can get T2 helm form Onyxia runs and T1 shoulders from MC or some equal in ZG.  Exalted shoulders in AB, if you're doing your grind in a later phase.  You're getting a ton of comparable items on your path towards those ranks.  If you're in a guild that's clearing MC/Onyxia, you can do those in a couple hours on a single night.  ZG runs are a dime a dozen as well.  Even better if you can prove yourself and sneak in an alt run with a top tier guild.  
---
I know, because we did that and let other PvP players get in our lesser raids.  Our "alten core" and "altwing lair" raids still had mains carrying, becase they needed stuff like drake fang talismans, CTS, ass candy, etc.  But a ton of gear we just sharded on a regular basis.  We were more than happy to pay it forward and get people into our alt raids to get gear and see raids they couldn't see.  I established a lot of relationships with the PvP crowd and we actually recruited a lot of raiders from experience playing with them in PvP.
---
My time wasn't worth grinding hundreds of gold to get the rune cloth just so my gnome could ride a black ram/horse/tiger.  I rather spent that time continuing to PvP, do raids, less farming for things like consumables and messing around with 19 and 29 bracket WSG alts, etc.
---
The Nelf starting area is really awesome - visually and musically. You're gonna have an amazing time, /u/Burnt_Pixels .
---
My first character was a nelf druid back in the day and it was just perfect for a first experience :D
---
So you’re saying you’re in the minority? Gotchu.

---
&gt;The distance between the servers and the users has not changed at all, in the last 15 years.
---
Citation needed? This statement defies all logic. 
---
First of all, there are most assuredly more servers / data centers than there were in 2004, and the speed at which you can send / receive data to / from those has improved as well. 
---
Network infrastructure HAS improved. Reduced latency is a byproduct of that.
---
because it's hard for leveling or for another reason?
---
Go with what's fun for you.  Anyone who gives you a hard time about racials belongs on your ignore list anyway.
---
Big thing is weapons and gear.  If you have a new higher DPS weapon ready every 5 levels, you can level quite quickly.  If it's your first toon, it's going to be slower.
---
Sons of flame? They most likely wont have time to spawn.
---
No, I remember it from raiding on private servers for the last 5 years or so. 
---
No one gives a flying fuck what you are.  If a guild is actually turning down priests just because they think they need a dwarf then that means they don’t trust their tanks with getting out of tears and should be avoided.  
---
I hate to break it to you sweet cheeks but vanilla raiding is not that complicated.  Don’t be bad and you won’t need a dwarf.
---
Every class can be good bro. People shit on hunters because they’re easy to play at a mediocre level - they can still be played at a very high level by a good player, and be great!
---
You seem like an idiot
---
You probably will, he's the CEO.
---
YOU DO REALIZE
---
Research logical fallacies and it’ll help you understand why people argue in a certain way
---
Story of the last few months. Pretty sure I wont know for sure until I'm staring at the character screen on the 23rd. 
---
I dont have as much time as I used to, and that's the only thing keeping me from a warrior. Lock and rogue are my next 2 choices. 
---
Good luck, friend.
---
Forgot to mention all the content will be trivial and classic is super easy.
---
#NoChanges
---
Give me all the QoL improvements of TBC and Arena, but make it in a different cannon instead of outland.   
---
No flying mounts tho.
---
Every 30 seconds is a bit of an exaggeration. I'm bored at work, but not THAT bored.
---
I think the people who want the 100% uncut, brutal, honest and original vanilla wow experience, the only correct way to play is on the same hardware they did over a decade ago.
---
I'm worrying this way takes too much time to move. Why do you prefer it?
---
You won't be appreciated in pugs. They'll just let you die while your desperately throw psychic scream, shields, and dispels all over. 
---
That said dispel is even more important than in tbc/wotlk. Remember wizard cleaves? Any combination of 2 warlocks and mages can do what they did with all their cds up. Geared people will crit frostbolts for 1800 and shadow bolts for higher. Most classes can't even get enough stam without grinding rank 14 to survive 2 people hardcasting a spell and then using an instant. They will get globalled the moment those spells hit.
---
Swifty
---
Sadly spoiler tag probably isn’t even necessary. Most people that haven’t already watched it will not  watch the show due to the massive bad press that season 8 generated. Anyone that i knew that had it on their bucket list no longer does,
---
# SM ARM/CATH - 4 ARMS WARRIORS AND A SHAMAN
---
I'm trying to figure out my alt strategy.  I know guilds will have MC on farm after the first week, but there's still going to be a pretty hard press in the first few weeks.  More so if they're doing an extended phase 1 to account for everyone leveling up.
---
But with no honor system, MC being a relatively easy farm, it's probably the best time to level up a second alt.
---
My SO is going Warlock but I know she'll be going slow in that process.  Which is OK, I can put an alt and keep it around her level.  If she does abandon the game, I wanted to play a warlock as well so I could even take over the account if need be.
---
So, at that point, I'm wondering if I'd have something like a main and alt leveled to 60 in phase one (probably warrior main, druid alt) and then pick something else like a paladin to level with the SO.
---
Just cast max rank, if it's on your bars it will auto-downrank for a lower level character.
---
I think a lot of people overlook 'quality' vs 'quantity'. 
---
I may only have 2 hours a night on week nights. But when I'm logging in I know exactly what I want to accomplish, where I will accomplish and how I will accomplish it. 
---
There's nothing casual about it, despite some weeks this might only be 5 to 12 hours a week.
---
Depends on the realm. BFA launch was delayed for 6 hours for high pop servers.
---
I can't wait for this game to feel like an actual RPG again
---
Hah, playing retail. Good one.
---
Alas, I'm almost 50. I will be going to be at 10pm... well maybe 11pm. 1 day a week I can do midnight. Okay no one tell my wife I didn't sleep okay? ;)
---
Bosses die in 30 seconds on private servers. In Classic the bosses will die even faster because they have far less armor so stacking melee dps will be an even greater benefactor.
---
Is area 52 a US realm? Because I think on EU we didn't have any issues and I play on to the most populated one. Hopefully everything goes smooth for classic tho
---
That is debatable. Warriors can pop free action or restorative pots to counter most of their weaknesses.
---
Now you're just projecting lol. Hate to break it to you but you aren't exactly exhibiting social or civilized behavior in your discussions.
---
AFAIK the only items that are locked to your specialisation rather than engineering level and/or character are the transporters. Gob gives instant access to a high level area where jujus can be farmed while Gnomish puts you in the next zone over from a PvP hotspot in the form of un'goro and it's devilsaurs.
---
Pretty rare to see someone who understands you don't need to rush 5/5 Imp Corruption.
---
thank you and well done.  I now have a new lock screen and desktop :)

 📷 &lt;No Plan Required&gt; is an EU PVP ALLIANCE guild that intends to aim high in Classic. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.  📷  What to expect  The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it, and we do it properly. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. Although we hold heavy emphasis on PvE content, PvP will not be absent from the guild's many activities. As for our activities, our members are not expected to, but are encouraged to join us as we embark on many open world journeys! ●▬▬▬▬๑۩۩๑▬▬▬▬▬● Note: Unorthodox specs are allowed within conditions  📷  We are currently accepting Raid Leader applications!  - Raid Days: Thursday -----&gt; Tuesday  - Raid Times: 7:50 PM GMT [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C-Nx-5iu2g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C-Nx-5iu2g) \- Guild Trailer Feel free to PM me for any questions you might have - Join our discord server!

Rogues can't use nightfall. The best nightfall user is a melee hunter, which is probably better than a ret paladin, all things considered.
---
**&lt;Get of Fenris&gt;** \- Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore
---
 
---
**What’s it mean?:**
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse. The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.
---
​ 
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.
---
**So what about loot and stuff?:**
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.
---
**What Gets us apart:**
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such **we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).** This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool.
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!
---
​  
---
**A Brief History:**
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Phase 1 we will have two (yes TWO) Molten Core groups. East and West coast.
---
East Coast: Sun/Mon 7:00 - 10:00 PM EST. (4:00 - 7:00 PST) West coast: Tues/Thurs 7:00 - 10:00 PM PST (10:00 - 1:00 EST)
---
Members may sign up for either that fits their schedule. Some more hardcore members should be able to raid both events with an alt/main.
---
**Guild Priorities:**
---
Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days). The 3rd day is a flex day for outdoor bosses and possibly Onyxia. MC will be ran in two days. We ask members to try and be available at least two out of the three days.

Drop us a line and let’s talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we’re gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
One for tanking One for deeps?
---
Much appreciated, thank you!
---
Hunters are great, problem is people who played hunters were historically bad. Either from not knowing how to use their traps, how to kite, how to use their shot rotation, melee weave, manage their pets instead of just dismissing them...
---
Private servers revealed they don’t scale nearly as well as other dps classes played by equally skilled players. But classic will be different in ways we still don’t entirely know. Regardless, hunters can still ignore threat capped dps
---
Hi HalSafonn,
---
Paladin is the better duo class imo. Can go AoE tank spec for leveling, with warlock benefiting running Imp. Fire shield is great with Ret Aura + BoSanc + Shield Spike. Both have free 40 mounts. Both benefit from BoW. No form swapping when the warlock needs healing. Better saves imo too with a no cooldown rez, BoP, Lay on Hands, etc.
---
For variety of content without respecing at 60, Druid might be better(stealth in open world is hard to compete with). Both have generally light requirements on their healing talents which frees things up for other activities. An argument can likely be made that the variety of buffs from a paladin makes them more in demand(more incentive to double up with them) than druids. Having a more armor options as a paladin is nice too.
---
In open world PvP paladin is the better duo choice(again, imo). Druid has a lot of mobility but the Warlock does not. You'd be better off turretting in world PvP, sticking close together, than be a druid leaving your lock buddy in the dust.
---
Endgame as pally you'd likely be looking at a 25/21/0 spec along the lines of  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/0554310052005-053201333001](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/0554310052005-053201333001). Depending if you were more interested in tanking 5 man dungeons(perfectly doable as a raid geared healer with some off pieces) or PvP, the points can be shuffled around a bit.
---
Disclaimer, I plan on rolling/maining paladin come classic. I am hoping someone replies in here saying how druid is better. I've mostly only been reading up on what to expect as playing a paladin; very possible I am underestimating the druids capabilities and warlock synergies.
---
\~Best of luck.
---
I am an officer not some pocket heale- YOU’RE MY DAUGHTER
---
You don’t think these issues are a big deal to the state of the game and warrant concern?
---
Given that Berserker Rage can remove incapacitate effects, yet can't remove Blind, Scatter or Frost Trap, they can't be described as incapacitate effects.
---
It seems that this is recent opinion here but never say never. 
---
Besides I think everybody here assumes that they will be in pro guild whereas they may end up in a guild that generally sucks at dps. 
---
During WotLK I was in one. We generally could beat encounters but there was huge gap between 1st and last dps and because of that everything was harder than it could be with pro team.
---
Almost made me cry dude.
---
You said it everything.
---
WoW was my therapy, my best friend.
---
I played with a very solid hunter and feral. Both would regularly hit top 10 with other competitive dps classes. It was actually very refreshing to see them push the class performance to the limits.
---
His reply was generic, but I think you need to take a break from the internet.
---
You’re bored enough to be rude without cause.  And nobody wants that for the community.  Try to be kind/ or informative or just scroll past, you’ll have my thanks.
---
I’m torturing myself, because I really love paladins, but I’ve never played alliance... I’m kinda for the horde so I really don’t know if playing my fav healer is worth abandoning the horde. Anyone else with the same problem? :D
---
Thats a fair statement. I've been reading on Joanas guide, watching Kargoz's routes and looking up how Tactics (a rogue on the beta) ran his 1-10. I personaly won't be making an orc/troll alt on classic (main druid, undead priest alt). Hence I haven't ran the zone as thoroughly as I could have.
---
I mainly focussed on the quests and wether they are drop rate quests or part of a larger chain. Leveling in the beta, Sarkoth was always up, but during the stresstests it was a serious shitshow trying to tag him.
---
It's initial cast is spell batch, not that that would make difference with how it works for the follow 30 seconds.
---
No, Tywin would be a Protection Warrior who very seriously minmaxes his character but rarely MTs. He would make sure to save every black dragon related quest possible in Dustwallow Marsh until he’s ready to do Onyxia’s Lair. Then he’d go through and do every quest possible so he can feel as if he is systematically dismantling Onyxia’s ring of power and influence. After she is defeated in the raid he would skin her corpse to symbolically represent his defeat of her and her power.
---
Then he’d, I dunno, have Vis’kag broken and forged into two different swords and then burn an Onyxia Scale Cloak.
---
ok great thanks ill defiantly be changing those, do you see any other mistakes?
---
What a shitty comment.
---
Pretty accurate.
---
Y more words when less do
---
Yeah it's how we talk haha. Eastern Maritimes (especially Newfoundland), Ontario and Alberta all have distinct accents. Look up a TV show called Letterkenny, it's a pretty accurate depiction.
---
Following week he be showing up to raid [like](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sqxu0xoZZEbct0cq)
---
you can only use berserker rage before hand, you cant use it while your incapacitated.
---
If anything its more like a buff, I guess
---
Until you get to the underground quests as a Hunter with no pet and try to 2v1 the mobs that aggro together. Holy shit that was so frustrating. Way worse than the mine in Elwynn Forest imo
---
&gt; will I be shunned for playing a priest  
---
No. Fear ward has its uses but its not an always thing. Healing is always a thing. People will always want to be healed.
---
Playing retail lol.
---
It will make Classic even better!
---
I see what your saying though, so what would you categorize blind scatter and frost trap?
---
You're welcome
---
Warrior is going to be the best ranged dps
---
Not sure where you got them numbers, but I believe base stun resistance is 5% and orcs get 25% bonus resist so sit around 30% chance to resist a stun which is huge

 **&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[Alliance - NA - PvE Server\]**
---
If you...
---
...want to experience Phase 1 MC/Ony
---
...are T3 BiS minded
---
...seek organization that allows work/play balance
---
...and hope to play with driven, mature, and friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players with high-end experience from Vanilla, private servers, retail, and every expansion in between. We’ve played many MMO's at all levels of dedication and leadership and look forward to returning to the MMO that has defined our gaming experience. We continue to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together to establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
**Mission:**
---
Our primary goal is to establish an organized raid core capable of clearing content quickly and enjoyably. Our member expectations and in-depth plan for Classic can be found at [http://celestialborn.com/charter/](http://celestialborn.com/charter/).
---
Tuesdays: 6:00 - 10:00 p.m. PST
---
Wednesdays: 6:00 - 10:00 p.m. PST
---
Wednesdays will be eliminated as much as possible in early phases.
---
**Loot:**
---
Loot council with member-driven distribution (details within Charter)
---
We are still recruiting for many positions, including non-raid core members whom prefer our environment but may not fit perfectly due to experience or schedule.
---
If you are interested in learning more please refer to our website at [http://celestialborn.com](http://celestialborn.com/). Or, add FAYRE#0120 on Discord. 
---
Thank you and best of luck in your search for the perfect guild!
---
&gt;I'm not sure if it's mainly meant for PvE or PvP, but I see you have Scare Beast on the list so you should have Hibernate
---
Isent Hibernate a sleep? or is it "technically" something else
---
That can be tricky as it requires changing out of berserker stance to apply. If you do that you’re asking to be gouged or put into a blind sap reset.
---
I’m not talking theory. I’m talking the hundreds of duels I played with each class.
---
Please shut the fuck up you give me Diablo 3 vietnam like flashbacks
---
are there other freeze effects? that arnt technically other effects ? like frost nova or something along those lines?
---
Get brokentooth, highest atk speed. Annoying against casters :D
---
Jesus Christ.
---
Burden of Knowledge (learning the game) is not part of playing the game. WoW doesn’t even have a relatively high burden of knowledge compared to other games.
---
And no, it was not dropped for being spectator unfriendly and I get entirely fucking sick of hearing this excuse. People don’t like watching WoW arenas because they’re just not very fun to watch, not because they’re all dentskulls who can’t comprehend the advanced and confusing gameplay of WoW.
---
Well? The person _didn't_ get my definition. And I said _like_ a crybaby. That's not even a personal attack, it's a characterization of an action.
---
Everybody thinks they're self aware. Almost everybody isn't. Are you aware how drastically you escalated the hostility, for instance?
---
You claim you stand on firm ground but haven't really brought anything to back it up.
---
Gnomish. All the worthwhile goblin items: sapper, jumper cables, &amp; rocket helm are BoE. Providing someone is a goblin engi with the patterns they can craft everything you’ll need.
---
I remember grinding in WPL for levels as a frost mage and had no problem doing it during vanilla. So if 13 y/o me could do it I'm sure it's not that hard but who knows.
---
I'm on the fence between Mage/Warlock/Spriest.. why are you tempted to roll Warlock?!
---
I think you just answered your own question.  People sacrifice parts of their personal life to play this game or never had one to begin with.  You will be playing classic casually, and that's completely fine.  Don't be afraid of that definition.  Even if you just took half of a weekend day to play you would more than double your playtime.  Small choices like that are the difference between being casual and not.. and like I said just play the game however it's fun for you.  There's nothing wrong with being casual.
---
Go druid and do both?
---
Slow cookers should be mandatory for bachelor pads
---
i think you should reread my comment.  "You would rather have a warrior/rogue instead of the ret pally and a warrior using nightfall."
---
so get rid of the ret for a rogue/warrior and then give one of your warriors (doesnt have to be the one replacing the ret) a nightfall
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=10318
---
Not sure how reliable the source is, but you don't need rep to purchase this hat.
---
Man you guys are savage and quick to downvote
---
It was always 20 hours max which obviously means that average is below. I mean you play 40-50 hours max? well your average is at 30-35 isn't it? so if someone can play 20 hours max, then average is probably 10-15.
---
Then I never said it's impossible, I said it's really not simple for average player and you can get better gear in raid with less effort and, as you mentionned, farming gold for your 100% mount is waaaaay faster. So why putting yourself under pressure and forcing you to play for rank 11?
---
If you answered to that guy: "it's doable but it's hard and you can get better things and faster elsewhere" then I would have just upvoted vote but since you answered things like: "you can get 3 level in a week and it's not that long, I did it 3 times" then I'm telling you that you are totally misleading someone who didn't play back then and that's why I'm answering you.
---
And sorry but if you didn't had time for your gnome to ride a black ram then you simply didn't have to get one and like I said, it's ridiculous to boast about how efficient you were if you bought gold.
---
Any class that must say I am a DPS is no true DPS.
---
Not from players.   
---
While I'm correcting things though. Death coil is a Horror not a Fear, Polymorph is a "Polymorph" effect, not an incapacitate.
---
so you are butthurt over giving his joke a compliment?
---
maybe you should step away from the computer to do some yoga or something therapeutic
---
I only said you seem *like* an idiot
---
Yeah I’ve been trying that out so far, do u think orc or undead works better for it? Essentially I’m deciding if I like avoiding stuns or fears lol
---
But then you have to play a meme class and we've already established that if you do, you have to be a terrible healer that never raids, playing what you love but not having any fun ever.
---
&gt; 10 (45min IMO)
---
not even speedrunner shamans do it that fast. On a fresh Iam happy to get out of starting zone in under 3 hours.
---
Real warriors stance dance
---
There's a vendor delay on retail too, it's not batching.
---
I should go feral Druid instead of warrior tank!  They have more armor and a piss easy rotation.
---
But then I don’t get those raid spots unless I heal and I’m only situational when I can tank there...
---
So I’ll roll warrior!
---
The whole time that phrase was directed towards every person who fails to find the fun in a 15 year old version of this game. They're out there
---
I remember pugging ZG and AQ20 a lot.
---
I remember pugging MC and Onyxia many times too, but you could tell everyone had raided MC and Onyxia a dozen times on their main but were pugging on their alt.
---
No you weren't. You seem to be under the delusion that a random group of dps that aren't in a guild with you are people getting carried because they'd roll on their keys. 
---
They don't receive any benefit from letting you roll on a key and they receive a massive benefit from having their own key. If they don't have any obligation to you, why would they ever just let you have they key?
---
tagging mobs was impossible at launch of the stress test
---
Why smite when you could melt faces?
---
My points make the fact that you are comparing to a private server totally irrelevant. Its lijke you didnt even read *my* comment
---
I am ok with post-Naxx quests/raids/zones at level 60, and I am also ok with TBC. However, I am almost entirely sure that the community will say one thing now and another once Naxx has been out for 6+ months, so it's hard to say what is best.
---
If they choose post-Naxx content, each patch should have minimal difficulty curves, and minimal class adjustment. I'd absolutely love some deep-diving new 5-mans in vanilla style, but I'm also super nostalgic about TBC heroics...even though they were super difficult, lol.   
---
While the two choices are close, here is a simple list on what I want to see happen and why. Best is on top, of course:
---
1. Post-Naxx content. New vanilla dungeons with vanilla balance without flying, and it keeps Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdoms alive as an immersive world.
---
2. TBC as it was. I loved the character progression in TBC, and the fact that enhancement shamans were viable is a huge plus for me.
---
3. Alternate expansion progression. This is simple unrealistic in my eyes, and is difficult to comprehend since a ton of thought and design goes into an expansion. That said, I also don't trust the lead designers to make a good expansion...sucks to say, but I don't.
---
I've always loved designing dungeons and bosses for WoW, so the idea of getting new ones but with old-world balance and progression makes me a bit giddy. 
---
**However: IF WE GET POST-NAXX CONTENT, DO** ***NOT*** **ADD CATCHUP MECHANISMS.** 
---
Side-grade raids that are a tiny bit easier are fine. I saw my brother log into his Deathknight in retail yesterday, and he was getting gear 25\~ ilvl above his +5 mythic stuff from 5man heroics. That is a system that will make me purge WoW from my mind and memories. 
---
That is all.
---
You have 2x master summoner in there.
---
Apart from that it looks nice.
---
Could you maybe explain to a noob like me why demonology is better than affliction? :)
---
I never thought about that. ty!
---
I don't like the gameplay of druid tanks in classic ... They were almost worse than paladins
---
4 months later... Do you know the name of the video? Looks like it's missing, but I'd love to see what you were pointing to. (Or the name of the druid?)
---
They ban plenty of add-ons already in current wow. Don't see why they couldn't ban the LFG add-ons. Sure there might be a LFG add on that slips under blizzards radar but an add on like that isn't going to be useful unless a lot of people use it, and if a lot of people use it then it won't stay out of their radar for long.
---
Spell batching wasn't a bug.
---
Doesn’t break slow fall
---
I think skinning would be pretty sound for leveling, because then it gives you more of an incentive to grind on beasts, which are plentiful. I'm going mining on top of skinning, in hopes of being able to gather enough mats while leveling to level up engineering at 60.
---
Now combine it with the sheer volume of people who will be leveling all at once and what happens?
---
It’s very easy to out agro your voidwalker. You can try voidwalker+bear to do a bit of aoe farming (as far as beardruids and warlocks can do that) but i’d also try using the imp and have the druid tank. I think you can easily do 3 to 4 mobs at a time if handled properly. 
---
It’s an interesting combination which i hadn’t given any thought yet. So anything i say is off the top of my head. *don’t blame me if i said something false*
---
It really comes down to if there are fast dynamic respawns for nodes. If blizzard doesn’t implement quicker spawns, then yes it will be extremely difficult to level these.
---
Why would you *not* do DM?  Just because it's a little out of the way?
---
Lol you fucking reported my comments? Little salty that you're fucking wrong?
---
Hunter makes the best NF user. Priest can spec shadow weaving for less heal efficiency and free up a pure dps slot. IIRC moonkin is 3% spell crit to the group and the personal dps loss tends to overshadow the other 4 party members getting the buff.  
---
That said attrition is the real end game boss. If you can keep a talented player coming to raids by playing a meme spec it’s better than going short handed or pugging slots. Having a fun experience is the better alternative to burning out players who will only raid log and ghost the guild down the road.
---
Right. I compared an action to one of a crybaby and you said I seem like I _am_ an idiot.
---
&gt; That's the firm ground on which *I call you an idiot*
---
See? Your intention was to insult me.
---
For Huhuran progression the soakers do need full nature resist.
---
2 min CDs, 3 min CD racial, wear a dress.
---
It's known exactly how resistances will work in Classic. It's been known for over 14 years.
---
As a Frost Mage you don’t need to worry about any resistance gear until Naxx.
---
Tyr's Hand becomes much easier with a duo. Usually made more gold there as a duo than solo from the greater killing efficiency &amp; vastly decreased deaths.
---
eww...soul link
---
"That's not why they multibox. They do it to get ahead of other people"
---
That was really insightful, respectful and added a lot to the discussion. 
---
How about you just followed your comment up by showing any evidence of your claim? Then it wouldn't have been as incompetent as you made it out to be.
---
All the anti-layering folks have convinced me this will not be an issue. There will be a bajillion nodes available. /sarc

&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | NA-PVP | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore
---
Introduction: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other’s company, and found communist memes amusing (For real though we have a lot of liberals/leftists. You for sure don't have to be. But if you get triggered by the existence of the left, that might be an issue).
---
Raid Schedule: We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 pm EST/6:30-9:30 pm PST on Tues and Thurs. We will use loot council made up of a mix of officers and a weekly rotation of raiders with a focus on gearing tanks and healers first.
---
Player Expectations: We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables and arrive on time. As we only will raid six hours a week, we need to be efficient and players should aim for 80%+ attendance.
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game.
---
Ideally looking for:
---
&gt;1 dedicated offtank
---
&gt;
---
&gt;3 fury warriors
---
&gt;1 holy priest
---
&gt;3 resto shamans
---
&gt;3 mages
---
&gt;3 locks
---
&gt;1 hunter
---
&gt;2 resto druids
---
On Culture: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren’t tolerated. You don’t need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can’t keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit.
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel https://discord.gg/vmC5sMb
---
Or just roll on an 8-sided dice for all 7 classes. If you roll 1, switch faction and roll again.
---
Ez.
---
Even resto spec you're more of a support jack of all trades class than a devoted healer for the main tank in a raid.
---
Holy moly. That resistance gear brings some good memories. I actually liked the tinkering with getting that gear. Travel to weird places and do quests all over. I think I had some good fire Res gear. Probably since we raided MC for ages.
---
Wait what? The invis cloak?
---
Master of Pain. Was a gnome rogue with music in BGs. Wasn’t just a crit video. Dude pulled off this great flag drop and repickup that was awesome. Also that video got me into 3 Inches of Blood.

---
&gt;99,99% of this community didn't even know what spell batching was prior  to it being mentioned by a blue post and videos popping up about it.
---
i disagree. im pretty sure a vast majority of people who are oldschool wow fans know about spell batching. its base knowledge for everyone who has so much as dabbled in pvp. 
---
i know i might sound like someone who is crying "hurr durr we were here first" but regardless im pretty sure most of the people who wanted classic for years before the classic blizzcon announcement are part of the nochanges group.
---
bold statement i know, however back when blizzard said they wont do vanilla servers but maybe something like prestige servers everyone said something along the lines of "we dont want an improved vanilla version or something like a vanilla version. we want vanilla." wich is exactly the stance the nochanges crowd has.
---
why is it important who came first you might ask. well, your statement paints the situation as if everyone wants an improved classic version and after certain blueposts a group of loonies comes by and demands the game is made worse for everyone.
---
&gt;is there anyone who think's its positive for the classic experience, please explain why
---
you already said it in your post. you understand spellbatching is important for combat and the playstyle of alot of classes. and its also true that a delay on looting, npc/ object interaction is worse in every way. i wont speak for everyone who wants classic to be nochanges, but personally i dont trust blizzard to make a decision on what nuances should be changed and what shouldnt.
---
its not like nochanges people dont know its dumb to reintruduce artificial barriers that dont hold any merit. its just that i dont trust blizzard to see what is and isnt important in keeping. its possible to tell them every little thing. but that takes alot of time, money and effort. and blizzard was barely agreeing on making classic a thing. therefore its best to just say:
---
was it in classic? if yes then we want that if no then we dont.
---
There are many facets to why wow arena isnt a spectator friendly esport. Burden of knowledge is a heavy one, and thats just for the spectator not the player. Other ones being spells and effects without great visual clarity, having no clue about timings, interrupts, dispels, healing. These things arent clear and it make it impossible for even wow players to follow whats going on.
---
Sons of flame won’t spawn. They don’t spawn on private servers and they won’t spawn in Classic with weaker Ragnaros.
---
Imagine gatekeeping hype because you're too old.
---
Stop
---
You are also providing WF for the PoD fury warriors and rogues. Purge and shocks can be devastating when used properly.
---
It did not.  1-60 was still very important, because there was no quick way past 60.  There were things to do in Azeroth still.
---
You will absolutely be outleveling Mining and Herbalism. If you really want to have 300 of either by the time your 60, and really want to slow your leveling speed as a result, wait until you get your mount @ 40 to go back to low level zones to level them up, eventually it'll catch up to what you need to pick/mine in 40+ zones. Obviously this will take a lot of time out of leveling itself so /shrug.
---
Best leveling professions are Skinning+LW, or Skinning+Tailoring, regardless of your class. At least on a fresh server/launch.
---
Or Skinning+Mining/Herbalism and going back to starter zones @ lvl 40+ with your mount.
---
Thanks! That’s good to know. I figured most spots would be easier with two (especially with the infinite rage or Lifetap loop we should be able to get going via the combo), but it’s nice to hear that the increased efficiency actually pays off for Tyr’s hand.
---
Not saying they are bad at all, they can be a force to be reckoned with. Just that I prefer rogue at that level range 😋
---
I plan an reading every guide and following the fixed bis list for my hunter. I will listens to people that tell me what buttons to press and how to play my character in the most optimized way and not waste time wandering around somewhere. And of course I will skip most quests to grind mobs
---
Tremor totem I guess. Not identical tho
---
To be fair, I do a lot of stuff that is a massive waste of time. 
---
Hell, I swam north out of orgrimmar just to see if you could get to azshara at like level 15 (you can't, the bank is too steep by far all the way to the waterfall, and then on the opposite side, there is only really one exit to ashenvale, and it's guarded by spiders, so you would have trouble getting up on the ashenvale bank and then running to the bridge). 
---
I will say, if you are actively looking for excuses to visit deadmines as horde, they exist.
---
 - Smites is better than anything in WC for warriors.
---
- Cruel barb is better than wingblade and you can get 2.
---
- The blackened defias chest is a lot better than you will get in wailing caverns for leathr wearers.
---
-  the wand is better
---
- and for priests, the overshirt is the earliest blue chest you can get. 
---
Now, is it optimal to run to deadmines as horde? I don't know. At all. 
---
I will say, it's not that far. You can get to booty bay from ratchet and I believe you can swim to grom'gol base camp to get the flight point, and then swim right to the coastline near deadmines, where no one ever actually goes to.
---
If your plan is to run a dungeon from 18-23? It might be better to run deadmines half a dozen times than to mess around with wailing caverns. I have yet to see anything even close to a 30 minute clear of WC, and a lot of the ideal loot from WC is on the last boss, so if you are dungeon grinding, you probably don't even get to roll on that (as the escort takes a long time).
---
Yep, me too
---
Gentleman! This is democracy manifest!
---
If you put in that much effort before ganking someone in World PvP.... I'm very impressed.
---
This literally only applies to guild runs. In PUG's your point is completely irrelevant.
---
oh? what is the 31 point resto talent? swiftmend?
---
**UBRS**
---
One evening after some PVP with my High Warlord Warrior buddy - Mudshovel - I wanted to do a quick UBRS run for a shot at the trinket ( I was in like 3 or 4 piece Transcendence, and Will of Arlokk, so I was decently geared). We waited like 1 or 2 BGs looking for an off tank and another healer, but couldn't find anyone, and we already had like 5 or 6 dps willing to go, so we just filled in the rest with DPS and ran it. Probably the fastest UBRS run I've ever done as Mudshovel tanked trash and all the bosses (except for Drak and Rend) with his High Warlord 2 Hander and I solo healed the group. Drak was interesting, I think we had 2 hunters for kiting adds while we burned him down or something. Definitely one of the highlights of my time playing Wow.
---
jerking off makes ur auto attack hit harder, confirmed
---
I agree for the 1v1 toolkit but in group fights a pod warrior or rog twink with WF is monstrous.
---
You must actually be narcissistic, mate, if you think anyone is convinced that you didnt mean to insult the person you responded to by calling them a crybaby. 
---
Insane mental gymnastics you're going through to convince yourself of what, exactly? That you're immune to criticism but free to dole it out? 
---
The only person who cannot see the foundation for my argument against your behavior is you.
---
Back when he did deal shadow damage he beat my warrior's ass. That shit was broken.
---
Combat Rogues are great sustained DPS, but not for burst which is what PvP Rogues want.
---
With Combat, most of your damage is coming from 'white" damage and this is boosted with Slice N Dice. Remember that when you get SnD rank 2 you have to keep it up 100% of the time to get decent damage so you can't afford to be waiting Combo Points on other things.
---
If you pop all your CD's (Adrenaline Rush, Blade Fury, Evasion), you can do really decent damage while mitigating a lot of damage. 
---
You'll thrive in Duo or group settings where you can afford to spend some Combo Points on Stun Locking. It's still a lot of fun to play Combat Rogue in PvP, but don't expect to be 2-3 shotting people like you see in PvP videos.
---
Okay that’s like saying Eastern Kingdoms is content in BFA... but its not. It has maybe 1-20 people at a time. Once people level it’s useless, and that’s bad game design.
---
&gt; Being able to play a mediocre game you don’t like isn’t really worth the 15€.
---
Tell that to people playing clash of clans and candy crush :( the fact that it is fun to most people doesn't mean it is a below mediocre game with shallow replay ability.
---
At this point I can't tell if I want a class that's challenging and complex but I risk sucking and hating it, or a class that simpler and "op", but I risk getting bored and hating it.
---
Especially as a Warlock. Emergency Fears in Tyr's Hand have a tendency to get you killed very quickly. Mages have a way easier time thanks to the reliability of Polymorph. Warrior would probably be able to just faceroll through the elites with dedicated healer support.
---
You've been reading a different reddit than me mate.
---
PUGs aren't doing things to make it "better for everybody" they're doing it to better their characters. And every character is significantly better with their own key. Funnel keys to whoever you want in guild runs, but I can't imagine anyone that doesn't already have a key would want to join a run where a key is reserved.
---
Should be around the AQ gear range
---
No, but that's what this user is blaming it on!
---
If our Prot Warr, or our Mage, opened the door, I don't really give a fuck. Either way we're getting in. Who has the key makes literally no difference to me. Assuming we're talking about a random PUG formed from Trade Chat ofc. In a guild run, I imagine Tanks/Officers to be the first to get keys, but that's between them and their guild and not my business.
---
HAHA GOOD COMEBACK MY GENTLESIR, YOU HAVE JUST WON THE INTURWEBZ
---
The top end damage is proportionally super high on whatever his MH mace was compared to 60 I think.
---
Improved drain soul is much less valuable. It would only proc on the beta if Drain soul it self got the killing blow. Which with dots running wouldn’t happen very often.  Might want to reposition those points.
---
I politely disagree. Having others chime in briefly to say they agree adds weight to the initial post. I'd much rather this than someone post a separate comment saying something identical. And this commenter did add their experience of druids tanking while leveling.
---
But what if you roll Druid. Did you even think of that? Imagine having to play a Druid because the die is an ass hole.
---
Smash my way thru leveling. I'll make sure to pick up my professions and keep those current.
---
I've redone the classic instances in retail wow so many times for nostalgia, I likely won't run them unless it's for a break from leveling/to do with friends/for cool quests.
---
I've seen a bunch of comments in various threads that boil down to "no matter what, **NO FLYING MOUNTS.**" I stopped playing retail a long time ago. Could someone explain the hate for flying mounts?
---
So do you think they should only fix Paladins, or every class / spec with issues?
---
No he cant.
---
A+ meme. Well done.
---
Have you ever tried levelling full affliction? Once you get dark pact you can drain tank with an imp and it's glorious
---
That's the red version, this is the black version. 
---
Since my contribution was down voted when I was right. Ima take it down and make the gold off it my self \o/
---
I also my class would be better with a 5% buff.
---
How do I make a blood elf
---
You’ll probably get hate here for this, I’d suggest posting this over at r/classicwowplus
---
I like your ideas though!!
---
Botched meme
---
Uhhhhhggg. The salty hunter tears taste soooo salty.
---
your right, I put in the wrong values D:
---
I did some Time Trials in my time on beta
---
1-6 are was EZ 25-30 min
---
6-10 was like 1-2 hrs
---
warriors just need to l2p
---
Judging from the amount negative responses I'd have to say you're completely right. No one gives a shit about the community as a whole XD the convo went straight towards greediness and accusations of elitism. Oh well. At least this helped me burn some time between posting and launch day.
---
Patch3.mpq + .org &gt; stv Zep is how I would get there. Me being an alliance priest was always fun to MC randoms off of it and just dropping them to GM island. I could imagined they were shitting their pants. Get fucked horde &gt;:)
---
That was the model edit way to do it.
---
As a mage who loves aoe grinding, who’s leveled up two mages on private servers by aoe grinding...this video actually makes me more excited for classic. I had forgotten how hard the world was. This is so awesome.
---
TSM has not been confirmed last I knew.
---
Yo dude, Its really not that complicated imo! My advice is follow the fastest leveling guide possible (if speed is what u want) and supplement with the odd dungeon run here and there, making sure to pick up every single quest for said dungeon. Learn to tank along the way in dungeons (you'l get instant groups so seriously not much downtime.) (obviously tanking can be stressful cos ez to blame bum warrior, i know i avoided it like the plague for 10 years, but yeah you may as well learn in the lowbie dungeons where it easier)
---
By the time shit gets real in 20-30s you'll be a level or 2 behind in said guide,
---
Also have a geez at hamstring kiting, it looks a pain in the ass, but I found it the exact opposite, adds just a tiny bit to keep you stimulated which is better to keep you going/not burn out imo.
---
Also, obviously F.A/cooking is important, cooking can also be a good exp grind (keep u behind in the guide), there are some weak as piss mobs that level a shitload of cooking that are fanastic to grind on! 2 birds 1 stone. 
---
Enjoy, it is nowhere near as bad as people make out.
---
Well worth it at 60, fury OP and tanking fun.
---
Water. Minimal greasy food.
---
In what world would you need to level an alt for farming? Druids are great farmers, can even aoe pull as well as do stealth runs.

\*\*\&amp;lt;Willingly Suboptimal\&amp;gt; NA - Alliance - RP-PvE\*\* 
---
\*\*INTRODUCTION:\*\*
---
Willingly Suboptimal is a freshly founded guild that is preparing for official Classic launch. Our goal is to enjoy Classic and everything it has to offer, especially committed when it comes to dedicated raiding. We're focused on achieving our ambitious goals, and looking for more. We will be rolling on an RP realm for its higher sense of community and atmosphere. 
---
\*\*RECRUITMENT:\*\* 
---
We are recruiting all dedicated and focused raiders of any class for our hardcore main raid team, those who want to push content at a fast and consistent pace.
---
We currently actively searching for a few more players of the following classes/specs.
---
\- Holy Paladin
---
\- Fury Warrior
---
\- Hunter
---
\- Restoration Druid
---
\- Rogue
---
\- Mage
---
We would also consider any applicant of any class. Our main roster has only a few open spots left. The leadership contains individuals who have had a long and successful resume when it comes to true hardcore raiding on both Retail, and Classic private servers.
---
We are also recruiting for two more casual minded raid teams, one weekend team, and one late night team.  These teams are much more laid back in relation to our main team, and contain friends, family, and the alts of us no-lifers. We're RP friendly, but RP is not a requirement. However, we will have some casually organized RP. Our guild is not just about raiding, and we are also looking for casuals, friends, and family who wish to integrate themselves into our community. 
---
\*\*EXPECTATIONS:\*\* 
---
As per our guild name, we do not worry about being completely 100% optimal. We are open to any class, and any spec. We believe it is the player that truly matters. Currently, our raiding rosters have room for any dedicated player of any class. We expect main team raiders to put in the required effort during progress. We expect to use our raid time as efficiently as possible, by also preparing outside of raid as well. We will be using a thorough and transparent \*\*Loot Council\*\*.
---
Main raid goals go from hitting the ground running into Stage One of progress, clear content at a fast pace, and end with killing Kel’thusad at least 30 times. We are in it for the long haul, with full expectations to continue into either past-Naxx content or the Burning Crusade, whichever Blizzard provides. We intend to have the casual raids begin in January, and clear content at a relaxed pace.
---
\*\*RAID TIMES:\*\* 
---
Main Raid Team - Tuesday/Thursday/Friday/Monday 8pmEST - 11pmEST
---
To start by the latest September 24th
---
Casual Weekend Raid Team - Saturday/Sunday 8pmEST - 11pmEST
---
To start on January 4th
---
Casual Late Night Raid Team - Tuesday/Friday 12amEST - 3amEST
---
To start on January 3rd

---
\*\*Discord Server:\*\* uHbVxpA
---
In our Discord is where everything is currently located, from our guild app, our roster, to all of our prep work. We do not use a website, instead we make extensive use of Google Drive, with various spreadsheets, docs, forms, and slides. We look forward to hearing from any interested individual.
---
I guess the macro interface has always been just fine for me.
---
a fury warrior could do less damage thank the tank, i dont see your point
---
You can expect some negative receptions over there, though.
---
I think druids definitely need some love as well but I don't know the class well enough to comment.
---
As a paladin though, shammies can go die in a fire.
---
It killed world pvp.
---
I downloaded it and played Beta with no issues on Mac OS (no boot camp or anything).
---
I would say most of the people that play it get lazy, thus their bad rep.

 NA Horde &lt;Brutality&gt; PVP Server Hardcore Raiding Guild Seeking Members
---
Hey everyone, We are currently of putting together a guild community (on a Horde PVP server) so that come launch time we will have a good solid number of people to group up with, run dungeons very soon, raid with. **We will be a Raiding focused guild** with a welcoming home for PVPers. **We are at over 50+ members and growing by at least 1 member a day.**
---
As the GM (im 33 years old, Wife and kids) *I have extensive experience in end game vanilla content (9/15 Naxx before BC) as well as years and years of expansion raid experience, Raid Leading Experience, and Guild Management.* Our goal is to build a community of people seeking **fun times**, **phat loots**, and **raid dungeon clears**. We will be building the guild from the ground up\*, Guild tabard, exact raid times (Tues, Thurs and Weekends), raid leaders, officers and class leaders will be things we will all be able to decide on together\*.
---
**I am looking for dedicated and willing to learn people. Experience is not required**. If you have never been in classic, thats ok, I'll teach you. *I will do anything in my power to make you as successful at raiding as i possibly can, I only ask that you meet me halfway.*
---
\*\*\*I will not require anyone to play a certain class or spec, if you want to play an enhancement shaman or a feral druid, the by god lets make you the best fucking enhancement shaman or feral druid on the server.\*\*\***I want to go to the top boys! Will you come with me?**
---
Feel free to msg me on Bnet or Discord or directly on here if this is something that interests you and we can go from there!

Mage is objectively better, especially in terms of your comp.
---
HOWEVER, 
---
Warlock is 100x more fun and cool IMO. And it's not like WL is straight up nonviable in your comp, will be barely any difference between it and a Mage.
---
So basically, let him decide whichever speaks more to him. Because it honestly 100% doesn't matter.
---
You be surprised with the burst of gouge/blind into popping CDs to open like a better hemo. Hemo isn’t about burst either, CB evis is basically it.
---
I guess im a pedant enough to say that Jaime had his hand and was one of the best fighters known in this clip.
---
Also that 2h paly is unviable garbage, but we arent sure yet if ironfoe is going to be or not.
---
If you’re pushing for top-3 of your server/faction, then no, engineering is spectacular, and it makes a lot of fights like Nefarian and the big slime in AQ40 trivial. 
---
If you’re not, then it’s definitely overkill.
---
This is not a 5% buff but thanks for playing.
---
rebind turn left/right to strafe left/right
---
Basically, allowing players to travel on the Z axis means you never see anybody else and the world ends up feeling very dead.
---
It also almost completely destroys world pvp. At the very least it alters it in a very negative way. Everyone gets a 3 second cast that makes them invulnerable for as long as they stay in the air.
---
Didn't know it existed, but will do!
---
&gt;  Classes were in flux for all of vanilla and could also be changed. 
---
But they won't be.
---
Dude are you ok
---
That's no different from retail. You should get the faster loot addon.
---
Edit: I looked it up and while it was cool. It seems like pure pwnage speaks a different dialect. Maybe it’s more broad or suburbs slang or dialect? Compared to the letterkenny ppl that is more rural?
---
And there I went, trusting things I read on the internet again! :)
---
For general use, yes. But Buffed at least was never the best or most up to date, citing noxxic for DPS rankings (Remember, Noxxic = Toxic) despite lots of their calculations being made up, wrong or both.
---
So don't count on them always being 100% correct in the nitty-gritty, but their generic articles are, at times, wonderfully written. They've got some eloquent people on there, which can work for them or against them (they sometimes wrote guides and man, pages upon pages of Hydross the Unstable guide writing made it seem 120x more complex than it was.)
---
If it's a true Classic experience... go make dinner while I wait for the server to have an open spot for me. ;)
---
You're a troll, dude. I never said anything about your name, just the fact that I can realize a post is yours before I even look to see who posted it.
---
We get it, you want attention.
---
The focus on weapon progression is definitely a good thing to keep in mind!
---
It's common sense to anyone paying attention to their design philosophy, they removed those sets and replaced them, unlike the mounts which still existed, correct? The 60 set literally replaced the old one as the blue pvp set, there is no reason they would the 58 set and exclude the one they settled on several patches before the final iteration of the game.
---
You can have doubts that when rank 14 gear is released in phase 2 and pvp is open world that for some reason they released the 58 set next to the almost naxx level set, that makes zero sense to me and goes against their goals of KISS (keep it simple, stupid).
---
Find a different guild then/
---
So much misinformation out there about a lot of these 'meme' specs.  Prot paladins in particular.
---
Shaman, for the simple reason that I wanna go Alliance this time. Always been a Horde player, I think it's time to switch up things a little :D
---
[Naga Trinity](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Naga-Trinity-Optical-Interchangeable/dp/B0788MCRGC/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=naga+mouse&amp;qid=1563216109&amp;s=gateway&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;sr=8-3) is pretty solid.
---
IIRC one of Vael or Rag (for early Rag kills) you use prety much full fire resist gear, but usually you're mixing it in.
---
A lie will remain a lie...
---
pve yikes go play bfa
---
Mothballs would only appear if someone placed them there to kills moths.
---
You're thinking of spider eggs. :D
---
Can try to look at it when I get nome from work, but no promises.
---
What do you mean. 5mans can be farmed endlessly. There's no reason why you should not be able to get all the blue preraid gear before you step into MC.
---
Didn't Rag and Vael require fire resist gear for the whole raid? At least for your first few kills?
---
No changes
---
I started with a NE hunter back in vanilla.  Good times :)
---
Are you talking about the one with the Night Elf how has insane dodge chance?
---
I really doubt average Joe mage would AoE farm his way to 60, or even much at all.
---
I have to second this, the starting zone for night elves is pretty amazing!
---
RIP Tywin, he died on the shitter to a crossbow from his son. Still didn’t die as terribly as season 8 SMH..
---
Ive played retail and private on my Mac without any issues or need to download Wine or anything of the sort. 
---
Classic starts fine, just no servers yet.
---
We will see.

I'm leveling a war not to get to 20ish to just try tanking cause I've never done it (well, I did it via RDF during WOTLK and it was by far my least favorite tanking class, never touched it again once it hit 80) and its been a brutal ride.  I could do it once but don't know that I could get all the way to 44+ just to do it again.  
---
I would consider doing warrior first for the same reason you're mentioning but my biggest concern would be paying for the job at 60 and all the repair bills and stuff.  As a more casual player at only 2-3 hours a day 5ish days a week, I feel like that'll be tough, but at the same time makes all those shouts for a tank more enticing, as I'll be able to log in and go basically, lol.
---
This is only a taste of complaining that is going to come on release. Luckily this time there is a choice to play BFA instead of them ruining the game
---
That's not a given.
---
It's 25% increased change multiplicative. They didn't get flat value until Burning Crusade where it was changed to flat 15% increase
---
Sounds like Paladin probably has better synergy.
---
Undead warlocks everywhere
---
Yep
---
To expand on your analogy, we're talking about a company that started us out with 0% chocolate, gave us 2% which was widely agreed to be a good thing, but led us all the way down the slippery slope to 98%, where each step had too much financial incentive and too little public resistance to ever be seen as a bad thing by the company doing all this. That same company is starting some of us over at 0%, surely with some financial incentive. Do you really trust them to take us to 2% again, and just stop there?  
---
I agree to a certain extent with the point you're making. There are things I would like to see updated or introduced or removed for Classic, but as much as I want those things, I don't trust Blizzard/Activision to do it in a way that I approve of. So the only thing I am really comfortable with is a perfect recreation.
---
Sadly a big difference on pservers. Also, voidwalkers on pservers do almost double the damage they did on beta. Making it much harder for your VW to hold aggro. Some people found that face drain tanking with a dps pet like improved imp or suc to be better as threat as very hard even with the improv VW talent.
---
It's best to pace yourself, 16 hours a day is enough.
---
In Flames would definitely be somewhere in there.
---
Also of note is that the nodes will be far less plentiful than private server players are used to.
---
Vs mages you must remember 3 things.
---
Save fear for the first frost nova.
---
Save intercept for blink. (No exceptions.)
---
Save trinket for the second frost nova.
---
Back off and get out of combat during ice block.
---
They can of course cold snap and still kill you, but if as a frost mage you consistently need cold snap to beat warriors, you probably aren't a great mage.
---
...except it is? Reworking and rebalancing classes wouldn’t be classic, it would be wow classic 2.0
---
this idea destroys pvp giving paladins an extra 250+ spell power in the later stages, from what I know burst is also the last thing you want to be a class wide passive because reckoning is already the burst spec but gains from this, possibly more than the other specs.
---
Fire resist helps quite a bit on Ony for smaller groups, at least if you don't use that one glitch spot on the wall that allows ranged and healers to stay out of the fire...
---
&gt;At that point you’re talking about a completely different game.
---
(Which you can play right now)
---
Wow! That's shocking. Well, Classic should be interesting...
---
I'm starting to get the feeling that they might stay relatively broken after launch but Blizz will fix and buff the shit out of them in a later update.
---
I'm probably wrong, but I can hope and dream for my hunter brethren.
---
Depends how skilled in NOT standing in Fire / Lava / Shadow Nova / Ooze the DPS is.
---
Very Skilled = no resist gear, just don't stand in shit
---
Not Skilled = resist gear but be prepared to get to like 20% on Rag and needing the DPS to drop resist gear and get better at not standing in shit to finish off that last 20%
---
Haha, I was there 10+ years ago, man. My first char was a NE hunter and I had no fricken clue what I was doing but for some reason the memory of noob frustration is super endearing to me :)
---
Oh no! Things have weaknesses! That means its completely unplayable!  
---
What is this? A pokemon thread on r/gaming?
---
I'm not sure how much resist gear this actually equates to after consumables (Greater Fire Resist Potion, etc) and if you're Horde, Shaman Resist totems can both up add like 150+ resistance in a hurry
---
Mage if you want good dps
---
Taking time to level professions in line with your level will always slow the process down.
---
It comes down to what your goals are. If you want 300 Herb / Alch at 60 then plan what you need to get there. You may slow down leveling because you need 20 more Silverleaf. 
---
If your goal is simply to make money, then be prepared to vendor almost everything, or farm 1-300 "Power Level Kits" and sell those over trade after you're 60 and the economy in your server has matured or stock up on items that are used across numerous professions and once the economy matures dump everything into AH.
---
That’s not what you’re talking about. Classic is a recreation of vanilla, which means any changes that would’ve been made have already been made.
---
You want changes and balancing in addition to what was done, which is not recreating vanilla. It’s a new game.
---
Saved for later.
---
&gt; i disagree. im pretty sure a vast majority of people who are oldschool wow fans know about spell batching. its base knowledge for everyone who has so much as dabbled in pvp. 
---
Rank 11 grind on two characters.  Cleared Naxx.  Never really heard any big discussions about "spell batching" just that anything where you gouged/sheep at the same time it was just bad luck and server lag.
---
It's a dumb experience and it just creates frustration.  It's the same shit in FPS games and why they always have "favor the shooter" for lag compensation.
---
Then Blizzard better shutdown the servers located in New York and move everything back to Texas for AuThEnTiCiTy. Believe it or not, people want to play to have fun.
---
It was like that in vanilla, so it should stay like that in my honest opinion.
---
Soundtrack to your escape was one of my favorite albums back in the day
---
Yes this guy isn't the most skilled but the leeway is still an issue guys. A very skilled AoE farming speed leveling mage recently set a new record of 2days 17hrs on a fresh launch. He complains about leeway a ton and says AoE farming is almost unviable on Classic Beta. You can't argue he is unskilled at it. So get past the point that this guy isn't the best player and look at the range mobs are hitting from, the delay to apply blizzard slow, etc
---
As he said, you pick it up for other reasons, but with an equipment manager it is actually very easy to switch to what you need. It is a thing in duels as well if you really wanna tryhard.
---
This is a bad change for shamans. Honestly i considered rolling one but at this point it’s just not worth it. Day 1 everyone will make macros to stomp totems, and if you don’t then you’re not fighting a shaman properly .
---
it's true, there's nothing stopping a group of people from carrying a bunch of dead weight and giving away all their upgrades to those people.
---
most groups charge tho, a lot.
---
That is what vanilla means to you. Vanilla to others and to blizzard may or may not match your opinion. There is a loud contingent of players who say no changes but blizzard at some point will have to answer to the influx.
---
System of a down. And more system of a down probably?
---
Pretty sure it was a joke.
---
I seem to remember pets dying a lot on Ragnaros. Hard to get them behind a rock from melee range...
---
Thank you for the ideas :)
---
&gt;The server processes the information every 400ms, that's absolutely true, but the client receives the information instantly, and the according animations/sounds begin to play realtime. That's why it feels fairly smooth, not like some shit game with 400ms ping.
---
If the server waits 400ms to answer a spell cast request, for the player it's the same as if he was playing with 400ms as in both case he has to wait 400ms to get an aswer from the server.
---
This is dumb logic that is hurting this game. Remember , this isn’t vanilla and layering will make sure of that. Other quality of life things exist and this should b one for sure.
---
Been a long time since I did Ony and I cant remember whether I wore resist gear or not. I suspect not, I did have it because I remember farming for it, maybe just for MC tho? But iirc you ARE going to get feared through the lava that comes up through the floor?
---
Warrior defensive stance quest is also down in the gorge. But maybe not for tauren.
---
You raise a great point, that I've experienced myself that led me to post what I did, in that Hunter and Druid are deceptively easy to play good.
---
It's only when you encounter a really, really great Hunter or Feral Druid who blow DPS up do you realize you've been playing with absolute shit Hunters and Druids.
---
Exactly haha. There were several bosses throughout all of the Raids where a Pet was just obliterated or became a complication more than a compliment.
---
Soil - Breaking Me Down
---
This song single handedly made me a soil fanboy for a good bit, and their top 10 or so songs would belong on this list imo.
---
It's glorious
---
Then go on and boycot Classic because there's Autoloot that definitely wasn't in the game. And if Leeway was implemented to combat natural lag from back in the day it doesnt make sense for it to exist.
---
I wonder how much spell power would be required for Ret to switch from a 2-hander to a 1-hander and a shield. Because whatever that amount is is too much.
---
Sure, that seems reasonable. I'd say by in large, most players were not that, though. You seem to be speaking of the exception, not the rule.
---
I think this addon does the same thing and it is compatible with Classic: https://willitclassic.com/view/yPn1M4VbKVBbahourERv
---
Pserver are weird when it comes to CC and how it breaks. Their are CCs that break all the time like Mind Control and then their are certain mobs that break reliable CC kinda often like the Death Knights at the Gothic fight in Naxx or the Anubisath adds at KelThuzad breaking shakles almost every 10sec. Snairs like frostnova and entangle are usual very consistant
---
If you have good social skills you can probably get away with a suboptimal build, join with a normal build and make some friends before you respec, that's what normal people would do.
---
Ultimately, it’s a bad idea to play a class to try for “an easy raid spot”. We really don’t know how many people will play, and on what servers. You can take some educated guesses, sure. Like, there is never a shortage of rogues wanting to get into a good raid. It’s possible the best guild on your server could use 1 more mage. If anything maybe consider hunter, since the most dedicated players seem really down on them right now. Don’t put much weight in the polls. Play what you want to the best of your ability will give you the best chance at achieving your goals.
---
Hmmm, this seems to contradict most of what people have been saying on here which is that its additive. Just did a google and most people are saying 30% but there doesn't seem to be a perfectly clear answer. I would be interested to know for sure!
---
Is there a word for people like us?
---
I just respeced at 43 and got Heart of the Wild. It seems to be worth it. I used to have INT and AGI gear sets. Taking HotW my AGI set had as much mana as my INT set. So now I might change my INT set to +healing set. Make my heals more potent now that I have more mana.
---
The 1.13 API that's coming with Classic actually offers a ton of flexibility around OG Blizzard frames. 
---
Honestly I love tweaking things but was surprised, pleasantly, about how much flexibility we get out of the box on the Blizzard UI for Classic.
---
Still may need a focus / assist add-on, but that's a different point entirely.
---
I don’t understand how this is confusing. Blizzard is already showing they are working on classic with vanilla as the template, even if it means reintroducing things people are labeling as bugs or unbalanced.
---
This is not a matter of opinion. I’m not presenting my subjective opinion of the game as right and saying your subjective opinion is wrong.
---
I’m saying that whatever vanilla was, objectively, is what classic should be. An exact 1:1 comparison as much as possible. 
---
What you are asking for is a completely different project. Even folks asking for changes or wondering what comes after classic, most people think it will just be TBC.
---
Until we hear something directly from blizzard this classic + stuff is a pipe dream. Regardless, it’s not what’s coming now. What’s coming now is classic, which is a recreation of vanilla as identical as possible.
---
Why are you lying?
---
 I'm not an animal.
---
The important thing is to complete quests before they go beyond +5 and you start losing experience for trivial quest completion.
---
I did things like moving to Barrens and doing all of the level 10-11 quests, then moving to Silverpine doing all the quests from 10-13 then back to Barrens and kept this up through all of the zones.
---
After the rough patch at the start I think I was able to stay 3-4 levels above the quests which made for easy sailing. This does make some of the elite quests doable on your own if you're careful and have the right class. It's very helpful to stay ahead because of how available quests begin to thin out once you get to around 50+.
---
I like most of this post, but tbh this is kinda true. Other raid content will be on farm for guilds pretty early and casuals like me will be able to be carried through MC and ZG and whatnot. But from what I remember Naxx wasn't as easy to farm and I never saw it back in the day despite having mostly epic gear (low epic gear though). None of my close friends ever did it. Most of the people you see in the world dont' have Naxx epics. 
---
However on the private server i'm on it seems people have much better gear so maybe thigns have changed and Naxx isn't seen as daunting as it once was, but I fully expect to not see Naxx and I wouldn't tell people they should expect to see it unless they are in a raid guild and are actively trying to raid often

Oh god oh fuck he has AirPods in he can’t hear us
---
I was making a joke about "You think you do but you don't," but I guess it didn't come off like that. I wasn't actually implying that you wanted spell batching.
---
Hurting the game, and yet it’s making classic function as vanilla did, which has been the goal all along. Sounds more like helping to me

Okay hunters can have the key but warriors get dal rends k?
---
Follow me on Instagram for more pictures during the build :D
---
Lul you won't get any hate. Or invites :)
---
It’s not a change, it’s how it was in vanilla.
---
The people who just chalk it up to luck or server lag are the bad players who settle rather than get better and better.
---
I believe you can actually segregate add-ons per character by editing your profiles in the WTF file. 
---
Haven't tested this on Classic, but in private servers I've been able to get this working a long with other add-on management add-ons that allow me to load a specific profile for a specific character. BarTender / Fubar in this case.
---
If you are body pulling, side strafing is the best pre nova option as you are literally guiding each mob into your kill zone. Normally pre-mount you’d wand pull one side and body pull another. The safest approach is to aoe pull to a previously cleared area so you can anticipate all angles beforehand.
---
Well 90%+ of all pornhub is sister banging, I dont get the kink but I guess the people have spoken
---
Either way , we should move to make it so totems must be manually selected. By your logic we should be able to not re order characters at login.
---
You’re equating equipment capabilities with the game design. Surely you can see the difference in that.
---
I will have a Warlock alt somewhere on the list.
---
Warrior or rogue for main - druid resto for alt
---
New "vanilla" flavored content would be really cool and an entirely new timeline would be very interesting, but I just can't see it happening at all. 
---
From a business perspective it just doesn't make sense. We still don't know what the population and demand will be like a few months to a year into classic relaunch. It'll definitely be huge in the beginning but plenty of people still prefer retail WoW and new expansions / content is enticing to a lot of people. 
---
Some of my friends have already lost a lot of interest after the initial hype and started playing the EQ 20th anniversary servers and have no intention of leaving anytime soon. Other friends still play on private servers and prefer TBC (or even pserver version of vanilla) and plan on playing classic only supplementally to the pservers.
---
Then you also have to consider the cost of essentially remaking ~15 years of content versus simply modernizing existing content. With classic came the backport (or forwardport?) of the newer client and engine. This laid the groundwork for any future modernization efforts and the cost required to get TBC/Wotlk/etc up and running is now substantially lower. I would assume this also lowers the cost of creating new vanilla content as devs/designers could use their modern toolbase but only proportionally-so compared to the former method of releasing old expansions, so it's still cheaper and faster to modernize than remake.
---
OSRS essentially does it and it's been a massive success for them but you also have EQ that doesn't, they just re-release content through progression servers on a rolling schedule, and that works well for them. There's precedence for both sides but with how Blizzard has been managed the past ~5-10 years and their seeming desire to satisfy investors and produce increasing profits over giving players what they want, I just personally don't expect anything more than simple progression servers in the style of EQ.
---
They've made some strides with the classic launch and have been listening to feedback a lot lately, and even BFA is having a renaissance of sorts, albeit at the end of the expansion cycle, but will the trend continue?
---
PvP is an overlooked element I see people miss when discussing who gets loot. Ya a lot of warriors in your raid will be Fury or Prot, but when they aren't raiding they probably switch to Arms and do Battlegrounds. And gear from PvP is not only a huge grind, but not that great unless you PvP so much you probably neglect your raiding duties (and even then is outpaced by the best raiding gear). So how do you handle a system where your raiders need to get both their best PvE \*and\* PvP gear from the same place?
---
Paladin leveling can be quite entertaining when you Respec at level 32 for reckoning. Inc RECK bombs!
---
Warriors aren't nearly as bad at leveling as most people think. They do poorly against high level monsters, but are actually among the top contenders against lower level monsters with an up-to-date weapon.
---
If you [clear thoroughly](https://www.vanilla-questing.me/), there's plenty of quests to do from start to finish.
---
Seal of Command is still based on weapon damage but modified by spell damage with an assumed co-efficient of 29ish percent. You would have a long way to go to get a 1h weapon + shield hitting as hard as a 2h since that 100 spell you get from 2000 armor becomes 29 damage to a soc proc. 
---
A Grand Marshall's 1h sword has a top end damage of 207 vs the 2h version top end of 353. The 1h soc proc +100 spell damage from a shield would be 174 (before attack power) and the 2h would be 247 (also before attack power). 
---
To get the same tier of 1h soc proc hitting as hard as its 2h counterpart proc you would need to add 209 raw holy damage to the proc... or around 730 spell power. to get all of that from a shield would mean it has 14,600 armor.
---
One actually changed the gameplay experience, one doesn’t. That’s a horrible comparison and you know it. 
---
However it was in vanilla is how it should be.
---
Then he’s stationary and easy to dead zone. Once he moves CC gets applied and it’s a non-factor.
---
Pick up HotW and you can do whatever you want.
---
I completely agree with this, and I hope that the community embraces this viewpoint. If we make it very clear to them, Blizzard would certainly be able to implement content while maintaining the continuity of the world and its mechanics. 
---
There is no reason to have to increase the level cap and essentially kill 90% of the world just to introduce more content and lore. The burning legion and the scourge already exist in vanilla, you don't have to resort to entire expansions to expand on that lore, and that's not to mention all of the unimplemented areas already in classic that you listed. 
---
I would not play a TBC server singularly because of the max level increase. Even with all the content added in TBC, it would be a *smaller* world than classic+ due to all the existing content made entirely irrelevant. New raid and instance progression can be balanced simply with gear, why increase max level?
---
in a future patch.... because changes are inevitable.
---
They won't.
---
Most nights when I go to bed Im thinking about Druid vs Hunter, with the occasional Rogue thrown in the mix.
---
I still can't decide which class to play first... 
---
Warrior is eventually a must but there's going to be so many of them.
---
Shaman for all the cool options but the mana issues might be too much.
---
And I want to play Hunter for the same reason you like mage... to drop area snares/roots at choke points in AV. Leeway might ruin the fun. &gt;&lt;
---
If you can't handle ff14's leveling, good luck with classic.
---
...except they’re not. They could easily roll into TBC and let us replay that without adding or changing anything with classic.
---
found Payo
---
Yea i figured but the «lol» put me off
---
One point I haven't seen mentioned all that much: WATER.
---
While Warlock summon is super helpful getting those 2 in the instance quickly, Mage water makes everyone's lives a lot easier. 
---
Plus portals make for great alternatives to getting the whole group out of a dungeon to a city easy and obvious and keep group comp together and tight for getting ready to run another / different dungeon quick.
---
* Do you want TBC: Classic released? Would you want the current Vanilla "Classic" to remain separate?  
---
**Yes and Yes.**
---
* Would you be interested in content based on existing Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdom zones (Hyjal, Caverns of Time, etc)? Would  you be interested in new content that doesn't raise the level cap  and/or doesn't increase stats on gear, therefore just being new content  for the sake of having new zones/dungeons/quests to explore with minimal  stat advancement?   
---
(I combined them cause I see them as the variants of the same question) **Yes** I'd be for it so long as **doesn't increase stats on gear** (only flavor and / or sidegrades)
---
*  Would you want *new* content released, splitting away from TBC, essentially making an "alternate" WoW timeline/expansion series?   
---
**No**. I don't see any realistic way for maintaining 3 separate versions of WoW. Caveat: If WoW Retail was to end its run and have some kind of WoW Reborn, I'd prefer it to be based around the original design principles.
---
*  Please share your own ideas, but feel free to use the above ideas as starting points of discussion.  
---
I sometimes think that my ideal mmorpg would be a frankenmonster made up of cobbled together parts of
---
   * Vanilla (all)
---
   * Burning Crusade (all)
---
   * WotLK with ToC patch and 10/25 raidsize surgically removed and linear progression restored (no more patch to patch content obsolescence)
---
   * Cata with old world revamp surgically removed as well everything after the Firelands patch. 
---
   * Gear re-tuned such that the previous "expansion" raids give gear of comparable power to next expansion max-level dungeons (ie flatten the power curve down **considerably**)
---
   * Previous expansion raids having their max player limit going down as you hit some level breakpoints (think MC going 15man at 70, 10man at 80, 5man at 85)
---
   * No flying in any pre-BC zones.
---
   * No LFR/LFD.
---
   * (not entirely serious, but an interesting thought experiment for me)
---
U do it
---
You mean like... Decursive, or maybe Healbot, which will not be allowed in Classic ? But totem stomp still in anyway ?
---
That kind of #nochange Vanilla ?
---
What am I looking at here? PC case? Looks pretty sweet my man.
---
True unless you Get a crit and Apply deep wounds, idk imo i just rely on demoshout tbh
---
Personally, if they don't add content beyond Naxx I will most likely leave a few months after phase 6.  Vanilla was about constant progression and Classic is obviously emulating it with the phases.  I don't think many will hang around a $15/month sub game once no more content is planed for it.  If it became cheaper or ftp, sure I see it hanging around like d2 or wc3 has.
---
Ideally, they would go the OSRS route.  Add vanilla intended content that was planned before Blizzard changed gears to do expansions.  What I see happening is TBC legacy server next.  It's super easy for blizzard to implement (Outland is still the same in retail) and I bet it would be very popular as many players joined during that time.  But TBC introduced many issues I have with modern MMOs so if this were the case I don't plan to stick around and play.
---
Ah yeah sorry - US. There were several servers that were down for a good amount of time but it wasn’t bad as a while.
---
I too hope classic goes smooth - so hyped.
---
Lmao you hypocrite.
---
Soke spoiled people might understand “do an undead priest” differently
---
I... forgot about this comment.
---
I'm back to work 21st of August...
---
Yeah I'm gonna make an undead priest on WoW and do an undead priest as well. This is 2019 bro
---
Hypocrite? Please even attempt to explain how the two are similar. Go on, I’ll wait.
---
Too add to my other reply my hardcore raiding days in wow were the first year or so of wotl. While I really enjoyed to content the classes felt overbalanced and sterile.  Every dps spec with comparable gear did about the same dps.  A ret pally, dps dk, and rogue were all just as durable despite the pally and dk wearing plate.  Whereas in vanilla you can absolutely tell the difference in durability when your shaman starts wearing mail or uses a shield.  The wonky balancing in vanilla is part of the charm and you don't have to be super minmaxxed to have a good experience.
---
Because a lot of us played most of our vanilla experience with 400ish pings so it just seemed like more lag.
---
Superman by Goldfinger
---
Exactly. One is unavoidable, one isn’t.
---
Its like the first week of Vanilla and I'm somewhere around level 18 or 19 on a Tauren Druid and someone asks me if I want to "tank WC". I have NO IDEA what that means. WC or Tank. I ask and he says just go bear form and take hits for us and its in that place Wailing Caverns you probably have a quest for. 
---
So I tank a full run of WC with zero dungeon/tanking experience. It went fine. I think the group was all beta-players who knew their shit so they really made up for the slack of me not knowing anything.
---
This is gold, Jerry, gold!
---
Well, one unusual run I had was a constant occurrence because of the guild I was in.  I was in a small casual guild of family and friends and our dungeon group consisted of:
---
Me = Dwarf Holy Priest
---
A husband and wife Night Elf Prot Warrior combo
---
A balance druid
---
And a Holy Paladin
---
Dungeons runs were slow but the husband/wife tank combo would have everything locked down as far as mob control, Holy Paladin would buff/auto attack and drop a consecrate, and the balance Druid would do what balance druids do....pew pew.
---
It was in no way optimal but it was fun because we were all friends and had a good time playing together, plus we all pugged raids together too.
---
Some D2 Player right here lol
---
Ber Mal Ber Ist, Bro

---
Typically no resist gear, unless you're tanking. 
---
While you will get feared into lava pits, correct grouping and efficient raid healing should get you through this. Could an extra 100 points in FR gear help? Certainly. But if it's at the expense of Str / Agi / Int or (God forbid) Stam you're going to be so much squishier and less effective damage dealer. 
---
I don't remember, even progressing, Onyxia to be about surviving per se. It was more so about actually killing her and being able to survive while doing it, then just purely surviving- like Twin Emps. 
---
Twin Emps you need resist gear because there is just so much AoE damage hitting everyone, all the time.
---
The 45 run always was great fun, especially with oddball combinations.
---
A little confusing but I understood a couple
---
Leeway shouldnt work on slowed targets but... no changes!
---
Just gimme WotLK "classic" with the C&amp;C remake, the AoE2 definitive edition and I'll be a happy man.
---
The classic client shares most of its code with the BfA client and as such, it will be released on Mac at the same time as the Windows version.
---
I’ve played the stress test client several times on my own personal Mac and hackintosh tower and it runs great. No FPS degradation compared to playing it with Windows on the same machine.
---
It's simple, ignore them and *LET THE ELEMENTS GUIDE YOU*
---
Yep, can't poly or Nova them since they just shift out of them. Stealth and open on us, then shift into bear and charge/stun us, then shift and either wrath or heal/hot to outlast our damage... :(
---
How is it hurting the game if its how it worked in the version that people said they wanted?
---
Yes, this!
---
Hakurai's guide already does this. It's pretty easy to outlevel it if you herb aggressively, and then you are already doing a current guide and working on zones 2 levels too low. 
---
I will say... it's a guide for a dead server. As in, everything there is soloable, and that's the worst way to play a warrior on a fresh server. (because there aren't a ton of people leveling as classic gets close to release).
---
For warriors, a lot of their problems go away when you add a second player, even a warrior. 
---
- Too many mobs packed close together? 2 warriors solve that. 
---
- Can't interrupt casters at low levels? 2 charges solves that. 
---
- Have trouble tanking enough mobs to make cleave and rend work well? 2 warriors can stand next to each other.  Rend doesn't let you dump enough rage? rend the other guy's mob as well as your own. 
---
- Battle shout/demo shout is expensive? halve the cost per player. 
---
But also, do you need to complete hard quests to get relevant gear?   An extra friend helps this a lot. 
---
Frankly, if you are soloing as a warrior on a fresh server, you are doing it vastly wrong. 
---
Even if you want to quest instead of dungeon grind (and the early math on dungeon grinding is incredibly popular, and probably is the ONLY math on dungeon grinding now the beta is down), you will still make more money and almost certainly more exp/hour if you have a leveling partner. And this includes the warrior/warrior and warrior/rogue groups. 
---
I will say, voice is incredibly important, because a bad leveling partner  will make leveling a warrior atrocious. The worst is warlocks. Warlocks can fuck you up so fast. You pull 4 mobs. The warlock send his voidwalker in and taunts what you intended to leash and then dots them up.
---
Congrats, you now are the proud owner of a pull you only intended to borrow for a short time to take one mob.
---
For rag? Dude, new talents, 1.12 gear stats, fire pots...
---
Because you have &lt; 30 ping on an actual stable connection with no packet loss.
---
No, you can zone them out of WSG though with the exit portal
---
Not to mention some private servers ban multiboxing.
---
I picked up a G600 last time it was on sale
---
A little weaker in terms of speed and detection range, but enough to get the job done.
---
Your point rings true.  The reason it hasn't been a problem on private servers I assume is that the masses of people who want to continue to do vanilla probably migrate to new server "seasons" and do it all over again.  Either TBC or fresh no-transfer seasons I think are needed.  Sure, some people are fine with infinite alt rolling on the same servers but the mass majority will be bored.
---
I imagine meme raids will be the new hardcore mode to flex epeen with.
---
40 man dodge rogue raid, all Paladin raid clear, all Druid raids were already completed
---
Careful with googling "19 twink" at work.
---
I've never played a druid.  Can you elaborate a bit on this?
---
&gt; You must actually be narcissistic, mate, if you think anyone is convinced that you didnt mean to insult the person you responded to by calling them a crybaby.
---
I don't think much of anyone besides us is reading this far deep.
---
&gt; Insane mental gymnastics you're going through to convince yourself of what, exactly? That you're immune to criticism but free to dole it out?
---
The juxtaposition of the parent's rude "dunk" attempt on me that came out of nowhere with cowardly downvoting struck me as hypocritical. "That's rich" is an expression that indicates dissatisfaction with hypocrisy. So I think you're wildly exaggerating by suggesting I'm engaging in any kind of "insane" mental gymnastics, because my stance has been pretty consistent. I took offense, and responded in kind.
---
And people are of course free to dole out any kind of criticism they want, but aren't I also free to respond to it?
---
Tell you what, let's chalk this up to a misunderstanding and move on.
---
Pretty much the only items that are up for grabs even by resto shamans/healers are PvP only items in most guilds like Eye of Sulfuras, Spinal Reaper, Ashkandi, Crown of Destruction if no hunter wants it for PvE.
---
Items that are an upgrade for a fury warrior say Onslaught Girlde will never be rolled for by a holy paladin.
---
An Ashkandi used in 99% of the cases for PvP? The holy paladin has as much right to spend his DKP on it for retribution PvP as a fury has for his arms PvP spec. 
---
I could only see an exception if the raid is running a dedicated guild premade PvP group and the Ashkandi would go to the premade's arms warrior.
---
The fact that Ragnaros has 2000 less armor is a far bigger issue than parry and crit. Melee damage is going to be completely out of control.
---
Some people argue that Feral isn't even viable *with* Manual Crowd Pummeler.
---
For real, if you want to be a feral druid in Classic you're better off rolling either warrior or rogue.
---
You'll be playing a warrior I take it? :)
---
Looting has had a delay since the game came out and it still does today. Only on private servers are transactions instantaneous.
---
I remember finding Ressan the Needler, the rare bat in Tiristfall Glades, on my first Warlock. I knew if I ever made a hunter, that had to be my pet. So, eventually, I made a troll hunter and camped his spawn for hours.
---
What I remember most was being out in Stonetalon on a PvP server, around level 20. I'd hide and use Eyes of the Beast to pull extra mobs into unsuspecting Alliance players, then despawn Ressan due to distance. They'd aggro on to the player and wipe him. After a couple days, my white bat was kill-on-sight for Alliance players.
---
Only deep sub rogues get the better stealth detection.  They both can pick up reduced detection, and outdoors, cats can pick up 30% move.
---
Yeah I guess I am just strictly remembering it from the first few months of Vanilla when we first killed Rag
---
There are nets on pservers.
---
Marksmanship/Survival builds were king for raiding, so the pet DPS was less important. Honestly, pets died pretty fast on most bosses, and mend pet was a channeled effect, meaning it wasn't worth the mana/dps loss. Keeping a pet alive, on passive, and with furious howl activated would give the whole group a pretty decent damage buff every 10-15s.
---
Normal combat spec has neither imp eviscerate nor cb
---
Lmao BWL AQ40 and Naxx are not hard..Hard is coordinating 40 people. A geared ret paly will pull his DPS.
---
I thought Vanish applied like a 3sec buff that essentially made you unable to be unstealthed.
---
As soon as you start releasing new content for classic, we've lost the very thing that we've been asking for.  That means they'll have to keep releasing new fresh servers without the new content, or people are just  going to go back to private servers.  Classic should be preserved, with "fresh" servers launched from time to time in order to keep new communities going.
---
Another point is that Naxx was already the point at which gear was reaching a level of power creep; it really started to be difficult to hang in BGs against folks in T3.  You start getting gear more powerful than that and non-raiders / early tier raiders can't compete anymore.
---
It makes sense to round out the intial "wow trilogy" with TBC and eventually Wrath; there are likely playerbases that could support all of them, and there will always be people that want to go back and play these games again even well after they are launched.  They could give us the option to move characters up, or not, but regardless of what they do with future expansions they should keep classic available.

&gt; how effective would seal/judgement of wisdom be 
---
Questionably.
---
First SoW rank is available at 38. For argument we'll grant the 5/5 Benediction talent.
---
* Seal of Wisdom Rank 1 = 135\*.85 = 115 mana
---
* Judgement of Wisdom is 'a chance to restore 50 mana'
---
* Seal of Righteousness Rank 5 = 120\*.85 = 102 mana
---
* Judgement = 6% base mana
---
Excluding the judgement cost(couldn't find a hard number at 38) you are looking at needing two procs of JoW to per judgement to not quite break even. Say you have a 2.5 weapon speed for simplicity and you are hoping for a 50% proc rate to still be netting a loss if you are using judgement on CD(I do not have the proc rate available but 50% seems unreasonably high). Not blowing seals/judgements on CD is where things enter questionably, but I'd wager its still unlikely to net positive personal mana like that.
---
Mana management for Prot comes mostly down to the Five Second Rule( [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview#spirit](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview#spirit) ). **At Level 60**(values differ per level), every 5 seconds after your last cast you'll get \[Spirit/5 + 15\] mana regen per 2 seconds. With zero +Spirit gear you'll have a free \~47 MP5 if you haven't cast in the last 5 seconds. Knowing your best threat generation without casting is key. Always run with Ret Aura up, understand BoSanc will often provide less threat than BoW, and always mark your primary target for the group. If you are maintaining top threat, don't dump mana to generate excess threat. 
---
When you do cast, plan ahead and coalesce your spells. Need to cast consecrate on a pull? -That's the perfect time to also refresh your seal if it is low. Going into a boss fight? -Judgement of Crusader -&gt; Seal of Righteousness -&gt; Smoke a cigarette; you are done pressing buttons that fight unless something goes wrong or your seal needs a refresh.
---
New expansions, or TBC or WOTLK servers, should not be done because the population would be too divided. Classic+ should exist, but maybe on separate servers from the pure vanilla servers, and released at a different time.
---
You are not alone man! I've spent a month going through the classes myself.
---
I went from Rogue &gt; Mage &gt; Warrior &gt; Rogue
---
Now I've settled on Rogue, my first choice back then. 
---
I made several posts questioning about the Class differences and roles, until I finally made up my mind.
---
But in the end, it was worth it! Cause I would be very upset if I had chosen a Class that I wouldnt like and eventually reroll to another one. It would feel like a waste of time.
---
Its better to spend some time now doing your research, talking to people and choosing the class than later, when the game actually drops.
---
I’m pretty sure priest any level beats hunter even if hunter gets first shot.
---
Make sure you play it with Winamp or Sonique with a cool skin.
---

Oh sure, but saying that everyone is a shill as well as saying that the overall game is in a bad state is a classic overreaction.
---
Why relevel engineering when you can just click on "soothsaying for dummies" in tanaris?
---
Unless you are somehow going to be tanking that target from range after you taunt it, you'll need the 110% threat because you'll be in melee range.
---
I wonder how many people in the classic community would rather see Leeway &amp; Spell Batching removed.
---
I would love class balancing to be implemented to allow us new ways to enjoy the vanilla content. I.E. changes to classes that arrived with TBC to some extent. I want to be able to taunt with druid and pally tanks. I want to rez with druid out of combat. I want all the "meme" specs to be balanced and made to where I can raid or pvp viably with whatever I want and not be behind the pack. 
---
New content would be cool if it was just ideas that were originally planned but finally getting fleshed out. But by no means is it necessary.
---
I would love TBC to be released with the option to free transfer to the servers. It was a great expansion, but I think it should not be forced on people who want to stay in Classic.
---
No way! I convinced myself a feral was a good option today! Because another option is exactly what I need.
---
&gt; because the only quest that takes place down there is Fizzle (unless you're a warrior)
---
I thought it was common knowledge they fixed this by 1.12 which is what classic will be.
---
do less dps
---
I’ve already warned my girlfriend. Beards on beards for that week
---
Yeah I think I realize now hes just telling it like it is. At first I thought he was ranting/complaining
---
It sure is :D Printed on a Prusa i3 mk3

You and your friends ran outta beer the other daaaaaaaaaaaaay...
---
Thank you man! :D
---
Good PvP pet memories? None really. Having to deal with constant pet deaths was annoying. I played a lot of AV and the pet just got in the way most of the time. Started leaving it on passive unless I got into a 1v1 situation.
---
they don't bind at all. Mostly gained from fishing. They were a lot easier to get in TBC as you could buy them from a vendor inside one of the caverns of time dungeons
---
Ahhh yes, the response is always 
---
&gt;That has been discussed plenty on the subreddit.
---
and yet... I still havent seen any suggestions better than what we are getting with layering.
---
The fact that you think mobas have a harder learning curve completely invalidates anything else u say. Obviously ur not arguing in good faith and ima exit this ridiculousness.
---
The reason they're looked on as the worst healer is because hots don't stack so you can't bring many of them and keep them effective. But if there's 1 resto druid in the raid they are more than capable of putting out top tier HPS, especially with regrowth spec. You can do well with healing touch spam too but it requires a bit of proactive casting.
---
Shamans can be either Tauren, Troll, or Orc. All have some use in pvp (orc and tauren having better pvp racials imo). Troll is the only one that gives an actual HPS increase with berserking racial
---
Well that’s not a fair comparison now is it. Those games are free and pretty much build from the ground up to make people addicted. Especially casual users. 
---
Either way I don’t see how that is relevant. The wow player base clearly doesn’t want to play a mediocre wow for 15€ just look at the subscription statistics...
---
But on the flip side, Warlock's main issue in PvE is shadowbolt threat so if you don't care about PvP then Alliance will actually be better for you because of Paladin's threat reduction.
---
...that's not what I was saying at all.
---
It's awesome from what I've seen of it so far, but it is alliance specific (done on a human) with no apparent plans for similar horde guide.  I haven't seen anything else like it though!  I wish more guides were like this one and incorporated the profs and stuff and less about full on speed runs.
---
Meme builds DO get raid slots. Their just not for the main raid, usually. You'll get into the 2nd MC run a week. 
---
Despite that you'll still have to pass up on the best gear if someone want's their alt to be a bench sitter for the main raid. Which will happen.
---
If you have a reason for not going dwarf then I think it's fine.
---
yes super dumb change. nobody really used it back in classic, because information wasnt as widspread at that time. became more of a thing once arena was out, and yea your right, it got changed super fast, because it was way too strong.
---
Why should they change the game from what it was in Vanilla because the community changed? "Back then the macro was less wide spread" so they should change it?
---
By that logic, why don't they change the mechanics of raid bosses because everyone has guides and better add-ons now?
---
You what was also uncommon back in Vanilla? Trinkets like Skull of Impending Doom and Nifty Stopwatch, that's why Swifty's video was so influential and ground-breaking because those "neat tricks" weren't used often. However, now those trinkets are on every "top 10 things you should do on classic launch" video. Should Blizzard change those trinkets because more people are going to use them this time around?
---
Classic is going to be very different from Vanilla because of the massive amount of information, data mining, communication (discord/reddit), min/maxing, better hardware, better server infrastructure (leeway/ping/ret-paladin can't sit-proc), etc etc etc. The devs shouldn't change things based on the community's new knowledge. (subverting expectation based on community knowledge killed GoT, if a bit un-related)
---
one step forward, and 10 steps backward with the targeting totem macro change. shamans are fucked
---
&gt; If you only care about nostalgia, which seems to be the case
---
Yes, of course, you got me, the only reason anyone would ever play vanilla is "muh nostalgia"
---
it's not a good game, it;s not a good RPG, it's not a good MMO, nope, people only play it because "nostalgia"
---
Back to /r/wow with you.
---
thanks for putting this up! unfortunately, I'm unable to view the talent build (maybe put a link to classic wowhead talent calc?). For those of us going dwarf, do you by chance have a similar list of progression guns?  
---
The one thing here I really appreciate is having the list of which pets to take to learn new abilities. That's something I've been working on putting together, but this makes it much cleaner. Speaking of pets, when you're out questing on your own with your owl, do you have growl, screech, and claw all on auto, or just growl/screech?
---
&gt;NO U
---
very compelling argument
---
It would somewhat alleviate the problem, but not by much.
---
A prot farming a DPS set and spamming Nightfall or even better a Nightfall spamming hunter would blow a retri straight out of the water.
---
The problem remains that the retri would still siphon gear from actual useful classes, so you would have to counterbalance the loss in raid DPS by assigning key pieces like Onslaught to a retri and not to a fury warrior.
---
just get ahead on your real life in the lead up to the death of it
---
Because its cool, a playstyle that fits me, I don't like mage or hunter, and don't have the time to farm enough gold to respec as much as I would want to as a healing class.
---
Plus, Voidwalker doesn't need to be amazing to still be really good. I also like all the other pets too.
---
Cool. It should be how it was in vanilla, and it was in vanilla.
---
Layering is a temporary solution that is necessary, then it’s being removed.
---
Batching is being designed to function as it did in vanilla.
---
They have higher agility so more crit = more rage = more threat.  Tanks will use daggers until very late game (thunderfury / naxx) so the human weapon skill won't be taken into effect.  It is marginal but definitely worth mentioning.  Also the dodge helps for tanking.  Not sure why people down voting probably just clueless human riders.
---
There's a big difference between retarded scrub and best any class NA. One comes to raid preped with buffs and consumables, and the other doesn't.
---
The mail is ours! It steals it from us!
---
No worries, I just picked one up! 15 bucks.
---
If you want to create the same experience, yes. You ain’t gouging many mage blinks on retail m8
---
If they fixed this, but this was working in wotlk for sure, did that million times
---
=D I hope you have a great time until classic releases if you are horde and if you're alliance have a nice rest of the year good sir.
---
They were removed with the Wrath pre-patch because Shamans had to deal with S1-4 of Arena where Hunters, Warlocks, etc. could press 1 button and negate all their Totems (this was also why Totems were at one point given health as a % of the Shaman--to try and stop totem stomping).
---
Playing a Shaman in PvP pre-that change meant you essentially were half a Class in PvP as a ton of the power of Shamans (see: Tremor, Grounding, Poison/Disease Cleansing, Resistances, etc.) were tied to Totems that could be destroyed with the press of 1 button without the user needing to actually target the Totem whereas all other healers had spells that weren't counterable.

Didn't training or mats or something have an equivalent cost to mounts for the other classes? Never played lock, but heard that the lock mount still has a heavy cost associated with it.
---
That went from 0-60 reeeal quick
---
My ideal scenario would be:
---
1. Classic Servers until content ends
---
2. Classic Servers get replaced by TBC (as it was back then)
---
3. TBC Servers get replaced by WotLK (as it was back then)
---
4. all 3 Servers become live at the same time, reset to the beginning and always stay and reset
---
At this point I would implement a feature where you can move your character from the previous version to the newer one (not backwards). This way everyone can loop these 3 Addons as they wish (f.e. Level 60 Classic Character moves towards TBC, level 70 TBC moves towards Wotlk - the end.
---
And hopefully many people come back to WoW for these 3 different states of the game, so that Blizzard comes back to better choices for the new Addons.
---
I am against new Classic Content on the regular Classic Servers. If that should happen I'd suggest "Event-Servers" or whatever you want to call them, where you can "upload" a copy of your Classic characters. This way you can introduce new Abilities, Items, Raids/Dungeons and even increase Level-Cap if necessary without interfering with actual Classic.
---
This part will drift away for a bit, hope you guys don't mind. My favorite Addon (considering all from Wotlk to BfA) was Legion. Legion felt like there is much to do, a lot to earn and my god .. I LOVE Legendaries. I'll quickly summarize a like &amp; dislike list of what I'd love to have in a new Addon:
---
**New Addon**
---
\-A good chunk of Legendaries (as in Legion, but with a better solution than simple RNG)
---
\-&gt;imo You should at least be able to wear 2-3 Legendaries but drop them in an order you prefer
---
\-Tons of Dungeons &amp; Mega Dungeons (maybe even Mini-Raids)
---
\-Mythic Raid also being able to be a 10 man, reducing GS of the items as it's harder to coordinate 20 people than 10.   
---
 Slight decrease of difficulty to 20 man aswell maybe to really justify the difference. This will appeal the smaller groups   
---
 that got demolished by static 20man mythic.
---
\- less Dayly/Worldquesting BUT harder &amp;  longer tasks instead. I really dread this hit &amp; run worldquesting
---
\- Artifact Weapon Progression, this was literally the best mechanic I have seen for constant progression in any game+
---
\-&gt; BUT PLEASE don't make multiple Specs more difficult again - I PREFER if everyone can play every Spec of his/her Class, don't make us twink with 8 characters if we can literally play 1 character in 2-4 ways!
---
\- Nerf M+ Item Levels/remove Warforging
---
\-&gt; I get it. There are many people that enjoy Warforging. I don't. I think it's one of the worst features ever. Even worse   
---
 when you can Warforge sockets. (Why not give sockets to the underappreciated jewelry profession again?) Dropping Mythic Raid Gear by Warforging is simply wrong, because you DID NOT CLEAR MYTHIC. I don't want to get Gladiator PvP Equipment when I can't even beat a Rogue in non-ranked PvP, too. I have to earn it. Mythic is not Heroic. Some Mythic Bosses aren't even relateable to other Mythic Bosses, while they still are harder than any Heroic Boss. That's a good thing, loot should mirror this.
---
\- Default Difficulty has to be increased again a la Classic
---
\-&gt; a friend played on private servers to see how things are going to start off on Classic launch, just imagine how surprised he was that his warrior basically got stuck on a level 10 quest, because he simply couldn't deal with 2 mobs, but couldn't pull them one by one - of course he was warned because warrior ranks lowest in most Leveling Guides, but even with his Mage he had a harder time than expected. Food after every pull? Man, he was oom after half of some pulls. This has been tricky, this has been WoW. Leveling back then was close to Raiding now. That's what we need. This gives your class identity, this teaches even the trash of us how to play our classes properly.
---
I think I could continue for a bit. But these are so far the most important things that came to my mind.
---
Generic redditor replies are disgusting
---
&gt; When people were freaking out about how chat had a right click ignore I began to get worried that the #nochanges hive mind might hamstring the game.
---
They don't care about right click ignore.  They care about right click report.  And actually, it's not even the reporting functionality that they care about-- it's the auto-squelch feature they don't like.  If a dozen or so people report you within a time window, you automatically get squelched until a GM can review the claims against you, which can take hours or days.
---
Even if the GM finds the claims to be baseless, you still would've been squelched for a long time for no reason at all other than some players didn't like that you said something controversial (but within the terms of use, such as "I like Donald Trump" or "I think Hillary would've been better than Donald Trump) in Barrens general chat.
---
That's not even getting into the ways that this feature could be used to target specific players and put them at a disadvantage.  Even in a concerted effort like that, what do I care if the offenders get punished?  _I still would've been unjustly squelched for hours or days until a GM reviewed the case._
---
Doesn't really affect me much since I juggle multiple mobs with fear and drain tanking.
---
Well, no.  First off, Classic EK was removed in Cataclysm.
---
However, even if it wasn't, there is no reason to go back to EK after hitting level 60 in BFA.  There were plenty of reasons in TBC, such as:
---
* Leveling professions required you to go through Classic content
---
* Kara, ZA, and CoT were in Classic zones
---
* There was still a lot of PvP that took place in Azeroth that you couldn't escape by flying
---
* Leveling 1-60 in TBC took longer than 1-120 in BFA.
---
In BFA, everyone is in a different phase and you can turn PvP off entirely, and professions start in BFA content if you wish.  So it is a completely different situation for EK in BFA than it was in TBC.
---
That can't be good for your mental health.
---
Shaman are in a really good spot even if you dont count Grounding totem being massively buffed compared to vanilla (though I'd expect them to eventually fix it). Even with totem stamping. And if they do remove it when people complain they'll just be in even more amazing.
---
I wouldn't worry about shaman's viability in PvP at all.
---
They wanted an authentic game.  Warts and all.
---
You basically have three spells for healing,  chain heal is really the only one to write home about though, would most likely be a resto shaman's job to drop their totems and start spamming chain heals to keep the raid alive.  The 2 single target heals are alright but will be outclassed by priests.
---
For an authentic experience?  Yes.
---
It's just a matter of where people put their priorities. You go the the gym for 2 hours, if you used that time to play games, you've all of a sudden increased your playtime significantly. Obviously that's most likely a bad choice, but it's the truth.
---
I've got a wife, full time office job, and puppy (Which obviously is way less time commitment than kids), and I stream 15-20 hours a week, go out on the weekends and do a podcast. I don't go to the gym often, I tend to get exercise (Though not enough), on weekends taking the dog out or random activities. It's just a trade off for what you enjoy or matters most to you.

Wish you would have thrown in a random stealth icon along with the NE female face.
---
Seal of Righteousness is per hit whereas Seal of Command is 7 procs per minute. Using the above examples the total dps before crits and attack power for soc procs for the 2h weapon is about 29 dps. 
---
The GM 1h sword has a swing time of 2.9, which is a bit slow for a 1h weapon. SoR doesnt base on weapon damage though so lets say you are instead using something like Warblade of the Hakkari, which has a 1.7 swing timer. That is 35 swings per minute.
---
SoR's math is a bit more complicated than SoC's math because it will  be doing between 21 and 72 damage based on weapon speed before spell power. Also with a 2h weapon it gets about 12% of your spell power added to each proc, while with a 1h it gets about 10% of your spell power added to each. 
---
I am going to assume that you get the best proc from SoR with this fast weapon you will be seeing the base proc around 22ish, for about 13 dps. SoR cannot crit. Adding 10% of your spell damage (2000 armor shield = 100 spell damage = 10 more damage per hit) gives you a per-hit of 32... or about 19 dps. 
---
To make SoR procs match SoC procs in dps (before crits, because SoC can crit while SoR cannot) in this model would require a shield of about 3500 armor. There is a shield in vanilla with 3495 armor so it is not impossible to do this... But that shield drops from Sapphiron.
---
But again... SoR will never crit while SoC will crit at the same rate as your melee crit percent.
---
Yeah that's how they were on my vanilla lock. Could hold aggro for a bit but mobs would often peel away towards the end.
---
yeah i agree but thats to much work for me D:
---
It would be a huge amount. 5% of each casters spell damage added onto his dps would be huge. It's like the fireball ignite in Naxx, with all mages funneling their dps into 1 big ignition proc for 1 mage. Everyone knows it's a team effort and not 1 big epeen mage out dosing everyone by a mile.
---
I'm not saying Ret Prio, to gear the Ret paladin first. I'm saying they're viable in a raid.
---
Heroic leap! But that would be op

Thanks - I don't know why the image doesn't show. On my Chrome Browser it shows, but as soon as I use an incognito window or another browser it doesn't. I've attached a link in "Talent-Build" - when you click it it redirects to classicdb.
---
I'll work on gun progression when I integrate other factions and races - probably tomorrow.
---
When I'm questing I'll have every ability except maybe Dive on auto-cast, since Owls only have Claw as focus-dump, it should be fine with having it on auto besides Growl and Screech.
---
Probably will macro Dive into Hunter's Mark + /petattack for quicker engages.
---
But he sounds like he's only played on private servers.  So one could argue that he's never really played the game either.
---
BM pets are super strong and do a lot of damage so they hold aggro really well. A tiger/nightstalker does 1 attack each second with the pet attack speed talents. I don't think growl cost any energy aswell.
---
I leveld a warlock in retail TBC and remember that I thought they didn't hold aggro very well. Problem I had was that "consume shadows" was on auto and the pet's mana was low all the time. Felt quite stupid when my friend noticed that my VW had full health a few seconds after every mob.
---
Crusader strike for paladin. It would do wonders to break up the monotony.

Thanks for sharing!!
---
A friend and I levelled up a shadow priest and warlock together. We made a point out of 2-manning every instance. We beat SM Cath at like 37 I think, which is without a doubt one of my highlights from playing WoW. Involved switching between succubus and voidwalker constantly and a LOT of voidwalker dying and us frantically kiting around while I tried to get enough space to get him back up. We ultimately beat all of SM, RFK, and RFD, all at about the right level. Don't recall if we did any others though.
---
I feel like you really missed my point, but I can't entirely tell through your sarcasm. I also interpreted your other comments incorrectly though, I think. Though I can't say I'm pleased with being compared to an r/wow\-er
---
Since you do seem to prefer vanilla over retail, which is good, can I ask why you think classic should stay stagnant? 
---
We have the opportunity here to keep the things that make vanilla better, and expand on content that is pretty much already there just waiting to be implemented. I would rather take that path, unknown as it may be, than follow the exact same road that led the game to where it is now. I want to play a living version of Vanilla, not a stagnant and abandoned version to be followed by the same expansion BS that hurt the game.

A raiding guild PISSES gold. You dont think a raid would shit 800g and give Nightfall to the prot warrior offering to do Nightfall duty?

There is a reason guilds have a gold tax to cover tank consumables and repairs, repair bots etc.

Looking for Raiding Guild
---
Region: NA

Faction: Horde
---
Server Type: PVE only, non-negotiable, sorry :(
---
Times Available: Very flexible on weekdays, prefer no Saturdays. Looking for around 3-6 hours/week total.

Role: Resto Shaman
---
Experience: Healer from Wrath through WoD, mostly Holy Priest with some Disc and Resto Shaman. I would routinely rank as a Holy Priest, especially in MoP.
---
I did also play vanilla WoW, but was in school at the time and couldn't raid. But I have realistic expectations for what raiding will be like in classic. I do know the 5 second rule and downranking and all that already.
---
Looking for something "midcore" and low drama.
---
Thanks!
---
RemindMe! 63 days "he wont have an alt and will either lie about it or not even respond"

There is a 10 man "raid" in UBRS, but it's not on par with the difficulty of Kara, especially the early difficulty, it's like a slightly beefed up 5 man. There's a 20 man in ZG, that is also quite easy and was more of a "catch up" raid.

Lol, yeah. I’m really excited about classic, but I’m equally (if not a little more) excited about the prospect of TBC servers after classic goes through its lifespan.

I was playing melee back in vanilla, so I had to have nature resist :) You are right, of course. If you weren't a soaker, you didn't go for resist. Didn't do the content in 1.12, but before, so we had to try harder at the beginning.

I saw a video of that and the melee are spread around Raggy and they all get hit by his knockback. On private servers the melee gather at one of the tips and move in and out to avoid it. Do you know if this was a tactic eventually used during vanilla or if it was discovered on private servers?
---
Hell if I know. Probably playing Horde because that's where the people drawing me in want to play. Beyond that, it's a big idfk. Druid, maybe, for mobility and survivability. Maybe mage, maybe warlock, maybe priest, maybe rogue. Heck, I dunno.
---
But I am limiting guides. BiS lists and general role and raid guides, sure. But I'm not looking up quests or such. Exploration and discovery seems like a bit of the fun. General rule for guides: If I'll be a detriment to my immediate party by not knowing, I'll try to be in the know.
---
Interesting. Mages are way more popular on alliance due to lack of shaman I guess.
---
Only downside is that you can only track one type of node at a time. Other than that it is perfectly reasonable.
---
I think it all depends on the success of this classic launch. If this explodes numbers, no doubt they will do TBC.
---
The rare slippery slope fallacy being applied to something that exists in game lol
---
It would not be absurd to think that with the new Legion API Macro System this should not be possible, as so many other macros that "make the game too easy" were intentionally made obsolete - it was not a thing initially on the beta - so they likely spend time to ensure this was in.
---
Seems to be quite hypocritical and some silly double-standards from Blizz when they are intentionally targetting other things such as Decursive and Healbot like /u/Nikbis said.
---
I plan to stay awake for 3 days straight (abusing stims), sleep for 6 hours, then sleep 3 hours every night from then until I hit 60. I don't know anyone who plans to do the same. When I'm done, I'll get a really good night's sleep and hit the gym.

Can my Nintendo with Power Glove™ accessory run Classic WoW?
---
Hey let's innervate the most mana efficient thing in all of WoW.
---
Furor is more valuable than Improved MotW. Resto druids will be using it in raids so it only really applies to dungeons and solo where it doesn't have much value.
---
[My currently planned raid spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxxscMdtVxsoc) Tank with offheals. You could take 2 points from thick hide and LotP to get natures swiftness if you'd prefer that.
---
Leveling you should focus on cat
---
[First few points](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZE0M) FB is going to be more helpful than threat or armor while leveling IMO
---
[Get to here and then pick whatever you like, respec at 60](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLV0oZE0MscbdZV)
---
1. Roll night elf Hunter.
---
I have an 8 week old, my worry is finding the time to play lol I hope the game is still thriving in its glory when he starts to sleep for long periods of time at once!
---
Yeah it’s based on character level so higher level mobs and players will have an easier time seeing you. If you’re a night elf you get an increase to stealth and are a lot harder to see.
---
!RemindMe 40 days
---
Look up Dive's draink tanking guide (have been posted here a few days ago max) and the Classic Warlock Discord if you want to spice things up.
---
This post is my thoughts exactly.
---
When you filter some of the straw polls PvP servers have Locks tied with mages on the horde side. Something like 14% of total horde players mage and 14% locks. The Alliance on the other had sees mages still at about 14% of the faction and Locks around 9%.
---
While I've been wanting to play a horde warlock this time around. The possible benefits that would come with 1/3 less competition are VERY alluring. 
---
I'm not afraid of WoTF.

I think this is case by case. With Vanish in particular I'm 99% sure that you just Vanish and don't end up in a Polymorph. You can also Vanish to avoid Death Coil, etc.
---
I’m off to a good start
---
This is exactly what I want to see. People follow top progression guilds in retail, I'd follow top meme guilds in Classic.
---
* Lost in the Mail: Shaman &amp; Hunter only guild
---
* Holy Moly: Paladin &amp; Smite Priest only guild
---
* A Void: Warlock &amp; Shadow Priest only guild
---
* Whack-O-Mage: Holy Paladin &amp; Mage only guild
---
* ... ok, I'll stop now
---
Very interesting. I’m still pumped to do it though. Kara was and still is my absolute favorite PVE experience of all time.
---
Good points throughout
---
&gt; I think key to Classic+ is going to be adding in non-raid content as a valid source of gear. To BIS you must play a variety of content BUT ensure that if somebody wants to raid only there is a minor downgrade available within that content. 
---
I agree with this, but it has to be done correctly. I don't want it to be like BfA where you can just do shitty, low-engagement content and get raid-quality gear every week. Though as long as dailies and weeklies aren't implemented, that is easily avoidable. I would love if they kept designing long, engaging, and challenging questlines with a good reward at the end.
---
to be fair I made these out of lolz, some are pvp related others pve, it's just for fun really
---
Oh it's me.
---
I know that but it’s something you mentioned to new player without explaining it.
---
And my statement comes from the fact that gold buying supported shady organizations and is just cheating. If you were the only person to get 4 mounts because you bought gold, then I see absolutely no reason to be proud...
---
I'm 100% committed to playing a warrior. I don't care if it takes me a year I'm getting to 60
---
TBC Introductions off the top of my head

1. Easier leveling
---
2. Heroics
---
3. Much more powerful class balance, meme specs less meme

4. badge vendors/catch up epics
---
5. flying
---
6. arenas
---
7. paladin/shaman for both horde &amp; alliance
---
8. pvp resilience
---
You should update the title... going to be hard to find in my Drive as "Untitled Document"

LMFAO, nice!
---
One of my favorites is from my own server of Arthas. [World of Roguecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw&amp;t=1707s) It's a bit RP heavy early into the video, but it's pretty crazy seeing the absolute domination rogues could do with the right skill.
---
Personally I want BC and WOTLK legacy servers, and then go into new content in a path completely separate from the cataclysm.
---
Oh shut up
---
Non combat rez for druids
---
Shadowmeld and afk with an aggressive pet.
---
They were all 40 except ZG (20).

Lay freezing traps around corners in horde territory and just let people sit there in them while you laugh in shadowmeld.
---
Hunters mark people that can't dispell when they're out questing.

Is this a real quote? Which movie?

That's a tough choice.  Shadowstep was a lot of fun.

I suppose it changes a bit for pvp. Im going to miss healing rain but i suppose ill survive.

I remember a guy had a YouTube video testing multi boxing after asking blizzard for extra accounts to test. I’ll post it once I get home.
---
All classes see them as vendors though.
---
That's not what a slippery slope is; you're using the term improperly.
---
Furthermore, a 2-second Google search shows that what I said [can and does](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20768676893?page=1) happen.
---
... Aaaand there's the slippery slope.
---
Dual wield for shamans, Im pretty sure that would pull enhancement out of shit tier to average tier
---
The capitalization of the title is odd.
---
Sure, I'll take the next wep that gives me 50+ap
---
Anything from Two Steps From Hell.
---
Very different playstyles. Do you prefer being up close and melee, with the downside of being kite-able, or attacking from a distance keeping people away from you? 
---
Consider the race you'll be for these (if different) and let that help guide your decision. 
---
Personally, I love stealth. I'm going druid because I want to do more than just dps, but HAVE to have stealth.
---
The 70 billion rogues in stv is a legit fear!
---
I think arena should be added but it should work the same way and have equally strong rewards as bgs, i dont mind titles. I also think the arena should be placed in the world where the two faction has there own entrance / queing hub on each side, this should create world pvp.
---
/castsequence Find Herbs, Find Minerals

Press the macro repeatedly while farming.
---
and even then so many of them found themselves unprepared and unworthy to hold the Board.
---
Hunter's are very good at ganking people. If you just attack anyway the same level as you from max range as a bm hunter levelling you've pretty much won.
---
I'd rather not have any AoE, tbh.  FoK just doesn't fit in with the rogue theme and kit.
---

---
Sounds good, I think that's just about the time we'll be finding out who's in it for the long haul.
---
"Or are people's opinions/perceptions of vanilla raid difficult just all over the place and potentially really inaccurate?"
---
You get a lot of bad information on this Reddit page.
---
You already answered your own question though.  Yes, you can carry people in raids but why would the raid want to bring a class that has to be carried ?  It's one thing to have a new mage who doesn't deal damage due to gear but your enhancement shaman will always do no damage regardless of his gear
---
The epic mount costs around 500g, which is still cheaper than for other classes, but absolutely not free. Level 40 mount is free though.
---
Yeah, that's a legit reason the quit the game.
---
Getting squelched for no reason that is, because a group of people decide to troll you because you do or say something they don't like.

Druids are the highest threat/second tank in the game, especially in dungeons. However I think the talent is still more worthwhile than thick hide (while leveling the %armor is not a big deal either). However furor is **mandatory** post 40. Its the only thing you really care about in the resto tree.
---
As someone who spent 10years playing vanilla and tbc only, i can say 2 things. 1. TBC is polished and balanced version of vanilla in every aspect. 2. Its completely different game. The biggest difference and the reason, why i prefer vanilla over tbc is the world. Vanilla is huge, immerse and alive. Meanwhile Outland only has very few places, that are populated(once everyone is 70) - farming spots and daily quest zones. The rest of the world is pretty much dead. The same goes with Azeroth. Only populated city is Shattrath. World PvP and wandering through the world is gone due to flying mounts. Leveling character in tbc is starting to feel like a duty you want to get rid of asap, meanwhile in vanilla its a journey. In conclusion, vanilla is better rpg game and has that open world feel, meanwhile tbc rocks in mechanics and overall gameplay experience
---
I don't hate the idea, I am not to sure your math checks out though. You won't be running UBRS without DPS either. This system essentially says you shouldn't be an UBRS tank if you don't have a key, right? Instead of having 1 out of 10 people expected to have a key, it's 1 out of 2? Sounds like this will just turn into  "WTB UBRS key can summon, have DPS gear -no more tanks."  
---
Getting more completed UBRS keys isn't bad, I would probably pass my roll if anyone was rolling on their last gem -regardless of my or their roles.
---
I'm sure you'd enjoy both! Do you want to be a sneaky jerk, or a bold dark magic jerk? 
---
Maybe level both to 20 and you'll find out what you like.
---
This was my rule for mages back in the day as well. If you intercept and then they blink it’s game over. So you waddle towards them slowly, but if you wanted any chance of victory that’s what you did.
---
Summoning Portal, healthstone, soulstone
---
Yeah exactly. I didn't mean while leveling. I'll make some random enchants for friends while I'm leveling up my skill but I'm definitely not counting on making money off of it
---
You can't trade points in feral for points in resto without making other adjustments, because you need the prereqs. He is 33 feral which means he can spare at most 2 points.
---
leveled to 30 on a lock and had 3/3 imp VW and it sucked for holding threat.  i would pull aggro with 3 dots + wand without fail roughly 1/2 through any normal mob. i actually farmed a bunch of WC elites for the deviate hides quest with a hunter and his pet held aggro easily
---
\*Mind controls enemy player and starts emptying their inventory and deletes all macros and key-bindings. Exits game, sets volume all the way up, and proceeds to open obscure websites in web-browser\*
---
Why? It's true.
---
Why turtle?
---
I agree. Especially if you playing somewhat casually.  Make both characters, place both, and you'll gravitate towards one over the other.
---
Less competition, more dps, and for pvp you can lean on a more burst heavy destruction spec to compensate for WotF.
---
I wanna go horde and play Lock but alliance has a tempting case for me.
---
I'm going to buy even more stuff of Amazon just to piss you off, Commie.
---
I really need to find a guild that raids on the weekends for my alt. I've been tracking guilds in a spreadsheet and there might be some candidates. Here's hoping.
---
...Just FYI, there is no LFD in classic, and chat was never closed in retail.

Or just have the pet be passive and use the bowl for dps increase

Kind of a reverse troll, but for mouth-breather hunters in instances, I always enjoyed tanking the trash into their deadzone... It separated the wheat from the chaff and gave a fun mini-game.

Sounds like warlock to me.

I played resto druid to 60 back in the day, there were quite a few dungeons I'd rather have a hunter pet tanking than the trashy warriors that were available.

**[EU German Raiding] &lt;plaGue&gt; [Alliance]**
---
&lt;plaGue&gt; is a large **german speaking** group of friends that have been playing WoW on and off since Vanilla. With every reentry to WoW we have rebuilt the guild and raidteam, growing our group to a community of skilled raiders always curious of what new stuff WoW has to offer. We have a wide range of people, from old &lt;For the Horde&gt; raiders, all the way to world rank 1000 players.
---
With an experienced Leadership, who has raided in Vanilla up to and including Naxx, our number one goal is to build a community that enjoys spending the evening together, while clearing the raid content in a timely fashion.
---
We are recruiting chill experienced raiders, looking to have a good time. Lacking experience in Vanilla is no problem, as long as you have decent raiding experience in any expansion.
---
Currently our raiding roster is getting close to 40 people, but still has room for any dedicated player of any class. We are aiming at an active raiding roster of 50-60 people, to ensure a smooth experience for all of our raiders.

Feral swiftness is the most important talent to get.
---
&gt; Is it better to build more for the cat form and go for healing in dunegons ?
---
Yes, you should go for cat form but that doesnt mean you cant tank dungeons as bear. Missing Primal Fury or Thick Hide is no big deal. The other cat talents work for bear anyway.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE! :D An Orgrimmar themed build would look sweet :)
---
lol right... opens refrigerator, drinks all but a shot glass portion  of their milk....

---
Is there a way to still report bugs now that Beta has ended?
---
Alliance is the plan! Gnome warlock and Dwarf rogue are pretty certain but I go back and forth what to play almost daily. Gonna do a PVP server though.
---
I would have to raid after 8PM, as I would like to spend time with my kids while they are awake. So 8-11. The wife can get time from me in the morning for 1 minute.
---
Why would you roll a warlock for easy raid spots. You have a much harder time than a mage getting a raid spot after BWL because you do horrid dps. After the second warlock, raid leaders are going to be deciding whether to carry you through a raid or bring the feral who can tank as well as deal horribly shit dps.
---
My vannila experience was 1 lvl 60 pally, 1 lvl 40 orc warlock, and an ungodly number of alt across 20 servers.
---
I played Warlock in vanilla from day 1, and I remember getting frustrated with my VW losing threat often. It has always been like this, you get used to it.

---
  **|About us|**
---
 **&lt;Legion&gt;** Is a Classic Horde Guild focusing on hardcore progression. We are a seasoned group of individuals with a drive to press content and will be rolling on TBD PVP server. We are looking for mature players with the same mindset and interest that we possess, while we do not require that you have played on private servers, we encourage players to get the practice before the content is released.   
---
 **| Raid Schedule|** **Monday/Thursday 6PM - 10PM PST  | Loot Distribution | Loot Council / Loot List**  
---
 **| What we expect |**
---
  **Raid ready -** We are looking for dedicated players interested in clearing content. You will be expected to have full knowledge of the encounter and be prepared to clear the content. You will be expected to bring all consumables and world buffs to raids, as well as being properly enchanted. 
---
**Attendance -** You will be expected to attend 90% of raids in order to be qualified for a Core Raider position within the guild.  Failure to make adequate attendance will result in loss of raider status.
---
 **Active Community -** It is important that you maintain an active presence within the guild, raid logging will not be looked on positively. Actively trolling, hate speach, and other bad behavior will result in instant removal from &lt;Legion&gt;.  
---
**| What you should expect |** Our officer team has been playing together on private servers over multiple successful guilds, such as Engage/Void/Loot Train and many others. We can guarantee that all content will be cleared in a timely manner, and actively create a guild worthy of your time and attention. Officers will be expected to provide extensive knowledge of their class, as well as knowledge of all raid content.

Totems definitely do not cost peanuts. Shaman class call on Nef could easily run you oom, we had a few wipes learning the fight where we had priest call right after a shaman call and it screwed us. 
---
Totems ain’t free

друидская товарищи?

One day..... A troll can dream.... :)
---
And exposed to a different kind of AIDS.  Stay safe buddy.
---
But Shadowmeld only works out of combat.
---
In combat is the wotlk version with 2min cooldown.
---
Fear ward is a must for certain raid encounters but not all healing priests need to be dwarf.
---
As a NE Priest you can really use it for trolling like MC people of the lift in TSN.
---
Good idea! Will work on that, even though much comes down to personal preference and whether you'll often be in PvP scenarios or not.
---
I fucking lvoe how warlock see the other. 
---
Hunt be like : \*has to feed pet so they liek them\*
---
Me, a superior warlock : Summon my voidwalker, send it in suicide mission and sacrifice him right before he dies, all because he was out of mana
---
What value does what? Like when I NE starts off with 10 nature resistance it says "poor". When does it get "good". 100?
---
Once they can go fire, yeah.
---
I think a lot of new mages are going to be disappointed and surprised seeing Hunters beat them in DPS before Hunters do turn to trash.
---
Priests: Mind Control, activating Shadow Form (visual and sound)
---
Technically Warlock, but it seems you'll have more fun with Rogue.
---
rogue is more gear dependent and you will be left behind in pvp without raid gear.
---
Locks scale very hard with gear, but IDK if your going to be farming BWL.
---
Everyone should rip on TipsOut. Dude should work out on sorting his fraud stuff.

"You know I'm something of a prick myself"

Retail wow isn’t a RPG
---
Classic wow is
---
Can’t wait!
---
Never thought I’d see Jack Jarvis with WoW armour on!
---
This is something I'm still debating myself actually. I'm still trying to work out how well Thick Hide actually scales, and whether threat or mitigation is more important in dungeon tanking. One point in Thick Hide's favour of course is that it affects PvP, whereas Feral Instinct does virtually nothing.
---
I can't be the only one who's had this nightmare.
---
I thought it was Valcor.
---
Do you happen to know if you can feign death out of death coil, poly, etc.?
---
There have been private servers where you could feign before the projectile hit you and it would negate it. I assume in classic once the projectile is cast it will hit you unless you feign within the same batch window but just curious
---
If you define "first group of lvl 60s" as those hitting it 2 months after release, I believe you have a good shot playing 10+ hrs per day with your strat!
---
Drain tanking with imp or succ
---
Mage - blink, polymorph and portal
---
He didn't fake shade the pictures.
---
So why are people saying that it's easier to kill them now?
---
I never said that it's impossible do do dungeons from level 12, im just saying that it wasn't as fast as solo questing
---
It doesnt remove the fact that you started this conversation with a shitty comment.
---
this is a great guide. 
---
Just to clarify, does it completes all quests, apart from starter areas all the way to 60?
---
Im a completionist and was planning on making my own little guide when bored at work, this would save alot of time if true...
---
It's not spell batching.. it's garbage cloud servers...
---
The flow of the leveling guide..
---
Thanks.
---
&gt;the reason vanilla is better than every expansion is the world
---
I agree. Once you start adding outlands, northrend, pandaria, draenor, zandalar, etc etc... the workd starts to feel smaller. Back in vanilla it was eastern kingdoms and kalimdor, and it was amazing.

Nostalgia is a small and efficient group looking for players who are interested in all endgame content. We all have played Vanilla and other expansions and are excited to relive the experience in a more relaxed and efficient manner. We are not looking for hardcore elitists - just friendly and dedicated individuals that want to finish end game content and have a good time while doing so.
---
##**⭐️Who are we looking for?⭐️**
---
- If you’ve never been in a guild, we welcome you to have us as your first.
---
- If you’ve never played WoW before you’ll have 60 levels plus our support to figure it out ;)  
---
- If you’re a die hard veteran who’s farmed every raid and done it all you’re more than welcome too. 
---
- Our goal is **Quality over Quantity**, **Maximum Efficiency**, and **Good Vibes**. If this speaks your language welcome to Nostalgia. 
---
- We are currently recruiting **all roles** except Hunter but definitely need more DPS such as Warriors, Mages, Rogues, etc.

viper sting lowbies and leave them at like 10% health without killing them, particularly if they're in a mob-filled area and can't move. Did this to a guy in thousand needles once and eventually he just sat in the road and went on a tirade in /s.
---
Couldnt' understand what he was saying but it looked like maybe he was upset.
---
Tool's new album drops a few days after classic comes out.
---
Hi, /u/crak69
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cdnw9y/i_found_this_gem_applicable_when_your_guild/). 
---
By existing.
---
Thanks, glad some random guy on the internet doesn't approve of me.  Made my day.
---
Then server location is just as valid, since it literally does that too through latency.
---
You say you only have time to level one, but why not level both? Have one character getting rested xp while you level the other, then switch off so leveling will be quicker for both. That rested xp makes a huge difference and it makes leveling not seem like it’s taking forever.
---
No, you could be regenerating mana wanding. Unless you stack spirit you get a negligible amount of mana for 2 talent points, and since you'll be wanding the mob down anyway sub-lvl40 it's nice to not deal with casting a spell after sanding. 
---
If you go DrainTank spec it's probably more useful, but check out the warlock discord for more info!
---
&gt;Boomer alert
---
You must be 12.
---
Looks like a hunter stole this guys gf.
---
Food pls
---
Who asked for Spell Batching in general? I understand that it's """blizzlike""" and all, but all it really amounts to is 400ms of artificial lag.
---
I don't think playing at 400+ latency is what people really liked about vanilla.
---
Counting on this.
---
&gt; I must caution that Bear form is/was unrealistically overpowered on Private servers, doing 30% more DPS than classic beta bear form, scaling to only 87% at lvl 60. It does throw off how bear druids perform.
---
Can you elaborate on this? I've been considering a Druid for classic and I'm trying to make sure I know the limitations. I hadn't yet heard about this difference.
---
I would absolutely love to play a mage in vanilla with ice lance.
---
I played mage for years, to me there's a lack of instant type fluidity from the class in vanilla. That spell alone made it the class for me.
---
This is best used on a rogue to make them shit there pants in fear. Can confirm.
---
Idk how easy they are to find, but THE man back in the day was Swifty. He’ll show you what’s what.
---
This isn’t as confusing as you are making it.
---
The shaman totem target macro is not a change. It was in vanilla, so it’s being allowed in classic. Stop calling it a change.
---
This comment made me consider rolling hunter for teh lulls.
---
When you think "serious progression" will be a thing in classic.
---
No. That's now how cast sequence works.
---
Nope, I just resent Blizzard creating a class that is useless in end-game PVE and then at the last minute, inventing a mechanic for 5 profession fights (out of 59 encounters) that requires that class.
---
Indoor roots for druid.
---
Looking good. I am considering a dwarf hunter, but it is still very relevant to me.
---
This was actually pretty awesome! Made me laugh, most memes don't. Great quality and original content!
---
Stay ret anyway.  
---
Don't let your dreams die.   
---
   
---
Reserve all the best loot, ret forever. ret all the way through AQ40 and to the end of NAXX.  
---
Kick other paladins who won't swap from holy to ret.  
---
Or druids who refuse to play the optimal dps spec that is moonkin.   
---
Holy priest? in my raid? shadow priest dps until we've got it on farm, then you can try your meme healing spec.   
---
Mages don't roll against shadowpriest gar, you're just here to provide water, you need spirit to regen your mana for more water making and that's it.     
---
Warlocks you're just here to summon, you don't need anything but bags, you can roll on bags that drop to hold your shards. 
---
40 man hunter raid. Constantly reviving pets, only pets can fight, hunters are just there to revive.
---
No music, but I'll put on Tales of the Past back to back to back and follow it up with War of the Ancients - Well of Eternity.
---
I'm having a hard time putting my thoughts together, but I think you hit the nail on the head.  I love the dungeon phase of the game more so than any other.  The more raids we have out, the bigger the disparity there is between raid gear and dungeon gear.  Historically we've seen "catch-up" gear fill some of this gap, and many people hate that we have them.  I hate that they are necessary.  If raid gear didn't so quickly scale out of control, we wouldn't need them.
---
I personally love the dungeon set upgrade quests, especially when done in level appropriate gear (i.e. pre-raids).  I'd love for more of that to keep pace with raids.
---
do you remember the CD of viper sting?  because im not seeing you keeping the distance from a priest for more than 30 seconds
---
If you play horde go for warlock or rogue if alliance go rogue only.
---
Downrank your heals, but only start doing it ones you get to 200-300 healing. Use 2 ranks of chainheal lowest rank (this is your main raid heal) and max rank (only for heavy raid wide damage) Use 3 ranks of healing way rank 5, max rank (only use for heavy tank healin and/or whit your natureswiftnes) and a rank you can spam for about 5 mins (this is your main, tank heal) and 2 ranks of lesser healing way max rank and rank 2 (use rank 2 to top up single targets in raid and max rank for holy shit moments). More importantly know what heal to cast. No point in casting chainheal if not 3 or more ppl need healing. And always precast heals and cancel them if they are not needed. Remember to weave in a lower rank healing way from time and time to keep your buff up on tank if you are tank healing
---
I like your build. One of the nicest things about having a feral tank in 5mans and raids is the crit aura (its small but it's a really nice little bonus). I know hotw/ns is often touted as **the** tank/heal spec but I think everyone in your group would always be happier if your heals were a little weaker but brought LotP when tanking. Having a feral tank with no LotP is just super *feels bad man*. Obviously NS is better if you're pvp'ing (although personally I think druid pvp is always pretty gimped without natural shapeshifter).
---
Overall good :) I would suggest using 2 different classes for the example, then it’s clearer when you say „Mages as seen by Druids“
---
Kiss my ass.
---
Pretty much this lol except maybe 9-12 for me
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Let the bodies hit the floor- Drowning Pool
---
Week nights doesn't really matter, prefer Friday/Sat since I can raid late and still play with my kids.
---
4-7am before work or school for me . Would be perfect. Can spend evenings on anything else
---
If you've cleared up to Maxx, you should have figured out not to have growl on auto.
---
I would argue Faerie fire feral is the most important talent overall. Cat form speed increase doesn't do much for you after you get travel form at lvl 30.
---
My memory says that you could Feign all of those spells. Not 100% as I didn't play Hunter back then. That's just what I remember from fighting against them.
---
[Well...](https://i.imgur.com/40Idny0.png?1)
---
A big part of it is pets. They figured out how to make Hunter pets not suck in raids after Vanilla.
---
&gt; Dungeon finder
---
But not in the way we know it today. More like the M+ dungeon group builder.
---
&gt;At what encounters through whole content hunter is a must have (Tranq shot, kitting ability, maybe some mobs jugling with "taunt shot")?
---
You'll pick up tranq shot from the first boss in the MC.  Kiting is necessary starting with BWL and UBRS.  
---
&gt;5. ammo
---
Typically hunters will use level 40 vendor arrows for everything.
---
I would generally carry 4 or 5 stacks of the engineered stuff for bosses/PvP/and some raid content.  It's not that expensive to buy on the AH as long as you don't use it all the time.
---
&gt;What are my options to place a trap if someone atacks me? Is FD only way to drop a combat?
---
FD + trap is typically how you use it.  Though a smart hunter has a trapped droped at all times when you might be attacked in PvP.  
---
&gt; How good would be a boar as a pet?
---
I think that when non beastmaster specked Boars are by far the best pets.  Typically I use charge manually to gain distance on foes.
---
**Neat**
---
Not sure if srs, but that’s the actual pope vs the pope from GoT.
---
You can't write a macro like  
---
/target [name of totem]  
---
/petattack  
---
macro in the 1.12 client, the macro needs to be written in the more complex LUA script language because the macro needs to do specific UI function calls that hadn't been aliased to slash commands yet.
---
Reroll horde and ninja loot everything
---
Only on reddit would you find someone snowflakey enough to get upset at the word "wrong" lmao
---
1. Lupos isnt good in 1.12. He no longer does magic, but instead physical. Brokentooth in badlands is your go to PvP pet. Spiders and bats are also good PvPers. It's all about that attack speed to spell push back.
---
2. Magmadar requires tranquil shot.
---
3. Using traps is so fuxking limited. Feign death wont get you out of combat if your pet is in combat (sometimes your pet wont even be attacking but will keep you in combat). Stoopod mechanic.
---
4. Ammo is cheap but engineering is good in PvP.
---
Can't you just make a macro that says something like: set focus 'target', /target totem, /cast moonfire, /target focus, /cancel focus?
---
Obviously the syntax isn't there, but that should work to target random totems.
---
Do you have a link to the specific guide? And it's entirely video, no text version?
---
There are both! I’ll edit this comment with both links quickly.
---
You save 145mana on rank 1 searing totem and you cast that all the time in pvp. 25mana for a spell that will keep players in combat and knockback spellcasts is a big deal.

# &lt;Get Off Our Lawn&gt; [Raiding/PvP | Semi-Hardcore]
---
Why the name? We’re a bunch of working adults with families, coming back to a game we loved. Our guild is full of moms and dads, and therefore, understanding of the difficulties an MMO presents a (somewhat) responsible adult. That being said, there is no minimum age requirement as long as you are mature. Evening Raids are scheduled after Dinner Time, no pushing for server firsts, etc.
---
**Loot System:**
---
* Modified DKP. The moment something drops, it’s checked in loot tables which classes are eligible for it. Then it is checked who out of all these classes has the most DKP. Then this person is asked if he/she wants it. In case of pass, the next person is asked. If at any stage there is more than one person with the same amount of DKP and desire to get the item, these people roll. Then, DKP are deducted from the owner’s balance. In case of tanking gear, MT and first OT have priority, regardless of accumulated DKP. Items have a static cost, no bidding, no DKP Decay. Priority is the following: Class &gt; Main Spec &gt; BiS &gt; Upgrade &gt; Off spec
---
**Raid Details:**
---
* Weeknights (Specific Days TBD by majority vote). They will start between 7-8 EST. We are voting on the start time as we speak. It will never go past 11:30 EST (and that is only if we end up landing on an 8pm start). We plan to Raid twice a week, three times only if the members of our guild can swing it. Two is the goal.
---
**Who We Are:**
---
* We are focused on PvE progression, but all of our current members enjoy both BG PvP and World PvP. The focus might be PvE, but there will be plenty of opportunities for PvP, ***including organized guild events for it.***
---
* We want to invite a friendly environment full of people who love Classic WoW. We aren’t interested in drama or the people it attracts. We’re here because we want to be. You should be, too.
---
* ⁠As mentioned above, we’re all working adults and have families. We understand if you have to go change a diaper. We get it if Soccer Practice was rescheduled.
---
* ⁠DKP is based on Attendance, time spent in the raid, and boss kills. This is a better motivator to show up, than punishment, in our eyes.
---
**What We Bring to the Table:**
---
* ⁠Experienced leadership. Our guild leaders and many officers cleared MC/BWL/ZG/AQ40/Naxx before Burning Crusade.
---
* ⁠A social experience. We love to joke, have fun, and sarcasm is our love language. We encourage people to laugh at themselves.
---
* ⁠Helpful members who will join you for Dungeons, help on a difficult quest, or come rushing in like a flood if you’re getting ganked in STV. There’s nothing quite like riding in with 15 guildies to punish some poor Shaman who thought the leveling Priest would be his bitch.
---
* ⁠Our discord is already full of pinned messages with resources for leveling, dungeons, gear, professions, add-ons, etc. This Discord server is live and if you join us, you will be added now, so we can get to know each other.
---
**What You Should and Shouldn’t Bring to the Table:**
---
* ⁠Racism, Sexism, and Homophobia are offenses deserving of an immediate ban. No second chances.
---
* ⁠Attuned by first guild raid.
---
* **⁠Discord – this is mandatory**. You don’t *HAVE* to talk all the time, but coordinating in raids requires that you are able to hear the Raid Leader call the shots. All pertinent guild info will be on the Discord. A Website will be created and live before launch in August.
---
* ⁠Again, we know that life happens. But if you can’t make it for Raid night, please give us as much of a head’s up as possible. If there is a family emergency, it will never be counted against you. I truly, truly, don’t want to have to deal with the possibility of someone abusing this policy. So don’t make me.
---
* ⁠There will be a lot of rolling for loot in the early raids. Expect it, and expect to go awhile without getting much. As people get loot, their DKP will be lower than you, effectively pushing you up the list and making the next piece more likely to go to you. Be patient.
---
**Possibility for Promotion and Guild Advancement**
---
* We have been recruiting for a couple weeks. Currently, half of our leadership consists of RL friends, the other half has been promoted from people we have met on the forums and this Classic WoW subreddit. There are still several Officer positions, as well as a PvP Officer position, we are looking to fill.
---
**Class Needs**
---
We are still recruiting for all classes. That being said, I have marked below how I would define our current needs, by class:
---
We have our Main Tank.
---
* ⁠Druid - Low
---
* Hunter - High
---
* Mage - Medium
---
* Paladin - Medium
---
* Priest - Medium
---
* Rogue - High
---
* Warlock - High
---
* Warrior - High
---
If you are interested, please feel free to message me here or on Discord. I will respond as soon as I can.
---
Also we all have jobs, so, we may not respond right away. Patience is appreciated.
---
My Discord: Shyfty#0901  
---
Co-GM: Nankersore#2668
---
what am i looking at
---
Sounds wonderful man, Are you East Central or West and what days will raiding be
---
Only tanks need resistance gear early on. AQ40 requires 15 dedicated nature resistance soakers (+ Warlock tanks need shadow resistance on Twin Emps) and Naxx has raid-wide frost resistance requirements.
---
If you're not tanking: consider pieces that have resistances on them in addition to other stats, but don't go out of your way to gear for resistance. i.e. Shaman and Paladins can choose to use the Red Dragonscale Breastplate instead of Robes of the Exalted while in MC/BWL.
---
K, let's also add back if statements so you can completely automate healing or DPS rotations because that was also part of 1.12 vanilla.
---
I love cleave while leveling. Honestly you shouldn't need to put a shield on much except on some boss fights, a nice 2hander with some CC and you'll be able to manage a few mobs pretty easy with cleave. But if it's a shield and 1hander I wouldn't use cleave that often unless you're able to dump aggro (replaces HS on multiple targets vs single). I'd even probably use Thunderclap for the damage mitigation to help the group.
---
Leveling as a war really isn't bad unless you're solo. Holding aggro in groups can be tough but if you're marking kills (I used F1 - F5) and the group isn't aoe'ing/going ham it's not so bad. I feel like people make war leveling and tanking out to be this difficult ordeal and it really isn't.
---
Like going to sleep at 7:30-8pm so you can wake up at 4?
---
Yeah. That was the one situation where I'd bust out resists gear in arena season one. It was also the only way I was surviving the face melting.
---
If it's not spell batching, it's leeway. If it's not leeway, it's layering. If it's not layering, it's Activsion sabotaging Classic so we all play retail instead.
---
Probably not, what he will get is a lot of "srry need mage" when trying to get invites to groups
---
I thought the Blizzcon demo ran on the Legion 7.3.5 client, but that they had upgraded to some version of the BfA client by the time the beta started? I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.
---
Why does this poll not include the full week? Being an adult in my mid 30's with a Monday-Friday 9-5, I will be raiding Fri, Sat with clean up Sunday if needed. But you guys need to realize 90% of you will not be raiding for 6-12 months. People forgetting how long it took to gear AND have a guild that was geared AND people all being raid ready at a certain time/day.
---
You save A LOT of mana and shamans go oom all the time in pvp so its a big deal.
---
Smart move as DPS to farm UBRS key early, and secure your spot.
---
no, it's the dang STREAMERS!
---
Feign is similar to, but not functionally the same as Vanish.  Vanish-immune was an answer to several powerful abilities (the aforementioned Death Coil chief among them).
---
Feign Death does not provide the same immunity.  It *does* provide a target drop and interacts with threat tables and combat in unusual ways (depending on how you manipulate your pet, you can drop combat with Feign).
---
Feign Death never (so far as I remember) provided immunity to effects while it carried out it's action.  Vanish very much did.
---
I could be mistaken, but this is how I remember Classic PvP and those two classes.
---
That's why I looked at it the wrong way, because some of these only make way if read the unintended way. Like the Mage-Druid one, makes more sense for the Mage to think the druid is a prick than other way around.
---
Addressing only the first paragraph:
---
I started WoW as TBC in 2006, in 5th grade. I'm now one year into salaried adult life, AND that's after taking 5th year for college. Shit's real
---
Thanks so much!
---
I totally agree.  While I like the balance that happened during WotLK with pretty much every class/spec being viable, it has the same problems at TBC and other expansions.  People play the expac content rather than the gigantic world of Azeroth.
---
Halo is great too
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scdSQbSiOT4
---
&gt; If the druid is barely contributing any dps, as a dps, then the druid is just absorbing loot from other classes who actually perform well in the raid. You could also just replace the druid with a mage, warrior or literally any other dps class and it would be an improvement.
---
I think the loot distribution will be a wash, given that a warrior or mage has higher "upward mobility" when it comes to choosing guilds. They're more likely to get an opportunity to leave your guild for a more progressed one, and if they do, they'll take all the loot with them. Besides, how much melee-oriented leather is a warrior or mage interested in?
---
You're also assuming that it'll be easy to "just replace" a feral DPS with a mage or warrior. That may be the case for some guilds, but not others.
---
&gt; So actually viability has something to do with your peers as well.
---
I'm not sure you made that case. If the content requires each DPS to sustain 400 DPS, then any player that can contribute 400 DPS is viable.
---
It is based on the BfA client, months ago it was based on the Legion client. The guy who wrote that is either dumb as a brick or haven't read any news at all regarding Classic during the 8 months.
---
Yes, it makes me wonder what other things they could do with the mac client other than releasing it. Hmm!
---
updated, hope everything looks and feels better \^\^
---
I'm going to be a warrior tank no doubt just unsure if I'll be a undead or orc. I was orc fury dps in vanilla that was 4th off tank but now I want to MT.
---
Ahh I see what you are saying; misunderstood your comment.
---
Lightning reflexes is only good AQ40+, since you don't get enough agi to get use of it earlier. Getting trueshot is better.
---
Oh right, how about "dungeon finder Lite"?
---
Vanilla has all level 60s scattered through the same amount of zones as tbc.
---
&gt; I really want to go engineering omw to 60 but mining will be really tough
---
I agree. The emphasis on Engineering from day 1 this time around means the mats will be in huge demand as well. There is huge opportunity there for people with lots and lots of time to farm nodes.
---
Which probably means gold sellers. Oh who am I kidding? It 100% means gold sellers.
---
Oh well that completely invalidates all of it then since private servers are so way off mark that it's laughable. Dynamic respawns alone probably shave days off the time it would *actually* take to level.
---
No dead zone for hunter
---
Spell batching, leeway, and layering are all real problems with the iteration of the game Activision is shoving down our throats. They chose not to give us what we want, which is 1.12.1. Instead, we get a reskinned Legion. Unfortunately, this sub is filled with tourists and retail players who don't understand why any of this is important to the meta that made Vanilla WoW great. We can't even have a discussion about that kind of stuff here without being banned for concern trolling.
---
&gt; Suddenly ~~the world~~ *Outland* felt much safer
---
Old world flying wasn't added until CAta so the old world wasn't any safer.
---
LEEEEEEEEEEERRROOOOOOOOOOY  JEEEEEEENKINSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
---
ok but why
---
Class balance for hybrids was probably the biggest thing. In Vanilla WoW, for the most part, hybrid = healer. Yea, sure, a super dedicated bear druid could off-tank or whatever, but in TBC meme specs were a lot less memey.
---
its ok its so BORING nobody wants to WASTE ALL THAT TIME
---
Even with Imp VW it can't hold aggro
---
Sheesh. Between this and the existence of streamers I pretty much don't care about Classic WoW anymore.
---
Alliance always does
---

I think the joke is that everyone hates mages.
---
&gt; UnitLevel("target")
---
In a macro you can call this function and yes it will give you there level. However, you cannot use `/cast` in a macro. The function `CastSpellByName` was made 'protected' by Blizzard in the Burning Crusade. So your macro can give the level of the target, but you're never actually able to use that information to be like
---
if target's level &lt; 10 cast fort rank 1
---
otherwise if target's level &lt; 20 cast fort rank 2
---
etc etc.
---
Not possible. One thing you could do is download an action bar addon to have many, many more action bars. Then on each of those put each rank of fort, and bind them to something really obscure like ctrl + shift + num 0 - 9

Hard to predict. Well find out in a few months I'd wager.
---
Well I live in an actual city irl, why not mix it up?
---
I'll just unsubscribe. Given the behavior and prevalence of streamers I'll probably just not even play the game.
---
Yeah for the hunter there are still some options to back out to range while the debuff is applied as well. I saw numbers posted by a ‘melee’ hunter and the dps loss required a certain number of casters to offset. As for offtanks annihilator is probably a better option unless the comp is caster heavy and a 2nd NF is probably worthwhile. I’ve wondered if an offtank could weapon swap between annihilator and NF effectively.
---
I feel you on the schedule, two days a week is already a sizable commitment. Once you start factoring in offnight raids, farming consumes, and respec gold it starts to look more like a unpaid part time job. I might just start as melee to avoid the initial flask costs and roll a mage for phase 2. The key is just enjoying yourself along the way.
---
Horde according to the polls everyone makes. Alliance will probably have more though due to female elves and humans.
---
I just want people to understand the mechanics they're being vocal about. I've seen several posts over the past few weeks that complain about spell batching in circumstances that have *absolutely nothing to do with spell batching*.
---
We are getting 1.12, it's exactly what we're getting, warts and all. And Classic has absolutely zero to do with Legion. The client they're using to run Classic on though is the BfA client and it's doing a heck of a good job at it too in my opinion from the hundreds of hours I spent on the beta.
---
I am loosing a counterattack with Trueshot, is it worth it? How good is Counterattack anyway, seems like a good pvp spell. Or Wing clip R1 spam is enough to replace it?
---
I use uBlock Origin but even if I disable it entirely the same problem occurs.
---
&gt; /cast Power Word: Fortitude(Rank 6)
---
The macro would only ever attempt to cast this
---
Not at all. They never upgraded to a BFA client.
---
Because we have 41 days 23 hours 44 mins and 38 seconds left to circle jerk.
---
I have not been in the beta, but as far as the footage goes and the friends I have spoken to... its slightly hindered. So as long as its working I don't see a problem. 
---
Its still MILES better than eating every after mob :)
---
These are the vanilla raids, they are level 60, player level cap was 60.
---
The Burning Crusade was level 70
---
Karazhan (lvl-70) 10-man [Tier 4]
---
Gruuls Lair (lvl-70) 25-man [Tier 4]
---
Magtheridons Lair (lvl-70) 25 man [Tier 4]
---
Serpentshrine Cavern (lvl-70) 25-man [Tier 5]
---
Tempest Keep: The Eye (lvl-70) 25-man [Tier 5]
---
Battle for Mount Hyjal (lvl-70) 25-man [Tier 6]
---
The Black Temple (lvl-70) 25-man [Tier 6]
---
The Sunwell (lvl-70) 25-man [Tier 6.5] 
---
Zul Aman (lvl-70) 10-man [Tier 5.5 equivalent, added later as a tier 4-&gt;6 bridge]. Zul Aman gear was strong enough to put you in a tier 5 farming guild, and entry level tier 6.
---
understandable
---
Show the source of this info.
---
That doesn't seem right, since otherwise the error "That spell is too powerful for the target" would basically never show.
---
I kind of wish they would have a delayed release for several realms. That way the streamers would be forced to chose from the first batch, to keep the hype, and we could avoid them entirely.

As always it will be server dependent
---
**[EU Alliance German] 5 man dungeon leveling group**
---
** Our goal **
---
We want push to max level in the first 7 days of the launch. The majority of our exp will come through grinding instances, 
---
while also doing certain quests/quest hubs along the way. 
---
You can check out this video for a ruff understanding of how we will level: https://youtu.be/GXPu3jEZ0-I 
---
We have done our own optimizations to that route.
---
We are a group of 4 friends that have all been playing wow since around TBC. 
---
Some of us have focused more on raiding, achieving multiple realm firsts and world top 100 ranks, while others have focused more on optimizing the leveling part of the game.
---
We are looking for a chill and experienced player, looking to have a good time.
---
Currently our group roster consists of:
---
- Warrior Tank
---
- Priest Heal
---
- Warrior DPS
---
- Mage
---
We are looking for 1 dedicated player. Class preference would be a Warlock, but other classes will also be considered, since the person playing is the more important part.
---
**Play Times:**
---
Launch day: 00:00 - 22:00 CET
---
All further days: 08:00 - 00:00 CET
---
Times may vary slightly, if all 5 of us agree on it.
---
There was the Amish challenge wowcrendor and others did in the beta, I don't see that kind of thing catching on much though.
---
The in-game Addons menu has check boxes that will let you load them for: ALL or Individual Characters

There's a lot more useful low level farm spots in vanilla. Like fishing for night fin soup. Herbalism for Free action potions, thistle tea, and so on. Engineering for iron grenades. Ashara is still a prime spot for fel cloth.
---
60s still visit booty bay and gadgetzan in tanaris and STV.
---
Vanilla definitely has more WORLD to it.
---
Never go to a raid fully loaded.
---
Exactly. The only value in any challenge is the value the person attempting it assigns too it.
---
True but i personally never felt threatened by lowbies leveling their alts. Eventually the isle of quel danas gave us a bit of danger but that took some time.
---
re 3  
---
So if i keep my pet at passive all the time a smart player would attack my pet once, lets say wand it, or apply a dot, and that would prevent me from getting out of combat with FD? Is that like a good reason to have a cat in a prowl mode at all times? Or how does a pet get in a combat?
---
Are you ok? maybe you should stop using Reddit for a bit or at least wow subreddits.
---
I remember 2 manning Wailing Caverns at around level 20 as a Warlock with a random Hunter because we just thought it was a group quest area. We had no concept of a "dungeon," and it took an entire Sunday afternoon to clear. I think I was 13 at the time. 
---
We could handle up to 4 mobs in a pack: freeze one, pets tank two, and I'd face tank the last with Searing Pain. It actually wasn't that bad since we could DoT up the off targets. With a healthstone and Voidwalker Sacrifice, I was actually fine without a healer. We weren't missing that much DPS compared to a real group, and we only died a couple of times to patrols. The real time waster was the \~45 seconds between each pull to heal and set up.
---
We actually did manage all the snake bosses, but we just missed most of other ones. It blew my mind to come back on another character with a real group and see all these new bosses.
---
That meme doesn't exactly explain mechanics tho. It just sort of ridicules people against it.
---
I need this for my orc hunter!
---
Although interesting anything under level 60 won't be raid. If it would be raid for say level 40 or 50 a few 60s could steamroll it. Which would be waste of some of the added content.
---
Bran could be a boomkin.
---
Well if you don't like Classic nobody is forcing you to play it. There are plenty of games I don't like so I just don't play them.
---
MAWS
---
A lot of people seem to have interpreted the explanations of "the server only processes [most] spells [casts] every 400ms" as "the server only processes anything at all every 400ms" and are now fully convinced that WoW is a server that runs at 2.5 ticks per second.
---
Cause y'know, apparently looting is a spell, vendoring is a spell, speaking to an NPC is a spell. I can't wait for people to call out delayed chat messages as being a spell.
---
Shaman: Wind Fury, Chain Heal, Purge
---
Priests gotta be Mind Control. Mind vision. Shadowform. At least if you PvP'd.
---
Nothing worse than being a flag carrier only to hear that crushing Mind Vision sound as you think you're sneaking past the zerg rush in mid.
---
All good questions but I can't answer them. I was just speaking from experience and I dont have the energy to test hunters anymore lol.
---
Billy Talent II. And ready steady go - Paul oakenfold
---
I'm advocating for spell batching here. I just think the way they've emulated it is wrong.
---
Old or new Reddit?
---
He's on there now thanks to /u/Grievuuz.
---
Rogues and warriors are all interested in "melee oriented" leather. DPS warriors dont have to wear plate. Hunters also want all the leather that doesn't have strength.
---
This is the correct answer
---
I didn't even know it was a thing on private servers. I know it from leveling several rogues pre-MoP.
---
Yeah Letterkenny is rural Ontario accent. Jeremy is also from Ontario but the way his character talks is less accent and more just... the character he made up I guess
---
Hamstring kiting didn't work nearly as well in the Beta as it does on P-servers; you'll maybe remove half the hits from a mob you would on private servers and it takes a lot more space to execute.
---
The other issue is that a lot of leveling guides (Joana's for instance) is built for Hunters, who can do a lot of things warriors can't.  Overall it's a good guide to follow, but there are plenty of places where there are roadblocks that you need to run instances or grind out additional levels to get to where warriors can continue following the guide efficiently.  It slows you down a lot if you don't know where those spots are before you hit them.
---
Sure but you had to go looking for it,rather than having to be on your guard all the time because it just might come looking for you.
---
Spellbatching caused this thread though.
---
What? I have 350+ comments in this sub starting from 20 days ago.
---
Yeah pvp is where you kinda shine can hop in the fray and really hold your own, or sit back and throw heals at the other melee classes.
---
god i miss this sooo bad lmao. sucks my friends are all die hard hordies and my main while they're active is always undead priest :(
---
Ahh well that makes sense. Thanks for the knowledge mate:)
---
Disabling subreddit style with RES fixes it.
---
Old.
---
You're a buff bot even if you use Crowd Pummelers. You bring 3% crit for the other melee and an extra Rebirth + Innervate. Your personal DPS doesn't really matter IMO. If you don't want to farm the weapons, then don't do it.
---
You're going to feel worthless without them though. 99% chance that you eventually respec to tank or heal if you actually care about helping your group.
---
Outfitter and Bottomless Bags!
---
It's a difference from private servers where you could loot without it being delayed by a weirdly long amount of time.
---
It feels and is bad- but nochanges I guess
---
Ever tried running old KR mmorgs on a new specs?
---
screw the show read the 5 books that we will ever get to read like the rest of us and be in awe at would have been.
---
I was also hoping it was a cat house
---
Aimed Shot combo from shadow meld... But with Ferocious Howl. The added damage made quite a bit of difference. Broken Tooth with full resistances just to annoy casters. Lupos to kill warriors because plate means nothing to shadow damage.
---
Just the usual stuff.
---
For some reason people don't understand that a great player on something they're comfortable with will almost always be way more useful than an average player on a meta class/build.
---
Tbh I agree that the mouseover macros should be nerfed since rogues in vanilla couldn't interrupt other targets without losing their combo points.
---
I know but I just like saying his name.
---
warlock on alliance not sure 100% which race yet. Im 1 of the only plebs out of my groups of friends but im ready to no life and learn :D
---
sounds cheeky after the fact I admit, but I starting fall away immediately when they were out of source material.
---
Many if not all classes have a lvl 1 spell, e.g. priests have Fortitude
---
From 22 to 30 it's very big diffenrence, after that it still is very good, 4% dodge and faster travel between certain pulls (where you dont need to get into caster to heal)
---
Speed levelers are well known within the pirated server community.   Even if he isn't one of them, he still clearly has experience aoe leveling as a mage, which means his experience on the pirated server is still valid.
---
Basically, I have no reason to doubt what he is saying is true.
---
... 
---
Did you even read the title to this post?  See the part where they blame loot lag on spell batching? 
---
Did you even read that link?  You know, the part where they say it still happens?
---
&gt; The game mechanism has improved since then, although loot lag still exist. 
---
Come on, guy.  It's like you aren't even trying.
---
Do you play horde or alliance yourself?
---
Be the ultimate power duo, go both engineering to use Recombobulator on each other and warrior + elemental shaman.
---
Both with alpha burst, both stomping people in seconds into the dust!
---
You were on the other r/classicwow layer.
---
Don't try too hard or get locked in on the 'theorycrafting' (very experienced players doing lengthy math, damage, and item optimization to squeeze out every inch of potential out or their characters) that is going on in this subreddit right now. It can be overwhelming to try to follow for even experienced players. You aren't going to do something wrong that can't be undone or solved later.
---
The fact that you're even trying the game is impressive. Have a good time, enjoy immersing yourself in whatever character you choose. Kill things you don't have to, explore new areas, help enemy players kill spiders, talk to strangers. 
---
If you want to give yourself a little more of a knowledge base, click around YouTube videos about the characters you might want to try and absorb whatever makes sense.
---
If you aren't having fun on your character, try a different one before you get to level 20 or so. There are a lot of different types and the one that sounded neat at first might not be the one for you.
---
To him, I think the coolest moment will be when he finds out you've played on your own time without him.
---
I know the name, but I have never played it.
---
Hence the challenge.
---
Holy shit Tranq Shot dropped in MC!
---
I had completely forgotten this. What a nice rush of nostalgia.
---
And dwarves remove it with stoneform. 
---
Also costs whopping 985 mana.
---
Well this guy following his route from private servers seems to be hitting level 30 in below 20 hours. So you think a person who has never leveled a character before in WoW will be beating that time?
---
Yikes
---
Turn up the fx volume, watch the Netflix. Fishing.
---
There's probably a good balance to find, but try not to get upset if he out gears or out levels you or runs groups without you. Playing with your girlfriend is cool. But not being allowed to play without her is not. 
---
Also don't force yourself to play if it's not for you.
---
I love it!
---
It's kind of hard to give advice to someone who hasn't played because there isn't any context. I could say a lot about the game and it would mean jack to you.
---
&gt; PI priest with 20 points in the shadow tree for weaving
---
Can you elaborate on this part?
---

---
2.3 so easier leveling wasn’t really true at TBC launch.
---
The big bad classic wow poll with many thousands of entries had a almost perfect 50/50 split and so did vanilla wow. 
---
Private servers or beta aren’t a good comparison to make because private server players are generally much more hardcore and people are more easily influenced by the community since there is only really one big server at any given time. Beta has way too many factors influencing people and it’s also a very small sample size. 
---
It’s safe to assume certain servers will be imbalanced due to factors outside of blizz’s control (streamers, community deciding on a pvp server, etc) but as a whole the faction balance will almost definitely work out to be very close to 50/50 and the average server will be as well.
---
Not sure if you've played current retail or vanilla, but loot lag was bad in vanilla, no where near what it is now. It was a daily occurrence to relog if you got stuck in the loot crouching pose.
---
&gt;Did you even read the title to this post? See the part where they blame loot lag on spell batching?
---
You want spell batching despite it being a negative relic from the past. When questioned, you refuse to think critically about it and just tell everyone to pound sand. When asked if other relics of the past should also be included without critical thinking *now that's different*. No bro, you can't be an inconsistent ass.
---
This could be seen as Classic version of transmog.  You still had to raid for it but it was of same level/stats as max level gear.  I like it.
---
I mean lets be honest, a huge component of WoW is for the looks/gear sets.  I know when I wanted Netherwind for my mage b/c it looked amazing.  I couldve built a better offset for min/max.
---
Please ignore this trash.
---
It's harder to backport a game than to make new code from scratch. Especially with how old the wow engine is. Making mass changes to very different parts of the code, instead of just adding new code, can cause a large variety of different bugs that could potentially be harder to fix than fixing new bugs created by new code. If that makes any sense.
---
They just wanna act like mage is gimped for once, which it isn't. Strong with no gear? Check. Strong with gear? Check. Strong at 1v1 PvP? Check. Group PvP? Check. 1vX PvP where they can CC and kill multiple targets? Check. High skill ceiling for huge outplay potential? Check. Able to use same spec for PvP and Pve, even if fire is better later on? Check. Top damage for pve at all stages of the game? Check. Very good at gold farming, soloing, and leveling? Check.
---
 Mage is indisputably the best class.
---
Aka TBC which will probably be out by then.
---
No. Max rank Shadowguard costs 250 mana (225 with talents that every Disc priest takes). Max rank Lightning Shield costs 370 mana.
---
Lightning Shield *does* do 82 more damage per orb (111 with talents that almost no Shaman takes). But since the usefulness of Shadowguard is the Blackout proc, you just cast rank 1, which costs 50 mana (45 with talents).
---
Moonglow isn't great untill you can get some decent crit chance. Or if you have all the crit buffs from worldbuffs
---
There was no critical thinking required.  Getting stuck in an ore node was a bug, and two polys going off at the same time was not.  Even if it was a bug, they are happy with the way it worked in 1.12, and since they are trying to give you 1.12 as accurately as they can, and since they know how to make it happen that way, they have.
---
If they want to re-create getting stuck in an ore node, I don't care if they do.  It won't ruin my fun.
---
If the priests have Spirit of Redemption I don't even want to know what the other classes are bringing..
---
Give me the Felguard at the end of the demonology tree for Warlock. Soul Link is OP anyway!
---
The Fall of Ideals is a bit less melodic but an incredible album from Anither band I used to love
---
What is causing loot lag, then? Because on the 1.12 client, loot is instant, but on Classic client, it's slow and laggy.
---
&gt; In this video Blizzard slow applies at exactly the same time as the first tick of damage, while in the Beta there is a delay. Very likely a bug.
---
In that video there's a delay from the moment the damage is dealt until the slow is applied. Look at the target's health and buff bar on any one of those pulls.
---
Hunter confirmed.
---
It’s based on the monsters level that’s attacking. 5 resist per level of the monster for maximum effectiveness (75% resistance). I remember gearing for 210 resist, based on the resist tables that you would resist (on average) 50% of the damage of the element. 210 was easily attainable with a handful of pieces and a totem/mark.

&gt;There's really no difference between Horde and Alliance for a Priest.

That's what I wanted to hear, thank you! Now I can play a Horde Priest like I wanted to.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doFnCzUxLU8
---
Play on a private classic server for a couple days to get familiar with the interface/controls. its a very simple game design to appeal casual masses really.
---
It's incomplete, how does....
---
Yeah do this
---
We're not talking about leveling here. And they are not identical. Shadowguard has a 27% chance of proccing a stun. Lightning Shield is just damage. At level 60, you have several reasons to cast Rank 1 Shadowguard. At level 60, you have no reason to cast Rank 1 Lightning Shield.
---
It was the tactic back in vanilla. There was a spot where melees only ha to move like 1 step to avoid his knockback
---
Mana cost is mostly irrelevant because shadow priest has nothing else to IF anyway and they have the same CD.
---
Ask lots of questions, not only about the game but also the lore and the Warcraft universe. 
---
I let my girlfriend play on the last day of beta and she got to level 3. She had a hard time getting the WASD movement down and wanted to stop after a bit. I thought she was bored and it didn’t take but I was surprised she asked if she could play the next day. She was sad when I told her we have to wait until August.
---
I really enjoyed explaining what a dryad was when she would ask questions like “Why is this centaur purple?” (She’s a big Harry Potter fan).

Big, xbows tend to be BiS

Been having the same exact issue all day.
---
It really depends on the server though. Mal’Ganis is like 90% horde.
---
Never thought about it that way. Mind Blast mana is relatively decent so using IF on DP every CD would be nice.
---
I don't think you need to follow any "balance" to agree a macro to automate the destruction of a huge portion of a classes' kit is against the design philosophy of not only WoW but MMOs as a whole.
---
 \*\*NEW CONTENT WHILE PRESERVING ORIGINAL 1-60 AND EARLY RAID PROGRESSION\*\*
---
=========================================================================
---
I completely agree with releasing new zones, and the opportunities it provides for **itemization improvements**. However, they should make the power level of mobs in new zones quite high, and/or **make zones require attunement/keys/quests** (like key to searing gorge, or timbermaw hold but not terrible). Consider making it infeasible to enter these zones until after some BWL+ raid progression. This will **ensure that the original vanilla 1-60 and raid progression experience is not undermined by new content**.
---
Raids, world bosses, and even \*\*new 5-man dungeons designed for high-tier raid geared players\*\* instead of pre-raid 60s. These should offer gear that is at most only marginally better than current endgame gear, or not better at all. It should improve itemization where it is lacking. Help the underperforming specs, like you said.
---
example: more +healing plate gear for paladins, available in some difficult 5-mans for groups with MC-quality gear. It should be competitively statted but worse than pre-raid bis in terms of healer stats, but fit the class fantasy and offer higher armor to compensate.
---
&gt;Some guy said: Think a paladin tanking set where a set bonus gives a taunt effect
---
Instead, think of skill books like \[Tome of Tranquilizing Shot\]. Or glyphs. Or set bonuses that alter current spells. "Your Hammer of Justice now forces targets that are permanently immune to stuns to attack you for 5 seconds." Don't break the game or make players say "PST MC must have X, Y, Z spells or no invite".
---
Also, player housing blizz plx.
---
\*\*RANT, Examples of new zone implementation\*\*
---
=========================================
---
* I think these first 2 are most important because they are so iconic in WC3, next to Northrend. Increase longevity and preserve meaningful progression.
---
* Hyjal- "The bronze dragonflight quarantines this site from outsiders while they ward off the infinite dragonflight within the caverns of time. Complete the Battle for Mount Hyjal to be granted passage." Accessing the caverns will require a good reputation with the Brood of Nozdormu, necessitating AQ progression first. This time, adventurers will have to travel up instead of starting at Nordrassil! Defeat some scrub who is trying to mess with the recovering tree or tap into the well of eternity. There wouldn't be a raid or dungeon here necessarily, but maybe an instanced FFXIV or Destiny Tower-like player housing district, and a sanctuary because the horde and alliance worked together there a few years back. Different architecture depending on race.
---
* ghostlands and eversong woods- "potent elven wards deny all entry so long as the overwhelming undead presence is detected, and throngs of the lich king's remnant scourge await any who could slip through. Defeat Kel'Thuzad's high command, the four horsemen, and the wards will weaken enough to enter." Revamp it into a tough zone that only Naxx-ready players can handle. An old high-elven kingdom in ruin with interesting scenery more in-line with WC3 design, as players retrace the steps of Arthas. Silvermoon city has blood elves that are tough as hell lvl 62s instead of level 10 starter zone scrubs, and a 5-man dungeon. They have no reason to join horde yet so they are hostile to everyone, because the horde are ugly and/or scary undead and the alliance are the same racist assholes like Garithos. Eventually, Quel'Danas and the Sunwell raid might be revisited in a different way. Maybe unlock high elves\[A\] and blood elves\[H\] by completing the content.
---
* server's first Atiesh triggers deadwind pass to become a questing zone with spirits being stirred, and Kara raid. Like scepter of the shifting sands.
---
* other zones are meh.
---
* New battlegrounds. Finish the one in Azshara, open-world like wintegrasp or not.
---
* throw in some WPVP in these new zones.
---
* cosmetics or reskins of pre-existing gear could be rewards as well. Questlines like Dungeon Set 2.
---
HORIZONTAL PROGESSION / slightly better gear / progression-locked content / build diversity and better itemization / give bad specs some love / new PVP content
---
Counterattack is good. But WC spam works, especially since you got entrapment too.
---
It comes down to preferences. But lightning reflexes ain't worth it at all early on, and if you're not grabbing TS, you should grab inp. AoTH.
---
There's a 1-60 Alliance leveling guide on YT I'm watching that does this.  He recommends training Herblore, and during certain episodes, he'll take a moment to say something like, "Make sure your Herblore is X level before leaving [current zone].  If you're below this, start going out of your way to pick flowers."
---
He also does this for Cooking and First Aid.  I'll edit this post when I get home with the dude's name if someone else doesn't name him before then.
---
Flight form for my druid
---
I feel like mages are the winners in this one
---
this, thank you! everyone is too used to the idea that you have to minmax in raids at reach the top of the meter, thats just not how classic raids worked. Between aggro limitations and the various class utilties, not to mention it taking 40 people for a raid, you bring the consistent players, as long as they aren't a total meme spec who gives a shit if they aren't a top dps spec like hunter
---
Also extra funny that people think they are going to be getting the world raid buffs for every one of their raids, that shit had a cooldown and you lost it on death lol
---
Was that the one the pally was afk until he was almost dead and came back just in time to die?
---
16
---
That makes no sense at all lol. First of all, why would Tranquil shot make them OP in PvP? It's useless in PvP. Secondly, even if it was useful in PvP, Hunters could still use it in PvP by getting it from MC.
---
Um, the post is about shadow priest.
---
12
---
Which means you should cast Rank 2.
---
the main issue with the meme specs is the drama they cause
---
if your guild wipes and you have a guy who's boomkin, hes gona be the first target for everyones ire because they'd be contributing a helluvalot more as resto.
---
That said, there definely will still be some meme specs allowed, esp when you just need to fill out the 40 people. People are really underestimating just how hard it is to find 40 consisten people who show up on time and don't stand in the fire lol. Just gona be alota flakk headin their way if its not going well

Druids eat mages for breakfast. Polymorph? Just shapeshift out. Nova? Just shapeshift out. Blink? What you think you're faster than a cheetah? Yeah, mages get screwed.
---
Warlocks eat druids for breakfast. Fear? No natural counter. Seduction? No natural counter. Drain mana? Welp, can't shapeshift, heal or decurse anymore.
---
The druid counter to warlocks is the Naxx shadow resist set. Seriously, that's the only reliable counter.
---
&gt; We're not talking about leveling here.
---
You are wrong.  OP:
---
&gt; &gt;  just trying to get the minmax input for all types of PvP specifically with some usefulness in solo/dungeon/**leveling** PvE.
---
&gt; And they are not identical. Shadowguard has a 27% chance of proccing a stun. 
---
No it doesn't.  It has 0% chance of procing a stun, because SG doesn't stun:  
---
&gt; | The caster is surrounded by shadows. When a spell, melee or ranged attack hits the caster, the attacker will be struck for 20 Shadow damage. Attackers can only be damaged once every few seconds. This damage causes no threat. 3 charges. Lasts 600 sec. 
---
Blackout stuns, not SG.  So that's twice you are wrong in this reply.
---
Maybe you should just appreciate someone who supports your argument instead of trying to argue with them.  You just end up being wrong and looking foolish.
---
Yeah seriously all you have to do is play and show some genuine interest it will mean so much more than you'll ever understand
---
This and you're gonna play Classic WoW? If this dude doesn't marry you, he's a fool.
---
that sounds perfect
---
Yeah mind blast is a fairly cheap spell anyway and spriest has weak crit damage so it's no great loss using it on DP every cooldown.
---
If you're a level 60 shadow priest (or a troll pvp disc priest), you have Blackout.
---
Human could certainly
---
8 or 9
---
There will be warriors leveling to 60 inside 5 days played at classic launch.

 &lt;Regicide&gt; | Alliance | NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore  
---
Regicide is a semi hardcore guild born out of a love for the game as it was. A group of people in love with the world and community that was created by Blizzard back in ‘04. We seek to be among some of the higher guilds on the server through raiding and in our world pvp. We are seeking raiders as well as some officer positions available. Socials are welcome, whether it be to be part of a community or you just need some help every once and a while with quests. Come join us!  
---
Expectations: We expect that raiders keep up with the pack when it comes to early leveling and reach level 60 within a week or two of the first 60’s. You will get out of this guild and experience as much as you put in. If you want to be near the top then you are expected to help with prep as well as basic help around the guild.   
---
The ONLY set in stone rule: Don’t be a dick. Respect one another, and speak with officers if issues arise. The last thing we need is turmoil that is hidden from everyone just to explode at random.  
---
Raid Schedule: Tuesday / Wednesday / Thursday 6 - 9 PST, 7 - 10 MST, 8 - 11 CST, 9 - 12 EST.

Ahh yes, he’s working on it with Ayle.
---
Yeah, it's big brain time.
---
Prot Paladin is fantastic in dungeon content, but lacks a taunt so will never raid.
---
Well reading all the information on the sub you're posting on is a start...
---
Good point he plays a ton of overwatch and roblox I think is the name. So I never know what’s going to interest him. He’s played everything from ocarina of time to spider man 4
---
Mage Bois are in the BG tonight
---
Gonna Pom Pyro those Hordies all night
---
Honest question ! Do you not care about building a strong character at max ?
---
19 at launch. RIP Winter 2005 semester.
---
Just play on private servers, they'll definitely still exist even with classics launch because they make that $$
---
They wanted to hook you good lol.
---
Why don't you just pause the game?
---
This is exactly the type of content I'm talking about. Long rewarding quests (and some short less rewarding ones). And each quest doesn't need to have BIS gear. Just a few items for each class, like 3 (for example). Throw in a few 3rd or 4th best items which are only a minor 5-10% reduction under BIS. Others could be rewards like collectables (like titles). Furthermore, others could just be fun quests with some gold reward. Not everything needs to be in pursuit of BIS but having a few bis items linked to actions you can do outside of raid is very vanilla like.
---
Also, not dailies or weeklies to get the gear. Just no.
---
Trueshot aura is better before AQ 40, imp wing clip is enough until that, just a tip,  put 1 point into trap mastery as a resisted trap alot of the time means death.
---
Hahah I can’t wait to be part of that rogue group finally. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. I ANSWER TO MY TRUE CALLING. PREPARE YOURSELFS ALLIANCE
---
&gt; Shadow resist gear to easy mode gank warlocks
---
If you have enough shadow resist to actually make a difference on incoming damage from a warlock then you have sacraficed every other stat to get there and you won't be ganking *anyone*
---
It aint that serious. I've got 7 days booked off work, will be online for the first 24 hours and then will sleep. After 24 hours I expect to be mid 20's unless there are server issues. The key is getting ahead of the pack and staying there.
---
Thanks for the info, guess its just more of a hidden recipe instead.

# &lt;Forty Decent People&gt; 18+ NA Horde PvE Competent Raiding
---
We are an 18+ PvE Horde guild of goal oriented individuals who aim to clear all the PvE content that Classic WoW has to offer, and to have a good time doing it. With the ultimate goal of defeating Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.
---
Leadership is experienced in raiding and we are currently in the process of recruiting more Officers, Raiders, deciding which PvE server to play on, and the guild tabard design.
---
All raid times are EST. We plan to raid 2 nights a week so people do not get burned out. If there is high demand for raids outside of these times, those discussions will be had once phase 4 is on the horizon because clearing MC, Ony, and BWL in two nights is quite doable. Tuesday 7-12PM Thursday 7-12PM
---
Loot will be given out by loot council. Primary decision makers are the Class Officers, with other officers and Master Looter serving as oversight to (hopefully) prevent most loot drama.
---
No single person has ever carried a 40 man raid to victory. You do not need to be an all star to join us. However, you do need to be able to pull your own weight in the raid. If we can assemble 40+ people who all pull their own weight, not a single raid boss will stand in our way.
---
If you aren't looking to raid, but want to be a part of the guild to run dungeons with or just hang out, there is room for you in our ranks as well. **You only need to post an application if you want to raid.**
---
Please, do not apply if:
---
\- You cannot respect your fellow raiders, even if they have made a mistake that caused a wipe.
---
\- Multiple raid wipes make you emotionally unstable or hopeless.
---
\- You cannot speak on voice coms.
---
\- You feel like playing for 5 hours 2 times a week is too much of a commitment for you.
---
Do apply if:
---
\- You are a relaxed person who's fun to play with.
---
\- You are willing to make a long-term commitment to take down Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.
---
\- You are dedicated to improve and build the raid team with us.
---
If you read this far, you may be the kind of player we are looking for, if you have questions you can ask them in our Discord, or PM me on discord. The "get-applications-here" channel has instructions on how to apply. Everyone who raids with us applies. Even Shizune the guild leader.

I believe Monkeynews does it in 5+ while grinding honor, but week 1 rah kill is going to be a race that’s down to the wire.
---
Yeah that's how it's done on private servers at least. Someone said that spot shouldn't work and that the range of the knockback is wrong, so I thought maybe that's why melee wore FR gear back then but not on private servers.
---
Thank you for calling out hypocrisy, you rock!
---
I don't understand how so many people lack basic reasoning skills.
---
These things are true at the same time.
---
You should play what you find fun, and also if you find raiding fun, then what you find fun will be something good at raiding.
---
It's not fucking rocket surgery.
---
Id say when you spend as much time in game ad you would a full time job then you are probably a hardcore player.
---
Im gonna guesstimate ill spend on avg 20 hours or so a week playing sometimrd a bit more. Especially on launch
---
CB + Preparation build sounds intriguing
---
Stray pets were so annoying, nothing was worse than when somehow two random hunter pets are on you as a caster. Especially if the nobody else attacked you, just the pets being ignored that wipes you out.
---
Started in BC, aged 42.  Old fart.
---
Of course there will be a bajillion nodes and if your layer doesn’t have them just hop to one that does... duh
---
I liked it when sor became a standard in the priest package. You were in a full raid. Suddenly, fail angel. "did you stand in shit again" "yes"
---
The core game is the same but the endgame is MUCH different. The outer world is dead in TBC and people only really play for instanced content.
---
Never bought my epic flyer in actual TBC because there was no need for it. I never spent time in the open world.
---
Here's something i plan to do
---
So you know how dying in Felwood is a pain in the ass right?
---
Well at the Horde Flight path, if you jump off the cliff you will fall down about 1/3 of the way, die, and ghost in Darkshore.
---
So this means you'll have to run all the way through Darkshore &gt; Ashenvale &gt; 1/2 of Felwood. THEN you'll have to jump off the cliff as a ghost and rez at your body. The only problem is that there's no safe way down, so if you dont have Hearth up you will fall down another third of the way, die, make the run AGAIN, rez, then jump down again, die, run, rez, and then you'll be able to rez at a safe place.
---
So essentially dying at that cliff in felwood is guaranteed to make you rez sick, hearth, or die 3 times.
---
As a Nelf Spriest, you can wait by the FP in shadowmeld, and when an unsuspecting horde lands you MC them, and make them run off the cliff. If you do it right they take durability damage too. You can do this as much as you want.
---
I was 13 in 2004 c: 1991 coming in hot
---
just suck his balls
---
[This is your standard build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/205300105041-3023-05025302030011).
---
Tbf, first hitting 60 is more relevant than in Naxx gear. If it's significant enough as a fresh 60, it could mean the difference between a raid spot as a feral which could affect whether or not you even make it to Naxx with a guild.
---
I don't think 112 AP is enough to make that difference, especially as you mentioned MCPs exist, but let's not dismiss the difference as just a 4% difference in a situation only a small fraction of players will experience, and it'll probably be 1.5-2 years into the game
---
I am curious though, is there a source on the 112 AP number? How was it determined if Beta didn't have 60s? Was it just extrapolated from level 10-40 and 58 data and it's offset by a confirmed formula?
---
You hit it on the head with pre BWL. When I'm talking about Classic+ I'm talking about new zones opening. This new zone needs to be consistent with the idea that the new raid doesn't dictate the fun. This means a few new hubs in one location, a few new dungeons, maybe a new raid. But it doesn't need to be limited to one location. Those quests could open new quest-lines in other parts of the world so it doesn't feel like the rest of the world is abandoned like current expansions do. The gear can come from all of these sources and doesn't need to replace all current gear.
---
just fuck his cock
---
Coin flip is how I base all my life decisions.
---
Is there an actual source? Interested in the testing procedures, the math, and the details
---
&gt;Someone said that spot shouldn't work and that the range of the knockback is wrong
---
It did work back in vanilla, so I have no idea what they are talking about.
---
Entrapment is better than Improved Wing Clip. Counterattack is a waste of a talent point 99% of the time.
---
I'm not playing Hunter but this is awesome and I hope it catches on for other classes. Thanks
---
Just autohotkey keybind that constant switches between the two. 100% bannable as fuck but worth a shot
