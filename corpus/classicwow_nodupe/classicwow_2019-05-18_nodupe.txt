Okay and those arguments about arms spec are not premised on private servers they are premised by the mechanics of the fucking game .

I don't know. If people are hyped enough to unironically watch Asmongold, that's pretty fucking hyped

Yeah with all these changes they‚Äôve added everything is shaping up to be much much easier.

Nope and I respect that PVE isnt what others want.

poor little baby

Depends on your gear when you hit 60 and what class you are like rogues can spec for 5% crit in a talent most other classes dont have that

If you truly feel I'm harassing you, there's a single button you could press that would make it stop.

Do you unironically believe you're the one who's right in this discussion, when:
---
A. You're being a massive hypocrite

B. You constantly have lie about me

C. You constantly have to insult me

D. You are unironically threatening me.

Reached level 10 and put all my stance macros back but they don't work the way I remember.
---
Here's an example:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [stance:1]Charge;Battle Stance
---
I have two issues:
---
1. The macros all show their default icon (usually "?") before i open the macros pane (/macro) and click on each, whereupon it loads the right macro and tooltip.
---
2. The macro doesn't work as expected.
---
Which lead me to change it as follows:
---
    /cast [nostance:1]Battle Stance
---
    /cast Charge
---
This worked.  But... if i'm in defensive stance, I charge, switching to Battle Stance mid-charge.
---
It seems there's something funky with the stance gcd.  Stances used to invoke a 0.5 sec gcd on everything else - I distinctly recall there being a delay between assuming a stance and using a skill.  Now there is none.

I think all the people worried about specs and if they'll have time to do things with guilds will be pleasantly surprised at the amount of casual guilds available to suit their needs.
---
[removed]

The trouble is one of those options is substantially cheaper than the other, so that seems the most likely.
---
Pre-history redux pt 1 the one with the boat
---
I'd prefer this, but I know Blizzard has to want to keep it this way as it at least presents an illusion that BfA is popping off too
---
But they do need to test it. Imagine not testing it during beta cause "not enough people to warrant it" and then they put it on live and this happens.
---
Good.
---
I unbind it so I can use QWER as my main ability row rather than 1234.

There's a guild recruitment section for both factions in this discord, lots of people already actively recruiting, I'm guessing you'll be able to find a crew that suits you :)
---
To have ranked r12/r13 on retail vanilla and private server, i can tell that i played way more on retail.
---
The reason is i was a retard and we were all retards on our server, and we didn't know how the system worked. We were like 15 fighting for top rank, draining each other stamina at 13h/day 7d a week....
---
On private server, i saw premade and server cooperation. You could go to R13 with  7h/day for 4 days, just by assigning an honor cap to everyone according to their current rank. Only AV weekends was a pain, because you couldnt control the whole server going 20h/day just for the rep. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So it really depends if you take part in the top premades or solo.
---
&gt;even if limited to specific easter egg locations that can't be exploited
---
Since you seem really intent on ignoring points I make to argue against some slight variation instead, I don't think we've anything to discuss and will have to agree to disagree.
---
If this is in fact not a bad, it's a minuscule compromise, and a temporary one at that.
---
You seem like a really sad individual.
---
blink did and does, and iceblock also does, if you really have to use it.
---
Ah.  Well I didn't know the EXACT numbers
---
lmao I actually have her as background too
---
No they didn't.  
---
  The big majority didn't even started using addons until the tail end of classic/start of bc.
---
This looks fishy, I'm gonna need access for a while to verify.
---
Mankrik's wife could never
---
g-guys I know everything about coding, this is not a bug at the beginning of a closed beta
---
True, changing stances incurred a short global cooldown. I used to have stance dance macros to handle onyxia fear etc and there was always a short delay.
---
The fact shroud is on the panel is a complete farce.
---
Orcs get 25% additional chance to resist stun effects -- what is the base chance to resist stun effects for other classes? 0?
---
People still ask for gold to repair their gear?
---
Yea that is not really surprising considering vanilla content is pretty easy. 
---
And I am sure you will do fine in BWL and MC in classic doing whatever the fck you want to. 
---
Wait so you just chastised me for talking about tanking with a Lionheart Helm on, and you offtanked with a full pvp set?! A bit hypocritical no?
---
Still in my eyes, its a dick move to fck over all the caster's DPS. Perhaps back then pre MS nerfs, it was worth it. But its really not when fury is the superior DPS spec in 1.12.
---
Let the scrub retail players do what retail players do best. Skip content, Look for the easy way and in general suck.
---
The true classic players will win over. They know the game, they know the strats, they know the vanilla goodness.
---
yikes
---
This is my life now.
---
Yeah that makes sense, hopefully that doesn‚Äôt rule us out of the beta lol
---
Yea, and I am the toxic one.
---
Believe it or don‚Äôt idgaf its on my launcher lol
---
all the best sites have it
---
Rest at ease, it will be ok. I did go trough legion in a really solid mostly server first guild and went trough a bit of vanilla way back when. I also went ahead and played quite a bit of pservers in a rather tryhardy manner. 
---
It is easier. Bandages are dirt cheap, and so is most food and potions. Flasks are so expensive they are exclusively guild endeavours for a tank or two. Gathering professions are as bad as now, meaning they will take quite some time from you. Sure nodes are harder to come by but at least potions are more meaningful and are actually not even required.
---
Yeah yeah, you need to have 10 potions of this and that, and food buffa of this and that, but how much of it will you actually use? People who say they used all of it lie. In most cases you simply had them, aaaand that's it. You'd use some on progression and maybe some if something is off that night. I'd end quite a solid chunk of raids with no gold losses and some even with more gold than I started.
---
On the raids, thing is solid guilds nowadays already raid 2-3 days a week 3-4 hours a night. In that time you can clear all the vanilla raids no Biggie. It actually feels as less of a grind as you are not repeating the same shitty raid but just on few different difficulties. At the same time you are hunting that one piece that dodged you for the last few months AND gearing newer players. Win win win in my book..
---
And I agree with most of your comments about the state of the current game. Its just that from my experience and experience of many players I was exposed to vanilla is not nearly as grindy. 
---
I'm just typing this as I'm hyped about the release and I sure hope me clearing said issues might get you hyped as well! :)
---
Shows the ignorance you have of private servers, you don't need to "download" anything but the specific client of the patch/expansion for the server you want to play on. Btw you're not interesting enough to get hacked.
---
Unless the servers db gets leaked.
---
same reason every time retail comes up someone just has to let you know how much they think it sucks, probably
---
In retail you don't feel any growth in strength. Just like when you go regularly to the gym.. Oh wait
---
Obviously some tourists from retail will leave. But everyone underestimates the amount of people who straight up stopped playing WOW or even MMORPGs in general because every game is now the same assisted garbage. There is a huge crowed craving for oldschool mmos, and Classic being so different than the current market is imo the very reason I think it will succeed.
---
Also the mmorpgs usually works this way: attract the hardcore players and the casual will follow. You can check Raph Koster's blog (Ultima online and SWG designer) on this.
---
The main base of everything is 1.12
---
So much this, don‚Äôt bother
---
It's not just another keybind, but a highly useful one since it's so close. In retail there's no reason to have backpedal bound unless you're a tank so many just unbind it and use the key for something else.
---
My PS4 just broke. I was about to go get it fixed, no questions asked, but then I realized I'd only be using it for streaming apps probably for the rest of the year. Might just get a Roku or the like instead...
---
neutral jump then pressing movement in the air gets you much smaller granular movements even compared to quick-tapping your backpedal key. You can press the movement key at all different points in your jump, earlier gets you longer distance, waiting til near the very end you can move extremely small amounts
---
Read the comment above me, and you tell me with a straight face that this guy just has a different opinion and that‚Äôs it
---
Just play on a private vanilla server.
---
Well yeah that's LFG. I'm talking about mythic dungeons where you need to manually find people and go to the entrance and actually hand pick people to play with. You get a lot more of the community feel through that than queueing up through LFR.
---
Personally I prefer Undead. But orcs are sweet as well!
---
Shroud played vanilla way back when and has played multiple other xpacs. What's the issue?
---
And neither is cheaper than either. If there's a market for it, it'll happen.
---
For his sake pray he doesn't frequent this sub. ü§£
---
once you picked 1 faction, you can only have characters for that 1 faction. Not both.
---
yep- tanking in bfa last nite, bored shitless, all i could think of how poorly it felt compared to playing vanilla servers.
---
Only resubbed to get into the beta lol
---
Garithos was also not even highly ranked... it's just that everyone died and he was the highest ranking guy still alive in Lordaeron.
---
Kael'thas should've just been like "I'm the Grand Marshall now, biotch"
---
It‚Äôs funny how you describe it as ‚Äúrough‚Äù lol. Retail players are so spoilt.
---
It's ok. Some people spend way too much time on the internet and think that someone doing other things, like not browsing reddit or paying attention to anything blizzard related means living under a rock.
---
It's hilarious that people think you are trolling. My brother has a coworker who doesn't even know what reddit is. And played classic through WoTLK. She only knows about classic relaunch because i told my brother, and my brother told her. Otherwise she would have no clue about it at all.

Weird that the WW monk movement abilities don't prevent fall damage
---
You‚Äôre delusional if you think a for profit company would ruin a game for their core audience for no reason. They want to make money, they need the classic fans happy to get their money or they‚Äôll all go back to even better pservers now that we have so much more info to work with. Also, they‚Äôve already stated this as a bug they intend to fix. Save this comment...
---
I did the same.
---
And for trash pulls. And for people who die mid fight or on trash. And it costs 20s/30s (depending on whether or not you're giving Kings) to do it, which isn't insignificant in Vanilla, especially with how long raids are.
---
Basically, as a Paladin, you can expect to hear "kings pls" a couple friggin times.
---
This isn't new, asmon admits to being like this all the time.
---
This might come as a surprise to you. But not everyone browses this subreddit, or goes onto reddit very much.
---
Yeah, Blizzard is absolutely capable of making mistakes, but after all they've been through and after seeing how much they seem to be investing to make sure we get an authentic experience, I don't think they have people who have never managed server architecture before. The example given by OP is a naive approach to handling demand for server resources (no offense intended).
---
Or they lied
---
I started in very late cataclysm and I love classic ever since my first pserver, so theres that
---
Improving your character is a task in itself. Anything you can do to improve your spec, gear, playstyle. In vanilla you could really feel your character getting stronger and it is oh so satisfying.
---
I also like getting experimental. Trying new specs and roles that I hadn't previously attempted, perhaps discovering some avenue of gameplay that tickles your fancy or helps you dominate.
---
Forsaken literally spawn in a crypt lol
---
Yep berserker stance -&gt; berserker rage macros for fears.
---
This isn‚Äôt true. There could be multiple other huge streamers who play on release
---
It still prevents fall damage on retail. Although slow fall doesn't need a reagent anymore, so not a big issue except when I forget where I put the button
---
I love fishing, it's not weird! It's peaceful, I get the same feeling I get when fishing in wow as playing a game like stardew valley
---
Not really, WotF was nerfed hard in 1.6, the immunity is only 5 seconds. Besides, rogues already have an advantage over characters that fear, sleep, and charm, so a racial cooldown that removes these effects isn‚Äôt better than a hard 25% stun resist and a damage buff cooldown. Also, the Insignia of the Horde trinket does the same thing as Will of the Forsaken.
---
Just LoN without the rings, no changes. Sets still won't work.
---
I have found that people generally feel embarrassed to not set their mouse/key bindings to whatever the meta is.
---
The truth is that everyone finds different things more intuitive. I will have "V" as vanish and "B" for blind just like I did in vanilla, regardless of how stupid that may seem to others - because to me it feels best.
---
I don't like the feel of M+ It feels like forced speed running. More of a fast paced action RPG than an MMO.
---
There was a screenshot that appeared on this sub a month or two back of ElvUI, or PFui working on the alpha. This UI is the tits.
---
Got it, thanks. That could definitely create some interesting builds. Might have to check it out.
---
Well you have two fear breaks that don‚Äôt share CD. I played a human warlock in vanilla and know how annoying UD rogues are.
---
&gt; Really? I am pretty sure he wants to play on a PvP server.
---
he said he wants to play on a PVP server, but he's not sure because he's worried about getting stream sniped and it basically ruining his experience, so, he's using the beta as a "test" to see if it'd be viable.
---
Everyone giving this guy a hard time should be reported for gatekeeping. This is such a joke.
---
back 2 retail.
---
And? As long as he has a following it's worth making sure people know he's a piece of shit.
---
Some quests do infact give you a yellow marker on Pservers atleast. It's been a long time since I played vanilla(duh) and it's easy to mix my memory with what I have experienced on Pservers, so I don't remember if this was the case back in the day. I highly doubt that anyone actually remember with certainty.
---
But hey, you people seem to fire up at anything. Calm down.
---
You need to be in SW for those sweet raid buffs.
---
he‚Äôs done this before, he‚Äôs not even that big of a scumbag. back in the day maybe, but nowadays? no.
---
But i'll take the memories with me forever
---
^(that being said I just want to use Beta as a way to choose my class, shh don't tell anyone)
---
This is exactly what I was doing for a while. Figured I'd level a bunch of different classes to 15 to help me decide. 
---
I ended up getting bored of that eventually and just decided to sit in org and play the AH to see how much cash I could make lol. Went from a few silver to a few hundred gold in a week or so. Took over the light leather market. Snagged a 1 silver bid on an AQ coffer key. Good times.
---
&gt;The layering is being done because the people that can't handle the difficulty of classic will eventually leave in droves. 
---
what difficulty in classic do you mean? Classic was never harder than retail, just slower.
---
I'd actually hangout with Soda. Asmon though probably not
---
Not sure about ya'll, but Thunderfury or the Scarab Lord tittle were hard AF back in the day, they'll be just as hard come August. More so this time around, everyone KNOWS what to do.
---
The only way to know is if you just download and play World of Warcraft right now. Use a starter account. It's free.
---
it's a joke, bob
---
I mean, he‚Äôs a big vanilla fan, so.
---
Thats why people watch him lol. I dont think it will deter them.
---
That‚Äôs my feeling too. We‚Äôre being bull shitted so hard and people are drinking the kool aid

This is sharding.

Duskwood is the best zone. Probably the main reason why I'll roll alliance.
---
What did he do?
---
What happened this time?
---
Did someone say Chick Norris?
---
Hey maybe calm down.
---
i mean, he was also in his teens back when the game originally came out. there were many people that were like this back in ye olden times.
---
OP is just trying to create drama when there is no drama.
---
Having tanked in retail lately this is exactly it.   
---
I feel like I'm responsible for not wasting people's time, for doing everything as fast as possible. No talking, no need for strategy, no need for anything. Fuck, today I entered a dungeon I hadn't been in before and I felt *bad* for not knowing the strats and not having the time to look them up. Turns out, once again no strats were needed anyway. They never are.
---
It's like being in the dungeon is some existential hell to them and they just want it over with. It's sad.
---
#OWNED, SO UNBELIEVABLY HARD
---
even though hes openly admitted to doing shit like this, hes a genuinely nice person irl and probably one of the more caring youll meet. not saying scamming someone isnt a douchey thing, but if you actually knew his personality youd know he does way more to help people then he does to harm them and generally cares about people
---
Report them for gatekeeping, violation of rule 2.
---
That is wholly untrue, for Onyxia and Nefarian you're better off as the other person replied, to put a fear ward on the healers.
---
What exactly makes you think he just doesn't agree with you about layering? You're incredibly hostile to anyone that doesn't like the inauthentic aspect of layering arguably ruining the vanilla experience. Some people think you're wrong, deal with it.
---
Doesn't matter, rofl.... He's not known for WoW, he's known for being a professional CS/PUBG player (that'd be like Kobe Bryant talking about soccer... Just because you played it, doesn't mean you're knowledgeable about said topic. Moreover, why the hell would I care about some influencer opinion on a game he played casually when he was still in elementary school? What does he remember? Honestly, he probably didn't even own his own account then.
---
One thing is certain though. That shroud is extremely fortunate he's godly at shooters because he's got an incredibly boring personality.
---
it happens a lot with Asmon. people take him way too seriously, when mostly everything he does or says is the complete opposite. he‚Äôs a fun dude to watch, people just need to relax a bit.
---
I might be wrong but I didn't think Enchanting was added until BC.
---
Agreed tbc is better than vanilla in almost every measurable metric
---
Fuck yourself.
---
What did he say? Can't watch the clip
---
Yep it‚Äôs got me very worried.
---
Thanks for the new header. Lmfao
---
It's certainly not minuscule, and will remain in the game for upwards of 6 months.
---
Yeah. I was hoping he would be involved somehow... Maybe if the "what happens next" conversation ever happens...
---
This is one of many reasons why I am against unbinding movement keys even if you don't use them that often.
---
No worries!  Aside from the memes this community has a ton of people willing to do the in-depth writeups like that.  Drakova got me into this paladin spec- he has a couple great guides about it on youtube.  Gameplay is really fun too you are the ultimate support class.  The more you're attacked the more damage you can do, and if they leave you alone you can just spam heals, blessings, or cleanse on your allies.  Your raw healing output isn't as good as other healers but the utility of your blessings and cleanses can keep your side in control of a fight.  VERY fun spec to play. 
---
I specced differently after awhile because the one big weakness of this spec is damage when you AREN'T being attacked.  If you don't have reck stacks you just don't do much damage, so I got a little bit bored of the character/spec being so dependent on reck bombs.  I changed my spec to 21/0/30 after awhile to get 5/5 vengeance and wore a little bit more STR gear with seal of command... MUCH more burst =P  Though a little more of a 'glass cannon'. 
---
Pally pvp is quite fun though.  Extremely versatile, easy to learn, but also a high skill cap
---
You enjoy the game slowly booboo the rest of us will be farming MC week 2 or 3.
---
I mean... I played vanilla to wotlk and I missed the announcement, because I'm not a "gamer" per se so there's no way I would have found out about this. Found out in January from someone on discord.
---
But it can‚Äôt be too fast paced otherwise there will be wipe after wipe, some of the affixes can really mess up the group if they follow it that way, going slow and steady is the better answer especially in the 10 or above dificulties.
---
Can't be spooked if you are already Undead lmao

Poison proc animation is in. It was a deal breaker for me and I'm glad it still happens in Classic!

It's a bug.

On Retail you cannot shard while in combat. This is a bug, confirmed even, Bornakk even said [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/sharding-after-latest-server-restart/175660/107) that "*There were similar types of issues like this back in 2004*". And other people have backed that up in another reddit thread. It's not layering, its not sharding, its some kind of mob derpaderpaderp. And even if it is the layering causing it, they are currently actively looking into it and they want to "*try and resolve this one before the weekend for the folks who are testing.*"

Relax broski

no vanilla is kinda differend, on nostalrius you can get summoned to other side of kalimdor and theres no loading screen at all, on live if you ress at graveyard or teleport 100 yards somehow theres 5 second loading screen...
---
100 yards is 91.44 meters
---
I don't mean to hijack your question but this theory has been debunked.  There are even cata babies receiving beta invites (non-streamers). You can see reports of this in many other threads in this sub. There is even a dude a few posts below in this topic who alleges he made a fresh account yesterday and got a beta invite.
---
Deep, unimaginable ridges.
---
My leveling spec looked something like this
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sEVuZx0t0e
---
I was on a PvP server &amp; I hated the idea of being ganked, so I levelled with this spec so I'd never die. I didn't tank or heal though, I had just heard that ret was bad so I never put a point in it.
---
Fucking god bless you
---
basically saying how he scammed people out of crafting mats on a technicality
---
Not true at all, they even covered it in the Classic panel at BlizzCon.
---
It's more minuscule than the issues in vanilla
---
It's just a guild man, not a "scene" there where thousands upon thousands of them when classic was retail. Nothing is going to change. Guilds will come and go on a constant cycle.
---
Hopefully it's fixed then
---
I think you are missing my point. I am aware if my pet gets the killing blow, I won‚Äôt get the effect. The bug I am experiencing is that even if my pet isn‚Äôt attacking, and a DOT gets the killing blow while I‚Äôm channeling drain soul - I still don‚Äôt get the effect.
---
Genuine question because I‚Äôve been asking myself - How do we decide which streamers are big enough to make a difference? It‚Äôs safe to assume many people who watch Twitch can be considered more knowledgeable of WoW if not more hardcore; if a streamer has 40 regular followers who want to play with them, that‚Äôs enough to form a likely semi-serious raiding guild. If the streamer stops playing, then potentially a whole raiding guild can fall apart; and I think anyone who played Vanilla can say that the making or breaking of a single raiding guild absolutely can impact the servers entire community.
---
That is really upsetting/dumb.
---
This is more embarrassing for OP than for Tips. Go witch-hunt elsewhere, bruh.

It's lovely with a minimum dual monitor set-up. So much browsing while you kill mobs.

" [Bellowing Roar](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=18431): Fears everyone for 3 seconds and causes Flames to shoot through the cracks in the floor dealing Fire damage. Players can hug the walls to generally avoid the cracks and the fire damage, but the main danger of this spell is the tank getting feared while a Flame Breath is incoming - as while the tank is feared Onyxia will change target to the highest threat player who isn't feared and use the Flame Breath in that direction hitting many players. Prior to the each cast of Bellowing Roar, the whole room will shake, so Warrior tanks must be ready to stance-dance to Berserker Stance and use Berserker Rage to immune the Fear. **The cooldown of Bellowing Roar is shorter than the Berserker Rage** though, so keep your Greater Fire Protection Potions clos "

&gt;They just said it was a bug tho, it‚Äôs a beta, this is what we test in a beta
---
This is definitely why we do a beta test. We can also do things like reset the realm at a busy time like 4:30pm PDT to try and find the source of a certain issue where a crocolisk is losing it‚Äôs brain due to how multiple processes are interacting and mirroring code to form a cohesive world. There were similar types of issues like this back in 2004 but we wanted to try and resolve this one before the weekend for the folks who are testing.

You listen here, Mac.
---
- Step 1: Wait until they tell us how they plan on doing it.
---
- Step 2: Do the thing.
---
Nope, they do share a cooldown. Not sharing the cooldown was introduced in patch 3.3.
---
I wholeheartedly disagree but you're entitled to your opinion.
---
Not a good enough reason. Hotted is an idiot for having him on.
---
Yeah it kind of implies the opposite.
---
nobody cares about you, so nobody expects you to care about some influencer's opinion on anything
---
How dare there be bugs in my beta test!
---
I disagree with OP of this thread but if you guys listened to the "elitist idiots" as you describe them, WoW wouldn't have turned into the dumpster fire you see today.
---
Thanks, bud!
---
I‚Äôd love to hear an explanation as to why you think that.
---
way to make a completely ignorant assertion
---
Right? That's the vibe I am getting from these comments. It's the third day of Beta. Some of these morons clearly don't understand the basic phases of software development and instead ignorantly lash out in anger at the developers.. 'I won't play this game, literally broken'. 
---
The cringe factor is too much.

What by using logic that such a person is more qualified to be a beta tester than most of the population of any private or retail server ?
---
You're too obtuse.

WE WERE ON A BREAK! XDDDD

Also how else are the mods gonna feel important?
---
I didn't manage to reach 60 before BC came out, so I'm not sure, but my plan is to just do dungeons from 51-2-3, don't know how feasible that would be :D
---
dodging the question, as I figured.
---
good talk.
---
Irony...
---
What makes you think I'm not calm?....Because I swore? Are you 12?
---
What is beta
---
Nice try alliance
---
BLIZZ PLEASE
---
Same, soda may not know how to boil water but he at least knows how to clean himself with it.
---
[people cared](http://www.darklegacycomics.com/46)
---
Comic #46, so it's OG
---
he‚Äôs not a piece of shit whatsoever.
---
Wake me up when we have CT_Raid.
---
If you like watching this guy you have terrible taste.
---
For a first timer the only advice I can give in good conscience is going in completely blind, and look stuff up as you come across them. If I could, I would wipe all of WoW from my memory to get that experience again, it was fucking magical.
---
fletched out game
---
No. *this is a bug on a* ***beta*** *that they have acknowledged*
---
Still trying to decide if I should sub just for a chance at the beta lol
---
The cluck quest? I thought that was common knowledge.
---
I learned about this from an episode of Cheat! in g4tv in like 2005
---
I bet no one remembers that xplay showed you how to get it.
---
That's a bingo
---
I mean, not really. I understand that it‚Äôs cool to hate him or whatever, but I think he‚Äôs pretty fun.
---
Snooze
---
Look in the mirror ü§£üò≠üòÇ
---
I just took off all my gear except Quel Serrar, Lionheart and Ony neck and I have 18% chance to crit.
---
I think it's more about following rather than size, it's just more common to have a following that would roll on the same server/stream snipe/be generally disruptive when you have 20k+ regular viewers.  
---
  
---
I don't think people with 0-5k will impact the server a noticeable amount at least not the the point where it would provide a HUGE faction imbalance. Because it's not like every viewer is going to roll on their server, it's probably closer to 10%. so with a streamer that say gets 1500 views, that's only 150 extra people, where as with soda/asmon that would be a couple thousand. Obviously these are just made up numbers, but you get the general idea.   
---
Could be wrong, dunno.
---
Stop.
---
Please.
---
Thanks for explaining more in-depth. I never thought of that, Shamans aren't ever going to be in the party to give stuff like mana-tide making alliance a clear better pick for choosing a mage faction.
---
&gt;who cares?
---
It's trending.
---
When I was like level 13 I remember trying to do stuff like this. I had just came from playing Diablo 2, where at the time, stuff like this was CONSTANT. There were multiple scams people did very commonly in Diablo 2:
---
\-- Try to trade items with a full inventory, trade doesn't go through, empty inventory a bit, switch the item you're trading for (ie, switch the Gull Dagger to a dagger with a topaz in it was the most common, also happened with SoJs) and then click trade again. 
---
\--Stealing from people who were muling items.
---
\-- The "you can dupe if you die, equip the items you want to dupe, and then die again!" play (the items actually then drop and the scammer picks them up... I feel like I'm missing a step here but it was something like this). 
---
Some people (like myself) were complete assholes when they came to MMOs after not playing a truly cooperative game before.
---
Hunde
---
The length of P1 gets longer every single time I see this post from you types.
---
*No. They aren't going to go anywhere near 6 months without releasing dire maul.*
---
Was it cheat? I thought it was xplay
---
That‚Äôs how a pserver was, not retail. You‚Äôre mixing them up. No one raided with that many consumes, not even top guilds just watch their videos.
---
The catch is you need an active WoW subscription to get into the beta. Most of the players waiting to play Classic refuse to pay Blizzard for retail WoW because it‚Äôs not even the same great RPG we all fell in love with.
---
I think it was PFUi, and it wasn't actually classic tho :/
---
why are you so upset? what is wrong with you?
---
[Here's a really basic guide](https://classicwow.live/guides/488/world-of-warcraft-classic-compendium) designed at new players to help you choose your race, class, professions, etc.
---
That site also has a bunch of guides in text and video format both for new players and advanced stuff if you want to dive deeper.
---
Ha it does like like that huh
---
Who cares what this "community" names themselves? That doesn't mean shit. This is Reddit, THE shit hole of the internet. If you honestly expect snuggles and unicorn kisses, well, good luck with that. Why do you get so agitated over what a bunch of random usernames post online in an armpit subreddit?
---
Will they send an email or do they just add it to your launcher?
---
It seems like you can't answer, because you are a content creator and not a real person.
---
It was for sure cheat. I can't forget Kristin holt telling me about the Easter eggs in WoW.
---
That's why I said upwards. No one knows but it will likely be around 3-4 months, which is still too long with a broken ~sharding~ sorry, layering, system.
---
Yeah definitely common knowledge. Simple google search for available pets in vanilla shows it as well.
---
Alliance is awesome! Welcome! The alliance Onyxia chain is amazing.
---
I cannot wait to re-enjoy this game in its prime!
---
Explain the better option then. A few unplayable servers for days/weeks after launch? Followed by long ass queue times after that?
---
Hundreds of servers dead within a week?
---
Yall need to look up the definition of compromise and start bitching  about shit that actually matters. Like right click reporting.
---
No thanks, game starts at 60.
---
oh god the irony.  sick emotes dude, you talk like my 16 y/o sister
---
lol dang.  I remember never having even 100g!
---
It's the first time I've seen Shroud. So far his arguments are all pretty sound so far (e.g. the hype on twitch will die down and viewer numbers will even out to the current retail numbers) and he legitemately admitted that the sole reason he went into the Beta is nostalgia.
---
Don‚Äôt forget Noggenfogger.
---
I hope they remove mouse over macros. They weren't part of Vanilla and it should stay that way.
---
Most people? No lol.
---
Not now, he won't!
---
I think the guild I was in was 'allied' with another guild, we'd just mash the 2  raiding groups together.
---
&gt;you have terrible taste.
---
You, sir, are living in the year 3035
---
I'm giving classic one month but it sounds like all of my fears were correct
---
okay man. thanks.
---
Ahh that‚Äôs why I thought it was xplay
---
Any horde rogue is going to be annoying to an alliance cloth wearer, they don't really need another advantage. The stun resist helps in areas where rogues don't fare well. You're better off taking a passive that throws a wrench in every fight against paladins, druids, warriors, and other rogues.
---
name a boss fight were a feral can compete with a competent dps warrior/rogue. Go ahead I'll wait.
---
Or..... Blizzard lied lol
---
That hurts! There's at least 15 of us damnit!
---
Be more vapid please. I dare you.
---
It‚Äôs not a vanilla screeny without mail.
---
yeah i fucking know this chicken. He's a real asshole.
---
Try Stellaris. That game requires so much attention while you play it it's tough to think about anything else.
---
Lmao. This is why I love him and his content. He isn't afraid to be honest. He admits to being scumbag literally every single day on stream. This clip is nothing compared to some of his troll shit haha.
---
I think I had a threat meter, but not a dps meter. Cause you had bosses like Phase 1 Ony where she was immune to taunt.
---
&gt;  aug 12-13
---
&gt; I live in Louisiana so what time would that be? 
---
Even in Louisiana days still have a full 24 hours.
---
Yup! And this is how warriors avoid damage. We tab target the nearest thing mid-fall, and charge it.
---
Great! Is this from Cataclysm (right before the ground opened up?)?
---
Nobody seems to understand his deadpan humor and overly sarcastic personality.
---
Strongly agree OP. If you've never played vanilla and you listen to the minmaxers/powergamers on this sub, you would think the only way to play vanilla is rolling an orc/human warrior and rushing your way to level 60 in a few weeks. This is an attitude that comes from pservers since most people on there have already leveled so many times, so they pass that on as wisdom to noobs.
---
In truth, leveling is incredibly fun in vanilla for a lot of people, including myself. Moving on to the next zone and seeing a new set of mobs who are actually gonna challenge me... in an entirely new environment, with a new story and new quests. It's just so awesome.
---
taste is subjective
---
White Kitten &gt; Chicken.
---
&gt; how will be the end game beside pvp and raiding in classic? Gettin your class blue set? What more?
---
Gold farming is a big part of Classic. You'll be doing that even after you've gotten all your gear and are just raid-logging or PVPing. Hunters, mages and warlocks might instance farm DM or Maraudon, other classes might farm Elemental Earth out in the Badlands or other solo methods.
---
I think people just hate that they make a shitload of money playing games.
---
Thanks converter-bot. But in WoW 100 yards is actually 100 meters on clients in languages that use meters.
---
100 meters is 109.36 yards
---
mAkE aZeRoTh GrEaT aGaIn
---
They have the rich part down.
---
It was posted yesterday too.
---
&gt; He isn't afraid to be honest.
---
Literally talking about someone who lies and scams people. Ok. 
---
&gt; This clip is nothing compared to some of his troll shit haha.
---
It's not "trolling". It's not funny. People spend their time in game to earn things and to be dishonest and steal from them makes you a bad person. The fact that it's a game does not matter.
---
Step aside for Stalvan.
---
haha you are so upset man.  Take some time off from your reddit tirades!
---
Do you know if this is true for all races? And maybe even sexes? For example, a dwarf vs a nelf. Large size difference. What about a male nelf vs a female nelf? Or is Tauren the only one with a difference hit box size? Hmm..
---
It affects me in no way, yet it still annoys me. Glad it won't be in classic
---
Because you seem acting out some mission of trying to spread the word that some streamer is a piece of shit for some reason. If you were really calm that might seem like... idk.. a weird thing to be doing.
---
Nobody cares if you swear or not.
---
Tbh this is a smart way of doing it to keep the players spaced between zones/level.
---
Usable underground and indoors too.  Some face pulls may occur, but you‚Äôre the warrior anyways.
---
&gt; It's just a timesaver and saves needless whsipering, but boy does it change the experience
---
Just like LFG/LFR, yeah. Automating away the human interaction.
---
Paladin was my first character and I raided mc, bwl, aq 20. What I remember most is upon forming a raid, starting a chat channel with the other paladins so we could coordinate who was using what buffs. Add-ons later would automate this process. Then I remember buffing. A lot. Then spamming flash heals, while trying to do some meager dps.
---
It was on the legion client used for the alpha testing though was it not?
---
It's actually pretty important if you have to quickly backpedal and you only have your left hand available. Dodge pats and whatnot. Saved me 100s of times.
---
I'm down to Warrior, Warlock, and Shaman myself too. Mained a warrior for 5+ years but love shammy heals / bolts along with warlock for easy leveling
---
Definitely man. You can play the auctions a bit, find your best leveling route (yes, there‚Äôs guides but doing your own adventure is more fun IMO), and learn professions properly. Really excited and can‚Äôt play anything else right now. I‚Äôm not going no life on it so I don‚Äôt get Vanilla burnout though.
---
Yep. People really overstate how intense end game/raiding is or was. I raided up till twin emps in AQ and we had 5 or 6 bosses down in nax by the time BC dropped. We definitely weren't the greatest guild out there and we never tried to min/max. People didnt go insane with consumables. We did just fine though and I was happy to be decked out in tier 2-3.
---
Keep projecting because you're too dimwitted to realize it. Take that L.
---
Dude thems some skills.
---
You completely missed my point reread please
---
nope
---
ADZ124_ is upset because he didn't get beta access. He's been raging in other threads as well.
---
Yeah, people know about it.
---
But for the upcoming Classic Horde players who never played Vanilla, you *are* able to get the quest. However, since the only feed vendor in Vanilla is that farmer there, you'll need to search for the feed on a Goblin AH.
---
He likes to lick Murlocs
---
What time during the day would that be üòë

I don't know, I may be mistaken!

Stop arguing them. They are borderline retarded and obsessed

Unless you play on a PvP server. In that case, the faster to 60 the better

Im actively looking to buy a beta account because i wanna play so bad. Offering 300$

Usually use the walk button, but S key does have other important uses.

Probably sometime during the day starting at a specific time that Blizzard will state at some point.

Don't have to, I'm in them.

strafing at the correct angle accomplishes the same thing without lowering your move speed

You take video games way too seriously. The dude is honest about fucking with people. If the worst thing he has ever done in his life is lie to a world of warcraft GM to get some free fantasy dust then he's a better person than I am. Get off your high horse.

AMAZIN
---
Were you in trade chat on every server 24/7? You can't make this assertion. Nor can you make the opposite without proof.
---
MadSeason is by far the best IMO followed by Kargoz. I like Kargoz's personality. He seems like a really nice dude IRL and he helps pumps up my hype meter for Classic. Not a fan of pretty much any other streamer/content creator for Classic.
---
They both suck and you need a low IQ to watch them and find it entertaining. Hopefully they and all their fans are on one server so people who want to play the game as it was are able to do so.
---
I understood it, you are just totally incapable of accepting that others don't feel the same way and will regurgitate whatever rhetoric Blizz comes up with. Him calling you a blizzard nuthugger was apt.
---
&gt;if you get to 60 in 2 weeks do all the endgame and start bitching and whinging about lack of content 
---
Come on buddy. You know that's exactly what they're gonna do and there's nothing you or I can do that will change that. "MOAR CAHNTENT". What about all that content you skipped rushing to level 60? "NO ME WANNA BE HIGH LEVEL, MOAR CAHTNENT".
---
Ohh a traitor in our midst!
---
I like current wow. I just think things had more of an impact &amp; repercussions in classic than wow today.
---
If they're primarily a PvPer Pally is hella fun with several great builds. PvE, on the other hand, prot is one of Classic's "broken" specs though it's a great farming spec and Ret...well you better hope you're a guild officer in a good guild, lol
---
You just made me realize I don't remember where I hit 60, and that kind of bothers me.
---
\- Debuffs after the 16th slot will remove debuff with lower priority.
---
If you cast a lower hot on someone in raid, it can be overrided by a higher hot. You won't be able to cast a lower rank hot on someone with a higher rank ticking, it will say a more powerfull spell is already active on target.
---
1.12 patch will make MC and BWL easy as fuck, don't get mad if 36 people clear MC in green gear at lvl 57 when you'll still be a lvl 39, this is not vanilla wow, it's classic, 1.4 to 1.12 made all class way stronger.

The debuff from the mages frost bolt crit? not sure the name, and sunder from warriors

If I remember correctly, using the salt shaker to refine salt for leatherworking was a 1 day cooldown. Not a cooldown on a crafting recipe, but nonetheless a crafting cooldown.

Any fight that has minimal downtime really. So fights like Twin Emps are a no-go. You'll also get better results as alliance because all the blessings synergize with ferals.

Actually, both the Legion launch (29th/30th August 2016) and BFA launch (13th/14th August 2018) had ~230k and ~600k peak viewership numbers, with average numbers dwindling down to 
---
20-25k post Legion launch, picking up around early 2018 to 30-35k and now hovering around 40k on average. Since BFA the game also has seen several peaks, mostly because of the world first race, where numbers for Uldir went up to ~100-160k for a week and Battle for Dazar'alor around 100k. Viewer numbers show, that even though players are quitting the game the actual viewer numbers don't go down that much. Considering that Legion was pretty steady with player numbers all the time (you could find more raids and dungeon groups all the time compared to now), the viewer numbers on twitch were relatively low. Meanwhile, with BFA the viewernumbers are relatively steady, considering all the negative parts the expac has.
---
I wish we had an option, normal no changes servers without layering with eventual server tansfers. 
---
And a layering server option.
---
 I'd rather just wait in a que than deal with all this layering shit.
---
Nice.  I think it's actually the Barrens then! Love it even more
---
Super helpful, thanks!
---
Hahahaha please keep replying I love it
---
Seconded Kargoz. He's my second favorite Classic content creator after MadSeason.
---
Sonii and Alodar are both chill.
---
What are you talking about? I dont get it
---
I think while the pserver scene played their part, they get too much credit for making this happen.
---
Blizz has said in interviews that they've internally actually wanted to make classic for many years, but didn't know of a way to make it happen on the technical end. 
---
Blizzards public anti classic stance was a facade, because to them they couldn't make classic, even if they wanted to.
---
As soon as they figured it out, it was a done deal.
---
Westfall is more like Kansas than Alabama, but whatever.
---
Roll tide
---
Daily I'm guessing. Woke up to the Classic option on my launcher this morning (Aussie time)
---
&gt;afaik 
---
yea you did need epic mount training at least at one point. I forget which patches changed what though and it was only one type of training. You trained normal riding for 10 and epic for 100 there were no type of trainings. You just needed to be exalted with the faction you wanted to be able to purchase it outside of your own race.
---
you sound very unfun to play with
---
Wow classic has a lot of quality of life things still in the game, the classic is more so the world and quests and tuning and abilities being exact to classic. But it‚Äôs all done in the new engine with new models and textures. He has no add ons but the in game default raid frames aren‚Äôt the ones from vanilla.
---
MMOs in general have a massive churn rate anyway
---
118 on average
---
Yea but this guy is commenting all over when in reality the answer to his question was one click away. The comment isn't even related to the clip.
---
RetroWoW is a decent place to test, since it's instant 60. But the server is pretty trash for anything but.
---
You think you are going to learn how to play from a subreddit?
---
The guy is commenting all over when in reality the answer to his question was one click away. The comment isn't even related to what's happening in the clip.

\*Yawn\* I'm not here to be a source of entertainment for people with ASD. 
---
On your bike, lad.
---
He's making this post for new players that feel like they have to rush to 60. The core game is leveling. That's all he's saying.
---
I'm not a content creator and I'm in.
---
Think he has his hands full with his current job.
---
Your friends probably want to rush to 60 because pserver people and minmaxers on this sub are giving all the noobies the impression that leveling is a chore in vanilla like it is in retail. I knew about 25-30 people who played WoW back in the day and I can only remember literally one of them who would rush to 60. Everyone else just played normally. So no. Your friends have received that idea from elsewhere. That is not something they decided themselves out of nowehere.
---
Layering is like buying a cat to catch the rat. Then buying a dog to catch the cat. It never ends...  Just give us a choice to chose original servers with eventual transfers
---
It‚Äôs likely a bug, as a recent blue post stated, but it‚Äôs not respawns. For one, if you watch the clip, the mob he‚Äôs fighting doesn‚Äôt die. It just disappears at 10%, at the same time two other mobs appear. And if they were respawns, they would have a 5 second grace/idle period where they don‚Äôt do anything unless attacked, after respawning.
---
Launch day I am moving a mini fridge and microwave to my den. Stocking up on My dew code red and hot pockets. Trying to recapture my early 20's lol.
---
I believe this was a bug in wrath of the lich king too. That border where the names change always caused that alligator to disappear. I only remember bc I leveled an orc warrior and got so upset bc it was potentially my last croc. I can‚Äôt recall terribly well but when I saw this I was like oh I‚Äôve seen that before! (Never been on a pserver as horde)
---
In terms of fall recovery and aerial insertion it's a 9.5/10 and second only to Pallies with the ol' bubble drop/meteor. (Paladin gets max style points for the sheer directness and lack of fucks given from any height).
---
[21:9 works](https://i.imgur.com/Ql1aWks.jpg)
---
Oh good point! Arms might be the way to go! Thanks for reminding me
---
Plus, why can't I quickly level up as a strategy to get more gold, and then reroll on a few alts.  There is plenty to see in Classic, but I will probably play however I feel like it. Including leveling up quickly to get more gold and make everything easier.
---
Well, that's just wrong.
---
Bink was much better because as it could teleport you to ground in some cases and enable you to continue dps.
---
That is what is very annoying about world pvp these days.
---
You get in an engagement, take someone and their buddy on. By the time you're done killing them, they are body ressing.
---
Everything I google says 3 days. \*ponder\*

Stop being bad.
---
I NEED A LINK TO THE UI!!! lol
---
Just got mine 5 minutes ago...there goes my weekend!!!!
---
So how's priest leveling?
---
Yea i recommend just running to the NE start zone and doing all their quests if you want sabers instead of horsies. But i personally won't be to worried about it until i need an epic mount my first mount will be just the normal Mechstrider.
---
I rush to 60. Then I lvl my shaman tank :)
---
SL/nightfall is a meme spec in premaids. You do see it on Aliance but SM/Ruin is much more the go to spec there and it is not about hard casting shadowbolts, it's about high sustained damage through dots and CC with WAY better damage than SL can ever put out. On hord conflagrate is pretty much the go to spec because paladins and it's good burst damage. In premaids warlocks are pretty much just backline damage.
---
Hi, /u/Raypep1
---
why are you so mad? were you one of the people he did this to? lmao
---
Or the vast majority of the player base understood Demons Souls was insanely difficult and it was the first of it's kind. There was a mutual respect for other players and a bow was a signal that you were ready for a fair fight. 
---
Or weebs or whatever.
---
Paladins output more raw healing on average in some fresh pserver raid data in the first few tiers.
---
But raw healing isn't everything. Priest healing kit is way greater than spamming flash of light.
---
I havn't made videos in ages. I thought I would start covering some of the rep grinds in Classic wow. Let me know if you have an suggestions. Thanks.
---
I've explained this a hundred times here but I'll humor you. I guess the better question is, if you *don't* know the consequences of layering, or why we need it, or what the alternatives are, then why would you support layering? What facts are you basing that support on? Intuition?
---
I played on Nostalrius launch. It had no dynamic spawns or layering. Since it was a single server, it had more players starting new characters than the WoW servers will have. The starting experience is nearly identical to what Classic will have - five minute respawns, etc.
---
It was fine. Yes, it was nearly impossible to kill anything in the Valley of Trials at first. I was playing a Warrior, so I had a serious disadvantage with mob tagging.
---
I could have fought for mobs and made some progress but instead I took a break for 2-3 hours. When I came back, a lot of players had moved on and I was able to progress through the beginning quests. Sure, I skipped some stuff like Sarkoth. But was the game unplayable? Not at all. I hit 60 within a couple weeks. Never did I feel significantly hampered by the population. It was cool to be able to instantly find groups for dungeons and elite quests though.
---
People say we need layering because servers will lose 90% of their population and we'll all end up with ghost towns. I don't think this is logical either. Nostalrius almost doubled its population within the first few weeks, and never really lost that. If you launch servers at 5000 population (less than Nostalrius) and they settle down to 2500-3000 (classic server pops), is that really a problem?
---
So, based on that experience I feel there's no way to justify sharding or layering.
---
The problem we have is there is a majority of players who have invented these nightmare scenarios that just don't exist. And these people have convinced everyone else that the sky is falling. And no one has stopped to think whether that makes sense or not, or what evidence supports the fearmongering.
---
So even though it makes no logical sense that "the game will be unplayable for weeks without layering," people have so completely convinced themselves that this is true, they will viciously defend layering even if it's provably unnecessary.
---
What's really sad is that this is the same sort of group think that led to the "wall of no," the community berating players who asked for classic servers, etc.
---
Ever since Classic Beta came out, I haven't felt like touching BFA. I do my dailies, then log out then watch Twitch Streams of people playing Classic. I just want in and it makes me sad. I refresh the client every 5 minutes. I have dreams about it. I fear that I will just get burned out of caring by the time I get the Beta or it releases.
---
Really simple but effective tip: if you have no idea what you are doing at any moment, just grind mobs around your level until you know what you're doing.
---
Has anyone on F&amp;F gained access yet? I know a few more beta invite waves have gone out since the initial wave.
---
Hey I just wanted to hop down in here to tell you that you really don't come off like a well adjusted or reasonable person in this exchange. Chill the fuck out man, you can have opinions but you don't need to be acting like this. You can be better.
---
Okay I‚Äôm going to say this one more time.  Do you really think I called him toxic and he should have been banned, for the sole reason that he has a different opinion than me, yes or no.
---
 Nice job
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?spell=19567](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=19567) 
---
yep
---
Nice, the three class I wanna play are gonna be the least.
---
First one is going to be a Female Dwarf Paladin, Night Elf Druid, and a Female Orc or Troll Shaman.
---
This is literarily the ideal situation - that almost never happens. There were very, VERY few times I was beat by rogues as a paladin. And the most memorable time was by one with thunder fury... we simply can mitigate all of your damage with bubble, BoP, LoH and high armor/shield. (Not to mention perception as a human).
---
Smart rogues in vanilla avoided paladins in 1v1.
---
This is the best. Can you make a 3840x2160 of this naked image?
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get the hate. I‚Äôve watched a ton of esfans videos since the beta and he‚Äôs genuinely fun to watch play. He loves every second of this, he knows his shit, he interacts with people and isn‚Äôt toxic trash like some of the streamers I‚Äôve seen.
---
also, dont feel pressured to level really fast and to be most effective with everything you do. enjoying the ride is what makes this game special
---
Honestly I was a day 1 Vanilla player and raided pretty seriously up to AQ and played A LOT.
---
I don't remember much. I remember the broadstrokes but dungeon boss details? Not much.
---
Just remind yourself they shoved the release date to three and half months away. That should put a bad taste in your mouth, and get you off the topic for awhile.
---
You‚Äôll pick it up as you go. The journey from 1-60 takes *a long time*. Like... 5 days /played if you‚Äôre a master, probably closer to 10-15 if you‚Äôre not.
---
The only tips I can give are to give the game a little while to sink it‚Äôs teeth in. The mmorpg experience is top notch, but the game really opens up at around 15-20, which can be done in a couple no-life days. 
---
Some people will tell you to skip dungeons because the xp per hour isn‚Äôt as good as repeatedly killing boars, or following a quest guide. However, as a noob, dungeons are the best way to learn how your class works, and how to perform in a team. I‚Äôd recommend doing every dungeon at least once just to experience the content and get better.
---
Sounds like most guilds in WoW at any time, just not a "vanilla" thing. 
---
Circlejerk is strong.
---
I can recreate it in that exact spot by the way, so cleary a bug at least
---
We do not know but I would assume Blizzard will give us details and a time PST add however many hours difference Louisiana is and get ya fuggin names
---
I'm glad someone else saw it too. I only ever noticed it at this specific spot. Figured the server was just freaking out.
---
You're totally right. I think I'm compounding my hope for classic to be successful with guilds overall as well.
---
Imagine they do and people enjoy the game even more and everyone quits BFA
---
You are assuming a lot about people you don't know, because it isn't your definition of fun.
---
I agree with you, but I also agree that a strongly worded post like OP is necessary to counter the very strong minmaxer vibe in this sub. I am genuinely worried that a lot of new people to the game don't realize that leveling in vanilla is awesome for those who like exploring, questing, and building a story for their character, and that there will be plenty of other people along the way to have fun leveling with. Because the critical mass of advice in this sub is basically telling people which race/class is the best and what the quickest way to get to 60 is.
---
Seems like a bug with the layering. Lower your pitchforks people
---
\*Suge Knight casts Blood Boil\*
---
Classic WoW Fan - ohhh I wanna play classic because of social interaction!
---
Motherfucker - this guy is trying to socially interact on a....FORUM. Stop being a toxic piece of shit. He clicked it from R/all and asked a question. It's not hard to be a socialpath and answer a fucking question you basement dwelling, inflatable doll humping, thermal greasing neckbeard.
---
are you currently subbed?
---
it was never a pet class to begin with. Elemental was a big dps cd essentially and was taken from warcraft 3 archmages. I miss it it being a big DPS button vs the passive dmg it is on retail.
---
Ok
---
I disagree with you wholeheartedly. The reason this has been successful isn‚Äôt because of people calling people troglodytes on a forum lol
---
[Damn Activision.](https://i.imgur.com/9L6PgKY.png)
---
Yes, yes, anyone who has a moral compass is "mad", there there.
---
Technically an invite-only beta can't really be considered "official" with regards to retail because you can't really buy it.
---
I‚Äôm just playing my wotlk private server. It‚Äôs super boring but I have nothing else to do.
---
i've had access since yesterday and just got the email 10 minutes ago, check the client, don't wait for an email to show up
---
I thought layering was disabled in this beta and was only going to be enabled during the stress tests? 
---
Also it's interesting he even got phased because it doesn't really seem like they've invited that many people in that would force phasing on a person. 
---
If Blizzard wants to eliminate this from happening while still keeping their layering system temporarily, they should just have the player be assigned a layer when they login so they can never be forcefully phased while playing. 
---
I'd have it setup like this, E.g Layer 1 supports 3k players but has a buffer to 3.5k-4k.
---
If a player logs in and Layer 1 already has 3k players, it puts them into Layer 2 instead. The buffer aspect exists for people that get changed layers due to group invites, so a player in Layer 2 gets invited to a group that's on layer 1 which has exceeded 3k players, but so long as it doesn't exceed the extra buffer (3.5k-4k) it won't phase anyone out of layer 1 due to the other player joining layer 1. 
---
Unless that buffer's limit got exceeded no one should get phased, and having the buffer in the first place should technically drastically reduce the amount it happens.
---
no, you just have issues dude. it‚Äôs really not that serious.
---
better than any single moment from BfA thus far
---
I can't wait to be THAT druid on my server
---
You should try to enjoy the 20-60 dungeons too. Just because they‚Äôre not max level doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not worthwhile, as far as enjoyment and upgrades go.
---
Honestly, most of the bitching about flying is due to the reduction in world PvP but you are 100% right. For me, I was never one for world PvP and it made farming far better. No need to have to slog
---
Memory is a funny thing. I have vivid memories of having to log in every day to use my cooldown, but clearly that must be false.
---
Reason to have it: Alliance don't have cannibalize so we need to be able to backpedal over the bodies of our enemies as the ultimate "frick you".
---
I am.
---
I know the feeling. Im selling all my toons old shit for gold on the AH to get some wow tokens lol.
---
Are you a pretend psychologist now?
---
I work 24/7 on call, so there's that I guess
---
Looks like a phishing scam
---
This is making me reconsider going druid. There isn't enough raid spots for these guys :D Shaman on the other hand...
---
Maybe you had two cds and it was like every other day or something?
---
&gt; It is a disgrace to exclude players that don‚Äòt have an active subscription honestly. I think the players who could help finding bugs and overall contribute to the beta the best dont‚Äòt have an active subscription at all. 
---
While it definitely limits the amount of potential feedback they could get from players who aren't currently subbed or haven't been for several reasons, it is not like the majority, no matter where they come from, will actually properly test Classic.
---
Only because you started playing on launch it doesn't mean you will know what is correct and what not. It's been 14 years since then, 12 since Vanilla ended, so your memories will never be 100% accurate. The most accurate data to campare to you will find is those in documented patchnotes and old 144p or 240p videos found on youtube and warcraftmovies.
---
You also aren't missing anything by not being able to play in the beta. In the end, outside of influencers, those who were invited into the Beta have legitimate interest in both versions, Retail and Classic.
---
You don't need classic to overtake retail wow to show that that is a possibility. There are mmos coming out in that fashion, but they're based on niche audiences for now. If classic even matches retail or has 50% of the player base, it'll be a success.
---
One thing people need to understand is that classic and retails audience are *completely* different. It's highly unlike that there will be a massive surge from retail to classic for the long run. There will be a spike but then it'll shift back.
---
Classic will bring back the old guard and the private server players. That's it. 
---
This dream of retailing dying and classic becoming the new game is such a pointless pipe dream, its laughable tbh. It's like listening to kids going "yeah but what if!" And talking about completely hypothetical scenarios that you know won't happen but jerk over for no reason. There's no grounding in logic to it.
---
Fact Is, if retail was to die, it would affect classic too. Classic would suddenly become blizzards money maker and would receive constant changes which would fuck up this vision you guys have for it.
---
Your best bet is to have classic survive alongside Retail, and receive consistent funding without them having to radically change it to cater to multiple audiences.
---
No idea tbh. I haven't, and I guess a lot on the F&amp;F list will get added during the stress test.
---
It would be so fucking magical if I could get in for the weekend. Please Blizz notice me
---
I absolutely would. I like living as a noob, vicariously through others experiences.
---
Yep as long as you each use the drop down for a different World of warcraft you can each be logged into the same battle.net account on 2 different computers. It's the same way multiboxers do it just 2 different computers.
---
There are some sneaky jumps that backpedalling is the perfect speed/distance for though
---
Right. I‚Äôm rocking back and forth in my chair just watching and waiting for the invite.
---
Just checked my account settings and still nothing. 
---
Subbed.

Do you need me to be? Do you need help? Show me on the doll where it happened.
---
I also dinged my first 60 in Winterspring, but by killing Brumeran (I think that was it's name?)
---
That is exactly what is going to happen
---
Still playing BfA myself, and it's not like that at all. Sometimes people will ignore you, but if you say hi most people reply. It's just the nature of M+ that you don't really have time to type. In raids, there are still people just joking around between pulls.
---
Closed beta at that.
---
Im gonna make a gnome rogue and a female night elf hunter to gank all the pvp kids that rolled horde for the pvp racials.
---
... my laptop is worse than a potato
---
Holy crap in glad someone else caught that qoute about the shot. I almost fell out of my chair anime style when I heard that one. It physically hurt me.
---
Ahh, got a good chuckle out of this. I gotta go watch that now.
---
I'm pretty sure I'm going Alliance this time around. I want to play Druid, but I just refuse to play cows. I just don't like them. New experience for me.
---
I'll miss Trolls and Undead for sure. Gonna feel weird having to kill them.
---
No prob!
---
I mean many retail MDI streams are very popular, PvP ones as well.
---
I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with you, but BFA does have relatively common large streams.
---
See you in STVietnam
---
I hit 11 back in the day with about 25 hours a week.
---
Shagu already said he's not making pfUI for classic....like a while ago.  Has that changed?
---
There's a dedicated weekly thread for these. You can access them on the side panel.
---
Good to know. I guess that doesn't surprise me. And we know the WA dev has beta, so that's nice.
---
Lmao yeah everything sucks but new Diablo season just started so that's nice
---
Like they were saying after that, it's basically an unavoidable problem. In the era we live in nowadays every server is going to have streamers on it so there's really no way to get away from "streamer servers".
---
&gt;  it‚Äôs really not that serious. 
---
What serious? Where did I say that anything about this is serious? If you just want to read into things that were never said, repeatedly, do I even need to be here? Can you just fuck off back to whatever shithole you live in and argue with yourself? lmao
---
All those hours playing bgs?
---
That's changes
---
Apologies! I'll repost it there!
---
Just play whatever class you want and dont speedlevel. And lvl up either herb ore miningbas you go
---
Christ, dude, grow up.
---
Hi, /u/Emerald_Theodicy
---
So much for no changes
---
I will rim him, I win
---
This guy is going to bring so many trash ret paladins to classic wow.

I agree on the server part, glad im EU.
---
or will you lol. stealth and shadowmeld

Lmao but sunwuko IS SO FACEROLL AND FUNNN U CANT DENY THE FIRE BELL

You may wish to wait until next Monday for the next thread implementation, for the record. More visibility with fewer listings.

Thank you :)

Not gonna lie I read Drug Inspired Battlestation.
---
Yep
---
Oh no, I'm not talking about actual merit. They're well known for being good in pvp nowadays (heck I'm going to main one) but back then I thought general consensus for most of vanilla was that they were straight up unusable even after the buffs.
---
I thought it was just an old meme. Maybe it had more meaning than I thought

Those that got one, what is your account age?

What movie was this?
---
It sure did! Got in. Subbed since Feb, 2005.
---
didn't beta invite requirement said either active subscription or active gametime?
---
has anyone got beta invite with no active sub but has remaining gametime on current WoW?
---
Go to Allcraft stream on Twitch (you may have to wait until to replay it). They were discussing how the community feels about being on a server with them. Their basic response was ‚Äúevery server will be a streamer server.‚Äù Was an interesting convo. Asmongold and the bigger (I think?) streamers are in the discussion.
---
im a paladin, rushing is physically impossible :D

*enemy lvl 60 rogue joined the zone*

---
yeah, exactly. i can't remember what i was like back in the day, but i'm sure i wasn't a perfect little daisy either. if he was still like this, sure, hate on him, but either due to his twitch stream or just growing the fuck up, he can't do this anymore without getting raked across the coals.
---
useless without authenticator
---
WORLD FIRST RAGNAROS DOWN.
---
Game is boring. Nothing to do.
---
&gt; and look stuff up as you come across them
---
Look stuff up only when you can't figure it out.  Go be a part of the world.  Do stuff.  Get lost.  Get killed. Have a good time.
---
Right!? Perfect videos.
---
Coming from priest and rogue, you will lose all will to play WoW if you start a paladin.
---
Layering is just phasing, off topic sort of, I know.
---
It really pisses me off that people are *actually fucking falling for this* shit. It's just a different word for phasing. It literally does the same thing, but in a slightly different way.
---
A lot of the private server play different from even other private servers. In some cases massively. So I can't see the beta being so different that it throws hardcore players off too much.
---
You're right, I'm over reacting.
---
I was playing with cosmo a week or 3 after release... yes they did
---
So, sharding.
---
I got an email too! Except mine was about Hearthstone &gt;.&gt;
---
I played Alliance in 2006 WoW, then i switched to Horde in Nostalrius and now i am going back to the Alliance.
---
I really dislike Orgrimmar over Ironforge. I prefer the circular design of Ironforge and dislike the 2 layer thing that's going on with Orgrimmar. Ironforge has the awesome central forge area with vibrant fiery red colors contrasting with otherwise quite dark brown/grey city. Orgrimmar is just too orange for my tastes.
---
When it comes to races, most of the gear looks wonky on Horde characters due to their poor posture.
---
Well dang.
---
I'm not defending it, but I just realised that due to layering, if you ask someone to invite a friend let's say, and that friend isn't on the layer, the party leader might not be able to /who to find them. The request thing might be necessary to pull someone from another layer into your group if you aren't the party leader.
---
lmao, pretty much. i'm sure everyone did something like this at one point or another back when they were in their teens.
---
And now you‚Äôre under Mind Control!
---
Nothing for me =(
---
Depends on, hay you do. For tanks for example, back pedal is actually really useful.
---
This kind of thing happened all the time in Classic WoW. Being at the wrong place at the wrong time then, respawns.
---
&gt; it's beta
---
Don't you dare fucking start that shit.
---
Yeah, for me old wow felt like a DnD campaign. Retail wow feels like a slot machine.
---
I just realised that due to layering, if you ask your party leader to invite a friend and that friend isn't on the same layer, the party leader might not be able to /who to find and invite them. The request thing might be necessary to pull someone from another layer into your group if you aren't the party leader.
---
I'm confused as to why the rogue was considered friendly and not attackable at the start?
---
Hi, /u/alottabit
---
8gb ram? hardly a potato
---
Hey guys, I don‚Äôt post much, but I wanted to let you know to check your emails.. I got this email @ 6pm pst..
---
Some quick info:
---
- been subbed since launch
---
- did 3 other betas for WoW (TBC, WotLK, WoD)
---
Hope you guys get lucky like me!!!
---
I‚Äôve never watched Esfand but have seen some of his clips on the subreddit, he seems very wholesome.
---
Damn how‚Äôs it feel :(
---
I just got a PC for the first time in 10+ years and DOTA 2 is my shit while I wait for Classic. It's still super familiar, even to someone who's last played MOBA was Heroes of Newerth
---
Done! [https://i.imgur.com/ukOk2MU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ukOk2MU.jpg)
---
The launch is based off 1.12 patch. 16 debuff slots was released at 1.7
---
Lol it actually looks more like Vanilla now, compared to the streamers with Ultra High shadows. Do I play on my laptop with integrated graphics for the authentic vanilla experience? Think so.
---
I played in Vanilla, from watching all the streams, I agree. I am recalling from just memory, but I would bet $ on the game being way easier than true Vanilla. I'm 95% certain, and it's not just by a little bit either, this version is completely nerfed. Watching defcamp now and he has leveled 1-20 literally without drinking once and has full mana nearly the entire time. He didn't even spec into spirit tap because the regen is so bonkers. The mobs are so weak, and they are not dangerous. Watching a level 17 tank WC with no problems, getting hit by 3-4 elites there and they do literally nothing to him. Game is going to be a faceroll.
---
[A little under half] (https://imgur.com/a/u9DuoIR) by my count, though what constitutes a different race is obviously open to interpretation.
---
Regardless, I agree, the majority of those present in the original image don't match Vanilla/Classic.
---
Asmongold had more viewers than Ninja.
---
Not gunna lie, I‚Äôm hyped!
---
Epic mounts are not free, especially since you'll get your epic charger once dire maul is released which is in phase 2 iirc.
---
Worse than leveling a priest? For real?
---
Aw damn :(( .. What a tease!!!!
---
destro locks can do a lot of dps towards the end of the game, they start off pretty bad though and mages are generally way higher dps because warlocks have no threat drop and if they crit multiple times in a row they pull aggro, so sometimes if they are high on dps metres they are doing it wrong. they are really fun in pvp though.
---
spriests are great in pvp but conversely really bad in pve. they go oom quickly, have high threat, and as such only 1 might be brought to a raid only to provide shadow weaving debuff to increase warlock's dps.
---
enhance shamans might be fun but they are in no way viable in pve, nor are they particularly good in pvp. ele has way better burst and more utility than enhance since they can heal as well.
---
paladins, mages and warriors are pretty nutty though i gotta say.
---
DotA‚Äôs literal crack.  I‚Äôm about 8 months clean, can‚Äôt wait for the year mark.
---
It's a really good feeling after a successful dungeon run.
---
Apparently blizzards decision to remaster the game rather than port a buggy version of the base vanilla game is my fault üëåüèª
---
Must be addicted to the yoga pants or soemthing. Only reason someone who go to the gym that much haha. Your poor baby.
---
From a source of content that someone in Reddit can provide me, yes
---
you were in a casual guild
---
my guild that went through mc, ony, bwl, zg, aq and naxx definitely cared about meters, consumables and gear
---
I mean, what do you want to know about pallys? The leveling isn't as bad as people make it sound, but it definitely isn't quick. One thing to note is that you're epic mount will still cost 400-500g and you will have to wait until Dire Maul drops before the quest is available. That won't happen for 3 months after release.
---
I did that and never found Kranal Fiss . Now I don‚Äôt do that anymore
---
You still have to do a pretty long quest for it so its not exactly free
---
For M+ and raiding above normal you still have to put together groups like that. Only the most casual of content doesn't require manual group formation. The main difference between the versions is that vanilla wow had no "not difficult" content, whereas live wow has a spectrum of difficulty in it's content, and "retail haters" can't be bothered to actually try the hard stuff. When people knock retail saying that raid/dungeon finder "ruined" the game, it's usually because they weren't playing the difficult content. 
---
All that being said, I can't wait to play the version of the game where the world was dangerous and I was a nobody in it.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/DifficultProtectivePlumPhilosoraptor Defcamp is clearing his way up a tower when he gets phased (Layered?) and it results in his death.
---
Well, I'm basing it on the fact that almost everyone enjoyed leveling in vanilla. If someone was rushing/had rushed to 60 that was a notable thing to talk about. I understand that it has been years and a lot of people have leveled multiple times on pservers but... I don't think it's right to make noobs think that leveling is a chore in Classic like it is in Retail. Let them decide for themselves.
---
I‚Äôm trying to step back and only jump on this sub a couple times a day. I‚Äôve been like a hawk on this sub for the last week and it can‚Äôt be healthy.....
---
Dec 11th 2004
---
Where can I check account creation date?
---
Is that for all servers? I thought it was only PvP servers, but I only started in BC so idk if this was more strict in vanilla
---
They are annoyed because they cannot do anything about it except not play.
---
I'm so excited for classic
---
I would consider my 7 year old, sub $350 when new laptop with integrated graphics definitely a potato. 8gb of ram or not.
---
I can remove a 4gb stick if you want to see if it effects it or not.
---
Not that much, tbh. That's why I'm asking. I know there's a quest chain, but it's still cheaper, right? It's still easier than leveling a priest, no?
---
This just made my day, god that was funny.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean anything lol. Fortnite had at one point 250 million players. Wow is expected to get 6-12 million.
---
also interested
---
He was in Durotar which is safe for horde players unless they choose to attack Alliance.
---
Paladin is the worst leveling experience out of all the classes. You literally just swing your 2 hander for 59 levels. Maybe press one or two damaging abilities, and heal yourself between pulls. Thats it. Literally it. Watch Esfands stream, and pretend there's no one talking or being interesting. You will see how fun it seems.
---
Working my ass off, finishing up college, smoking that good kush, and I live in Vegas so the night life always gets in the way üòÇ
---
The best thing the large streamers could do is coordinate together and play on the same server.
---
That's what this is. Integrated graphics and all!
---
Incorrect
---
I have like six of these on my retail account because it converted every single one that was in my bags when they added to pet journal to an entry in the pet journal
---
I was really surprised to get an invite. My account had literally just expired in the last few days, so I thought that would disqualify me. The only other WoW beta I participated in was the original one. I've been subscribed on and off since launch, the only expansion I didn't play during was WoD.
---
Ouch. That seems pretty bad. Thanks for the input!
---
You clearly know nothing about modern wow and how plenty of people still have social interactions in dungeons, and how nothing about the game's design deters it.
---
And I never said or implied it was in anyway what so ever. Why can‚Äôt you accept some people don‚Äôt share your sense if fun, how is a bunch of kids really wanting to get to 60 as fast as possible weird and out their?
---
So happy for you! I hate you so much though. Enjoy
---
That was my first thought when I saw him the other day! "Holy shit he looks he would be Ron Jeremy's kid"
---
I'm so confused.
---
Is there any particular reason that should seem incredulous? Excepting a two-week stint back in October when my ex convinced me to try out BfA I haven't played since '09, shortly before Wrath dropped.
---
I'd imagine the same is true for a lot of folks here. The game changed and we lost interest, and *that* didn't change until the Classic announcement.
---
You have to decide what you want to get out of it, and if it is fun to do that.  That's really all it comes down to.
---
That‚Äôs awesome my dude, I‚Äôm stoked for you!! Happy Friday!! Haha
---
If you have an old account or an account with a lot of money spent subscription/cosmetics, sub and opt in.
---
There was an interview where they stated they'd use new names. I'll see if I can find the link.
---
Never played wow before but just subbed recently this shit lit! Can‚Äôt wait for classic:)
---
Zero speed increases. Zero ranged abilities. Everyone expects you to buff them. Fuck pallys.
---
They aren't the same, because they are different servers.  You can have the same name on every single server if you manage to get it.
---
Yeah, but I assumed by "elitist idiots" you are also referring to people back in the day who argued against EZ epix, too much class balancing, and stuff like that.
---
and sharding is neither of those xDd
---
Frostadamas, Madseason.
---
Who's saying that?
---
I watched the entire panel. Night was never once mentioned.
---
feelsbadman :( wanna share the rng with me bruh? haha
---
If the mage wants nightfall effect he needs to use nightfall himself, why should a 2 hand dpser be required to sacrifice their own dps by using nightfall to benefit the mage?
---
 Why should the mages ignite be more important then a warriors ability to use their MS?
---
The only possible argument is that raw dps is somehow the end all be all.  This is based on the assumption that min maxing dps is somehow intrinsically better then every other modality and we have already discussed counter examples disproving this assumption.
---
The healing drake from bwl is a good example (Kazzak is another one but he is a joke in 1.12)
---
just think of it as being a set number of different servers designated to be merged at a later date that share a name pool, except you can still play with your friends
---
if it works how they say it does it's honestly as good as we could have hoped for, now please just tell me they have a faction balance system in place somewhere, though they likely don't give a shit based on the inclusion of cross realm BGs
---
I say it a lot but I am torn.
---
I know they rely on viewers for income but Im sure they just want to be left alone to play like the rest of us.
---
On the flip side it is terrible to find that you grind something out but a streamer was given it by many of their followers for free.  They will get their mounts first via in game fanbase and any boe epic that they want will easily be bought.  
---
When we do our best to avoid them it really isnt (in most cases) because of them directly, but the people who always need to be near them.  They shouldn‚Äôt feel slighted
---
[https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=422](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=422)
---
It will be up to players to research the servers and put the information out there for others to find.
---
I certainly want to avoid the bigger streamers, will totally ruin whatever server they land on for everyone else.
---
It wont be, but I will change that. I will make sure it will be introduced at one point or another. Mark my words.
---
The world for yourself for maybe two seconds before 100 other people log in.
---
FUCK you're right
---
Well phasing is when the zone changes based on quest progression.  Sooo I think you‚Äôre the one in the wrong here mate...awkward
---
Me Gusta Esfand Me Gusta..
---
What do you mean "shoved in your face"? It's not like anyone is trying to convert you or even argue any point. It's literally just a joke about how MAGA could also stand for "Make Azeroth Great Again", but you're acting like he's making some divisive stand on a controversial topic like racism or abortion. Nobody was getting triggered over politics until you brought it up. If you hadn't said anything in the first place, the issue would be non-existant.
---
They've been asked the same question a million times at this point and their answer is 100% true. They can't really do shit about it. Get the fuck over it. They don't/won't typically enjoy having a million tards following them around tagging their mobs, or trying to gank them. 
---
They will coordinate among themselves as best they can to space out and balance the servers. Many have already talked about this, and will be playing on opposing factions. I for one am very excited for what this will mean for world pvp. 
---
This was never going to be the exact same experience as vanilla wow.
---
I tried retail before BFA and was lost. Was Legion a good expansion?
---
I had no clue what the fuck I was doing and talk about my entire screen just being populated with, ‚Äúhey, you need to do this and this and this and this.‚Äù
---
&gt;will be more successful than people thought. 
---
That's the real magic of Vanilla WoW... I'm mad u got an invite (still waiting........) but happy you enjoyed it
---
This, and the fact that he mentioned arrows guiding us to quests, was the final straw. Unsubbed, what a disgrace :/
---
An 8-4 job, girlfriend, girlfriend's 9 year old daughter, far too much yardwork and household chores, an elderly blind dog, two cats who absolutely need to jump on my hands AS SOON AS I SIT DOWN, and taking my GF to her many doctor appointments.
---
I hope to be level 60 sometime before PCs are replaced with a Matrix-like structure.
---
This would be a good area for a blue post confirming the behaviour. If Blizz said this is how it was, then all good.
---
I can accept that other people have a different sense of fun. I think superhero movies are garbage but I don't care that other people like them. Same for action games like God of War and Assassin's Creed. I don't get it, but I don't have to get it - other people enjoy them, so whatever.
---
I could accept that your friends prefer rushing to 60, if they had any experience with the game. If you already leveled before, you have the experience to know if you liked it or not. But you said they are new to the game. That means they don't know if they're gonna like it or not. So logic dictates that they cannot have an opinion on it one way or the other. That means they have received their view of leveling from elsewhere, probably you.
---
Death and Taxes literally have videos of their healing officer clicking dude
---
I can't possibly agree with this anymore than I do.
---
If I understand the layering correctly you will still be able to /who people who are not on your layer. The whole realm is still connected, its just the continents being instanced to reduce stress
---
that part where he handed him all his money has to be the best fucking representation of all us desparados resubbing after years of being dormant lmfaooo
---
hell yea
---
Nope just the douchebags like that guy. No problems with the people you‚Äôre talking about, that‚Äôs me lol.
---
Not really, it‚Äôs simply an observation. Whether or not you want to get offended that‚Äôs up to you.
---
This is not going to happen as they're going to be split between PvP and PvE. Asmongold has already said he's going to be playing on a PvE server. Sodapoppin will be on PvP.
---
Your account name makes this post kind of hilarious.
---
I'm thinking they could be doing some load balancing testing (This is a beta after all). Doesn't have to exactly follow what they stated for retail.
---
No you ignored what I said, we were kids we tried to get to 60 as fast as we could, we looked up guides, one of us had the paper book even. We tried to get to 60 as fast as we could, idk ekes how to say that... we found it fun, I‚Äôve found that kind of thing fun to this day, and it seems like they have too.
---
Every post I read about this the sadder I get. I have a 2005 acc and still no invite. :(
---
I thought that was the crappy flying mount for people who didn't have flying in Wrath.
---
no sir ur mom eats it
---
Sloot is just instinctively an excellent player so will pick things up quickly.
---
If you keep saying it's not a chore as if you're trying to convince yourself, then I wonder where they would get such an idea.
---
Got any recent posts on this sub that bemoan the leveling process as a chore?
---
Funny how asmon doesnt differentiate between 10 viewer andys and 100k streamers to try to make a point that all servers are gonna be streamer server, then saying anyone who thinks otherwise is just hiding that they secretly hate streamers and that's where their criticism is coming from instead. A streamer with 10k snipers is going to take up an entire server on their own then kill it as soon as they leave. It's really shitty that they're just pretending like it's not going to be an issue at all, the least they could do is announce their realm beforehand so people know not to roll on them.
---
I applaud the effort, but you've made a number of errors there. As OP noted, insects and arachnids were in Vanilla, as were ice trolls and the Highborne (albeit only in the lore). However hobgoblins, magnataur, polar furbolgs, makrura, tuskarr and blood elves weren't.
---
Subbed since 2005. No invite. Feels bad
---
Oh okay thanks for letting me know
---
So Aug 27th will you still call it retail?
---
why do we need to know ur at work tho
---
I have 3 friends who haven't played WoW since cataclysm that are stoked for Classic. 
---
2 of which are married, one of those 2 have multiple kids, the third works full time supporting his mother and step father.  
---
The whole "I have a life, I can't play classic wow" is a false dichotomy.
---
Still, in the era of streaming there will always be a top dog streamer no matter what server you're on. Maybe not Asmongold big but you can't avoid it.
---
"You're so bad you need engineering to win!"
---
So you are an ot that tanks In half dps gear?
---
I will assume you are ‚Äúoff off tanking‚Äù which is not what we were talking about.
---
Even if this were the case, LH helm has exactly zero Stam on it.
---
This means not only are you advocating for people to spec in such a way as to better accommodate YOU, you are at the same time not doing everything within YOUR power to do your roll correctly and support them(namely at the least wearing gear with stam on it to tank) or did I miss something?
---
Everyone look out we have a badass over here.
---
&gt; People spend their time in game to earn things and to be dishonest and steal from them makes you a bad person. The fact that it's a game does not matter.
---
Hell yes.
---
I like him, what's wrong with him?
---
He's a skinny balding nerd who is a complete fucking slob with terrible hygeine, but he somehow is banging a 10/10 juiccy gf making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year playing WoW. If that isn't winning, I don't know what is.
---
Priests are pretty easy to level as soon as you get a wand. You never have downtime. Most  leveling tier lists would look something like:
---
1: Mage (aoe grinding), hunter, warlock
---
2: Feral druid, priest, 
---
3: Rogue, sham, pally 
---
4: Warrior
---
I just figured I'd mention the delay in the Dire Maul patch because it means that you'll have to wait 3-4 months to even start the mount quest. That obviously isn't an issue depending on leveling speed/how much you play.
---
I would give real money if Blizz would have "no streaming allowed servers", Seriously I would pay extra a month for that option.  I really don't want to have to deal with these yahoos or their sycophantic followers.
---
Lol...
---
BFA problem was the game sucked. You don't overhaul the game once it's in beta. They are even saying it's a bug and they're working on it (the phasing atm). Exactly the point of the beta, to find and fix bugs.
---
i have for the last few years drifted back and forth between eve online and wow. right now i'm on about a year and a half of being hardcore active in eve, and i'm starting to feel the slow down. i'm hoping that i'll be able to keep interested until wowc drops because if not i have no idea wtf i'm gonna do with myself until it does. i cannot even put into words how stoked i am for classic.
---
I might be wrong but I read this with a slightly sassy tinge and I loved it haha
---
Vanilla wow had communities. You played with real life friends or made ingame friends that you rolled with. That created a sense of adventure and memories. Some retail players still have that but it became all too easy to lfg and pug with randoms you'll never see again. 
---
You also felt every bit of progression. Getting new skills meant something, getting upgrades while leveling meant something. Now that's irrelevant. It takes 20hrs to max level each expansion and you're geared enough for mythic dungeons a few hours later. Constantly replacing gear so it never has real meaning.
---
I think these hooks will keep a lot of people interested in the game.
---
Not a bug, just zoned based phasing that exists on pservers as well.
---
There's a specific spot in duskwood town where you run up the hill with spiders.
---
&gt;They were inconsistent in 1.12, and we‚Äôve reproduced the exact inconsistency they had back then.
---
Nice.
---
Like Beta in WoD and BfA LULW
---
Iv been watching Sodapoppin and from what he has said about the plans is for most streamers to go on the same server and try get them all to ban all server names in chat to make it harder (not impossible) for groups to find and follow them.   
---
It will soon spread on here what servers streamers have turned cancerous and what servers are safe.
---
Thanks for that punchline had a good chuckle
---
GOT AN EMAIL!
---
fucking hearthstone.....
---
GOT ANOTHER EMAIL!!! OMG
---
NEW SEASON OF D3 GUYS!
---
sigh
---
Im just ready for people to start bitching. Popcorn anyone? But also I wonder how many people were reporting for them to actually have to say this, which is sad
---
I'd say spending 60 hours per week playing a video game is quite the opposite of badass.
---
Found this while i was looking for the same and then found he uploaded a set with no emblems here: [https://barrens.chat/images/wallpapers/screens.zip](https://barrens.chat/images/wallpapers/screens.zip)
---
str/ap is worth more as dual wield since it applies %100 to mh and 50-62.5% to oh
---
Taylor Swift?? What kind of weeb ... Taylor Swift???
---
Challenge accepted
---
 [https://itemization.info/](https://itemization.info/)
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know that. Well still, better than none of it going to the streamer. In any case some don‚Äôt pay for cable and choose to pay streamers. No harm no foul.
---
Sure, here's water that's always behind the curve even when you get a new rank.
---
Hell. You get the 161 mana water over 15s long after you're sporting 700-800 mana.
---
Link where they very clearly stated that?
---
I‚Äôm not entirely convinced. I saw some people say they got in this morning but no proof that they didn‚Äôt actually get in last night but not see till this morning.
---
Also saw a post about a wave an hour or so ago but I‚Äôm 99% sure that was the emails for last nights wave.
---
Get out of here with your logic and reasoning!
---
College. Thankfully, this coming semester I only have Tuesday/Thursday classes but it's still gonna be a pain
---
Orc is superior
---
Tauren is sexier
---
Troll is actually pretty amazing too
---
This happened back in vanilla/TBC too, for example with Kungen and his thousands of followers in &lt;Nihilum fanclub&gt;. Grim, Vurtne, Drakedog, any big WCM name would have people flocking to their servers, and the biggest guilds attracted tons of people too.
---
He streamed it for me to show me he had access. Basically rubbed it in my face since he knows how badly I wanted to get in.
---
classic/vanilla takes a long ass time to level, better play something you like not just for a free mount.
---
Pally most viable spec is healing
---
Or just walk instead of run.
---
Any chance you could test it out and report the results?
---
WoW was designed to be easily accessible to newcomers of the MMO genre at the time. It was intentionally designed so you could never make irrevocable mistakes, and you can never lose progress in the game like you could in say EQ or FFXI. As such, as long as you keep at it, you will get to your goal in time - the game is very simple to pick up, though requires patience to reach goals.
---
As long as you do not have preconceptions about what MMOs should be based on modern MMOs, you can always find a fun time in Classic WoW. :)
---
&gt; Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth.
---
fucking lol
---
Really? Wow I never knew priests were that high up on the tier list. I figured a lot of people struggled with healers even with wands. Interesting. Thanks!
---
Try it, if you like it keep playing, if you don't stop. It's all person preference
---
yes
---
But I like healing?
---
Something of these are actually surprising. Standing on top of other players while facing away allows spells and attacks to be used. This literally makes no sense because the whole point of them NOT using the real 1.12 client was because it was full of exploits and bugs. This is just a stupid bug that shouldn't be there. Also the tauren hitbox one is surprising
---
The best thing the large streamers of world of warcraft classic could do is coordinate together with other world of warcraft classic streamers and play on the same server of the server type that they want to play on when world of warcraft classic officially releases for the public to play this summer
---
just twiddling my thumbs while restarting my launcher all day. SEND HALP!
---
SERIOUSLY THO.... My friends want to roll for Alliance but my heart is for Horde. I'm so conflicted and the classes, I can't even start to pick. I feel like I have to do Hunter/Mage as I've always mained those but I want to try other things too and know what it's like... I'm lost haha
---
Well that contradicts your original statement that the other guy was referring to:
---
"I have friends who‚Äôve never played vanilla and want to rush to 60"
---
It's all about framing data to be easier to apply. If someone looks at this poll &amp; wants to know what's in demand for dungeons, they only have to worry about their faction. 
---
The way this data's presented, mages are 15% and paladins are 8%. First glance you'd expect the alliance has 2 mages per paladin, but that would be inaccurate. Combining paladin+shaman has its own flaws, but it mitigates that flaw.
---
I am genuinely curious on on how much more requests got their authentication server for the last few days with every one closing/restarting the launcher.
---
classic is the BEST time to get into wow
---
Or Swifty crashing servers so often when he was top dog that he got banned.
---
Some are interesting, others I'm wondering why the hell so many people reported as a bug.
---
Just stating what it's meant to be without taking into context previous trainwrecks of expansion betas. The classic team seems really focused on their jobs, and after all, BFA and wod betas were soley meant for testing not requests for content. That's sorta why both came out without crap for content (and forever for WoD). Still shitty how they still ended up with a shit ton of bugs out the gate anyways. I have hope that this team knows what they are doing and try to give em the benifit of the doubt. See you in August!
---
great!  it could be a good choice for you, do some research to make sure you like the playstyle.
---
also W OMEGALUL D
---
The leveling experience is gonna be a long one for everybody, and yeah, warriors are the slowest. You need a lot of patience and I suspect a lot of people will give up by level 30 as they did in vanilla. 
---
That being said, the class is god mode at 60. If you put in the time, you will be rewarded.
---
Minor Graphical Bug:  At the exit stairs from the initial spawn point for new Undead characters, there is a point at which you become invisible.  Need to check to see if it's unique to this point, or if it happens at any transition between above ground and below.
---
Yep, it's a hell of a lot more like this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06NlJMuKpfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06NlJMuKpfY)
---
Private servers probably
---
where are you from
---
Lmao. You can tell who the new players are by the sort of things that are getting reported.
---
Same
---
Feels bad  :((
---
Because they're coming from BFA lol
---
They could use a stream delay.
---
I‚Äôll give you the rest of mine!! Haha
---
That's good to hear in a way. Prehaps I'll try to find a healer as a leveling buddy then.
---
So I can rock a brown hair gnome named Frodo and /walk to burning steppes? Got it
---
The tauren one makes sense because I think the original philosophy was that every race was very different from the others. 
---
Slowly over time though that design changed and the racial differences were more and more minor.
---
Oh well that‚Äôs true, a few joined in later and I got caught up in the argument. But I never remember at time where any of us cared about taking our time, we wanted to be cap lvl to complete, if anything I went the slowest because sometimes I wanted to read the quest text.
---
Bodybuilding... looks like im in for a LONG ‚Äúbulk‚Äù season come august
---
I've been in a few vanilla raiding guilds and as a rule of thumb, if your gear isn't nonsensical, you show up on time and consistently, get buffs as often as the other core raiders, and don't cause raidwipes, then you'll only get called out for dps if it's really noticeably under par - like to the point where you're almost certainly just playing in a very wrong way.
---
Hey, Blizzard said that they‚Äôre not sending emails for beta, be VERY CAREFUL. If it‚Äôs not on your launcher already, it‚Äôs a scam.
---
"Don't play the way you want to, play the way I want you to"
---
hmmm
---
Super interesting to hear the tauren hitbox confirmation. I think it was fairly widely know or at least suspected, but I wasn't sure if it had ever been confirmed before now.
---
But people said they wanted vanilla as it was, without changes. Then Blizzard gives them as it was. Else people would then bitch about them fixing exploits and bugs because"slippery slope"
---
I don‚Äôt understand this one. If you‚Äôre standing directly on someone why wouldn‚Äôt you be able to cast abilities on them? It would be abusable if not because you can turn instantly with the mouse so someone could just stack on top of you and spin endlessly and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to attack them. Think rogue vs caster.
---
https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html this guy will show your transaction history
---
Not if only one is a streamer server.
---
I'm tempted to go night elf just for the wisp form... those corpse runs were no joke.
---
There was some kind of network occlusion that was zone based, the mobs did their own thing, but players would 'lag out' when changing zones and then appear further ahead.
---
I got to say you're wrong on this one. Well yes a casual guild is not going to care so much about DPS people even in pug 10 man's are asking you to link the achievement and item levels.
---
hell yeah. this is the rng I need. I feel the POWER. Kappa
---
they get 8% movement increase in ret tree for leveling
---
Meet people and be nice. Cooperate and build a solid friends lis for dungeons. I hope lfg is not in classic but didn't look into it much. If you get stuck, ask around. Help people out if they are lost of confused. I think community is the big thing people miss.
---
There weren't mouseover macros in vanilla. The new macro system bypasses a hard balance check rogues had.
---
I do.
---
Yeah.... that shit sucked
---
Also jumping into the lava I died a lot... idk if that's related or my internet at the time
---
Any healer buddy will make you a god team while leveling too. Conversely, you could go druid and have an easier leveling experience. If you commit to it then you should be fine tanking up until BWL.
---
They didnt say that. They send they arent sending keys. Stop spreading false info.
---
Pretty cool! Any way you can make the zones be ordered alphabetically? Think it would be easier to select that way, but otherwise, nicely done!
---
But is much harder to do, relatively.
---
The idea is that you missed a life lesson that any child learns growing up.  You are continuing to portray your lack or maturity with this post so I guess I was thinking I was addressing an adult who would understand.  My bad.  13 was a hard year for me too.
---
It makes me so happy to read stuff like this coming straight from Blizzard themselves.
---
I like this a lot. It'll settle some debates and hopefully adjust advice given out like sit-macros from our favorite pservers. Hope they keep updating this! It might be worth a link in the beta thread as well.
---
You're just cultivating mass lmao
---
Wars arent that bad. I levelled two during vanilla, one pvp focused, arms, the other to pve tank, though levelled it fury.
---
People talk it up, but if you get in a rhythm and cook lots of snacks its fine.
---
My pally was slower, for example. As was my priest until the 40s.
---
Wars with a decent 2hander can smash faces
---
I would if i was playing on NA servers, i don't feel its going to be as big an issue on EU servers.
---
The shitty part honestly is going to be figuring out the servers not to pick during name reservation, as well as in the early rush when you want to be rushing through
---
If you're lazy, level fishing and make your epic mount in a week while being lazy all day. If it's anything like private servers, I fish off Feralas coast without even moving and make decent hourly gold. Paladin is annoying to level to 60 imo. You'll never die. But you also rely on seal of command procs which don't come as often as you'd like.
---
Thanks! I'm a little nervous since the cosensus seems to be that holy priest is the only viable healing spec. I was a noob when vanilla came out. So pallies are still desirable for their buffs, at least?
---
Shit feral was the broken spec....
---
problem with spriest is that raids can really only bring 1 due to the debuff limit, and even if you are the 1 youll be low priority for loot due to locks/mages scaling way better than you. however problem with rogue is that there are 100 rogues fighting for a handful of raid spots. oh and as a spriest you will get pestered to heal, as with any hybrid. as a rogue youll only ever be asked to dps! personally i dont find spriests to be a fun pvp class, i mean sure you will melt
---
faces but you‚Äôre literally just standing still channeling mindlfay 90% of the time.... kind of a snooze fest imo. there is a class that seems to combine your pros from both classes... if you want a unique playstyle in pvp and a cool epic 60 class questline have you considered hunter? also bring a lot of cc and bow progression is sick
---
You basically go for improved wands and then go shadow from what I remember. Throw pain on and wand. You can mind flay until the mob gets to you later on and then wand 'em down. It isn't the most exciting thing in the world but it's consistent as hell. There aren't really set "healer" or "dps" roles when leveling. You do both.
---
Alliance warlocks have less fun in pvp dealing with WotF.
---
why is that? i was planing to play a paladin, is leveling a pally in classic hard? can you elaborate?
---
Same. Guess it's more random than we thought.
---
My bad, I saw a community manager post on the front page saying they are not sending out emails.
---
When the actual game launches they prolly will. Its all gonna be up to blizzard when it comes down to it.
---
Thanks! Yeah I remember healing pretty well whatever spec as a priest for dungeons. I was kinda doing both.
---
Feral druid.
---
 Oh well that‚Äôs true, a few joined in later in TBC/WotLK and I got caught up in the argument. But I never remember at time where any of us cared about taking our time, we wanted to be cap lvl to complete, if anything I went the slowest because sometimes I wanted to read the quest text. Thing the guy is also overstating how influential I am to my mates, I am not quite as magnanimous as he makes me out to be.
---
Wait....what about the mushrooms?
---
2 Rimmies over here bob!
---
Thanks for sharing this with us. A good reminder to slow down and enjoy the journey.
---
   I was wondering what the breakdown of class and race would be after seeing the results of my last survay. So I made a new one to see what races are being played with what classes.
---
https://marktatsu.typeform.com/to/e5DCP1
---
This is the problem. Maybe they are hitting too low, but you literally can‚Äôt know. You cannot accurately recall mob dmg from 15 years ago.
---
Not always.   
---
Liking tomatoes or not is subjective. If you like to eat shit, you have objectively terrible taste, and you're almost certainly retarded, just like the people who enjoy Asmongold's content.
---
I've somehow gotten to the point at which I only seem to be interested in gaming as a social activity. If it's not D:OS2 or Anthem with my brother and our friend I just can't seem to bring myself to care about a game. I've been stuck on the tutorial level of Styx: Master of Shadows for over two months now because every time I load in I tool around for 5 or 10 minutes, realize I don't actually want to play and turn it off.
---
Gaming used to be my primary hobby. It was what I spent virtually all my free time on. I don't even know what to do with myself if I'm not doing that.
---
I don't know how the hell I'm going to make it another three months.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
The interesting thing about vanilla WoW is that it has all types of content to appeal to all types of players. If you are competitive there is a world first ranking deal for you. PvP matches and the like.
---
If you are a more casual player that likes to go at your own pace. There is loads of lore and quests for you to do. Neither play style is superior. It's about whats fun to you. 
---
As someone who is a more casual player. It's funny that you make a comment like this assuming what all casuals think of competitive players.
---
I think the person you are trying to describe is just an all around dick. And has nothing to do with their chosen play style.
---
Praise be to jebus you're going to heaven!!
---
If you want to be a white knight for truth and justice, take it out into the real world where someone might care.
---
I never thought of this, but I think you have something there. I generally get in before my friends because I started day 1 and have done most raids/Ahead of the curve, it was either Legion or BFA beta I got in without even being subbed at the time. I'm not resubbing for a chance at classic though. When it comes i'll most likely give it a try if I my schedule changes.
---
Lies. I wont even check the talent tree, thats a lie 100%.
---
üÖ±Ô∏èLight‚Äôs üÖ±Ô∏èLope
---
this is not what its referring to
---
I usually call it "live" actually, but on August 27th the lines will definitely blur.
---
It‚Äôs legit, I‚Äôm online right now!
---
jesus this place got flooded with so many comments like this ever since streamers got beta lmao
---
What is it referring to?
---
No, you can only have pink or green hair.
---
It's so weird. I mean, between Vanilla and BFA was a huge world revamp that changed basically everything from named mobs over to levels and spawn rates. 
---
People who report things like that  with apparent comparisons to BFA spawn rates probably aren't the smartest people.
---
I love vanilla, and am excited to play. But my favorite times in wow were probably the.
---
So I hope that we will have the opportunity to play through it again in a year or two after vanilla re-releases 
---
But I do also love the idea of new level 60 content
---
&gt;On level up, the message: ‚ÄúYour skill in Protection increased to 15‚Äù was added in 1.12.1, and we‚Äôre intending to keep that.
---
/facepalm
---
I got an invite email tonight, almost exactly 24 hours after I had it available in the launcher. These might be from yesterday's wave.
---
The potential for twitch has existed for as long as little brothers have sat and enjoyed watching their big brother play pong. Brings a fucking tear to my eye.
---
"friend"
---
With the power of hindsight, it's now common knowledge that locks are really good later in the game (whereas everyone seems to constantly talk about how badly hunters fall off late game).
---
Since we have no idea what happens after naxx... It sounds advantageous to pick a class that will be great at the end; there might be only "end" for a long time.
---
isn't Rule 2 "Di't be unattractive?" Or maybe "Don't talk about Fight Club." (in all seriousness, which rule 2 are you referring to?)
---
Lots of people may play warlock, but not many will play WELL
---
What's the chapel there called? Light House? Lost Hope? Idk
---
Playing on them is actually not illegal. Running them is.
---
I would imagine that the stress tests and the servers over the next couple of weeks will have enough to test layering with more people on.
---
furthest thing from a low effort meme i've ever seen
---
How hard is it? Is the gear requirement pretty steep?
---
How do you navigate to this page?  The account history I'm finding online is showing back to 2010 only.  This link goes back to 2005, but stops at 2017, yet I was subbed a couple months ago.  The pages are different as well.  My guess is you use a different method to get to the page you linked.
---
I don't mind being patient and I have a decent amount of time, not quite no life levels but more than most. Its just the fact that many people called it frustrating thats making me be a bit wary of it. 
---
But as Relmar pointed out if I manage to get a healing buddy for the leveling it should be a lot smoother since recovery would be a lot easier.
---
ah, horde here; didnt happen be part of YOGS?
---
This isnt really a good sample size. 94,930 ppl in this sub. and the people that actually browse this sub regularly and answer these polls are very different from the average players. 
---
Warriors, rogues, mages and hunters will all be more prominent than warlocks imo
---
üé£ It's not any dumber than watching baseball on TV.
---
Don't get me wrong, I get where you are coming from. This sub makes it seem like it is the most hardcore game ever and you have to grind 12 hours a day to even get a sniff of Ragnaros's panties. It's all bullshit. The vast vast VAST majority of the classic playerbase when it was retail were casual AF. You will be fine, whether you start raiding a month in or 8 months in or a year and a half in. It will be fine.
---
Im sorry noob question but why is that? It seems really efficient to do at the right places but idk never played classic
---
Can apply the same logic to watching people play sports, or anything else that isn't some show
---
BFA also improved after beta. Sure it wasn't perfect and it still isn't, but there were thing I personally remember from the beta that were better at launch.
---
My guess is that they reimplement those bugs for the "authentic" Classic experience, only for them to be removed later on when the community damands it eventually. That way they can minimize backlash, I reckon.
---
Lol!
---
Agreed, esp on ally I think
---
I was a Gladiator all 4 seasons on multiple classes including Warrior, which was certainly one of the easier classes to reach top 0.5% with, and I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt this dude wouldn't break 2100 as a Warrior Druid 2s. 
---
Guarantee he is a fake cast magnet and burns intimidating shout on a whim without setting up.
---
For those curious, I'm June 2005 and I'm not in - subbed, but no play time in BfA.
---
I'd be curious if there was anyone out there in this wave that was past June 05.
---
Polls are skewed, which actually might reflect a good thing. A bunch of newcomers to the game who don't know that Alliance Warlocks, especially in PvP, are hard countered by UD.
---
The meta on p-servers for the past ten years is that everyone initially rolled UD Mage and Priest to hard counter Alliance Locks.
---
This led to a period of Alliance Locks dropping off. With so few Alliance Locks, Troll Mages and Priests became more viable than UD, and that's where p-servers have been now.
---
They are building lag into the oceanic servers to compensate. \#nochanges
---
Yeah good one buddy
---
I'm rolling on an RP server and I seriously doubt any of them are going to roll on one. So unless I'm mistaken I've already dodged that bullet.
---
I‚Äôm one of those that loves highly edited YouTube videos because of the comedic aspect. Streamers just put on a fake personality and I could never see myself donating or subscribing.
---
i cant wait 
---
i just hope our battlegroup is non us
---
Too many locks?  Hire some rogues.
---
Forest Gump
---
yeah, everyone says they‚Äôre rolling lock now but they‚Äôre never around when people need summoning
---
Dude 20 hours grinding vs months of playing a class you're interested in....
---
% of people won't matter, they can use it to judge the distribution of server choices and scale the layers based on that info
---
Are you me?
---
I've somehow gotten to a point at which I only seem to be interested in gaming as a social experience. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is virtual perfection, seemingly tailored specifically for my tastes - but if I'm not playing my multiplayer save with my brother and our friend I just can't seem to get into it at all.
---
I've been stuck on the third level of Styx: Master of Shadows for over two months. It's a fun game, would normally be right up my alley, but every time I load it up I tool around for five minutes before realizing my heart's just not in it and turn it off again.
---
I don't know how the hell we're going to make it another three months.
---
‚ÄúPrebis‚Äù is literally another example of pserver sensibility being repeated for so long that people accept it without questioning it.
---
In vanilla, the only one who really needed ‚Äúprebis‚Äù (we didn‚Äôt call it that shite) was the MT.
---
The first time I stepped into MC I was still wearing greens and I was lvl 58. Incidentally we cleared half the fucking dungeon and I was up there on dps.
---
You are still relying on pserver sensibility as justification for your entitled opinion, while at the same time admitting that pservers are not accurate compared to vanilla.
---
Incidentally, saying that wearing gear dps gear to tank necessarily is more challenging for healers is not even necessarily true. 
---
As you mentioned, increased tps leads to increased dps (ceiling) which (should) lead to shorter rights which should lead to less chance of healers going oom.  The problem is, due to the complexity and human factor, this is a non linear situation and frankly we can‚Äôt predict how changes in strategy will effect the actual success of the raid.
---
It might have been the case that the ‚Äúovertuned‚Äù pserver raids made it ‚Äúfeel‚Äù better to min max tps and dps, but assuming that the same strategy will perform the same way on a (literally) differently tunes server is an over simplistic understanding of what actually happens in a raid.
---
Furthermore, your argument is again premised on the assumption that players interests are not equal since in your opinion it‚Äôs better to challenge the healers then...oh ....I don‚Äôt know let‚Äôs just say the stupid ignite mage?
---
Everyone has an equal right to do what they want in the fucking game. If someone wants to dps with a green lvl 5 broomstick in prot stance as a an arms warrior , who gives a shit as long as the bodies are getting stacked?
---
Proclaiming that the broomstick weilding lunatic somehow owes it to you to play and spec the way YOU want him to is a vacuous argument premised on the flawed assumption that maximizing raid dps is the only viable strategy for vanilla raiders.
---
His whole ‚Äúliteral god‚Äù and his try-hard shtick during the deadmines run had me cringing pretty hard tbh. But I still watched.
---
Yeah we've gotten some blue posts since this that suggest it was unintended, hope they're able to get this fixed up pretty quickly.
---
And they are WRONG
---
Love this list, but the one thing I wish they would add that would have little to no impact IMO (feel free to provide me with examples if i'm wrong) is 'low level quest tracking'. I really want to 'complete' vanilla now that I have the time and permanence to do so and would rather not use 3rd party sites to make sure I get everything.
---
Can he just stop reporting anything, i don't want him to ruin my baby. &gt;:(
---
Looks real to me
---
"NPCs which offer multiple quests may inconsistently display them as a dot or a ‚Äú!‚Äù on the available quests list. They were inconsistent in 1.12, and we‚Äôve reproduced the exact inconsistency they had back then.". 
---
Ok then they are just going to be assholes about this aren't they.
---
Y'know, that's a good way to think about it. Maybe I ought to boot up Styx: Master of Shadows again, see if I can't manage to actually push through and beat it before Classic launches and devours my soul.
---
they said that theyre open to doing TBC and WOTLK if theres a demand, which there will be. they also said theyre open to the discussion of post naxx content, which i really hope doesnt happen, and if it does i hope they open separate servers for post naxx content. but blizz has also said they dont want to focus on more then one mmo (modern wow) so idk how likely original content in vanilla would be. the reason i dont want it is because classic was created for the purpose of preserving history, and adding things to that changes it. but for TBC and LK id love to play those asap
---
Forgot that there are people that have never seen Forrest Gump. Be sure to watch Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park 1 as well.
---
It's "easier" as in you can be half afk during the leveling process.  Leveling a priest is quicker and more engaging though.
---
The only people that would have ever mattered to are speed racing pserver tryhards.
---
It's because it is the worst class for gameplay by quite a large margin.
---
Both Prot and Ret specs are totally unfinished and lack vitally important elements.
---
Holy is the most boring healing spec in the game, with limited tools but high efficiency. There are advantages for having holy paladins, no question, but you want someone else playing the paladin for you.
---
Not hard, boring.
---
Stop being such a fucking drama queen over this. You wont be happy with any solution they put forward because its problem that doesn't have an easy good solution that pleases everyone. Deal with it. 3 weeks and layering wont be a thing anyway.
---
I'm happy to see this list but part of me still would like to see a clip of their internal server where a rogue can backstab a mage that is casting on them, with both of them facing away, so long as their hitbox clips slightly.  I'm not saying they are wrong, but it would give me some peace of mind.
---
However if I'm making wishes I guess i'd rather wish that they use the time to address the other bugs rather than giving me peace of mind :P.
---
its the same concept for sports. why sit there and watch a football game when you could go out and play it for yourself
---
You've never witnessed the depths of despair until you've seen a level 60 beg for gold for repairs from players well below their own level.
---
yes it does work, based on what I‚Äôve seen streamers do.
---
Sure. I'm not saying I personally like lighter nights, I prefer darker nights. But whatever you fucking do, there's gonna be a good reason why some people can only play at night. That's why they changed it for retail. There's no plan to change it for classic though so all good.
---
It's hard in the way watching soccer is hard for Americans
---
Dude... The feels. I'm sitting there, trying to enjoy my classic-less life, when all the sudden... *Bing* ohh I've got an email! Pops into mail folder thinking in my head, oh that's probably my beta invite, sees the word hearthstone... Promptly gouges eyes out with fork. I had to download the brail edition of Reddit just to post this.
---
Because they charge into a boss with broken gear and a healer not even in range...
---
this guy has no idea what he's talking about. there are no new models or textures. you have the option for more ground clutter, hd water, upgraded shadows and (iirc) sharper textures. if you want no changes theres a classic option that negates all of that
---
From what I have read paladin had very low dps in vanilla.
---
lol imagine being a hunter and needing to rely on a pet
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler in Gnomer, tho you don't need two for it
---
I love all the people in here acting all high and mighty about what a person in the beta is allowed to do. Everyone complaining would do exactly the same things they are if they got in.
---
Esfand is bestfand.
---
There's a gamma setting, this is why retail is the way it is because morons can't fucking tune a slider in the options.
---
You a funny guy my mans
---
Yeah I'll admit its stupid as fuck but hey it makes sense to me
---
Maybe I'm bad but I tried the sit crit build on a private server and it felt more like a meme than anything.
---
You'll be happy to go Arms. It's more fun, and you'll be way better in world PvP. I think Monkeynews' leveling spec is pretty flawless.
---
When did you re-subscribe?
---
If I manage to get a sable tanking position I really wouldn't like to give it up. It was always enjoyable being the main target, felt like such a badass. So I guess I'll just roll a Warrior and try to look for a leveling buddy.
---
Technically you're not selling your life to blizzard, you are paying them to take it. Either way I'm all in.
---
This was actually awesome.  Hilarious and well done!
---
Not classic related. Please delete.
---
Cheers. A part of it for me is definitely a bit of Mandela Effect as well. I was in a middle-pack progress guild in Vanilla (got halfway through AQ before BC landed) and I always pictured things being way more hardcore back then than they actually were, just because I'd never done something like it before, and I was younger.
---
I'm really glad the classic community isn't going super spergy about minmaxing. Gives me a lot of hope. :)
---
honestly i like twitch to check out games , or learn about mechanics of game im new at
---
like twitch helped me a lot at path of exile and a few games like that with a lot of mechanics
---
but yeah i dont really enjoy watching people play games 
---
i also find it annoying how they are sort of required to interact with chat and deal with memes and answer stupid questions all the time
---
i also dont really get the deal with subs or giving away randoms subs like the chat icons is the only benefit of being a sub and i try not to bother a streamer it im checking a yame out
---
there are some streamers from youtube i love a lot that moved to twitch but yeah dont really enjoy their twitch content as much
---
its a shame youtube does not support gaming content creators or any content creators really
---
I've been watching Soda play and then Asmon, and then Soda again.... Literally it
---
Probably just devs using BFA as a comparison point.  I seriously doubt anyone is typing "Boars spawn slower than in BFA" in their bug reports.  
---
Keep in mind the spawn rates on private servers are all guesswork, so someone used to grinding certain mobs over there is gonna think they're wrong when they come to Classic.  (Same story with like health regen and crit procs, etc.)
---
Why so antagonistic? You don't need to be a "speed racing tryhard" to want to level efficiently.
---
I've honestly been looking forward to this for months (seeing these idiots play the game and be exposed as the scrubs they are)
---
I for one am glad this is not in the game, something just felt wrong about it.
---
I'm kind of worried that I won't get to do all the Kalimdor dungeons, because of finding a group in off hours. This is a nostalgia trip for me, so I want to see those dungeons again. I guess we will have to see how it pans out.
---
I tried out both Fury and Arms on pservers, before level 40, Fury always killed things faster. You literally get essentially a passive +25% damage; nothing in Arms tree surpasses that until Mortal Strike.
---
The lava in mc... Good times
---
All of DME, Quartermaster Zigris in LBRS dude is either carrying a stack of max level potions or has a chance of a really good leather belt which was prebis (not so sure anymore now with confirmed unprogressive itemization). First view DMW bosses/rares would work aswell got some nice healer legs and mp5 trinkets there.
---
I‚Äôm sensitive and the one person who downvoted me clearly is taking their dislike for blizzard out on me.
---
I'm in.  
---
Day 1 player - was in the beta then as well. 
---
I subscribed for 6 months on 5/14.  Haven't been subbed since early Caty.  
---
Gonna go play now.  :)
---
gz
---
Yes roll warrior since you enjoy taking ignore the rest. You will learn as you go, just make sure you do every instance so new spells are familiar as you progress through the content.
---
BLIZZARD SEND HALP! SAVE US ALL WITH BETA ACCESS BEFORE WE BECOME NORMIES!!!! REEEEEEEEEE
---
yes the buffs are very wanted and they are good healers, prob at least 3/4 pallies per 40man.
---
This has been theorycrafted to death. ‚ÄúPossible‚Äù in 5 mans and the odd shitty raid boss. Pretty bad at everything though.
---
I haven't heard of madseason, I'll check them out!
---
That was my thought as well, especially since I intend on playing alli lock.
---
You're right about selection bias, but I just want to nit-pick your sample size comment.
---
&gt; 94,930 ppl in this sub.
---
There are problems that come with larger sample sizes. For many applications, a random sampling of 1,000 people is more than enough. Larger sample sizes lead to larger margins of error.
---
For those of you at work (... On a Friday night? Poor bastards...)
---
 
---
&gt;As we‚Äôve discussed before, the nature of WoW Classic sometimes invokes different memories for different players, and this leads to certain misconceptions for some about what is or isn‚Äôt working as intended.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The following is a list of commonly-reported gameplay in WoW Classic that is not actually a bug, and is working as we expect it to:  
---
&gt;Tauren‚Äôs hitboxes and their melee reach is slightly larger than other races.  
---
&gt;Being critically struck while using /sit to sit does not cause abilities like Enrage, Blood Craze, and Reckoning to activate.  
---
&gt;Using the ‚ÄúAutomatic Quest Tracking‚Äù option does not auto-track newly accepted quests. (It instead will start to track an existing quest once progress towards an objective is started.)  
---
&gt;Warrior health Regeneration is working at the expected rate.  
---
&gt;Quests objectives and points of interests are not tracked on the map or minimap.  
---
&gt;Completed quests are marked on the minimap with a dot. (and not a ‚Äú?‚Äù)  
---
&gt;Feared players and NPCs run fast.  
---
&gt;Standing on top of other players while facing away allows spells and attacks to be used.  
---
&gt;Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth.  
---
&gt;NPCs which offer multiple quests may inconsistently display them as a dot or a ‚Äú!‚Äù on the available quests list. They were inconsistent in 1.12, and we‚Äôve reproduced the exact inconsistency they had back then.  
---
&gt;Quests that are too low level for do not show up as a ‚Äú!‚Äù in the game world.  
---
&gt;Available quests do not display a ‚Äú!‚Äù on the minimap.  
---
&gt;On level up, the message: ‚ÄúYour skill in **Protection** increased to 15‚Äù was added in 1.12.1, and we‚Äôre intending to keep that.  
---
&gt;We appreciate all of your feedback!
---
Loving the "Feared players and NPCs run fast." and "Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth." lol.
---
I think you could get to Vyletongue for the Satyr's Lash as a duo.  It's been a long long time...
---
Yeah there are a lot of dungeons on Kalimdor that I want to see again. But I worry that my play time won't line up with most people, plus if I'm alliance, so it'll be tougher to find groups for those dungeons. I'm tempted to lean toward playing Horde for this reason. Gnomer and Deadmines are two dungeons I could skip, if it meant playing Shadowfang, WC, Razorfen x2.
---
Hi, /u/mcmanybucks
---
First round of Beta testers are clearly the most knowledgeable about Classic. We thank you for your hard work in identifying bugs. See you in August. xoxoxo
---
Rofl
---
I was almost always top on effective healing, and overall healing as a paladin. Priest are just best at raid healing and dwarfs have fear Ward.  I'm not sure exactly why people say that. Priest are really handy to have around, especially on some fights... But there are tons of things paladin does better.
---
if you wanna tank there is only 3 real options.
---
prot warrior MT - Tons of time investment but you also need to usually be in an established guild. MT spot is usually first thing gone.
---
Fury Warrior/Prot Warrior OT - You can tank in fury as long as you acquire the gearset. This process is pretty easy as you just tank stuff to get both sets at your leisure. As a tank you can usually dictate who and what classes to bring to give you the best chance at securing loot.
---
Could also roll feral druid but that requires a ton of time investment if you'd like to be a boon to the raid rather than a 'wasted' slot. A good feral druid has multiple sets for when the need arises, because you will not always be useful in a fight as a tank, or a dps, or sometimes even healing/decursing. The flexibility and having a gearset for every fight is great. Also it requires a lot of PVP rep farming if you aim for BiS stuff. Also be aware a tank druid is usually only a 1 and done thing, and sometimes zero are brought. So the pressure to be a good feral druid is much higher than being OT warrior #3 or whatever.
---
Druid isn't bad to level, and they can tank dungeons just fine. They cannot be main tanks except for a select few bosses.
---
I like that. This is something I can get behind.
---
I don't understand how ppl think it's intimidating its a 15 year old game your better than that &gt;.&lt;
---
I kind of break this down based on the clips that I saw, you can see my original comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bp61yw/beta_bugsproblems_megathread_report_issues_here/entnron?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), but basically:
---
" This looks like if the character's circle can see even a small bit of a target's "circle" (think clicking on them and seeing the circle around the target), it counts as eligible. And since that edge of the circle is on the backside of him, it is eligible for backstabs."  
---
I actually thought more of this later and I do remember some duels back in the day outside Org where he kept backstabbing me while running through me and I assumed it was lag, but it all makes sense now! :o
---
&gt; Tauren‚Äôs hitboxes and their melee reach is slightly larger than other races.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/DifficultSleepySalsifyBrainSlug?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time
---
Are they really saying this was the intended range for meele of a tauren?
---
As someone who raided as lock throughout vanilla and has fucked around pservers recently, here's my 0.02c
---
All of the polls that have been done put warlock way up there in terms of popularity. I don't think they'll be nearly as popular as those polls make it seem, regardless of any hindsight we have about their numbers. 
---
The main reason i believe this to be the case is because we have statistics for various pservers and locks always tend to fall to around 9-11% with only druid and priest being played less. Considering that the pserver crowd is fairly "hard-core" when it comes to vanilla wow, I'd be inclined to believe that classic will have even fewer warlocks as the normies roll rouges, legolas', and mages just like in vanilla wow.
---
LOL, fair enough... me too. We fought courageously but in the end we were outnumbered.
---
Sweet thanks man. I've been having trouble finding a good website with classic dungeons and their corresponding loot. You think you could clear a good portion of dire maul east with two level 60s?
---
Yeah you're actually living under a rock lmao
---
Hurr durr Pursuit of Justice
---
Stealthing in AQ20 to the Silicate Feeders for ez AQ loot tables and 1-2g per larval acid.
---
Why would I only have my left hand available? Am I jerking off or something? (Note I am not planning on rolling a paladin)
---
Seems cheesy. Who wants to sit all the time?
---
New Orleans
---
The sit engage one justifies so many arguments ive had
---
Lol, this guy... About as wrong as you can be, but okay...
---
I'm hyped. Arms warrior has always been my guilty pleasure.
---
Its because both are tauren. So they both have longer melee ranges and larger hitboxes.
---
What is the action cam?
---
Don¬¥t listen to this guy, he shows how littel he knows about paladins in a few comments below. Most classes "only" use one to two skills to actively kill mobs. Paladin leveling isn¬¥t the fastest and isn¬¥t for everyone but it can be great fun. I¬¥m looking forward to it.
---
yes, because the diablo 3 team designed the endgame post MOP.
---
think to yourself, doesn't M+ feel awfully similar to keystones? many other similarities too. they blended genres and now they both suck.
---
Perfect.
---
Dude it's beta.
---
Esfand's old streams from 2 years ago were honestly so good, it's going to be so exciting to get to watch him play again
---
\&gt;holy hamster ball
---
I'm using this.
---
You're my hero.
---
Anyone knows what happened to his twitch channel? It seems like it got deleted.
---
No one ever constantly /sit to level a warrior in Vanilla.
---
I read some very heated arguments about that hammer on 3+1 Channel -- druids can get the highest DPS in the game with it apparently. Gnomer was definitely one of my favorite dungeons.
---
&gt; but they‚Äôre never around when people need summoning
---
the locks are too busy actually running to the destination...
---
GPU?
---
Yeah, you're probably right didnt know how to word it better
---
Still just a student, but I'm loving it. There's a ton of tools available to us now that makes Front-End a breeze.
---
Its not a bug, multiple people are having this happen on the beta. Its sharding (layering) in action.

---
Jesus Christ they just can‚Äôt win with you people can they?
---
Yes, both have extra large hitboxes which makes it look worse.  I'd say they are probably too big, but its not up to me.
---
It's the meta of this subreddit to give speed-leveling and minmaxing advice to noobs as if that is the only way to play the game. If a noob made a post about leveling as a nelf dagger rogue and asking about talent spec, I'm certain that 95% of the posts would be telling him to switch to human swords, and not answering his question at all.
---
No one is putting in references to bgs spawn rates. It‚Äôs a reference to private servers but Blizzard has a policy of pretending they don‚Äôt exist, hence they reference ‚Äòbfa‚Äô.
---
The most recent classicwow poll had a similar result, though, so maybe there‚Äôs some truth to it
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgV6Gk7LfK4
---
Doesn't seem too far fetched when both are Tauren

I'm jealous of you. Just play it at face value. Go google and look up some when you're stuck. Experiencing it for the first time is really amazing!

Was that the Satyr in the tiny little fire-place shaped room in pre-maraudon?

Most warriors leveling arms on pservers. Mostely because of the PvP aspect and the ability to defend yourself. If I understand it right you would go fury only until a certain level and then spec arms and kite with a 2hander, the dmg you take and the downtime of regging up just gets too big for sit/fury shenanigans later on also you get a (almost) free 2hander in your mid to late 30s that will carry you easily until your early 50s.

I asked [a question about specs](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aeumlf/relaxing_warrior_leveling_builds_without_the/) a few months ago, when I started leveling a Warrior on a pserver, and the comment I found had the most accurate info was [this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aeumlf/relaxing_warrior_leveling_builds_without_the/edv0fxw/)
---
Essentially, a 2H, Deep Wounds / Imp OP Arms build.
---
Skinning is better then mining
---
&gt; Standing on top of other players while facing away allows spells and attacks to be used.  
---
Hmm, i'm confused whether this is a bug or not then:

I think it's still a bug cuz they aren't standing right ontop of each other.
---
Not hijacking at all i appreciate it, this is a scenario where i would like to be wrong.
---
I believe Blizzard is saying stuff like this is working as intended. 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/AnimatedLachrymoseMangoPipeHype
---
I thought it was the other way around, that you had to maintain rank. Or maybe that was only one patch and then they changed it. I can't remember... damn 14 year gap.
---
Only thing I unbind is turn left and right
---
I was watching because I‚Äôm hyped for the game. I don‚Äôt have the ability to play because I didn‚Äôt make the beta so this was the next best thing.
---
I found this recently! Had a laugh about it.
---
I leveled as Arms in vanilla before switch to Prot for raiding and it worked great. Probably doing the same again.
---
Considering that Demo Shout isn‚Äôt causing the proper threat, I‚Äôd say Battle Shout isn‚Äôt either.
---
I would go Skinning and either Mining/herb.
---
&gt; Camera bug. This may be an issue with raw input, but I didn't see an option to change it in the settings. See the video around 3 seconds.
---
&gt; 
---
That happens on retail sometimes and has been happening for several years with no fix. It's something to do with mouse cursor resetting to the middle, but if they're not fixing it for retail I wouldn't have high hopes for classic.
---
Which is what these streamers should do instead of going "oh my god, this is bullshit, how dare a beta be buggy? Trying to be a streamer here durp".
---
I am waiting for the big streamers to figure out they can get it in the beta.
---
Not offended, but you made a ridiculous statement there. Comes off as /r/iamverybadass combined with /r/iamverysmart
---
True looks close enough, the visual difference might also be increased because no one is really wearing gear which would make them look bigger.
---
He charged through his trap it's a bug
---
This is what was asked for, this is what was advertised. An authentic vanilla experience. They can't replicate everything perfectly but that's pretty good evidence that they are doing the best they can to achieve that goal.

Thank you Feenix wow. It's odd, on this sub barely anyone mentions feenix. Both servers were awesome, obvious bugs aside. Not to mention instant 60 pvp server.
---
I would hate to be people that make those projections.
---
please blizzard no.....no phasing no layering no sharding stoppppppppp
---
Don't be afraid to ask questions, just try not be a butthole about it. Most people will probably be cool with helping noobs. 
---
Also make some friends and talk with people, this game is all about interacting with people and chatting for even the most trivial stuff. Enjoy the journey!
---
Wotlk launch was really fun. I never did beta so entering the new zones for the first time was amazing.
---
Man am I the only one who got divorced and can actually play more now?!
---
Skinning and mining for hunter
---
Skinning and herb for mage
---
&gt; upper BlackRock spire is 15 man
---
I believe we‚Äôre getting the 10 man limit.
---
Addons had already trivialized many things during vanilla though, take decursive for example. Blizzard was also nerfing addons back then. I don't remember what patch it was but I still remember them castrating the flexbar addon I had spent a few hours customizing lol. Who knows where the Classic api will end up, safe to say it will be more limited than vanilla days either way though.
---
Ever since Blizz changed their site I've had troubles finding this page so I've just kept it on hand. I'm honestly not certain how to navigate to the above link via their site nowadays.
---
Didn't they specifically say there was not layer switching during combat? OMG This is garbage
---
Pallys are the best single target healers by a fair margin so they tend to get assigned to tank healing
---
Doing this is a pretty common farming method. You go as healer and warrior usually you would like to have enchanting and mining you kill all bosses disenchant the loot and mine the RTVs on your way out. Those runs dont take long you can do easily multiple per hour. Selling large brilliant shards and arcane crystals can get you pretty good money.
---
Ive been looking into it a lot recently. You definitely arent going to top dps and the values considered have all been on pservers, but you can keep up and make the spec semi viable in raids.

---
3 I chastised you because of your hypocrisy in literally saying people should spec the way YOU say, while admitting you are not reciprocating the practice by wearing dps gear to tank and making ‚Äúruining the experience‚Äù for the healers.
---
Lionheart helm to tank...
---
Compared to vVanilla, retail players are spoilt. You have LFG which means you can literally queue for a dungeon and get in after 2 minutes, supposedly the rez sickness was more punishing in vanilla, you can level to max much faster these days compared to vanilla, dungeons can be completed in literally 20 minutes, e.g. I did WC a few months back and it literally takes 20 minutes (and that's being generous) compared to the 45-60 that it used to take. 
---
These gameplay aspects make the game a lot easier and less time consuming than it used to be, hence why I said retail players are so spoilt. There's my argument for my statement.

A different camera mode introduced in WoD (or maybe Legion) that behaves more like a camera you'd see in a 3rd-person action game. It's more of an over-the-shoulder kind of thing and moves around a lot more. [Here's a video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRDHjbp-y-4)

Give streamers their own layers, win win for everyone since blizzard loves layers/sharding and we hate streamers

I didn't.

Your attitude is toxic.  Just because I am not tolerant of your toxic statements does not in-turn make me toxic.

let me play bro
---
It's like this dynamic camera thing they added that's kinda over the shoulder view and moves in different ways.
---
It was cool for like 30 seconds after they released it but it got old quick.
---
Soda pointed out today that stream delays won't do much when you can /who

This has already been confirmed to be a bug and is being worked on by Blizz devs fyi.

It just makes no sense lol even in a fantasy sense
---
" A lot of things that add value without being direct monetary support" Buuut I am not going to give any examples, I'm just going to keep repeating there is lots of ways, because of course everyone knows there is lots of ways besides money... for example, lots of other ways.

I finished two indie games (Dead Cells and Cryptark) this week to try and keep my mind away from Classic, and for the most part it worked. I'm purposefully picking somewhat difficult games so I can focus on them instead of watching YouTube and Twitch streams about Classic. The struggle has been real and I have a close friend that has been trying everything to forget Classic for a little while to no avail.
---
Yea. People have reported it as a bug but blizzard is doubling down that its correct, not much can be done about that. Also the increased field of view might have an impact an how large it looks
---
How are they wrong? You cant just yell wrong lol. None of that was your original argument. Nah I have 24 crit in my typical gear and im fine thanks.  My mages like doing damage.
---
Good for you. You claimed "nobody" did it. I did it. :\^)
---
Same skinning and herb then probably change one too engineering later
---
Geofencing?  back in the day we sued to call this  sharding  ROFL   please nOOOOOO
---
Thats what we said in OSRS until we realized games die without updates and now the game is 4x as big as the original Runescape and growing. Of course this relies on having an awesome dev team though, I'm excited to see where Classic goes.
---
Yeah I added a month of fame time like 20 days ago to my new account I wonder if I‚Äôll get a invite or not lol only 9 days left D; and do I have to have a subscription to play the beta once I get in?
---
The problem is less about your gear and more about having that many uncontested mobs come launch time. You will need to be ahead of the curve by level 20ish to even consider it.
---
I feel like you are going to be a captain of industry when classic gets released
---
I played through WotLK and I don't remember there ever being arrows.  So probably MoP or WoD?
---
I made a new one to see how many people are playing specific race/class combos

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpznl5/classrace\_combo\_question/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpznl5/classrace_combo_question/)
---
oh sweet. you got link?
---
1) It's more difficult then it looks
---
2) There's limited spots that work well, this means that if 1 person comes to your spot or you're not the first there that questing would be faster.
---
3) Easy target for anyone close to your level on PvP servers
---
4) If you do anything that isn't AoE grinding, you're less efficient because you've chosen certain talents specifically for AoE. This means that if/when you get bored of killing the same mobs hours on end and you want to quest or maybe do some BG's, you're at a disadvantage without respec'ing. Good luck paying for those respec's early on in a server life
---
5) Mages who stumble upon other mages in AoE spots (which is frequent, see point 2), they usually troll you by sheeping mobs you're trying to farm.
---
The only people I suggest AoE farming to on a fresh server are people who are planning to be server first 60 and if that's your goal, your route should be mapped and you should be practicing already. 
---
If the server is a couple months old at a minimum, then you'll most likely be fine.
---
I still think invites only go out during normal business hours lol. I forget about automation. I have a 2004 account but no luck still. =/
---
sponsored by tipsout
---
NA or EU?
---
It's very efficient, but on launch only those who are far ahead will have the large groups of uncontested mobs free to really do so.

---
Thanks for the reply, I'll stop frustrating myself now
---
You don't. Make new friends. I think that's your best bet. I learned this trying to get friends to play other games with me. I was better off making new in-game friends because my real life friends just didn't have the same interest or involvement that I did. So I had to find new like-minded people to roll with. Makes it easier for grouping &amp; whatnot anyway. 
---
A good idea is to be friendly to everyone you play with &amp; (depending on what class you're playing) always add the tanks/healers to your friends list. Makes grouping later easier. Especially in Classic where people you grind up with usually will be pretty close in level when you're looking for the next dungeon.
---
when u level up on beta it spams u with 3 lines of text that your talent trees gained skill points for some reason
---
but still im not sure this is even real?  the only evidence i can find of somebody leveling up back then is [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79LfKXNhClw) from dec'06 and it does not do that
---
I have a 2004 account. If I pay $15, what are the odds that I get in to the beta the next day?
---
Same it‚Äôs been depressing. I‚Äôve been trying to play Elder Scrolls Online as it‚Äôs a decent mmo but it‚Äôs just not the same
---
this is the type of beta testing we needed
---
A bug in Vanilla I hope is still around is that you could hit your friend with a snowball when he was getting on the windrider and he would be instantly teleported to his destination
---
You are literally in dps gear talking about how viable you are as a tank.... do I need to draw you a picture?
---
#SHAYMENS
---
Systems can be set up to reserve a name without creating a character. In fact every MMO ever that has had a reserve a name before release has done this without even needing to load the game. Can be easily done on the website. Don‚Äôt talk about shit you are clueless about then call people idiots.
---
private servers also use dynamic respawns which kinda skews everything
---
Dude, you have a valid argument but you are totally being the grumpy+smug "back in my day" guy.

---
I was a prot/arms spec, so prot/fury is a bit out of my experience. From what I have gathered from other guides/articles on the subject, mixing fury or going full fury spec is very gear dependent, so it'd be something you would work towards but not jump into right away at 60. Again, this is my understanding, someone more knowledgeable on the subject may have a different opinion. 
---
It could be something your guild works towards, if they like you as a tank (any role, MT, OT, etc). A lot depends on the guild, their mentality, their opinion of you, and so on. First thing is, be a good tank. Worry about the dps part later. That's my opinion/advice.
---
My guild was kind of a weird cross i guess. We followed the general gear and spec meta, but it was never enforced. So we told people to spec like this and gear like that, but nobody was held accountable of they didnt. 
---
We never had any janky roles like ret Paladin or Moonkin Druid, but I sure was specd Ret/Reckoning most raids while i healed. Most of us knew healing stats were king for Paladins, but most of us just wore T2 to raid.
---
Im just thinking Mage and Hunter are good at farming so do they need the extra gold while levelling would just slow them down.
---
It's a bug dude, you can get off outrage duty
---
I'd personally just go skinning and worry about mining/herb later when you have a mount.
---
Oh you know it :) Definitely still going to play, extremely excited.
---
nope, people would ALWAYS find a reason to bitch. Fuck if they made the 1.12 client fully work without any crashes I'm sure people would still bitch
---
put that free mount to work
---
I barely remember the reason for doing these grinds - it was nice that you mentioned the recipes because it was an "ah yeah that's right" moment. Maybe a quick summary towards the beginning to remind people what the reward for the grind is (i.e. "Why would a player need to do this")
---
I will likely do herbalist  and alchemy again as I did in vanilla. Health and mana potions sold really well on the AH which helped me afford my mounts.
---
Great video!
---
Do we have confirmation it works in Classic like it does in pservers?
---
gotta put that free mount to work
---
Missing means less rage thou
---
Name them or shut up.
---
might as well earn that free mount
---
Yeah you make a good point otherwise it slows down levelling to much much.
---
Might go Skinning and Tailoring for Mage. 
---
Skinning and something else for Hunter.
---
I will likely do herbalist and alchemy again as I did in vanilla. Health and mana potions sold really well on the AH which helped me afford my mounts.

I wish they mentioned about that boss in WC does actually hit that hard.
---
Keep your friends close and enemies closer.
---
On private servers we went into MC with greens too man... Having a set of gear to strive for when you get to 60 is not a bad thing. 
---
Its natural to trade off mitigation for threat generation. Its not really challenging them when you are grtting tankier at the same time. It makes sense. Sure you dont know exactly how that trade off will play out on live servers. But it will happen in some way. You are just rambling at this point man.
---
Well, Blizz is still throwing their temper tantrum about flying... so that's not a great start.
---
I do think there's a lot of QoL improvements that could be made to Classic WoW without compromising the experience, but clearly it's something that needs to be done very sparingly and thoughtfully.
---
LOL most skilled in wrath? That's a joke dude.
---
There have been a ton of top PvP streamers and others who have said their favorite expansion for pvp was MoP
---
Fact is retail players are spoilt. And my points are valid. I could care less if I come across as a dick for getting that message across. 
---
It's like anti-vaxxers who feel attacked because they're scolded by people with brains that vaccinating their kids is the right thing to do.
---
I came here looking for answers on how one gets into beta. This answered it quite well.
---
Zappyboi gang:(
---
Except this is untrue.  I'm in beta and do not have an active subscription.
---
I have game time bought with gold.  But i've cancelled.
---
I would say fairly high. I'm from 2004 as well and I got in day 2. Dont know how invites dole out from here though
---
Fact is, retail players are spoilt, and my comments have validity (I'd say much moreso than yours). These are facts, not emotions.
---
That's actually a really great find.  Imagine the chaos if blizzard's internal version is shown to be not representative.
---
This was a survey posted a while back, i feel it's slightly less biased from Asmon's poll. 
---
The reason being is he was shitting on warlock due to the rock/paper/scissors/mushroom video, and also people don't vote for paladin to troll McConnell. 
---
This poll was also broken up between horde/alliance, which is nice.

As others have said it‚Äôs pretty rough if you‚Äôre going to play solo as you essentially just Melee a mob down then drink after because the seals are still useful to use in combat. But on the bright side of you have a friend to level with Paladin is S tier for duo leveling as they are inherently a support class.
---
Glad I'm playing on EU servers.

Well actually people main tank with good threat gear and dual wield on private servers lol. 
---
If the raid leader wanted me to wear more mitigation I would lol. Turns out healers can handle it. Its pretty boring healing someone in 440 def mitigation set. Everyone has more fun when the tank has good threat. 
---
Look man, keep trying to convince ppl arms is a good spec to raid in. Whatever. Good players arent going to listen to your bullshit anyways.
---
Don‚Äôt you feel a little broken that most people are so sure on what to roll and we‚Äôre over here so conflicted.

Hahaha no way! That‚Äôs awesome, thank you for doing you.

Ah. A man of culture.

The people you meet on the way to 60 will be the people you raid with/can get you into a raiding guild. If you speedrun it and don‚Äôt make any friends along the way we‚Äôll...

I mean reddit isnt affiliated with blizzard so mentioning the competition should be encouraged actually.
---

I can‚Äôt speculate as to the horde side but can confirm 2h sword spec arms with hoj was the tits. Dw fury was the best post a certain level of itemization, but 2h arms was up there too.
---
If your stream is 10mins behind then people still have to find them in the zone. the group swarming them will still be smaller. The real reason is people are less likely to donate or sub if their message is delayed.
---
Good find! This proves it, especially when it's double taurens.
---
I'm pretty sure realm population will still have a hard cap (perhaps three or four layers) that will prevent this from happening.
---
The idea is to let the realms *bulge*, not *break*.
---
If too many realms are reaching the breaking point, I think that's when they'll decide to open *new* realms.
---
This is going to determine which realms are going to be higher population with occasional queue times and which are going to be lower population with less activity and resource competition. And you probably want a health mix of realm population sizes, anyway, to accommodate different player preferences.
---
Each layer "fork" will also probably have only a fraction of a realm's total population, rather than simply doubling it. For example, if a hypothetical pop limit of 1000 is reached, it would only split into two layers with pop limits of 750, putting 500 players in each and making room for another 500 players (250 each).
---
There would be a limited total number of forks that could happen before new layers stop getting spun up, introducing queues which will naturally discourage players from selecting that realm.
---
Concurrent realm pop is also not only a matter of dedicated players and looky loos. After the initial rush, players will settle into their own playtime patterns, with peak days and peak hours.
---
I came

Yeah, I am certain those pepegas got in the other night and the email batch was just delayed like every other beta.

Yeah, I am certain those people got in the other night and the email batch was just delayed like every other beta.

I think it will be huge. Beta, and two MAJOR streamers streamed from what I saw and it hit like 200k on open.

Imagine when shroud, tim, and all the others get on. I think it could easily get 500k+ in viewership alone.
---
For a Beta, where everything is going to be deleted and doesn't have much value, the viewership is pretty dope atm.
---
I got in and I received an email about it.

FurBLOGS...

No but they are probably inside one another's hit boxes which is larger than the model - that and gnomes have tiny models!
---
You again, I bet you think annihilated handguards are ‚Äúbis‚Äù for dps warriors don‚Äôt you?
---
Nub
---
&gt;So pallies are still desirable for their buffs, at least?
---
Paladins rival and sometimes outheal (especially later with crit) priests. Without buffs, they can easily compete for a raid spot, but since paladins also bring super good buffs, every guild will look for *several* holy paladins. They'll never not be seeked out at any point in the game.
---
I read that entire thing and didn‚Äôt see anything about why her hair turned white. Can you explain?

blizzards implementation of sharding type tech has always been the most trash ive ever seen

I feel sorry for you.

luckily, i don't have that problem, tho, it does extend to WoW because i re-subbed for the announcement of the beta. so, i could play retail, but i have no interest in it (and haven't, so, i don't even have BFA). hell, if i do end up playing retail, it might be to just farm gold to afford a classic subscription, lmao.
---
Where‚Äôs the sound???
---
I'm more curious about how many paladins will stick it through the endgame. It's all fun and games until you realize just how much bloody time you need to spend buffing people.
---
I see. Here i thought the thing i learned when i actually grew up was precisely that disney movies are hardly a good source of morality. I suspect you merely want to put me in some folder you put people you disagree with m8.

Doesn't do anything. Players will always find the streamer no matter what.

I have game time bought with gold.  But my account is cancelled.  It expires on May 23, which means I was cancelled at the time I got my beta invite.  I can provide a screenshot.
---
That's exactly how it worked before there was auto-turn casting. Melee would zig zag wildly to try to avoid being faced when cast completed because it would cancel the spell. In the current demo where as long as you're in 8 yards of a player it casts is not accurate at all.

Wrong. You gain 1 minute per level after 10. At level 11 your resurrection sickness is 1 minute, at level 14 it is 4 minutes.
---
i love my extra inconsistency.
---
Well I'm glad to have a ClassicPurist such as yourself to tell me what this sub is all about and what the meta consists of
---
Ya i will avoid any streamers when I select a server. Hope none of them hide their characters either. I'd like to know where they are and stay clear
---
Legion was better than WoD and BFA but that's not a very high bar.
---
You think your trade of massive damage for casters to do a tiny bit more dmg with MS is somehow a better trade off than fury prot, which will be similar if not better threat and not fuck over your mages. Be honest, this is really abput keeping your pvp spec while raiding. You can probably find a pvp guild to let you do that. Dont worry. But its not a better spec for tanking. Sorry bud.
---
I have this still unopened from that long ago. Idk if I should crack it open on launch
---
I'll play with ya buddy
---
I am unsubbed but I got invited.  I do have active game time through gold.  But my account expires on the 23rd, meaning I was cancelled at the time of the invite.
---
I would say mining/skinning. Sure there are really nice high level herbs that sell great but so many people will reroll eng at 60 so all the low level minerals you get will sell for a good price and fast.
---
Game time yes.
---
Yes.  Because I have game time (gold) sub is cancelled and am in beta.
---
I see, thats an odd idea. Here i thought the thing one learns you actually grow up was precisely that disney movies are hardly a good source of morality. I suspect you merely want to put me in some folder you put people you disagree with m8.
---
Cause it‚Äôs BiS PvE heals, BiS PvP shadow.
---
You're gonna need a psych eval if you go through with it
---
This is just one of the many reasons this game will not feel the same as it did in the early 2000's.
---
nothign wrong with that
---
It would be impossible for blizzard to know who is a fan of the streamer and who isn‚Äôt.
---
These are all great names for your dick.
---
shamans can use shields, so they could use it i think. Its in uldaman tho, which is like 40, 1k needles is 30, so comic works fine.
---
The drake in BWL doesnt heal if you taunt rotation and even w MS you arent dpsing thru that. The drake is a very easy boss as well. There isnt any amazing utility your arms spec brings come on man what a joke. 
---
An off tank can swap and hamstring for nightfall. Or a hunter that doesnt do much dps anyway. Or a ret pally or enhance shaman
---
Name reservation should help with the forecast as you can weight those players as being more likely to stick around.
---
Hi
---
I really could never get into paladin or priests. I tried, I really did. I guess the Light and I just don‚Äôt connect like that. (Paladins worship the Light like priests right? Lol)
---
Why?
---
Very bad. Beta is tiny and some popular content creators didnt get in.
---
&gt; If the counter to a Hunter is to just FAP/Sprint, then the Hunter can FAP/Cheetah to keep as much distance as he can. 
---
Sprint is 40% faster than Cheetah. Going Cheetah is pretty much a death sentence because of daze.
---
&gt;Scatter/Trap the Rogue (he can't trinket it and it's not blocked by FAP), keep Hunter's Mark and Track Hidden up. Keep a DoT up to keep the Rogue out of Stealth. When FAP is down, the Rogue loses.
---
Okay, as soon as trap wears off, the rogue will sprint and never leave the hunter's deadzone. FAP lats 30 seconds. How exactly does the scatter fd/trap counter this rogue?
---
&gt;When FAP is down, the Rogue loses.
---
Gouge pet, sprint away, mount up, reset fight.
---
A lot of things "make no sense lol" in vanilla.
---
Like how you can carry 20 horses in your backpack.
---
I could never get into paladin or priests. I tried, I really did. I guess the Light and I just don‚Äôt connect like that. (Paladins worship the Light like priests right? Lol)
---
You're probably thinking of Heroic Strike and/or Cleave which go off on the next white attack.
---
Only if you get crit
---
I think it's actually much higher than people were expecting, just another private server bug it seems
---
Yes you should
---
Remember when you could get Flintlocke‚Äôs Piloting Pants from that quedt at the wrecked zepplin in Hellfire Peninsula?
---
&gt;This is just plain uneducated.
---
Just offer a counter argument.
---
I agree with you but those big streamers are literal Titans compared to even someone like Frost or Madseason, shit even that idiot Tips and I feel bad for them really. I remember I was doing some WQ‚Äôs a few days after BFA launched and Soda tried to gank me but gave up and not even 10 seconds after I got spam whisperer by people trying to get into my shard. I actually kind of like Chance, not Soda, but I feel so sorry for him because you can tell the streaming life has really worn him down and his attitude reflects that. All we can hope for is that they‚Äôre all transparent about what servers they‚Äôre going to be on.
---
Read that comment above me and tell me that the only issue here is differing of opinions.
---
High meme value, low watchability. Keep track of your progress and update us on time played
---
You can wear the blue pvp helm its... okay. LH helm is alot better. You just compensate with high mitigation elsewhere. Its all about balancing your mitigation and threat appropriately. Early on, LH Helm is the single best item you can get pre raid.  If you can tank MC in greens, you can wear LH Helm lmao.
---
He doesn‚Äôt max out at 15k what the fuck are you talking about. Uldir he got to 98k and he regularly has around 25-30k.
---
Now who is the closed minded one?
---
tipsout Influencer btw
---
Agreed, being Feared away and into more packs was terrifying in groups.
---
Gatekeeping ftl.
---
Do you know what a bug is? LOL
---
Gatekeeping...FTL!
---
Rushing on the main
---
Slow on another. 
---
I have limited time and if i want to do something i have to rush in my weeks off work.
---
do you start at any specific lvl in beta?
---
tipsout influencer btw
---
and I wouldn't have it any other way.
---
Every person I've seen on this reddit that's recently gotten it has been an 04-05 player.
---
Thanks. I quit not long into legion and only came back to hit 120 in BfA and then quit again as soon as I did.
---
hahaha laughed at the vid not the joke tho
---
Chuck Norris doesn‚Äôt believe in Thunderfury
---
‚ÄúI was able to slow a low level dungeon boss.  This isn‚Äôt what I remember leveling in mop at all‚Äù
---
lol
---
Oh we have plenty of shit posts for them to take care of. Just sort by new lol
---
that is like saying you can count warrior twice because they have it on both sides
---
Enjoy sitting in 12 hour queue every day for the first week. I can hear the people who took vacation crying now
---
Hey Marmaladegrenade, what we're doing is having a theorycrafting discussion. There's no need to get our egos involved here because it makes it hard to have a productive conversation. Egos cause us to be irrationally defensive about an idea. Instead, we can challenge each others ideas productively to find the right conclusions.
---
I was never rank 14 in vanilla but I got pretty far and PvP'd constantly. I was dueling rank 14's including one in my guild outside Ironforge in vanilla. In TBC, I was on some top 5 teams for arena. 
---
I'm completely open to being wrong, but please tell me what part of my strategy is wrong and why it won't work rather than telling me to simply" stop posting". We're all fans of the game, we're here to talk about it :)
---
I've heard people say disabling hardware acceleration can resolve the issue in game options, but this option is not in the beta client.
---
I can tell based off of the feedback that itll be around 63% of the population that will be gone..
---
&gt;I've heard people say disabling hardware acceleration can resolve the issue in game options, but this option is not in the beta client.
---
He does seem to be one of the more down to earth humble WoW streamers. I don't watch many streamers, but I do watch esfand.
---
Yes, I'm aware of the technicalities. But do you really expect the official Classic forum to be okay with the advertisement of them? No.
---
It might have actually been a thing for awhile in vanilla, it was, however, likely fixed/changed at some point
---
I dug this up sometime last year, https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Sit?oldid=249301 a revision to the /sit page on wowwiki from about a month after 1.12 released, so it probably wasn't a thing in 1.12 at least, but no info on whether or not it was prior to 1.12
---
All this great info and no mention about the fate of Mankrik's wife. Shame on you.
---
I love esfand
---
I think he is implying that he found the video so funny that he could not restrain himself from laughing out loud despite being at work. PUMP YO BRAKES HOMIE
---
Yeah I remember back in Vanilla exploring with friends to Loch Modan and surviving when I jumped off the dam because I switched into defensive stance
---
I think he is implying that he found the video so humerous that he could not restrain himself from laughing out loud despite being at work. PUMP YO BRAKES HOMIE
---
I hope my internet also drops out if there is higher then 10km/hr winds, slight rain or a phone call. 
---
I dont want to break the immersion.
---
Arms was already on par and imo better even with sit critting, the damage you can output with imp OP and later SS which double dips with WW and cleave means you can kill 2 mobs in a couple seconds.
---
just a note though, imp HS isnt actually that great as the more optimal way to play is to spam sunder to proc dodges and then OP, it effectively becomes dead talent points as you shouldnt be pressing HS much after 12.
---
TBC boi here with a warrior main. Are "ya'all" warriors or other people warriors are gonna bend over? Pls be the second one.
---
This is \~\~garbage\~\~ beta
---
Username checks out
---
Live and classic have the same darkness levels this has been covered alot on this sub.
---
I would argue, yes. Similar to Blizzard leaving in the request flight path drop off button because you could do the exact same thing in classic by logging out/in while on a flight path.
---
I got the email but the account isn't flagged yet. Nothing on the drop down on the launcher... :/
---
I keep saying it, WC3 campaign dude! It sets up classic so well, its got the best warcraft stories, and it's really dam fun. I literally just finished the final level of the undead campaign of the frozen throne. Onto the founding of durotar!
---
Warrior here who didn't play classic. Are the regens something I should be happy about or sad?
---
you answered your own question
---
It's THE time to get into it, my friend.
---
I‚Äôve been a league of legends player for a long time and I‚Äôve just recently noticed my self not giving a shit and basically trolling my ranked games because I just don‚Äôt care anymore. My mind is focused only on Azeroth lol.
---
Laughs in oceanic
---
It atleast was there at a certain point, but I am also positive they removed it later on.
---
Weren't there some debuffs that lowered those skills temporarily at a certain point and made your skills worse in terms of hits and resists? I somewhat vaguely remember that.
---
Yes, and?
---
Countdown to Classic discord is huge and busy, great community
---
there will be more mages than warlocks,  Not sure about hunters

EVE Online was really harsh as well back in the day.  When you died, you lost your ship, all the stuff in your ship, and if you didn't have any clone backup you lost all the XP you were learning at the time.
---
Although it is still relatively nothing, it costs me 500g on retail when I take the spirit healer then repair my gear. No arguement, I just wanted to mention that for some reason
---
there was, idiot
---

Do you have any insight as to why there are so few warlocks?
---
Not all of every xpac was 1.12 or X.4...
---
It's a known bug and they confirmed they're fixing it.
---
Do you monkeys ever stop raging for ten minutes?
---
NO CHANGES!!!
---
I mean.. Just watching his interviews with people who actually play you can see he clearly knows nothing.
---
So?
---
So are gnomes super sneaky?
---
i'll throw in a ZJ
---
beta testing the same game twice, 15+ years apart from each other
---
strange
---
sweeeet, thx man.
---
Something 5 levels above the players should be causing crushing &amp; glancing blows, is that happening? I would hope something that large from the combat tables wouldn't be missed, but who knows.
---
I'll throw in a ZJ
---
sweet, thx man.
---
Priest are far from the only viable healing class. Holy paladins are high in demand, and if you like ret you will get plenty of off-spec gear raiding as holy.
---
My account is 2004, un-subbed 2007.  
---
I paid a 6 month sub last night,. no beta,  
---
didn't really expect to, but I might get in after the first stress test
---

the 500th post about getting in
---
I assume it means if you're standing within their hitbox, your facing doesn't matter?
---
It's a feature!
---
&gt;Especially on a Warrior, which is by far the slowest leveling class.
---
try paladin brother
---
my arms war was a delight compared to my current paladin grind on pserver
---
im literally fighting a single mob as i type this
---
What he said. La, for context I was overseas on work when the date and the beta dropped! I spent $100 on roaming data to download the client onto my 8 year old laptop, which has a 13‚Äù monitor, an integrated graphics card and about 300gb hard drive space. I can‚Äôt even run The Long Dark on this thing so it was a surprise to see Classic work on potato settings. The net I am using is from the hotel and lag is real, and because I am working, I‚Äôm coming back in and playing from about 8pm to 3am. This is about an hour slower than my typical run.
---
I got gifted the battle pass, played for a week and uninstalled yesterday lmao
---
Hard, no.    
---
Long and slow, yes.    
---
    
---
Paladins don't have much for offense,  so it's just a slap fest.
---
They do not, 500g for taking rez sickness is fine for most people, especially as rez sickness is rarely taken. However gold has been significantly more difficult in BFA than most expansions, so pots and flasks are rarely used by people nowadays unless its guild runs or higher end content. I sit on 100k, I spend all extra gold beyond that on old mounts I never bought before. 500g isn't laughable to me but it is still a drop in the pond.
---
It's those consumables that get ya
---
Is this r/subredditsumulator ?
---
I just made some characters on Light's Hope, should hold me over until release
---
They are standing in the hitbox.
---
Some of these are very dumb things to report but it‚Äôs pretty rich that Blizzard felt the need to make this list saying things like ‚Äúwe reproduced this inconsistency exactly as it was before‚Äù when the beta is absolutely overflowing with bugs to the point that many are worried if they‚Äôll be able to release a passable replication by the end of August at all. 
---
I personally am worried that the ‚Äòbuild the old game on top of the new client‚Äô approach will never be able to replicate vanilla wow and laziness around some of the changes (layering, content phase decisions, lack of progressive itemization) will give us a product much lower in quality than has already been done (i.e. Nostalrius). 
---
Just my two cents in response to this list.
---
I imagine they have gotten plenty of "bug" reports from snooty private server players saying how the game "should be" according to what they are used to.
---
No way. That sounds hella fun imo. I would love to do something like that.
---
Come to oceanic mate. You can server xfer on live from our servers to US servers so can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôll be different. Server xfer was in vanilla so I guarantee it‚Äôll be in classic
---
Ehm, i saw a twitch clip of two taurens dueling and they could hit eachother from a range that would otherwise be hunter-shoot-range.
---
I doubt that the "slightly larger" hitbox of taurens is working as intended.
---
Is this info based on pservers
---

---
You guys are getting so mad about something they can fix. We get it, there is an issue. That‚Äôs the point of the beta
---
Same here. No namer. Started day 3 after launch and played through wrath. I did buy BFA and have a 6 month sub. I had access to the launcher 24 hours before I got an email from blizzard.
---
Blizzard is known to throw some sass every while and then. Not often, but gosh dang those few times are why I love em
---
Another way to get at this. 
---
There never was a private server with less than 10k population at launch that did not die off in under a year. 
---
In Vanilla the server cap was around 3k and the total population grew month after month for years. Pop grew from nothing to around 7million. Even with that gind of growth alot of servers became ghost towns. 
---
Now we can expect population to go the exact opposite route. Start out high and then fall off. I am glad they made layering cause it will be needed.
---
I'm in the same odd boat as you. I'll be in Thailand for the next year and trying to figure out what to do.
---
I just subbed like 2 days ago and I got into the beta.
---
Spirit + Hamstring. Warrior is now the easiest class to level.
---
oof.
---
I just subbed 2 days ago and I got into the beta.
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I'll be in Thailand for the next year and I'm not sure what to do.
---
I don‚Äôt struggle to level cooking while leveling, but fishing quickly becomes an issue. You have to stop doing what you‚Äôre in the middle of and go cast a line. Cooking you just use up why you gathered when you‚Äôre back in town.
---
Will people who opted into the beta get access to the stress test if no current active game time is set up? I have bfa and last active game time was about 3 months ago
---
Streamers are fine. It's the fucking viewers that are the problem.
---
Yep this one is me
---
Play the game how you want, I‚Äôll play the game how I want. That includes rushing to 60 and world pvping (and yep I‚Äôll kill people lower levels than me - not sorry about it. Won‚Äôt camp them though).
---
I don't hate streamers, streamers are fine. It's the fucking viewers that are the problem.
---
Just think how difficult it would be to even do that random deep dive, skip 4,7,3 pages at a time until you find just the right video porn search, only to come across pops railing some broad.
---
Whirlwind Axe baby! 10/10 best weapon.
---
but how do you kill that which has no life?
---
Nope
---
That video was made after the TBC pre-patch had already been deployed. Though I can't say whether the message was added in 1.12.1 for certain myself, do remember this: 1.12.1 was the patch that revamped the Riding skill mechanics (needing to only purchase one global riding skill instead of race-specific ones). It is possible that changing that had inevitably added these messages, which were removed with the pre-patch.
---
From a guy that has been tanking for(in total) roughly 12 years:
---
Not every dungeon will be a success NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE!!! Why not? Because people are different.
---
I am quite a (according to millenials) toxic dude. I call you out whenever you do stupid stuff (rogue pulling cause "I wanted to see whats behind the next wall"-&gt;whilst not in stealth) or a hunter not dismissing pets in gnomeregan/maraudon etc. there is hundreds of examples I could give you. So what has this to do with your situation? I know every dungeon in and out, Ive been tanking with every single class and through most of all difficulties that are available. YOU WILL WIPE ANYWAY! If that last sentence has sunk in-&gt;Youre good to go. Best thing would be: Find a healing buddy and 1-3 dps as well. If you have 1-2 friends that do healing everything will be WAY smoother cause he will know what you are capable of and you can react better to what is happening. Pulled additional adds? I KNOW that I can leave a melee NPC hitting my friend(the healer^^) and he will be able to do his job whilst I am collecting all the other mobs running around that we added. I will actually be doing a Tanking series on my YT channel:
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-gj-3gerGNm9jOeFHiYmUw?view_as=subscriber
---
I also got in. Sometime between last night and this afternoon. A handful of my guildies got in as well.
---
You see that targeting circle on the ground? Imagine another one for the other player, and they will overlap slightly. I guess if they overlap they are "standing on top of each other".
---
Look at it this way.
---
Classic is the beginning of WoW. You could start at the beginning 
---
OR
---
Start in Retail which is 7 or so expansions deep. 
---
WoW was the casual players game back when it first came out compared to everything else on the market at the time. Its made for people to come in and learn quickly. Classic is probably the best starting point, less \~\~clutter\~\~ features, more emphasis on community and if you put in the extra time it is rewarded. 
---
If you're on the fence about it might as well try it. If you dont like it then you're out 15 bucks but you'll know. And knowing is half the battle.
---
xx
---
I'm trying not to play classic so I can play classic.
---
I‚Äôve always played Horde and Hunter, so I think I‚Äôm gonna go with a Troll Hunter!  Alliance seems tempting though.  I‚Äôve never gotten too far on an Alliance character.  If I do make one, it‚Äôll probably be a Night Eld Druid
---
Vanilla has it's fair share of problems, it's far from perfect.
---
rez sickness is 10 minutes of being totally useless and 75% gear damage, which at lvl 11, is basically a fine for your entire bank roll...
---
This is awesome. If you could add respawn timers once they are known, that would make this twice as useful. Not sure how feasible it would be to do loot tables, but respawn timers would definitely be great.
---
He needs a hunter tagging along with him ;)
---
I think you‚Äôre a bit above average schmo. Average would be leveling ONE character to max lvl every xpac
---
This. I've been trying to figure it out. Is this 'I just got home from work and checked bnet' or is this 'I'm checking every 30 minutes and literally just got in'.
---
Thanks OP.
---
Insects and Arachnids were made red due to there being no connection to the Old Gods in vanilla.
---
Hobgoblins existed in lore. Magnataurs, Polar Furbolgs, Tuskaar and Blood Elves were in Warcraft 3. Makrura were in vanilla, you could find them right in the water in front of Ratchet.
---
I actually misread Highborne as Nightborne. Oops. Of course Highborne were in vanilla, they were in Dire Maul, although without any physical difference to night elves.
---
I've been following him for a few years now shortly after he was banned from YouTube for streaming private servers. He was so passionate for Vanilla WoW that I am truly happy he's finally gotten to play again. He looks so happy. On the other hand I am immensely jealous that I probably won't get into this Beta and still have to wait a grueling three more months.
---
Oh god, same.
---
Veco is for fight
---
It's always surprised me how low Druid is. I know it's not the absolute best class, but it's not really the worst either. But more than that, I'd have expected the class fantasy to carry it... shapeshifting is just too cool.
---
Yes, without any actual connections to the Old Gods or anything else really. They were just critters. Like squirrels.
---
veco is for fight
---
Needs some work on the text alignment of the mob selection accordion.
---
Also, it's not very apparent what someone needs to do when you first visit the site, a bit of a UX flaw.
---
I've done a bit of math on it. Skinning is good on first characters to help get your mount. You'll get anywhere between 10-20g by level 40, which can put you right over the threshold depending on how conservative you are with your money.
---
Mining is great if you are going to use the mats and the resources are abundant... On a new server, if you aren't ahead of the pack or taking it pretty slow, you might find yourself outpacing areas faster than you can get your mining/herb up. If you're on a class like Hunter/mage, which are great at grinding gold, and you were planning on selling the mats/don't want to have mining or herb at 60, I'd agree that it's questionable as to whether or not it's worth it.
---
dont forget warriors that defy laws of physics and heroic leap to negate fall damage despite having a harder impact... smh
---
Can they hide their name and keep their realm a secret? And maybe have a mod to alter their race to only them. I feel like their own experience is gonna be broken because getting help kills a big part of the point of classic wow
---
Lord cobrahn in WC
---
If horde Baron Aquanis for Outlaw Sabre
---
Viscous fallout in gnomer, as well as crowd pummeler.
---
SM GY rare spawns
---
Glutton in RFD
---
A few of the bosses on both sides of Mara including a rare mob and Rotgrip.
---
Rare in ZF (drops leather feet).
---
Grim Guzzler BRD plugger has some good drops, general angeforge I believe too.
---
Troll mini bosses in ST for leather shoulders.
---
Sure they may be a few more I can‚Äôt think of right now. All of these can be duo‚Äôd while leveling for gear and some can be solo‚Äôd.
---
So.. this is a little hard to explain. When I kite a mob on my hunter to the back left he starts doing this weird back peddle animation. It‚Äôs seriously really hard to play like this too because it sort of locks your camera in place and you can‚Äôt really see your target. Between that, and the confirmed raptor strike bug, hunters are feeling really buggy.
---
This. Been trying to figure out if these posts are "I just got home from work and checked bnet" or "I've been checking every 30 minutes and literally just got in".
---
Thanks.
---
Why does everyone think they don't have the vanilla source code. They aren't using it but they have it for reference.
---
I can‚Äôt project the number of servers. All I know is there won‚Äôt be enough. Layering will overstay it‚Äôs welcome because the populations are still too high, so we get layering for a while 2-4 months, unless they open new servers, maybe RPVP and allow migration transfers. 
---
But I think each server will have, on the first few days, a 2k pop lager, and as time goes on and people disperse, the layers will get larger in size, closer to 3.5k where they should cap. So in both directions, with higher cap and lower player activity after the rush, less and less layers will be needed. Here‚Äôs my ideal situation...
---
Day 1-2, 8 Layers, 8000 pop, 8 1000 layer servers. 
---
Days 3-7, 4 layers, 6000 pop, 4 1500 pop servers
---
Week 2...2 layers, 5000-6000 pop, 2.5-3k each
---
And when concurrent numbers drop to 4k or below, remove layering entirely, maybe week 3, maybe month 2, the sooner the better.
---
Fuck
---
Ugh
---
eu ?
---
eu or na?
---
I agree. Plus bag space is a premium once you start carrying around quest items and such.
---
What? Priest has the widest toolkit, definitely a ‚Äúpure healer,‚Äù but far from being the only viable healing spec. Paladin can pump impressive numbers and you have insane buffs everybody desires.
---
Friendly reminder: Getting the email does not mean you just got in.
---
A lot of times they are 24+ hours in. This is only relevant if you already checked your launcher today and it wasn't there, and now it is, because it would imply a third wave did go out. You could have been second wave but waiting on the email when the launcher is instant.
---
Warlocks where pretty much the worst class early vanilla when this video was made IIRC so that's the joke.
---

Those dudes are cunts.  I‚Äôd find a different guild.

IIRC defensive stance was at level 12 and I want to say at minimum you'd have sb before 15.
---
Its more of people reading posts like "I was a lock back in REAL vanilla and let me tell you I was topping meters and unstoppable in pvp, private servers are off!" and "Warlocks dont have to use the most efficient pve spec like everyone else, just go a hybrid pve/ pvp spec xD"
---
I hope this isn't what they're talking about but this was my initial thought too.
---
you must not know staysafe
---
I agree with this. First character will certainly be a farming character (herbalism/mining on a warlocks maybe) and my second 60 will probably be a healer that I want to raid on.
---
Very funny!
---
The tauren hitbox confirmation makes me believe it to just be a case of their hit boxes overlapping which acts like their standing on top of each other.  Just my thoughts on the matter at least.
---
Yes, without any actual connections to the Old Gods or anything else really. They were just critters. Like squirrels. Or wolves.
---
Rushing to 60 is just to farm herbs before other people can get to those zones.

I just want to help the dudes at the logging camp cut some wood. That's it.

RemindMe! 4 months
---
Agreed. Seems way too easy.
---
No idea. My guess is they will have you basically create a character like you would normally they just wont let you enter the world. Thatd be the best way. No extra work really other than not allowing people log in to the world. 
---
When it will be I have no idea. But I expect it will be at the same time as the server list or shortly after.
---
Grats! My account has only been around since early 2010 so I doubt I‚Äôm gonna get in. Hopefully I‚Äôll get lucky though!

This issue does not even exist on retail. You are full of shit tbh
---
No you're right, this seriously was never a thing. I have no idea why they believe the talent spec 'skills' should increase upon leveling. Here's a random example from Joana's video to 60 in 1.12:

What particularly would be a reason to goldfarm, I'm new to wow and apparently most of the endgame gear is soulbound
---
So on one end you talk about tanking MC in greens, which is fine. But then you say you cant tank in Lionheart. How does that make sense. Your other gear can compensate for Lionheart. It is easily one of the best items you can get as a tank early on. Its all about balancing your threat and mitigation appropriately for the given fight. LH Helm is one of the most powerful pieces of gear in the game.
---
Insects and Arachnids were made red due to there being no connection to the Old Gods in vanilla. I guess I should have made the connection red.
---
I made a class picking video a while back and posted a poll along with it. Right now it's sitting at 25k votes total(warlock being second place right behind warrior). I'm not sure if it's the biggest sample size or not, but just thought I'd share it incase it would be handy: https://www.strawpoll.me/17557953

Good point I‚Äôve been planning mage this whole time, but the hipster in me keeps seeing mages as the top rolled class and is making me want to play a paladin.. might just ignore it and push to 60 knowing most of them won‚Äôt even make it

you do know you can grind elsewhere, ya?

What happens when Joe from Illidan-A will merge with Joe from Illidan-B? How's it feel to have an opinion, without having a brain?
---
You lose combo points if your target dies, too, but early on the game would give you a couple of seconds to use them. Don't remember when this went away but it may have been around 1.4.

I got to level 50 on warrior in vanilla as an 11 year old with ADHD so I think I can manage 60 now.

Wait, why do people want to test beta so bad?
---
If you aren't playing Fortunate Son by Creedence when you go into STV are you even doing it right?
---
The whirlwind axe is going to be pretty hard to get on launch. Interested to see a warrior in beta go for it, if they can do the full quest chain with the level cap.
---
There are downsides to layering too, stop being ignorant.
---
&gt; they aren't standing right ontop of each other
---
They're within each other's hitboxes.
---
Want it to look really crazy, use two Tauren (larger hitbox than other races), or a Tauren and a Gnome for it.
---
hey you went full retard in that conversation with the other person so i'm going to have to call you out real quick
---
i don't know about that other guy but i (the original person mocking the idiot who called towelie an asshole) was not "jumping to his defense"
---
consider this scenario.
---
person 1 says "i like hamburgers"
---
person 2 responds "FUCK YOU YOU FAT CUNT"
---
i come in and say "wtf why did you freak out like that at this guy we both don't know who seems to have done nothing wrong"
---
person 2 responds to me "oh are you gonna suck his dick too?"
---
it's clear in this case that person 2 is the emotionally invested one, and the person "coming to the defense" of the hamburger guy (aka me) has no emotional investment in either person or hamburgers, i'm literally just criticizing the mental faculties of people who irrationally insult people (even if i don't care about those people personally)
---
feel free to try to respond to this in good faith, but you're not going to be able to because this isn't an argument you can win

I'm glad someone else remembers the deep magic.

Insects and Arachnids were made red due to there being no connection to the Old Gods in vanilla. I guess I should have made the connection red. But they're just critters, they don't belong into a map of conscious races.

1 day, 8 hours, 3 minutes, 11 sec
---
Sweet thanks! Yeah people say you can do the fury/prot spec until like mid raid progression
---
Most of them. The stream testing I was watching yesterday the Tauren were definition being smacked and smacking others at insane ranges well outside of anything I can recall ever playing a Tauren during any xpac, including Vanilla.
---
Also,nthe stream I saw with casting tests the 2 characters were not on top of one another and not even close, I'd say barely inside of melee range and you even saw the Frostbolt travel backwards between the players to hit the target. There was enough space between them to watch it fly between the caster and the target.
---
Playing a caster main through all of vanilla I don't recall that at all being the case. I recall seeing "target must be in front of you" constantly in PvP when missing a cast on a melee as they walk through you, still on top of you but past the 180 degree rule to get the cast off.
---
180 degree rule was knowing the angle of an acceptable cast when being walked through - the degree at which you can still cast at a target to the SIDE of you as if they are in front, but never from behind and on top of you.
---
Any caster will know the 180 degree rule, especially if they PvP'd a lot as you would flip the camera quick to top down to track the enemy easier by facing them as top down gave you a better view of where they were as they would walk through you during a hard cast in hopes to fail your cast using facing direction. 
---
It's not correct to be able to cast behind you with enough distance to visually see the effect travel through empty space backwards as was seen in the stream.
---
i don't know about that other guy but i (the original person mocking the idiot who called towelie an asshole) was not "jumping to his defense" by any stretch of the imagination
---
consider this scenario:
---
person 3 (me) comes in and asks "what the fuck, why did you freak out like that at this guy we both don't know who seems to have done nothing wrong?"
---
it's clear in this case that person 2 is the emotionally invested one, and the person "coming to the defense" of the hamburger guy (aka me) has no emotional investment in either person or hamburgers - i'm actually just questioning the mental faculties of people who irrationally insult others at random (even if i don't care about those people personally)
---
feel free to try to respond to this point in good faith, but you're not going to be able to because this isn't an argument you can win. your position is indefensible and you wouldn't be intelligent enough to defend it regardless
---
There's no data on how many of those people that want to play X class will even make it to 60. Even if they make it to 60 the average player will take much longer into Phase 1.
---
I got an invite 3 hours ago. Can‚Äôt believe it, although if they have some sort of way they checked accounts I was active from the start all the way through BC and came back for BoA until December and just renewed my account the day the beta was announced. So they are still sending out invites.

I just got an invite a couple hours ago so they are still sending out invites.

NCSoft was the first one to release a classic version of their game and it was a big success. I think blizz might have noticed that

I just got in got an invite 2 hours ago!!!

holy fuck i never heard about this that's very interesting

I just got in got an invite a couple hours ago!!!

holy fuck that's pretty interesting never knew about that

---
I think my guild had a ret paladin, we laughed at him, but he was still allowed in!
---
Just got in got an invite a couple hours ago!!!
---
It's not a huge deal, on release the starting zones are going to be overbearingly flooded with players. This isn't detrimental at all. 
---
There's no organic Classic experience anymore because it's not 2005. Meta data for every possible leveling route and class optimizations are readily available. Back then everyone was on the same level of knowledge on the game, nowadays many people play WoW is some form and understand at least the basics of a class.

All these people bragged about playing classic and knowing everything about it...
---
I'm afraid warlock is going to be overpopulated this time around.
---
Take it from someone who was alive 15 years ago: you couldn't do this.
---
"You think you do but you don't" lolz!
---
But tips has been doing nothing but play vanilla for 13 years. He's got like 11.5 years /Played so he should be used to it.
---
If you don't get a reply sometime tonight or early tomorrow, I'll post a couple of screenshots with the graphics cranked. It's honestly really pretty. Any early Alliance zones you want to see?
---
That's how my guild was, I think we had a ret paladin though.  We laughed at them cause they were bad, but we still let him in.
---
How does it limit your options? I don't have it unbound but I might as well since I never use it.
---
what do you have bound to your ult
---
I have 2 weeks of vacation, I've level 5 toons im rolling mage and rush aoe farming. But idk might roll warrior..
---
any reply?
---
You still shouldn't advertise on the official products platform.
---
lol, you poor noob.
---
I agree, that and all the overpowered weapons and talents will eventually get tuned down. Maybe that‚Äôs phase 7
---
Maybe they should let in people who don‚Äôt have active subs. The private server people, for more accurate bug reports.

I honestly can't remember ever seeing it before, but I'm pretty sure by the time we were that late I had already filtered out skill gain from my chat, so... 
---
The strange part is that I've yet to see anyone but Blizzard confirm it was like that. If it was in then someone would've recognized it.
---
Enjoy
---
Eh, people were complaining it was too fast actually.
---
Everyday since it was announced to be honest.
---
Pallies around the world in tears over reckoning
---
I've felt this way since November 2017 when it was announced. Nothing else seems worth my time ever since.
---
God, same.
---
I'm playing Diablo. Season 17 just started. At least something to get my fix. And easy to leave whenever as there is no story or commitment.
---
Same.. Still holding on for hope!
---
That video is how I remember the levelup text in classic, and I started playing after 1.12.1.
---
This is how I liked to play back in BC and Wotlk. Get your main up ASAP to make the most money on ppl spending crazy money on mats and stuff. Then slowly enjoy my alts. But this time I am actually going to just go slow and smell the roses because this is America and I can do what I want.
---
Or they could just you know, merge dead servers just like how they will merge dead layers?
---
there are addons that let you expand your ignore list
---
Real mage tip that sounds fake: you should buy water just like everyone else and use your shitty water when you need to or time isnt an issue
---
Maybe they should let the unsubbed pserver players in.
---
Thanos wouldn't have to snap much, this is nearly balanced.
---
The sit enrage pretty much makes it not useful to go fury over arms for leveling.
---
&gt; Quests objectives and points of interests are not tracked on the map or minimap.
---
I loved reading this whole list üòÑ
---
Something else people may not expect: deselecting a character you have combo points on (as a rogue or druid) causes you to lose those combo points.
---
Why would it work lol it's just one of the many little things private servers got wrong
---
NCSoft did the classic thing first with a big success
---
Just a bunch of overreactions, it's like people don't know what a beta is for. They literally have a bug report button on the screen. Report it, let them take care of it.
---
In the character screen, it had a ‚Äúclass skills‚Äù sub category, similar to weapon skills, languages, professions etc. it was a bit of flavour I think that doesn‚Äôt really do anything. 
---
Example, elves have both darnassian and common as languages spoken. 
---
Weirdly, warriors just have ‚Äúarms‚Äù under their class skill. I think blizzard probably intended something for them initially and it was never fleshed out.
---
Would be interesting to see someone compare the classic beta mob data to something like a mobinfo mod database export from 2006.
---
i bind it to alt-S, it is useful in some situations, especially if you're tanking, for terrain movement in PvP i think walk is better to use, S is a really useful button to have on demand don't waste backpedal on it, you rarely use it (excluding tanks)

---
There are only a handful or less than a dozen big name streamers that tend to draw massive crowds in game regularly from what I have seen. Do we know if they all plan to roll on PvP realms? I'm thinking that PvE realms would be less likely to draw people wanting to make a name for themselves streaming Classic. And probably RP-PvE servers would be least likely to end up with any major streamers at all. I've been set on the idea of rolling on an RP realm anyway just because I think they may develop some of the strongest communities. But if they're likely to be unpopular for major streams that's another good reason to favor RP realms over other types.
---
To be fair, if you watch the clip, the instant the first mob dies is when the switch happens. But, as it's a bug, I'm sure it'll be fixed.
---
You still shouldn't advertise competition on the official medium.
---
Thats like going on the Pepsi website and recommending the new Coke flavor. It's just disrespectful.
---
Planning on doing most of this. Probably won't go down to deadmines for horde though lol

Hobgoblins existed in lore. Magnataurs, Polar Furbolgs, Tuskaar and Blood Elves were in Warcraft 3. Makrura were in vanilla, for example in the waters next to Ratchet.

Northdale (Light's Hope) is the most popular vanilla server at the moment. 
---
Afaik almost every private server is free to play, with a few of them just having a cash shop for items / cosmetics.
---
Northdale is completely free and "blizz-like" though so eat your heart out
---
&gt;the mechanics are flat out better
---
Then why was EVERYBODY begging for Vanilla? Nobody was asking for wrath. Nobody wants Wrath. Wrath babies stay seething.

video you linked appears to be a 2.0.1 video, not 1.12. Don't have any real video proof but can confirm that used to happen in vanilla.

---
How do you get drop down menu
---
I was already favoring the idea of an RP realm for other reasons, cause I think they're likely to have some of the strongest communities, but this seems like another good reason. I assume that all the big streamers that are likely to stick with Classic are going to roll on PvP realms, so it seems like regular PvE will be less likely to wind up with them, and RP-PvE least likely of all.
---

So hard!

The video you linked is the bc prepatch (2.0.1), priest didn't have vampiric touch in 1.12. I don't have any real video proof but can confirm the skill thing happened.

Nice
---
Crazy!  I don't know which server I'll be on yet with the guild I'm joining but maybe it'll be the same as yours if you join up again!
---
He openly says he only got to level 51 which is why he doesn‚Äôt know too much about endgame or really anything but he played a lot on private servers which I think makes I‚Äôm assume he knows more than he does.
---
I'm pretty sure you hold absolutely no power to make that happen
---
NCSoft was the first to do an official classic release and it was a huge success. Blizz was sure to follow
---
It'd be different if we could trust Blizz but we can't so this is how it has to be. If Blizz didn't fuck up so bad the last 10 years maybe we would trust them to do some bug fixes and whatnot.
---

---
With warrior it's always gonna come down to weapons ofc, but discounting that Fury is still superior to Arms without /sit. Fury generates more consistent rage and more of it, does more damage, and has better survivability.
---
It's the last point that really changes things. Improved demo shout, Blood Craze and Bloodthirst makes it so much easier and quicker to level. People say Blood Craze is a meme, but it's basically around 7-8% evasion for 3 skill points, which is crazy good. People don't use demo shout (because they play arms and can't afford it) but it cuts mob damage by a quarter to a third, which again is pretty major.
---
Then you look at the damage talents. Fury has Cruelty (which is 2h spec but better) and then Flurry and Enrage which nothing in Arms comes even close to. People talk about the miss rate making dual-Fury bad, but when calculated with similar gear the dps for dual comes out slightly ahead even with the miss rate. And then you add the bonus hit chance from heroic strike and it's far superior.
---
I used to be all on the Arms train myself, but after actually putting time into testing it I came to the conclusion that it's not even close.

Either way, its still lame to advertise a service on the official medium. It's like advertising the new Coke flavor on the Pepsi website.
---
No, they are giving us what we asked for.
---
Mate. Gonna have both a paladin and warrior at 60! My body is ready.
---
yet you won't say it here... I wonder why.
---
There are always guilds that play and raid at off peak hours on every server, no matter the region. Choose your home region and stay there imo.
---
I have this on repeat!
---
Why on earth would you skip the skill ups + AH money you can make from herb/mining from 1-40?
---
Side note, for AH money purposes: generally herb is going to be better for  than mining at 60, but mining will be better while leveling

Certainly play however you want, but no dungeon Ive ever ran ever came close to the fun I had in Deadmines. Scarlet Monastery was also fantastic. That said, world PvP and BGs were always more fun than dungeons and questing so its hard to ignore the allure of leveling up quickly.
---
Ummm its a game. Games are meant to be enjoyed, time enjoyed = not time wasted. Very simple my friend.

I ditched Netherwing to keep myself fresh for Classic.  Now I just pass the time with some occasional Overwatch and hosting bondage parties for large breasted women while I wait patiently for August 27th.

It is based on Nostalrius core then it is because Nostalrius actually splits up continents into chunks for perfornance reasons. On of the transition points is the Durotar river. It will appear like phasing as you transfer to a new map.
---
This however is not a normal thing, most servers do not do this. It is 100% NOT Blizzlike either.

This actually made me laugh. Haha

Yeah take leave that week mon-friday. Spend monday and tuesday with wife so shes happy before you wake up wednesday morning at 5am for launch and play until tuesday. Since we have that following monday off aswell.

They're all just jealous that they've been hyped as fuck for a year and a half and this bastard just has to wait three months.

If you're tanking a mob it's pretty useful too. No chance of getting hit in the back if you backpedal.

He did say he was pretty sure. Which means he wasn't 100% That and he made a comment on the video admitting he was wrong. I'd rather have someone that does that, then someone who will swear up and down that they're right when they aren't.

I have twice I think. Never went that low on gold before a raid again after that, just borrowed pots from friends instead if I was low on money at the moment. Feels a bit better to borrow actual items than gold imo.

I get what your asking for - I literally have zero desire for that and I think you will find a large group of people who feel the same.

Say what you want, a fuckload of people will play BC and LK no matter what you say. I know flying is stupid, but I think BC is such an awesome experience its not going to stop me.

Did vanilla have the ghosts in that house that would kill you if you did an AOE attack in there? I recall during TBC doing arcane explosion or whatever it was called while my friends and I were just screwing around waiting for the last guy in the group to show up, and all of a sudden I'm being attacked and can't see wtf is even attacking me.

I ask because I want to fuck with my friends that don't know about this stuff who will be playing with me.

Lineage 2 had this and was launched near same time as wow. Seamless world and no instanced zones at all. Used to play l2 with friend and we considered wow as a carebear online because of the fact that there was no death penalty and many other things such as l2 having only 60% chance of success when crafting for example. 
---
Lineage 2 had "talking Island" which was the human starting area. Which was good 5-10 minutes boat ride away from the mainland. Each mob dropped like 50 adena and the boat ticket was like 8k. We were so cheap that we found a buffer who gave us buff for underwater breathing for 20min and we swam across the sea. Well over the half point because dying sent you to closest city.
---
Saved 8k! Yea so no loading screens at all and I also remember loathing the wow instaces since world bosses were up for competition on l2 so wow instances were again carebear mechanic that let the less skilled players to get loot without worrying about pvp.
---
L2 also had sieges which is hundreds of people as In tens of  different clans trying to over castle In order to get the castle and get the taxes of the castle city which was usually "quest hub" or better maybe grind hub. Even these events were not instanced and happened in the weekend every 2 weeks. 
---
I remember being In the defending side and friend of mine went to scout ahead over hilltop and ran back screaming "they are coming!!!" with 200 player alliance behind him coming to invade our castle. Good times. 
---
I would argue lineage 2 had bigger and more Seamless world than wow had at the time and the map was huge as well.
---

Siege for reference. 
---
The game was just so hardcore In terms of grinding that it was not that popular. Well the private servers were packed becouse they had 3-5000 boosted rates.
---
I want to sub so I have somewhat more of a chance for an invite, but at the same time, it'll be so pointless especially since I have 0 interest in retail.
---
I'm on the ~3 year mark. Never touching that game. Literally heroin for me.
---
I‚Äôll be there to play TBC and LK - no blind nostalgia, I played through them both a few years ago and had a blast.
---
What I don‚Äôt want is Blizzard taking the helm again
---
Yes, exactly? Why do you even explain it to me since THAT IS THE ISSUE everyone is talking about?
---
The problem is that there was no way to do this in vanilla, since you couldn't use mouse over macros. You had to target the player and use blind.
---
That is the problem. Do you understand?
---
Yessss

Dude same here. I was having so much fun leveling my Priest (46 atm) and now I don‚Äôt see a point in logging in. I just end up watching Classic Beta streams and refreshing my battle net client :(

So here in my opinion is proof that health regen is for sure off. Here are to videos. One from Asmongold's stream and the other from Joana's speedrun leveling. They are both level 21. The regen rates appear to be similar despite multiple factors. The first and most egregious is that the Joana video is sped up. The second is that troll's have increased regen as a racial. This to me means that Asmongold the level 21 human warrior is regenning WAY faster than Joana the level 21 troll hunter. This doesnt even account for the fact that Joana likely has more spirit considering his class.

Well, they already added colorblind mode, O.C.D. mode was the obvious follow-up

Quality post

Thank God. That also means it wont work to proc reckoning and redoubt for Paladins
---
Content aside, the classes felt great to play at the end of Legion. I actually loved the marks hunter design (in Pvp, specifically) and Venom Rush on my rogue felt soooo good. Now all those things are gone and the classes feel like trash.
---
You‚Äôre creating a much larger problem than you‚Äôre eliminating.  Statistics aren‚Äôt for people who can‚Äôt understand the faction aspect of this simple poll.  It already doesn‚Äôt factor the fact that maybe 90% of the mages are going to be horde (exaggeration).   We don‚Äôt need to add more uncertainty by combining two completely different classes.
---
I'm scared because I start school full time in the fall for accounting. My classes start the day before classic's release. As a kid I spent 4-8 hours a day, 6-7 days a week playing wow. Classic to the end of wrath then I quit and moved on to other games. Nothing else ever came close to my /played. Over 8000 hours.

I'm excited for this game but I'm certainly not going to let myself ruin my grades over it.

it is correct, I have very vivid memories of it being this way. During S3 TBC i leveled a tauren druid on the EU-Auchindoun realm and did mainly 2v2, the bg was very very underpopulated so we constantly played the same people over and over (a warrior druid mirror) whos warrior was a tauren with stormherald, he was able to melee me from ridiculous ranges. There was a particular game on blade's edge where he was rooted at the bottom of the bridge downstairs and I was on the lip of the bridge upstairs casting a cyclone on him when the roots expired and he jumped at me and managed to white swing me for a stormherald stun from like 20 ft below me..
---
Lineage 2 had this and was launched near the same time as WoW. Seamless world and no instances zones at all. Used to play L2 with friend and we considered wow as a carebear online. One reason was the instances zones that let you gear up in peace. Unlike in Lineage 2 where you were never safe. All the areas were FFA PVP zones but it did have anti greafing method called KARMA system.
---
Anyways about seamless zones. Human starting area was this "Talking Island" which was away from the mainland. Boat trip from the island to mainland was like 8k. Each enemy dropped max 50adena at that level so we figured we rather swim across the ocean. We found a buffer who gave us kiss of eva which let you breath underwater for the duration of the buff which was 20min and we swam as long as we could and then died under the water. But we were over the halfway mark and dying sent you to nearest city so we got the mainland!
---
L2 also had castle sieges which had hundreds of people fighting for castle ownership. Castle owner could set the taxes for the Castle city which was "quest hub" or in lineage 2 it really was a "Grind hub".
---
These castle sieges happened every 2 weeks and there was like 6 castle. Thousand people fighting all over the world for castle ownerships. and then defending it 2 weeks later.  
---
I would argue Lineage 2 actually had the most seamless world with 0 instances during the launch even tho it had massive player interactions.

The game was real hardcore in every way really and I think Pservers were more popular than the actual live version because private servers had boosted rates. I mean retail could have you HC grinding for hunders of hours for single level at later stages.

---
Did you get the stance without doing the quest?
---
And everyone you knew wasn't even a drop in a drop in the bucket of total players, numerically speaking.
---
What's the point in doing that ? They're bound to the arrow keys by default.
---
Duskwood is so awesome!

I was chosen for the beta and i won't have any time to play for the next 3 days atleast :(

I remember this one case about sieges which made it so awesome that it was not instances.

We were defending and friend of mine went to scout the enemy lines. He went to a hilltop and came running back few min later screaming "THEY ARE COMING!" and he had \~200 players behind him charging at our castle.

I‚Äôm with you I just hope we get a Cali server. I‚Äôm about 250ms on a Cali server

I'm trying to shed some light on the reason why they may not want to have RP pvp servers.

I really don't care whether they do or do not provide them.
---
Thank God. That means Pallys wont be able to proc Reckoning and Redoubt doing the same nonsense. Glad to see all those bullshit leveling guides on YouTube look silly
---
It is correct, unless it was a bug in late TBC also. I have memories of it being this way. During S3 TBC i leveled a tauren druid on the EU-Auchindoun realm and did mainly 2v2, the bg was very very underpopulated so we constantly played the same people over and over (a warrior druid mirror).

---
We thank you for your participation.  On another note, do check out classic wow when it releases in august!
---
I don't care if they provide these servers.
---
Not more recently, but historically yes.
---
As someone who played all of vanilla I appreciate this message when directed at new players but some of us already know how we want to continue playing the game.
---
Even if I ran out of endgame stuff to do (and lets me honest there is only so much loot that drops in a week) I'll then make an alt and appreciate slow leveling. (Or work on professions/farm gold probably) 
---
There is plenty to do in this game at 60.
---
The LFG tool in retail is similar to that. A group leader lists his group and then other players can apply to it. Also no teleports to the dungeons, just summoning stones.
---
What I never understood, was where do the trolls actually come from. Are they some kind of old god spawn, descendent of some titan creation, descended from a loa? I can never seem to find lore about the trolls past the zandalari empire. They just seemed to have suddenly existed on azeroth at some point and then ever since.
---
Brace yourself for the salt
---
same here man well close july 3rd 2005 when I started.
---
Was hoping that would get me lucky but not yet.
---
My exact idea, going to rush a hunter to 60 for some gold and easy farming greens from low level dungeons for all the alts I am going to level on cycled,  rested xp.
---
I don't even think Retail allows character transfers across regions. It might be possible but it would be a separate "account". 
---
I have had characters transferred across accounts back in BC when I would power level with accounts. It required 2 form identification and other hoops, but this was US to US.
---
Best of luck my friend. Hope it all works out.
---
Here is an in-depth, detailed breakdown of Paladin DPS gameplay in classic:
---
Press seal of righteousness/command
---
Press judgement, consumes seal
---
Reapply seal
---
Wait 10 seconds, repeat
---
Whether you‚Äôre level 10 or 60, it never evolves past autoattack.
---
ideally at launch loads of layers will be filled to the brim so adding another won't cause these problems.  most likely a side effect of it being a closed beta and lower populations.
---
Yes but once you overpower your dmage is halved compared to a 2hander.
---
They are somewhat right but the thing they don't understand is there will be something like a dozen or so streamers that will actually have massive significant impact on the way the players are acting/playing on their servers, so if everyone on allcast as well as some of the other popular wow streamers were on the same server, it actually would protect most of the servers from this issue.
---
The smaller streamers outside that group aren't going to have this incredibly huge influence.
---
They're missing out on so much money.
---
You give beta access to people that are not subbed. Then they have to sub to actually play the beta. Kind of makes sense.
---
Nobody ever blamed Blizzard for being very smart.
---
Everyone except the people who wouldn't
---
Yes but once you overpower deal almost half the damage since you only attack with your mainhand.
---
I think the majority will make it.  Many will reroll.  Some will be so traumatized that they will uninstall the game forever.
---
2h slam fury warr by far my best level experience as a warrior and I've levelled 3 vanilla warriors, never did the sit down crit.
---
Is nelf hunter better then mage at wpvp
---
Do you happen to have a link to Monkeypaw's arms leveling guide? I've been google searching to no avail. I'd be very interested in looking at it, since I plan on leveling a warrior.
---
Makes me want to go to sleep sooner, so when I wake up, maybe I got in, just like Christmas morning.
---
lol nice
---
Dude seriously. The Westfall/Duskwood quest-lines make rolling alliance worth it!
---
Play what you want. Gold will come eventually

---
Nelf hunter better then mage at wpvp?
---
lmao, delusional classic players
---
Man, almost every WoW streamer I've seen is pretty awkward and cringey. Fun clip though.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpzzxh/-/) has been removed for Rule 1.

They were brought Justice by the end of vanilla though.

Fully geared Naxx lock with SL spec is disgusting

Lineage 2 had this and was launched near the same time as WoW. Seamless world and no instances zones at all. Used to play L2 with friend and we considered wow as a carebear online. One reason was the instances zones that let you gear up in peace. Unlike in Lineage 2 where you were never safe. All the areas were FFA PVP zones but it did have anti greafing system called KARMA system.
---
L2 also had castle sieges which had hundreds of people fighting for castle ownership. Castle owner could set the taxes for the Castle city which was "quest hub" or in lineage 2 it really was a "Grind hub". So of course they were up for huge contention.
---
We were defending and friend of mine went to scout the enemy lines. He went to a hilltop and came running back few min later screaming "THEY ARE COMING!" and he had \~200 players behind him charging at our castle
---
There was also many things that made WoW  'carebear' as we used to call it compared to L2 other than quest hubs and instanced zones.
---
\- L2 required you to have party to lvl with. If not because of the mobs then because of other players  
---
\- You could not see other players levels or HP pools or casts or anything. Even when you were in the same party with someone all you could see was their HP,MP and buffs. So still no levels so you had to take their word for it.  
---
\- Making money in wow is piss easy compared.   
---
\- Crafting had 60% success rate  
---
\- Enchanting your weapon had 60% sucess rate. When you failed the whole weapon broke and weapons were behind hundreds of hours of grind.   
---
\- No instances so you had to rely on your clan.  
---
\- NO factions which ment you were never safe. There was no one on your side except your clan mates. Since there was no instances and the FFA PvP you had to PvP for grinding spots.
---
So the whole social experience that we praise here for Vanilla was actually bigger in other games. I would say Lineage 2 was the last old school mmorpg that hit it big and was all about the social experience.
---
This went a lil longer than intended but damn that was a good game! WoW is better in some ways and is a lot more accessible and at current life situation I cant even start playing L2 because of the time investment but oldschool L2 will always have a place in my heart.

hype
---
You aren‚Äôt wrong, but I sense there is a hope that WoW classic sets certain precedents going forward that help with WoW properties as a whole. 
---
Obviously it isn‚Äôt a 1 to 1 comparison, but what OSRS did for Runescape was a pretty big deal. If Classic WoW is even half as successful as that (and only time will tell, the ‚Äúnewness‚Äù certainly inflates numbers), I think it could very well find itself in a position to be the vehicle of some degree of ‚Äúrevival‚Äù. But, for sure, the time to really measure that is months, if not years off.

\- You could not see other players levels or HP pools or casts or anything. Even when you were in the same party with someone all you could see was their HP,MP and buffs. So still no levels so you had to take their word for it.
---
\- Making money in wow is piss easy compared. 
---
\- Crafting had 60% success rate
---
\- Enchanting your weapon had 60% sucess rate. When you failed the whole weapon broke and weapons were behind hundreds of hours of grind. 
---
\- No instances so you had to rely on your clan.

It's unsurprisingly addicting playing around with this. Thank you!

seems like the curses from the haunted servitors in sfk aren't summoning spirits as often as they should be
---
I had it unbound since it gave me anither easy to use bind and didn't need it in pvp. If you play pve i see the purpose of it.
---
You can't be serious. You think because one user submits a bug report that they will just accept that as fact and not double check with their 1.12 client at their office to see whether the numbers are correct or not? Please. A lot of people will submit incorrect bug reports over the course of the beta due to incorrect pserver values and misinformation - obviously they will check and compare with their real client first.

Man it's a **huge** difference. Not in just the world itself, but in whole class balance and systems and in general *how things work*. Classic is the nuts and bolts that held everything together as a core concept of the game; modern/normal is something that has grown so much it's lost all identity of what it was originally (both player, and game identity are gone, it's a button-mashing loot-mill where everyone is the same, and social interaction is completely non-existent because players are "merged" from different servers based on zone population).
---
Other than some names, some general terms, some cartoony graphics and perhaps the UI elements -- Classic is a totally different game than retail.
---

I wonder if anyone who thinks mobs are dying too easily have compared health to things like 2006 exports from the mobinfo mod. It wouldn't be perfect, but it would be another data point to check.

It may just be that people really know how the game works now.

I'll still be going fury and tanking dungeons as I level.
---
Well, there's a lot more talents for starters. That completely and permanently changed class builds/combos. Even pre-Outlands (at level 41) you could dip into TBC talents for example.
---
There's a few people already that got into the beta that didn't have an active sub.
---
It might not have been intended originally, but that's how it was in vanilla.

If memory serves there was a rare boss in LBRS that dropped the pattern for arcanite reaper. Stealth to him, get a kill, get the pattern, sell it for a small fortune.
---
I count pre-patches as part of an expansion considering they have all expansion content in the files/databases (including items mounts and spells), but each to their own. :D
---
Found the right answer.
---
Yea usually if I'm not in M+ I'm farming tmog or achieves (farming towards 30k) and since the beta went live I've had zero interest in playing anything else.  I don't plan on playing retail at all anymore other than maybe the AH to pay for a token each month so working towards progressing my retail account with tmog, achieves and RIO score seems pointless now. 
---
The optimistic me thought all the bugs I reported in BfA beta and forum feedback I provided might have meant I'd get Classic beta access but no such luck. I suppose all Blizzard want are streamers to get the hype train going.
---
I'm going to be checking bnet 10 times a day until the 27th :(
---
But having 20 horses in your backpack does make sense?
---
Oh yeah I remember that people where so mad about the normalization of attack power and weapon speed :D I was to young to really understand and I felt like I almost hit as much anyway so didn't care for it.
---
Are people complaining that it's too high, or too low?
---
I remember having to eat or bandage after every 2-3 fights.
---
Having to force close the game to drop out of perma combat is a bug that has been around for over a decade. And exists STILL in BFA happening no less than twice a day. They can't fix that, what the hell do you honestly think they are going to fix in this beta? lmao
---
Can also confirm, just happened to me today on a lvl 10 lock
---
They needed some other debuff associated with switching instead of a mana cost.  Rogues have lots of great abilities that require a cooldown, so you're often changing your action based on what's available.
---
Agree that rogues was in their worst state in vanilla in 1.12, but they were still really damn strong and you could still kill naked if you wanted to.
---
Adding that this would never happen in a real scenario, since you'd never have two Tauren players fighting other than duels. So for all other instances of PvP, it's half what you see.
---
Also this hitbox/reach difference only affects players, not NPC Tauren.
---
You stole my line :) Agree 100%
---
Yeah, i kinda wish this closed beta had nda. 3 months of teasing are going to be painful.
---
Yes it was, have you played pservers at all? That spot between Durotar and Barrens have always had this issue on all the pservers I've been playing on.
---
I love you.
---
I love you both
---
Big boost to warrior levelling!
---
This is what happens when people like tipsout and the other "content" creators who were 6 when Classic was live get Beta invites.
---
You don't need to re-sub, just have a Blizzard account that is opted in to the Classic beta.
---
Could you link him doing that?
---
It also runs on an onion, though the tears might disturb you somewhat.
---
I knew these posts were coming, your memory was wrong deal with it.
---
Hahaha
---
a warlock player said that mobs armors are lower and magic resist are higher than private servers, any1 talks about that?
---
their red circles are overlapping thats why
---
On a higher populated server it is really challenging to win, but also seriously rewarding. Did it back in wotlk and still took me like 4 tries. So probably much more competition in vanilla. Watervalking potions and swiftness potions + having your hs set to booty bay wehere the turn in is, is a must.
---
Don't worry. Only 101 days to go.

---
I know multiple people have told you this already but it isn't BS and it was abusable to figure out what would drop in a raid ID. 
---
You'd log in ASAP after reset outside any raid, walk in and try link the item you're after, if it DCd you then you reset the raid. Repeat until you didn't DC and that item was guaranteed to drop in that raid, then you just sit in the ID till your guild clears it. 
---
Was huge in TBC to warglaive farm.
---
Has this been confirmed by any legit source? Everything else has been pointing to needing an active sub for invite.
---
Oh man, the subtlety rogue trait in legion must have been great for that mindset.
---
Well the suits behind the Activision Blizzard - they do not care about anything except the income. They carefully analyzed the marked it clearly showed that Classic does have a potential to be profitable. So that's where WoW developers comes in. Believe it or not they still care, at least some of them are. And they would do whatever is in their power to make sure we enjoy it to the fullest when it comes out.

ooohhh shit thats whats up fuckin thanks I'll sign up regardless in that case

When kiting to the back left on hunters they seem to go into this weird back peddle animation. It‚Äôs hard to explain but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has come across this issue.
---
You arent wrong. All I can say is that the team working specifically on classic has been very communicative with the community. There are tons of recent interviews and plenty of blueposts.
---
It will be warrior 1st then rogues and mages close then hunter and warlocks close, then priest then paladins and druids close then shaman
---
do we need people to be testing instead, the ones that were bitching about regen rates being wrong in the bug thread (ones probably that weren't even in beta)? but I guess that ruins the shit on streamers bandwagon, so carry on
---

Not a real RPer. :P

I'm gonna level prot and deal with it.

Yo, reading this thread after all this was cleared up is wild... People going absolutely crazy with the conspiracy theories in a BETA. Its crazy how a beta is for finding bugs and yet people flip out as soon as they are found. Amazing....

Every FPS/MMO I've ever played I unbind 1234 as primary and only use them for secondary skills (Shouts, Evocation, Res, etc). But I've always kept WASD for movement, and rebind absolutely everything around it to skills.
---
QERFCXZ is main skills, Shift+QERFCXZ is alternates. Other big hitters are on the mouse thumbs (stances, etc). Also 99% of keybinding efficiency is skill at knowing how to macro. You can distill multiple key-binds into one conditional macro (for example Warrior's Revenge and Overpower can be on the same hotkey, regardless of whether it's on your stance bar or not).

No idea what cosmos is and I played vanilla. Granted I was basically a kid so I don't even remember if I had Addons lol

You will find a spot for both. Pally is a one button trick, likely tank healing mana battery. Priests got a few heals less mana more versatile. I've played both, would not play pally again for raiding.

There should be a tradeoff associated with flying, so that sometimes you'd not fly.  Or an additional bit of game that concerns the player if they decide they need to fly.
---
Perhaps mounts should require feeding, and the food is costly?  Perhaps they prefer food that exists only on mountain tops, giving you additional milestones during your flight to the next zone.
---
Mounts require rest and can only fly so much per day?  Mounts are happier if kept near flight masters, and get a speed boost if you leave them there?

---
srry replied to wrong person I just logged in and opted in idk if I'll actually get one but we'll see. From what I read it says you need to have an active sub or have time played on that account.
---
I think in a hypothetical world if they were able to give people the literal client straight from the end of vanilla except with less crashes and people would still bitch about stuff being wrong. Like realistically
---
Its pretty obvious HP regen is bugged. Here in my opinion is sufficient proof. In the clip below Asmongold a level 21 Human warrior regens 283 hitpoints over the course of 18 seconds. That is 78hp/per5seconds. Rank 3 renew which is obtained at level 20 heals for 175hp over 15 seconds. Thats 58hp/per5. The best food available at this level restores 115Hp/per5. Why would a warrior EVER buy food? I mean this is clearly broken. I'm attempting to find original footage to back this up as on the classic beta forums they list warrior health regen as something they don't think is a bug.

I've also been trying this for the last 2 months or so. Hoping 8.2 will be good enough to re-invigorate my M+ enjoyment and all I've figured out is that the specs in BfA are watered down version of the same template with the largest difference between specs being purely visual.
---
Made me real sad thinking about how healers used to be legitimately different with Holy Power for Paladins, Chi and stances for Mistweavers, HoT's for Druids etc and now having gotten them all to 120 and into 10-18's in M+ I've noticed how similar and thus boring all the healers are. Druids for example, are the HoT healer and yet in any heavy healing situation a spammable casted heal (Regrowth) is 60%+ of all healing. Mistweavers in M+ are nothing but Vivify/Enveloping bots, Priests are non-viable for any group/affix/dungeon that needs actual healing etc.  
---
Realizing all of that made me sad for the state of retail but also extremely hyped for Classic thinking back to SL/SL locks, 2H Enhance Shamans, Warriors with stances back and so on. Specs being \*different\* from one another has me checking my launcher every hour. 
---
I might be more excited for 8.2 and overall happier with BfA if I played specs that had strong/interesting Azerite traits but the ones I do play (all healers) except for Glimmer on Hpals are forgettable, uninteresting, weak and don't affect gameplay.
---
You‚Äôd lvl with the standard pvp spec regardless of sit macros. The speed difference boils down to almost nothing either way. 
---
Go standard pvp mortal strike with axe spec. Don‚Äôt go improved heroic strike.

It actually still works with spell batching [https://youtube.com/watch?v=TpwJ46vbIdc&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://youtube.com/watch?v=TpwJ46vbIdc&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Yeah, ive seen some randos in streams and on reddit make that claim too. Ive also heard stories of people claiming GMs confirmed the opposite.
---
Do you think it will would to be crippling without escape artist though?
---
I mean some things have to be sacrificed for gamesake but if you're /that/ concerned with realism we could always only carry a small amount of stuff and spend a week downtime between each fight to recuperate from our injuries.
---
Some mistakes here and there and the images are kind of a mess but it is neat to see everything laid out like this anyway.
---
Warriors and paladins are hardest to lvl up.
---
Warriors because they have a lot of downtime between each npc kill and they are at real risk of dying if they pull 2 mobs. And because their damage comes from auto attacks it means they kill quite slowly. Warriors cast charge then some choose to use rend some dont and simply auto attack and dump rage with heroic strike which means they attack once every 2.9-3.6 seconds depending on weap speed. At 40 things are sped up a bit due to mortal strike being an instant cast dmg spell.
---
Paladins are the same as warriors with one advantage and 1 inconvenience. They are slow from 1 to 60 and do not have the lvl 40 spell that warriors have to increase their killing speed. However theit advantage is that they are safer and won't die as easily as warriors due to heals, buffs and the gazilian immunities they have.
---
Wasn't that always the standard build though? Anyone who plays Arms without that is nuts.
---
Na I like to see my character, not that I really RP or anything but I design a story to the character.
---
I like this.
---
The reason this can still work is that with spell batching, it reads the crit received while they are sitting as if they were standing. So if you sit macro enough times you will proc Enrage, Blood craze, and reckoning.
---
Fuck, it's only been 3 days?

---
*Press (zug) to doubt*
---
Ah the memories.. And some bored mid 30s horde dropping by from STV to wreck some lowbies with everyone trying to kill them together. Good times.
---
It's the last point that really changes things. Improved demo shout, Blood Craze and Bloodthirst makes it so much easier and quicker to level. People say Blood Craze is a meme, but it's basically around 10+% evasion for 3 skill points, which is crazy good. People don't use demo shout (because they play arms and can't afford it) but it cuts mob damage by a quarter to a third, which again is pretty major. It's just not very flashy since having a mob hit you for 12 instead of 16 seems so minor.
---
Then you look at the damage talents. Fury has Cruelty (which is 2h spec but better) and then Flurry and Enrage which only Sweeping Strikes comes close to being as effective. People talk about the miss rate making dual-Fury bad, but when calculated with similar gear the dps for dual comes out slightly ahead even with the miss rate. And then you add the bonus hit chance from heroic strike and it's fairly superior. Also, Fury can alternatively go Slam build at 30+, which is a nice temporary speed boost.
---
I used to be all on the Arms train myself, but after actually putting time into testing it I came to the conclusion that Fury is just better. The best reason to go Arms is if you plan on kite-grinding, but pulling that off effectively for 100+ hours is beyond what most people can do.
---
Call me a mad man but I might try to level Prot just so I have a higher chance of getting into dungeons. My fondest memories were slowly losing people later in the evening and eventually finishing a dungeon with 2-3 people.
---
The classic team is doing everything they can to preserve the state of this game. Yes, they have to make some changes we all can't agree on, but overall they are fucking killing it. Its up to you if its worth the price, we can't change your mind on that. You either wanna play bad enough you are willing to give blizzard money or you dont.

You don't get a beta invite via email, you don't even get notified if you get in by email.

Except they didnt. That just your headcanon. Some human are prejudice against the horde but it not out of racism but literally because their home got obliterate by the horde.
---
Vanilla having people you actually know means that at some point you might run into that character who ganked you at a lower level and now it is your chance to get revenge. Of course you will take it because it feels personal!
---
it almost always happens if you're not an idiot.
---
yup the blades edge arena thing happened to me too
---
And yet they get dumbstered by everyone in dueling and world pvp. Even in bgs they are not the greatest unless the person playing them has a healer beside them, aka a pala or a priest. Am pretty sure a lot of people are getting this impression that warriors are the gods of vanilla and will be very surprise when they roll the class and see how much they'll get trashed by everyone.
---
Even in pve its is very questionable if they are the best damage class overall as mages become stronger by naxx, warlocks depending on spec are either next to them or slighly above, rogues are slightly below. In t1/2 content they usually dominate dps meter tho
---
And tanking is uncontested as warrior kings
---
Probably to low. I remember having to eat or bandage A LOT also
---
This isn't even a real server it's an invite only PVP sandbox for private server NEETs of course it's going to be a cesspool
---
? He's correct, Hunters were nothing against a good rogue.
---
I'm pretty sure that's how it was in vanilla. It was never ever recommended to take in levelling guides. The version where it works as long as some of your damage kills it is just a private server thing.
---
Want to point out that it was introduced in Legion yeah :)
---
Same with tanks too. 
---
[This was basically how people reacted to seeing tanks or healers in vanilla.](https://youtu.be/Mk82SU2hj5Q)
---
I feel like too many poeple feel like blizz is beyond redemption in any form, but the classic team is full of great people. I understand if you don't want to support it.
---
It's a magic bag and magic bread.  
---
It's alot different than, "hold on Mr. furbolg, I know we are in the midst of an epic battle, but let me sit down for a second as it will make me so mad, I'll get enraged."
---
You basically have to find a heal hybrid buddy. Well, you don't HAVE to. But it's extremely encouraged.
---
you'll see streamers say they got in without having active accounts because influencers get free stuff. It's an incredibly cheap ad for bliz to run, giving a beta account that costs nothing to someone who wasn't subscribed but has a substantial following
---
I also agree with this. They should pretty much only do it for the first 2 or 3 days. After that the layers jeoprodize everything.
---
In my retail guild we had people in your situation in our Australian guild. All I can say is play oce while your there and realm transfer and be the new kid on an American realm when you go back. Realm transfers between us and aus are possible in retail I don't see why they won't be once that service goes live.
---
I didn't really get fixed until BC arena where Taurens could reach around/through pillars. Without Arena it's kinda just a nice racial bonus. Much like gnomes being small and hard to target.
---
Maybe early +spirit calculation was off. 
---
On pservers a warrior's strongest stat until about level 30 is spirit because it gives mad regen. At level 17-23 with the pig man's +spirit from the trapped guy in Camp Taurajo who gives +25 spirit you regen 6-10% health per tick. You never need to eat between mobs.
---
I think this actually is what he is referring to. Seems like this is intended to compensate for the rogue v. caster scenario he proposed where it is very easy for a rogue to jump around and spin while getting damage off while making is very difficult to line up sight for a spell from the caster. Blizzard has to take in to account latency and what not as well, but  there is definitely room for criticism as far as the compensation for caster's line of sight forgiveness goes. I'd say this is what the beta is for and any discussion definitely helps.
---
Fuck em, let's steal their names.
---
But that robe has such good stats!
---
Is parkour considered PvE?
---
A lot of people are seeing the real face of streamers. It's glorious.
---
This time around we might get to see beartanks in raids though, since the pservers have helped shift the meta. Nevertheless, great info man :)
---
So many primary colours. I love it
---
I believe there were a couple other options over the past ten years that were considered more optimal because of the p-server meta.
---
Darkshore and Duskwood all the way!
---
Sweet I already have a pocket priest I‚Äôm leveling with.
---
ok
---
I personally plan on trying to hit higher level at a decent pace, but not rushing it. I'm gonna end up doing a ton of dungeons and working on prof's and trying to make gold. Epic ground mount is gonna be priority.
---
Really? Every warrior I played with on pservers leveled as arms for better world pvp, hamstring swing timer kiting and a few specific aoe grinding spots after level 40.
---
Not really what I am thinking off, but w/e. 
---
theres no need to port most addons and those that dont work  will not work the same anyway.

&gt;come up with new narrative
---
lul.
---
All I can say is be prepared for a grind.  But at the end of it that grind will feel like one of the most rewarding things ever. It's one of few online games where my guy that i played FELT like he was earned. Best time to start? By far!
---
My friend works for Blizzard and he keeps taunting me saying he has the beta but cba to log in =‚Äò(
---
I felt exactly the same way. Some of the stuff I read really put a smile on my face.
---
It's a shame that they didn't say that the WC boss was doing the correct amount of damage but I suppose that would almost be to directly of a call out to that one streamer.
---
Nope, came in wotlk i believe
---
You just shout out, dibs on name
---
It's stupid shit like this that made vanilla wow so fun ;D
---
&gt;Try out engineering, alchemy, or enchanting even, these professions offer unique and powerful buffs and items that can not just make leveling easier, but really fun. Some of them might even stop a gank, like "Swiftness Potions" or "Spider Belt". Make some grenades, set your sword aflame, or add some ice to keep enemies from running away in fear.
---
Note, when you do get 60 professions are very very important. Where as in the last several expansions they've been mere footnotes. Alchemy is literally PvP/Raiding heroin fuel. Crafting is super important as many hurdles are resist/reputation based. Consumables at this point had not yet been unified(right? could be wrong.) So everything that gives a buff is super valuable.
---
LFG was literally implemented at the tail-end of LK - like Patch 3.3 / 3.4.. you could have at least said flying.
---
Either way I find it patronizing that you think my memories are clouding judgement. You are literally pulling a ‚Äúyou think you do, but yoy don‚Äôt‚Äù on me. All I know is I will be there for BC and LK if they go on to that, and I most likely wont touch WoW with a 10ft pole if they start changing things.
---
Heck the only reason I am 100% keen on Classic / BC and LK is because I played them and know what they will be. I wont be going in with false expectations... if they took Classic in a new direction - people would expect a lot from Blizzard and I don‚Äôt have faith they can pull it off.
---
Hes on here.
---
Wonder if he will defend himself.
---
Probably not. Unfortunately a lot of these streamers are shady. I started combing through their videos and many of them are full of misinformation...on purpose.

&gt; Being critically struck while using /sit to sit does not cause abilities like Enrage, Blood Craze, and Reckoning to activate.
---
So I suppose this means it is a bug that you CAN actually /sit proc enrage through in the beta version.
---
Might have been BC because I had a human lock some time before WOTLk and remember picking human over gnome for that talent.
---
You mean ganking someone half hp? Jeah thats not a 1v1 situation also every class has the upside if you fight someone with half your hp
---
Im not saying rogues are bad or not playable he just said rogues were the best 1v1 class by a longshot which is just not true
---
One of the reasons I am planning to roll a druid is because there will be a lot of warriors on release. I can go into a zone and ask, "any warriors want to quest with a healer?" and be fairly confident that I will always be playing with someone.
---
As someone who originally didn't like warrior, but grew to love them over time, I wanted to try and offer counter points to some of your gripes.
---
&gt; Part of it is that I just really dont like their class fantasy.
---
The only true 'berserker' class fantasy is the fury spec.  The rest have quiet a bit of interpretation in them.
---
IMO, the class fantasy for Arms is supposed to be more along the lines of a weapon master.  Someone so skilled and in control of themselves that they can be both brutally offensive and cautiously defensive in how they approach a battle.
---
Protection is a bit more muddied in the class fantasy aspect, but I often viewed it as someone who was about creating opening for their allies.  You are the one to distract the enemy to get them in a vulnerable position for your allies to capitalize on.
---
&gt; Part of it is stance dancing. It just seems like such a pain to try to figure it all out and play with.
---
I can understand why you wouldn't enjoy this aspect of Warriors.  It was such a prevalent issue with players that they eventually got rid of stances.  They do take some time to get used to, but are very rewarding once (if) you do.  
---
Also, stance dancing isn't required most of the time.  PvP is really the only place where it is a true requirement, where as PvE will have you sitting in your spec's stance 99% of the time.
---
&gt; And part of it is that I just fear that warriors, with them being the very best in not one, but two roles (tanking and melee dps)....
---
I wouldn't buy *too* much into this.  While Warriors were **the** tank in vanilla, warrior dps was considered sub-par to bad in early tiers.  It wasn't until Naxx that warriors were considered strong in vanilla.  
---
Private servers have warriors as the best overall dps, but they also didn't have the proper armor values; something that can drop physical dps very quickly.  It is possible that better play/builds will cause warriors to be good/the best in early tiers still, but I am willing to bet that they will be middle of the pack to low early on.
---
Lastly, you forgot PvP.  Warriors are monsters in PvP if they have some backup, but are very vulnerable to being kited if they are alone.
---
&gt;....that so many of them will simply act like elitists toward everyone else.  And that's the last thing I want to be labelled as.
---
Every group will have this issue.  Some people are just jerks, but word does get around in vanilla.  As long as your are cool, you shouldn't have any issues with this type of thing.
---
&gt; I really dont want to play a warrior.
---
At the end of the day, that is fine.  Some people can't stand healing because they feel like they spend more times looking at bars than interacting in the raid.  But there are some people who love it for the unique challenge it brings.  
---
Play what makes you happy, but I hope my points will put the Warrior in a slightly better light for you.
---
That's EXACTLY where I hit 60 too. I can still play those last few yeti kills back like a movie in my head.
---
Asmongold has a ton of spirit in that clip from his staff though, spirit is strong yo

Interesting, wonder if mage is so high because of Skorch?

Or ignore them and play your God damn game. Ohh no they got their mounts and epics gifted who cares. Throne the crowed of people and do your own thing , there will be plenty of people doing the same.
---
Yeah, well, I've been playing vanilla for 14 years now and I didn't get in because I don't have an active account in their newest expansion. So, I'm not sure Blizzard wants accurate bug reports at all.
---
this isnt a fucking livestream subreddit
---
Haha
---
I genuinely dislike this guy.
---
&gt;together since April of 2015
---
&gt;we have raided mainly Vanilla content
---
looks like a respawn tbh.
---
Imo they don't fill a layer then wait for it to be full and then switch to another layer.
---
They spawn layer according to the flow of people connection, trying to determine the optimal number of layer and then spread  people into them. After few days, they can tighten the number of layer.
---
Convenience factor, easy, highly sought after
---
This is like a Twilight Zone episode conclusion but then you show up at the library and it's dedicated to classic WoW.
---
No, and you'll come to appreciate the increased reputation humans get.
---
Taurens are the dopest race, sincerely an alliance player.
---
'cuz, in vanilla, Paladin just spams one button and calls it a day. Priest, at least, has several different buttons/heals they can hit, depending on a situation. 
---
Classic Paladins only have Flash of Light/Holy Light for healing. there are fights where their utility via Blessing of Sacrifice/Freedom can come in handy, but, you're gonna be spamming a single heal for a large majority of your raiding career.
---
When he made videos in the beginning it was ok, now hes just annoying the fuck out off me
---
I wish being grossly uninformed was his only problem.  Unfortunately he's also a shit.
---
Oh well i‚Äòm a bad person! That‚Äòs why i play stuff like greedy warrior! üòÖüíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Man, I just woke up in Europe. Saw this as trending on my phone from bed.
---
Thinks *oh more invites, maybe I got one*
---
Rush to computer to check my client. Nope.
---
Finally actually come and read the post itself.
---
Well played.
---
You should buy water as a leveling Mage
---
This must be your first time playing with Russians.  That's just how they are man, played DotA for a decade I know.  This is a better argument for region locking than anything else.  Rofl
---
Definetly. The two games cant really be compared at all.
---
This will be one of the few positive things about playing on oceanic servers.
---
We have very few semi-popular streamers and no 10k+ streamers
---
Ya but higher than Warrior and Rogue? interesting. I def thought it would be 3rd, close to or tied with rogue
---
I think what people are remembering from classic that looked similar to this was zones "sleeping" when they were emptied out. When nobody was in an area it would 'sleep' and respawn timers advance and sort of soft reset. We used to take advantage of this with mob farms clearing an area, vacating it, and mobs with long timers would all pop back right away.
---
You can use mouseover macros with the addon Clique on private servers. Not sure if Clique was there in vanilla as I can only find that it was released in 2008.
---
Blizzard is aware and said they hope to have it fixed before the weekend. 
---
I personally haven‚Äôt had any issues with it on the beta. Have leveled to 15 twice now practicing for launch. 
---
Hopefully Blizzard stays true to their word and completely removes it after a few weeks after launch.
---
Did you say FREE MONEY?
---
I mean I really fucking hate all of these guys, but this is not the typical PvP group for a classic server. These guys are turbo-nerds on private servers.
---
Also in retail: you have less then 15-20 spells total lol.
---
in today's episode of "the west is too feminized to take a joke anymore"
---
With the recent Blue post stating /sit is confirmed not to proc Enrage mechanics, this seems like it is not working as intended.
---
You get the hang of it eventually. You *need* a swingtimer to make greatest use of it. 
---
Without you often sit down when you want to swing, losing substantial DPS.
---
You need to want to be a true support player. Ask yourself honestly, am I okay knowing the best plays I make may go unnoticed if they lead to an Alliance victory?
---
Paladins are hands (heh) down the best support class in Classic, and arguably the worst support at doing anything but supporting.
---
Ret is 100% meme and ranking is only done while leveling or out gearing content. Holy is life. If that's you, please PM me where you roll and your character name.
---
Michael Jackson, Margaret Thatcher, same difference. Two crazy white women.
---
The blizzard servers will have more players playing from the getgo than nostralius, that's a fact.
---
There's at least a million people out there who doesn't want to play on shitty private servers &amp; have just been waiting for this.
---
Layering will be required in the beginning, that's a fact.
---
How it's working here is not how it's intended. HENCE THE FUCKING BETA WHERE PEOPLE BETA TEST.
---
My man, this is pretty much how i‚Äôve done it for years.
---
If you plan to PvP A LOT i'd actually not roll lock ally side, horde PvPers are almost always largely Orc and UD. Orcs are fine but UD are able to break all your forms of CC and then become immune to them for 5 seconds and it doesn't share a CD with the CC trinket.
---
I was a human lock in vanilla and did the R11 grind and it's frustrating as hell when you enter a BG and see 50%+ of the enemy can sit on you until you die, not to mention UD locks just CC locking you to death even if you fully open on them first because they get to freecast and you get to run around headless.
---
Streamer viewership is booming lol wtf are you talking about?
---
By hitting "X", the command for sit/stand at the perfect moment, Esfand is able to trigger crits to enable reactive ability procs in beta. Thought only possible in private servers
---
When I was practice running a Warrior 1-20 I‚Äôd spend all my travel time backpedal grinding to the next quest location.
---
nice website!
---
Yes it is. People are also seeing a different side of streamers, especially as they fatigue.
---
Mask of the Unforgiven; you should be able to two-man stealth it.
---
I have tried leveling warrior and I dont understand, why are people calling it slow and hard. Its true, that you have limited survival capability when aggroying more mobs, however the leveling process is smooth, if you play smart and keep up good weapon. You will have to eat / use bandage after every 3th-4th pull tho, which isnt that bad, considering you are pulling 1 target at a time.
---
Choosing how I want to do professions is my toughest decision.
---
Hi, /u/Lasivian
---
It was so funny he couldn't even get the words out. Rofl
---
the anti back pedal circlejerk is one of the dumbest thing from try-hard WoW players.
---
The more savvy community members who would participate in a poll like this probably know that in this patch rogue is toned down while lock is a dueling god and scales into great raid damage.
---
Insects and Arachnids were included due to there being no connection to the Old Gods in vanilla. I guess I should have just painted the connection red.
---
I would also like to jump in here as I am also trying to decide between the two.
---
I watched a vid by Preacher that said mana for healing priests was a massive problem in raids, which would force you to more often than not, have to wait between heals for the 5 second rule or they would go oom VERY quickly. Is this accurate?
---
I much prefer chain casting...doing something ALL the time. Would paladin suit this playstyle better and would priest just frustrate me in the end?
---
the laughs were annoying and goblin like, but I like the passion and hype, people yell at football players on TV for fucks sake.  2:14 STOP THE SOULFIRE, JESUS CHRIST STOP THE SOULFIRE, FUCK ME IT'S A 25 SECOND CAST. EZ laffs.
---
Maybe in a limited time event but no leave it as is.
---
NO CHANGES!
---
These particular crocodiles &amp; in that area is intended to phase like this, they did in vanilla and this is on every single private server as well.
---
Figured we could use a break from bitching about Tipsout and crying over beta invitez
---
They seem to be going through various phases of grief, mostly denial..
---
Im sure blizzard likes being associated with this guy
---
This is intended. It happened in vanilla too.
---
Found the new guy.
---
This behavior is intended and is not phasing/layering.
---
Out of that entire group of Esfand / Asmongold orbiters, Tipsout seems like the most egregious.
---
It is though. I played mage for all of vanilla. i can asure you, that this was the norm while fighting meele classes
---
Your wrong, you need an active sub to PLAY the Beta but not to get an invite!
---
Heh.. I have reported lots of bugs on private servers and they were ignored because I couldn't "prove" it was broken.. going to try out Classic just to see if it works correctly again.
---
So who here remembers that if you left loot (after looting) on mob for more than x seconds (on retail), that loot would be available to everybody, including the other faction?
---
For me the choices are Herb / Alch or Eng / Mining
---
Don‚Äòt care about this guy but it was a little joke. Fucking entitled sjw people who can‚Äòt handle a simple joke nowadays are making me sick.
---
A Blizzard employee literally said on an old blizzcon panel ‚Äûif a player is too bad for your raid kick him out‚Äú i don‚Äòt even wanna imagine the outrage of crybabies when he would say this nowadays.
---
Its something every private server has in common. It's just there. Not something they actively set up.
---
These crocs and at that area, they "phased" like this, but this is not phasing as all you new people know it. This is intended and 100% working as it should.
---
Paladin is a one-button spec. Seriously. You just push Flash Heal. That's it. Oh, and keep buffs up every fifteen minutes. Otherwise, you're just spamming Flash Heal to the top of the HPS charts.
---
Hillarious to read how redditors know for sure that their own 15 year old memory is more accurate than Blizzards 1.12 reference client.
---
This is such bullshit lmfao
---
Skinning when leveling, drop it at 60 and then get mining/engineering. Think of it like this: absolutely everybody will try to get the same resources at the start. It will also cut into your leveling time. At least skinning is available as you're killing mobs, and it will give you some decent amount of gold too.
---
When you're 60 you have your mount, which means it's way faster to look for nodes. And you won't have to worry about killing the mobs by then either.
---
You are suppose to kite this boss... Lol It is not a bug and is intended. People who just tank through it have no idea how to does this encounter.
---
It's intended. Don't comment if you're new to classic/vanilla &amp; haven't played back then.
---
Definitely took some time, appreciated this myself! Thanks
---
Changed the batteries on you hearing aid recently?
---
You guys need to stop this ‚Äòstop and smell the flowers‚Äô bullshit. We get it. You are not in here to rush anything. We fucking get it. Are you vegan too? Why not tell us about that aswell. This posts reminds me of the most cringy post on any subreddit ever. It‚Äôs a really really funny read which is why I will always save it :D
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azi98a/mindful_classic_the_way_im_gonna_play_it_whos/
---
This happens on all private servers, go on the biggest one there is now and check. It's intended for classic &amp; private servers.
---
It won't bring back reck pally, it's clearly a bug and will be fixed before release.
---
Really? Why not skinning/leatherworking?
---
Herb/alch have a better gold income?
---
Isn't it really good to craft your own gear during leveling?
---
Skinning and enchanting
---
Dont level enchanting tho (only for the wand maybe)
---
Nodes will not be farmable in the beginning and enchanting on lvl 1 lets you disenchant everything.
---
Enchanting mats are always good profit and skinning is self explaintory.
---
Ofc it depends on your plans.
---
Jeez if this is how all of you guys think I feel WoWClassic should just be quarantined. We wouldn‚Äôt want any normies getting in.
---
Lol I love the random humans sounds in the background "whoe"
---
Where PTR is.
---
It's under the tab selections; there will be a "Beta" category along with "Live" and "In Development".
---
In action: [https://clips.twitch.tv/FrailHomelyCardMcaT](https://clips.twitch.tv/FrailHomelyCardMcaT)
---
oh ok thanks so on the right side 
---
i thought it would be its own game on the left i wanted to clarify thanks
---
yes I agree, it is a bug and should be treated as such, anyone thinking this a "feature" is wrong
---
I dont think you will ever keep LW up to date without slowing down your leveling, if you don't care about speed then it should be fine but you will sacrifice a lot of leather just leveling up LW which is gold lost. 
---
As for Herb / Alch for me its for PvE
---
Not even close to free.
---
Nah I‚Äôm hyped for the next expansion for FFXIV so I‚Äôll be distracted aplenty. It‚Äôs going to be tough keeping up with both once Classic arrives.
---
How many hours ~ to max mining/engineering at level 60?
---
And just think, there are people who actually support this kind of stuff just so they don't have to compete over mobs.
---
Same here. No beta access for me so I started up on lights hope to get a feel of it all and to confirm that I‚Äôll be making lock or something else.
---
I would have thought so as well. 
---
It's possible we'll see it given its own spot once release comes around, but given that it's currently a wow dropdown, it'll probably stay there.
---
You can't have 2 gathering skills at the same time in vanilla
---
Even if you click in vanilla you deserve to be shamed. That shit is a waste.
---
Okay! Thank you
---
Ok, but this is currently how it does work.
---
Hope this stays
---
My fellow patricians down there at the bottom.
---
Do you work for blizzard?
---
I am not going to tell anyone how to play, but I do have a nagging worry in my head that goes like this:
---
There will be a significant group of players that will rush to 60 and get stuck into the endgame again. There will also be a group of players that try the game out, dislike the slow pace, and leave by level 30. There is a third group of players that will be taking their time, running dungeons, and not worrying too much about efficiency. These groups are probably not a complete list of players and there is some overlap between them, but most players fot broadly in in these
---
This, but ironically. I'd rather have 3k people all struggling to level than deal with this shit for more than a minute.
---
It really depends on how much resources you get, but my guess would be around 8 hours.
---
It‚Äôs spell batching and vanilla like.  Like other pros and cons of batching, this is one of the things that can happen
---
Most won't make it lvl 60. They will try the class, but in the end will find play style boring. Druids/ locks will be at the bottom like in vanilla/pservers.
---
I honestly take it a lot further than this. I'll bind some skills that aren't used commonly to virtual keys like F13-F24 (or Home/End, but this can interfere with chatting) and use Autohotkey to couple that virtual key with a regular key like QERFCXZ.
---
Then in game I'll bind that virtual key or Home/End/Etc in-game to something conditional, like for example a Revenge/Overpower macro. So pressing "E" could actually be pressing "E"+F13 every time I hit it. If F13 is Revenge/Overpower, it will only fire when it's valid. Otherwise it will just fire whatever "E" is. This is just a simple example, as these couples can get as complex as your scripting skill allows.
---
Basically you *never* miss a Revenge/Overpower when spamming other keys.
---
It's not exactly fair, but if a game is going to give me 40+ freaking skills/items/icons and things I have to click to work with, I'm going to do everything I can to distill all that down to QERFCXZ as much as possible.
---
Calm down shill.  They should really keep posting, until you can't post it, because it isn't an issue, because they fixed it.
---
Ahh I see, they needed to fill there content slots...
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt the hit sometimes crit????
---
Asmongold has no weps, his fist weapon skills are trash.
---
This is behaviour I would expect if they just quadrupled the max shard size and the underlying kubelet size and called it a day. Costs for new tech: $0, costs on increased shard size: $linear.
---
Racing to 60, esp if you are new is doing yourself a MASSIVE disservice.  Please don't listen to people who tell you, that you have to rush and min-max.  They are completely wrong!
---
Yep, should show right above that, friend showed me when he got invited.
---
Or you know do what you want.
---
Omg yes! I was having a lot of fun in Mordhau but ever since the beta opened up all I do is think about about classic and watch streams of beta on twitch with not much urge to play mordhau even  though I think it's a great game.
---
I never expected I‚Äôd come back to WoW. It was a footnote in my gaming life. Stopped after WotLK was released, and even before then, I was a dirty ‚Äòcasual‚Äô. Since the beta was announced and I resubbed just for a chance - and got in - I can‚Äôt stop thinking about WoW. Almost snuck out of bed when the wife and cat were asleep just to start it up again. Last time I felt this way was in 2004 during beta and at release. It was such a magical time. When they added all the expansions, it became a different game to the one I originally played and wanted to continue experiencing; it‚Äôs a large reason why I stopped playing and now without them - the main reason I keep wanting to return. All other gaming has ceased.
---
Haven‚Äôt heard of anyone who‚Äôs gotten an invite that hasn‚Äôt been playing on the same account since 2005
---
Didn't show the evidence, just the conclusion. But for the past hour he was reliably proccing crit effects from sitting in a pvp duel.
---
Except that since the starter zones are not contested you can only be attacked by enemy players if you attack them or flag yourself
---
Luckily it seems like combat text was not mentioned in the post sooo, old combat text incoming?!
---
No, I rather have this anyway.

I disagree. Because part of the reason for "classic" is the "classic feel" of not knowing what's going to happen. :)

This post is perfect. Turns out all the pserver hardcore nochangers were not spending their time experiencing the "real classic experience" anyway. We should whip this post out under every "im quitting classic wow to play in pserver because this is not an accurate recreation of classic wow" post after August release.
---
And just a month ago, everyone would call you a fearmongering pessimist for thinking they would do this, and guess what, you and I were right. Just like every other time Blizz moved the goalposts.
---
People are incredibly naive to think this "layering" will be gone after a month.
---
If Blizzard truly thinks this is the only solution to overpopulation, what are they going to do with the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj event? Of course they are going to use the same technology!

Be wary that only the normal grund mount is "free". Thec epic one is at the ebd og a very long and expensiv quest.

Comments aren't showing for some reason, but I have the evidence in a reply, guess I should have swapped the conclusion for the evidence in that regard.

Are you from the US? The game launched in Feb 2005 for EU, but have not heard of any EU subs from Feb 2005 getting an invite
---
Zero
---
Gnomergan is such an asshole the first time you do it lmao
---
i would certainly hope it gets its own spot on the left
---
No one knows. Seriously.
---
From what people report on reddit, if you want to count on that, it appears that older accounts are currently heavily favored, but it's impossible to tell if it's true and impossible to tell how low your chances actually are.
---
"Beta: WoW Classic" under the In Development category of that drop-down.
---
Nope, if you care to look at the comments, you will see just the nost team is what made classic happen not even blizzard is as important.
---
I would say it would be cheaper if everyone played wow classic, because those servers would be cheaper to run.  So they would probably prefer everyone just play classic, and they also wouldn't have to develop new content, but still rack in $15 a month.
---
Dire maul released like less than 2 months after US release, didn't it?
---
Literally no one but Blizzard can answer that and they never will.
---
I mean, the "NOT A BUG"-bluepoost clearly stated that passives not proccing from crits forced by sitting is intended. This only makes sense if forced crits from sitting are in fact a thing and intended.
---
There will be a significant group of players that will rush to 60 and get stuck into the endgame again. There will also be a group of players that try the game out, dislike the slow pace, and leave by level 30. There is a third group of players that will be taking their time, running dungeons, and not worrying too much about efficiency. These groups probably do not cover all players and there is some overlap between them, but a majority of players fit broadly in to these categories.
---
I think the worry of the third group is that they will be so out populated by the first two groups that it will actually be difficult for them to play the way they want to. Doing dungeons or low level BGs requires allies and enemies at a low level that are willing to spend time doing something other than levelling.
---
This fear is likely an irrational one, but that is not stopping me from having it and likely is not stopping others either. 
---
I hope this clarifies things for you.

Select your Classic account and look for the earliest payment.
---
What? He has free slots. I distinctly remember this actually being a thing, and not just on pservers.
---
Um ok. Not something that can be used to any great effect in pve or pvp and nothing like how the mechanic worked in vanilla or private servers. So... beta has bugs? Who knew...
---
100 days is a Goddamn long time.
---
This community thinks the nost team are gods so I don't think they will agree with you, anyone that isn't praising them gets downvoted, this is sadly the community we have here.
---
I'm more concered regarding the activity time.  If the priest can manage mana without too much having to wait around during a fight with mana potions, then priest will be fine.
---
I was hoping that layering would a fancy term for virtual servers, so basically exactly what you described but the different Illidan layers would all be handled by one server, and then they could remove the layers later.
---
If each layer is entirely self-contained and acts just like a server from the players' perspective, that would be great. The problem is that right now it's just sharding with a mask.
---
Yes, then we can worship them here annnd ingame!
---
Yeah. Bloodshot eyes and all.
---
That‚Äôs just referring to sitting and not standing up afterwards to proc the effect.  /sit /stand macros were a thing in vanilla to take advantage of batching
---
Right now yes but I have Bloodstained in June and Fire Emblem in July. :)
---
I know it sucks but at least for me, I have no interest in playing the Beta. I did a Mage 1-58 over the last few months at my own pace - might gear him up and mess around. 
---
But i‚Äôm more keen to get into release then dabble with the beta.
---
You search for groups in capitals/trade chat, /world and level appropriate zones. SFK is pretty common for alliance, decent drops and not that far from Southshore
---
I dont remember. I was talking about the planned phases for classic
---
You cant straight up double it. You are crazy if you think paladin is going to be the most played class.
---
I agree man. And for some of the quest content in vanilla, if you decide to do them, you are grouped with people you regularly meet during leveling. Which is fuuckin awesome. I miss that aspect alot!

The only reason why priests are more talked about is that you need more of them than holy paladins but holy paladins are still very much needed, also, paladin is faction specific so priest can be on either side which makes them appear more frequent.
---
In vanilla you couldn't track both herb and mining nodes at the same time.
---
Dunno if they'll change that QoL setting for Classic.
---
Yea obviously not in 1.12, it was patched out sometime through vanilla :) The comic just made me think of how my class could avoid fall damage (blinking before hitting the ground, light fall or ice block iirc)
---
Lower ranks of damage and healing spells are less mana efficient not more efficient. Unless you have a decent amount of +spell damage or +healing that is, but that‚Äôll only really happen at 60.
---
Oh ok
---
hype =/= sustainability
---
Thanks. 07.04.2005 ‚úå
---
doesnt know how to cast a healing spell, deserves to get layered into a shard.
---
For what its worth, the mob is bugged.  It spawns and just doesn't patrol at all.  The spawn point is further to the east then where he was checking, because 99.9% of people encounter the messenger on the road where it patrols after spawning.
---
Well not anymore, not after the chemicals in the water turned all the murlocs gay.
---
Really ? I play a ton on private servers and I guess I just haven't noticed . Maybe I don't bubble my self for fall damage as priest because I always carry light feathers .
---
My first add on was a ‚Äúkill on sight‚Äù thing that like made a noise when someone I had in its list was in my vicinity and then I believe played the mortal kombat music if I entered combat with them. Best add on ever
---
no that is not the consensus lol
---
I remember reading an interview when TBC came out (I cannot for the life of me remember where, it was 13 years ago) where the interviewers asked Blizzard developers if there were any plans to make new content for mid-level characters, like Maraudon. I cannot remember the answer (which probably means it was somewhat evasive) but the question really stuck out for me.
---
Imagine living in a world where it was not a joke to ask for new dungeons or zones for low level characters.
---
I started in tbc. Almost done with uni - om still a slacker idiot though.
---
ITT: People thinking Blizzard re-wrote entire classic WoW off a whim and mistyped regen health values. No, that's not how it works. They polished a 1.12 build and served it to you.
---
They haven't given any sort of time table for the phase releases, so to say 3 months is just completely unfounded.
---
Skinning and Mining whilst leveling (keep the ores).  
---
Blacksmith / Engineering at 60, you'll definitely want that fear immunity trinket from BS just to fuck with warlocks, warriors and priests and there's no real way to effectively use alchemy for the potions you'll need in bulk (Swiftness, free action, etc) without also taking Herb and the pots you need are tradeable/useable without the skill but the trinket from BS isn't and neither are engineering toys / grenades.
---
If you really want to tryhard there's no better combo for PvP than BS/Eng but you'll need a decent method of making money to sustain all the pots you'll use.
---
As a casual, take anything with Engineering. Eng has the most "bang for your buck" in terms of benefits to PvP in a single skill, then simply take mining and make your shit for free and sell it to lazy engineers and min maxers that spend 100% of their playtime PvPing.
---
Blizzard did state that they want a variety of players both new and old so I reckon you'll probably get in in one of those Stress Tests.
---
To be fair, it works.
---
I suppose it is easy to give testable, quantifiable advice on how to improve levelling efficiency. It is much harder to give testable, quantifiable advice on how to have fun.
---
I plan on playing a Paladin then power leveling some alts up to around 40. It's easier to do with two accounts but possible on a single account.
---
Yes but you Overpower with your main hand, making the increased dodge rate negligeble when attacking with a weapon dealing less damage since it's an instant attack.
---
Never heard of em but fun stuff. I like it.
---
Remember these guys its a big chance that they are the ones that kill Ragnaros world first!
---
Well eng and ench are not good for beginners of vanilla. It's time consuming and expensive especially while leveling. Some dungeons too are not worth it based on 1) proximity of dungeon to FPs 2) little or hard to gather quest lines 3) massive trash clearing with relative to leveling isn't wise.
---
I get these posts but this one leaves much to be desired.
---
Sad invites for this week are over prob.
---
Judgement technically has a range.
---
Also is it really vanilla if I‚Äôm not at 250 ping :/
---
I think they were saying that each server will develop their own streamers over time. Like, leta say you pick server X. People on twitch will see someone streaming with "Server X" in their title and flock to it. Before you know it, they're the most popular streamer on the server and your server now has a semi-popular streamer on it.
---
Last year I did some digging on that topic and found this https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Sit?oldid=249301 it's the first instance that mentions sitting not proccing stuff like that, it's from almost a month after 1.12's release, so it's possible that pre-1.12 you could in fact proc enrage etc by sitting and it was just never fixed/changed on private server cores
---
So the problem with a lot of these YouTubers is that they love reframing things in ways that are pretty silly and attention-grabby. To say that Priests have *a massive problem* with mana in Vanilla raids is hilarious.
---
You'll be using Greater Heal (rank 2) and Flash Heal (rank 4) most of the time, which means you won't be running out of mana.
---
If you have to do any more healing than that and you dip low, just hit the mana potion keybind and keep going. Mana potions don't have a long cooldown either.
---
If you're running Alliance you'll also have to Fear Ward. That's about it.
---
I dinged 60 in schoolomance, was awesome.
---
I got the email a good day and a half after the option in launcher.
---
YES!!! Mighty Alliance!!!
---
Too bad there is no such community already existing in some subreddit. /s
---
The Tauren hit box thing though is scuffed as hell. Saw a clip where 2 Tauren warriors pvpd and stood so far apart that they swinged their weapons and hit nothing but air.
---
The Tauren hit box was a bit larger yes, but not 4 times the actuall character size
---
This same thing happened to be yesterday, I just had to have a chance to get beta key ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Whoever made a comment in here I think you're shadowbanned.
---
idk man we will see I think this a bug, I don't remember doing that in vanilla
---
I really don't think there will be an equal amount. Especially if a streamer rolls on a pve server.
---
They will be back in their private servers in no time.
---
I remember the advice back in the "old days" was to get 2 Gathering Professions during Levelling and only worry about Crafting when you reached Max Level. 
---
I probably choose Skinning &amp; Mining.
---
Bind back pedal to like some obscure bind like alt+S. That way you can use it but you'll have to choose it.
---
Yeah I suppose that is the question. The not a bug post states /sit, and this was achieved using specific timing using the sit button, not the macro.
---
Yeah prob. From Last Wave. they did Rolling invites I think.
---
So far its pretty true. Soda horde + asmon alliance.
---
Staysafe and esfand alliance and tipsout horde... well this one might not be very balanced .
---
Stfu porfavor
---
this dmg in beta looks so fucking scuffed. Cloth wearer getting hit by 3 people still not even below half hp after 5 seconds.
---
I don‚Äôt really see how its any less fair then an MMO mouse or footpedals for your PC (I really want to find a set :P)
---
Nothing wrong, it sounds like a good setup. I might look into something similar myself when I make my War.
---
&gt; There is only so much a casual player can do in classic.
---
What? There's so much a casual player can do. Vanilla is still friendly for casual players, it's just going to be slower for them.
---
Anybody got a link and timestamp for the video?
---
Ever since Method started streaming their world first race, WoW was among top games during those times.
---
Besides, WoW in general is not really a good game to stream. Much of what people do there is repetitive. Would you watch someone grind mobs for hours upon hours or do Molten Core for 10th time? Classic will be a huge hit at start, but then will drop off, because while the game itself is amazing, there¬¥s difference between playing something and watching someone else play it.
---
Unless, of course, said someone can play the game while you can¬¥t. You know, like during closed Beta where streamers were given access.
---
Yeah. No.
---
It wouldn't crit sometimes because you have to time the "stand" action correctly to trigger it.
---
No, the entire reason for classic is a preservation project, as stated by Blizzard themselves.
---
They said they are open to ideas about classic+ servers or tbc tbc classic servers in the future, but the whole reason Classic to begin with was because people wanted an official vanilla server as it was.
---
I'm going undead, so I don't need that trinket should I keep mining and change skining for engineering?
---
There are already some people who are expecting it to be bigger than retail WoW. I‚Äôm not sure what would be bigger than that. 
---
So no, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be bigger than anyone has expected.
---
I never stopped
---
Take one for the team
---
Worst part of going back to vanilla for me will be every time I see a lot of the gear in this pic I think of BoA gear.
---
Whats rogues and noobs have in common?
---
Christ guys... It's a joke.
---
Probably zero.
---
Honestly if we get some old school changes in retail because of Classic it‚Äôs a step in the right direction. 
---
It‚Äôs not us vs them, if retail benefits from Classic then everyone is a winner.
---
Huh, I can't really remember that. Strange what stays and what doesn't, but that does sound a lot better.
---
Yeah, all these pserver players comparing the beta to BFA really shows how wrong they were.
---
The ? Arrow is pointing to where it should be if you get it.
---
Im gonna be rolling holy paladin myself. Can wear everything from plate to cloth, can tank dungeons if needed, bubble for those "oh shit" moments, blessings, great survivability while levelling and free mount.
---
Warlock was one of the least played classes in Vanilla.. but that was due to them being Mushrooms (weak) for until around ZG Patch I believe. Hence the natural population was low.
---
This time will be different, people know how strong and fun the class is, how much utility it brings and also shines on the Raid DPS charts after BWL.
---
Thanks for this. I am also considering the exclusivity of healing plate, vs competing for gear with casters. Or do Pallys adopt cloth as preferred healing gear?
---
So you can buy stuff from my GDKP runs I host.
---
No. He's a blue post listing some things that are not bugs which are being frequently reported.

I was thinking exactly the same thing. I dont want to watch BFA i just wanna see Classic streams and it's a bit annoying scrolling through everything and mouseovering over titles to check. Let's tweet @twitch maybe they will do it !
---
Honestly I'm more surprised that a level 11 did that much damage to him to the point where he almost died.
---
People forget about scriptcraft and scriptcraft2, but my recollections of at least sc2 was mechanically it worked great compared to the time. Not good enough by today's standards because you could do stuff like force quit run through keyed doors, but I remember combat working remarkably well in dungeons.
---
potions, consumables, enchants, and that‚Äôs all i could really think of atm lol. i think there are some BoE epics that you could buy, like the accessories.
---
For leveling:
---
Overall going 2h arms for sweeping strikes (and mortal strike for PvP if relevant) to better handle multi mob pulls is the superior choice, but you're not gimping yourself at all by going fury and/or dual wielding.
---
As fury spec dual wield is slightly superior to 2h provided you can get equivalent 1h weapons. Here's some [math](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/abt0kk/dual_wield_vs_2h_while_leveling_with_math/) that helps explain why dual wield DPS is slightly better than 2h even while leveling given that condition.
---
Fury has slightly higher (in the range of 5-10%) single target DPS than arms at most levels and better sustain with blood craze and bloodthirst healing you.
---
Got home from work to check my launcher/email, no dice. Played since late TBC and quit in Legion/BFA launch. I've never wanted to be playing any game as bad as i want to now, it hurts lol.
---
There has been plenty of talk about that. Private servers have been guessing the values, only Blizzard know the real values. Expect mobs to be tougher in Classic.
---
Did you abuse the sharding to get more mobs to grind?
---
Consumables, alts, crafted gear, epic mount, professions, twinks, respec, etc.
---
Flasks and other consumables and talent changes plus epic mount
---
Before I quit retail I grabbed a wow token with gold and left it on my account for when I decide to relapse in the future or when classic came out, whichever happened first.  Once it was confirmed that beta access required a sub I was upset because I really don't like the current game, and if I did get into the beta, I wouldn't want to grind much out in fear of burning myself out and eventually rushing through content when it goes live.  Now that I've watched a few streams of the beta, I really want in on it, so I burnt my token.
---
2 days of time wasted so far without an invite and my account was created back in 2005, but I'm still holding out hope.  Worst case, I lost $15, so I'm not too concerned.
---
Don‚Äôt most skinners just vendor leather only early servers?
---
Warlock. Immobile sack of cloth relying on steady dot damage. Boring a.f.

---
I've actually been playing Diablo II with Classic streams running in the background. It's been surprisingly relaxing.
---
While leveling you'll be looking for all kinds of gear that has Spirit and Intellect. This might compete with casters, but it's not a huge deal while leveling.
---
Once +Healing gear starts dropping, as you get closer to level 60, you'll be prioritizing the following:
---
+Healing &gt; +Spell Crit &gt; Mp5 &gt; Intellect.
---
You might have some overlap in a few cases with casters, but not really. Your biggest competition will be other healers, but because you have access to Mail + Plate healing gear, Paladins have ridiculously low gear competition.
---
Mount and training, consumables and repairs mainly.
---
Consumables, epic mount, BOE gear (some BOE items are BIS for a long time), enchants when you get new gear, repair bills, respecting (50g a pop once you've respected a handful of times).
---
Consumables are huge. Lots of buff pots, heal/Mana pots, pvp consumables, sapper charges, iron grenades, the list goes on.
---
It's not that. It's a looming guilt that you're playing the game inefficiently. And to be fair you are but that doesn't make it less irrational.
---
Have you seen Guzu dueling on henhouse?
---
Are you sure? I do not remember that being a limitation.
---
Man I loved those Barman Shanker runs.  After doing it for myself I‚Äôd bring in fresh 60 rogues to help them get theirs.  Felt so good.
---
Epic mount is a huge goldsink at 1000 gold, some enchants can be really expensive, consumes are expensive and a big part of PVP and PVE. Even repairs can be expensive if you're a plate wearer in a progression setting.
---
That video was made during TBC prepatch
---
It honestly seems pretty accurate. Ive heard rumors that resist/miss/dodge/parry chance %s are scuffed, but Defcamo is a solid player. Hes got 100% uptime Inner Fire, uses PW:Shield tactically with renew, and fear is OP.
---
Must feel shit that your sorry ass did not get beta. I'm sure your post cata and pserver exp outweigh Joana who level several alts in vanilla retail. Fucking omega lul
---
I do wonder how many people telling others to level slowly actually will be themselves.
---
Strictly speaking it depends on what you‚Äôre using them for, though. Earth Shock Rank 1, for example is more efficient if you only need the interrupt. 
---
But also if you‚Äôre really pushing the envelope, you don‚Äôt really want to ‚Äúoverkill‚Äù things as it‚Äôs extra damage that‚Äôs not really going anywhere at a cost of extra mana. 
---
Certain classes definitely benefit from having lower ranked spells on their bar in the mana department.
---
You will always want flasks.
---
You will always need to repair.
---
You will always need want potions.
---
Plus, alts.
---
Why people here are so salty and acting like they don‚Äôt get mad when they got ganked?
---
But its a slightly less goddamn long time each day =D
---
Play something that people want to group with. A tank, a healer or a warlock for example. Then just enjoy the ride, do as many dungeons and group quests as you can, you will for sure make friends.
---
I reallyyy hope they add one
---
Not quite the highest but it can be acceptably high and sometimes too meters once in a blue moon. It takes a ton of work though.
---
I watched Tips for a little while and he said that hp regen seemed high. Granted it did look quite high but as this bluepost says it seems to be WAI. I kept an eye on other streamers playing other classes and their hp regen seemed alot slower (more what I'd expect) .
---
It could be possible that in the process of making classic, this was an unintended outcome. That being said, it could also be completely vanilla like, and the reason why people didn't really know about it back then was because you had to get it perfectly timed.
---
What do they mean by you get flagged? I don't get how you know when you're chosen
---
Basically what the other guy said
---
talent tree reset for us indecisive people :D, also yeah consumables (Shadow Oil, Dragonbreath Chili, Living Action Potion, Free Action Potion)
---
- BoE Epics (especially crafted items). Very few are BiS, but many are still useful for progression.
---
- 18 slot bags are pretty costly
---
- Epic Mount Training
---
- Consumables for hardcore raiding
---
- Respec cost for those who want to minmax talent builds for both top end raiding and PvP (instead of making a hybrid build)
---
- Bankrolling alts for faster levelling, profession training, or twinking
---
- Training professions (including buying rare recipes)
---
- Collecting various miscellaneous items like pets or mounts
---
the big one is your epic mount which is 1000g total without a discount. 1000g is a lot of money in Classic. i only got that much originally 'cuz i found a super popular BoE epic (Krol Blade) that sold for 800g or so on my server.
---
otherwise, the same thing it's always used for: consumables, crafting materials, enchants, repairs, respeccing, etc.
---
Priests mana regen is fine. It's just a pally litterally can have infinite mana.
---
DPS meters are used for one thing, to broadcast to the world that you're good/best in the group. The fact people are using them again in classic, not to mention in the freaking beta already, blows my mind. What's going on in ones life to where they need to prove to the world that they are good at a 15 year old mmorpg? (My life is miserable but hey, I'm top dps, see!) LOL
---
Consumes, professions, respecs and crafted gear mostly, there's also the one time big boy price.of your epic mount.
---
Keeping skinning beyond 60 is pointless IMO, it always tanks and for normal mob leather you're basically selling it on the AH for like 10% over the vendor price. There's exceptions like Dragon scales from BRD but it's so niche, and you'll require a 5man to make that money.
---
Mining i'd only keep if you're looking to make a bit of money and to keep engineering rolling, but i literally ALWAYS take BS/Eng and i main UD, 30 second fear immunity is just beyond broken and beyond having a gathering skill to make a bit of money there's no other prof that has any PvP benefit that can't simply be bought.
---
I will be going human either way, priest or paladin.
---
What really makes me sad....I opted into the beta, yet i know they won't pick me since i do not have ave an active sub. Sure, there is word out there that you don't NEED one except to play the beta. However, even though they can see my account was active during the original Vanilla,  they won't do it. Why? Because I'm not some dumb streamer who sits on his ass talking to people half a world away. What do they care what original accounts think? Streaming wasn't around then, and half of the "influencers" (if you can really call them that) only get to be in because they might raise the amount of current subs and can brag to investors.
---
Do you have sources for this? I haven't seen it happen in the Irvine demo or the beta.
---
I wonder where the line between "authentic no changes" and passive-aggressive "you asked for this" is, and how far past it we are.
---
Ironic, because that seems like what the guy I responded to is and not the streamers lol
---
Steady on my way to 3000 hours on Factorio while I wait.
---
If you want to PvP and PvE at the same time, resetting your talents is going to cost 50 gold every single time. 
---
This was a huge, *huge* gold sink in Vanilla. Some guilds would offer to pay for your reset costs as a main form of enticing you to join their raid.
---
What are you talking about?! He‚Äôs the best warrior NA!
---
Priests have a much more versatile healing kit than Paladins and can fill a lot more roles between tank healing, dispelling, aoe healing and so on.  A Paladins healing is mostly just casting different ranks of Surge of Light with the occasional Holy Shock if you choose to spec it - most of the variety in a Paladins game play is skillfull use of their various blessings and buffs at the right time. Priests will struggle for mana a lot of the time - you'll be stacking spirit hard and even be able to translate that spirit into spell power, but it's poor compensation compared to the Paladins ability to get effectively infinite mana scaling off their crit rate. Paladins will probably top the heal charts through their ability to just spam out heals but I'd say that a Priest has a much bigger ability to make high impact and more effective plays with their kit.
---
Can confirm, seen Guzu tested it yesterday.
---
right now in the beta the number of people who got it is so small. replicate that on a live game where you are literally running into people every 10 seconds. you get used to the same names which u do dungeons with and then at  max levels you will run into the same people. add to that the contested zones where you will run into opposite factions and sometimes kill each others sometimes live peacefully. Or someone starting as a small scale griefing in a zone, only to escalate into an all out guild war in that zone, even to a faction war. those small things in vanilla that allow gameplay to revolve around the social aspect make it really exciting.
---
Yes, Spirit Tap and Wand Spec should always be your first ten talent points.
---
Some people alternate between the two, some go for Spirit Tap first (especially since Wands will be hard to come by on a fresh server.)
---
Um. I'd strongly suggest going Dwarf Priest because of Fear Ward. For every Dwarf Priest on your server, that's one less opportunity for you to get gear.
---
I am sure anyone will choose to have the posibility of changing their name over some horrible sharding experience ffs, how detached from reality are there fanboy apologetics?
---
There's a lot of gear that can be crafted or bought from the AH that's good for level 60s. Then there's repair bills, depending on the content you do, and epic riding etc. 
---
Gold is still going to be more valuable in classic than it is in retail. It's not uncommon for someone to be gold capped in retail.
---
Brian was in Sakaar's chat today and said it'll be looked at on Monday.
---
&gt;     bullet
---
&gt; Not a real RPer. :P
---
What makes you say this about the GP?
---
iirc, the spec is: 5/5 Wand Specialization -&gt; 5/5 Spirit Tap -&gt; 2/2 Improved Shadow Word Pain -&gt; Holy 'til Divine Fury 2/2.
---
after that, whatever until you hit 40, then respec into full Shadow for Shadowform.
---
if you're looking for a leveling healer build, as long as you have Wand Specialization, Spirit Tap, Improved SW:P and Divine Fury, you're good to do whatever from there.
---
That way of clapping hands is chimp heritage

Can't wait to shout and aggro the level 50 ghosts and die
---
Legion was one of the best since wrath as far as I was concerned. BFA is a bit of a shit show but still hoping 9.0 can make it worth the time. 
---
Btw classic access achieved this morning and its worth the wait. It is so fun
---
But say when a caster is sitting down eating/ drinking, as a rogue to sneak up behind them and strike would make sense as a big crit
---
Obviously I‚Äôd like up through Naxx, but I‚Äôd be 100% down for locking us in at 60 and adding new, horizontal content designed in the philosophy of vanilla/classic.
---
I get many people want TBC/Wrath and I‚Äôm not really arguing against that per se. I just think the game started to experience geographical bloat and class changes started to step away from vanilla philosophy (though that was was much longer process than a switch being flipped from one expac to the next).
---
If they add new content, I really hope they do it in a way that keeps level 60 content, gear, and builds relevant. I want new stuff, just not at the cost of making 98% of the old stuff just a stepping stone.
---
Good video! Would be Nice if you could include why People should grind rep there, like which rewards do you get for revered, exalted etc
---
Sort of defeats the object of classic wow. The unknown was part of its draw. Why bother returning just to rip through content to max level
---
I was overcome with happiness seeing the pure joy in Preach's eyes while tanking this dungeon.  Completely lost track of what he was talking about multiple times just from having so many little details coming back.
---
Welcome home preacher.  Welcome home.
---
People were saying it was too high, as it's higher than the other classes
---
mmochampion polls have also had surprisingly high warlock results.
---
I think eventually this could be interesting. However, for the launch and phase of the game EVERYTHING should remain as it was. Then maybe blizzard can look at how to evolve the game if that is in fact what the community wants. Tbh tho that wouldn't happen and if it did it would be 3-5 years
---
I can't wait to play it. I played shortly after launch when I was 14 but I couldn't get into it and found it too difficult. It was my first MMO &amp; RPG. As I got older I played more games and got used to/more interested in the genre (all I really play are RPGs now.) I went back to WoW shortly before MoP and played on and off until 7.3 or so. I quit because it got easier and more watered down with every patch/expansion, and I don't have the time or desire for progression raiding or anything like that, but I want to be challenged and have a real sense of adventure. But most importantly, I want to experience the lore of all of the Classic zones and immerse myself in it. I've read multiple novels and the first two parts of the Chronicles and am in love with the universe. I know there's no real Big Bad Guy in Classic and I love the idea of being able to focus on each zone and not being able to get to 60 over the course of the weekend lol. I've never really felt a connection with my character and I think this will be different because I actually have to work towards things. I know the thread was supposed to be about lore only, but it's a combination of everything that I can't wait for! I really hope a lot of people play it and maybe eventually Blizzard takes it all the way to WotLK.
---
1%
---
Nah cool thing about vanilla is there's very few specs that are so bad they can't raid, healers don't really have one of these specs though (as long as you are good at the class).
---
If you pull 5% less hps than a hpriest and you get replaced over it , fuck those ppl lol
---
Noooo
---
Even without sit critting fury is superior in terms of raw dps all the way until 30 (and even then most wont consider switching until 36) - that being said - in Pvp servers that imp overpower is godly
---
A simple joke, for my simple friend Hyyren.  I'm glad Tips could make so laugh with his great sense of humor.  XD
---
Yes. exactly. that is why to me the fact that so many pservers kept popping up with a solid community proved that behind that nostalgia is an amazing game.
---
If a game was not that good, nostalgia gets you to try it again, but not stick with it.
---
You don‚Äôt need any special talents to heal as a priest sub 50-55, just make sure you keep up somewhat with new ranks of healing spells as you level.
---
If you hamstring and play the warrior right you won't have to bandage or eat unless you pull 2 or more.  You won't even have to do that if you stack spirit like you should though. I'm going to love leveling warrior Simply because I know 80 percent of the people won't stick to it for the reason they won't learn how to level themselves properly.

Warlocks are one of the best pvp classes regardless of your faction if your skilled, and to be honest as good as will of the forsaken is it's hardly a hard counter. You'll see a far higher impact from having engineering vs not &amp; being able to use the various random items like Skull and consumables.
---
With my guild we killed... I wanna say 7-9 bosses in naxx and missed C'Thun in AQ. So not super duper but nice. I don't remember recount being a thing at least in MC/ZG/BWL/AQ but might have been in naxx. Mainly everyone was watching Omen and not Recount with who is top.
---
I'm honestly leaning paladin because of the mana.
---
No, not how it works. I did not notice any layering as I was ahead of the curve.
---
And I'm saying new players should do whatever they want, instead of letting people tell them what to do. If they want to experience endgame content and don't care for leveling, sure, they can rush through the game.
---
I feel so certain (I played Mage) but at the same time the fact that I can find no mention on this anywhere makes me second guess myself
---
I had a very nice priest Djara craft me a wand early on that I used! We donated linen to him for his efforts :)
---
I should have :( but no
---
&gt; Honestly, most of the bitching about flying is due to the reduction in world PvP but you are 100% right. 
---
And I'm saying it didn't reduce World PvP.
---
Consumables and respeccing will be a steady drain on your gold, but the deep gold investments depend on your class.
---
Epic mount &amp; epic riding comes to mind for a universal gold dump most people need to grind towards. Then there's really exceptional pieces of gear you can essentially get through gold in some cases. For warriors for example, they'll spend obscene amounts of gold on stuff like Quel'Serrar, Lionheart Helmet, Edgemaster's, etc.
---
Gold is generally extremely potent as a currency still in classic and much desired, because accruing it will be tedious for almost everyone.
---
I think my favorite part of warrior is the lack of fantasy honestly. Warriors are this tried and true archetype based on actual history. 
---
Knowing I‚Äôm relying on myself, my own skill - no magic, no pets, no stealth - just running around yelling and hitting shit with a car door.

5/5 imp fireball 2/2 flame throwing 3/5 ignite 1 pyroblast IIRC and then I took points in the hit talent (ele precision in frost tree) to help me kill some orange mobs for quests

Awesome, thanks!

"Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth."
---
This is clearly a sassy way to call out private server babies because I've seen so many of them complain about spawn rates, since private servers use dynamic spawns.
---
as it always did in pvp, in pve it doesnt
---
Used to love this video.. turns out I still do
---
I do not think so. Hunter is so much more consistent without any downtime and can solo elites, higher level red mobs, etc. Plus they get cheetah at 20 which is HUGE. Mage will be fast though. I hope I get time off work that week to see how fast :)
---
Everyone has seen the AoE grinding videos I guess.
---
Can you post the source on the private server values being wrong on this?
---
Yea I hate how they made it streamers club exclusive beta, alongside few luckiest dudes who probably always win all kind of shit in their lives:(
---
&gt;Do you work for blizzard or any gaming company?
---
Do you? How can you be so certain that it is absolute nonsense without being one yourself?
---
&gt; lmao gtfo 
---
Thanks
---
I'm obviously joking here people. Those downvotes are like candy, youre just admitting you dont get sarcasm.
---
I expect them to do that after it‚Äôs released
---
Anecdotal, but everything here lines up with what Baconn (made a reckoning guide back in 1.10) says should happen, namely these:
---
&gt; "Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit. However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting." 
---
[Source](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm)
---
&gt; "...if you stood up just as you were getting hit, the server would see you as if you were standing and get a Reckoning charge."

It could be that the new batching they have introduced is easier to manipulate.
---
Crazy times.... Can't wait!!
---
Well you probably shouldn't
---
No. Once you achieve the rank you can always use the items. They must be purchased while you are at that rank though.
---
&gt;F1-F4 is Potions, F5-F8 is Food/Buffs
---
My Mac-playing ass is jealous of actual functional function keys.
---
Consumables mostly and your mount. There's also leveling your professions and gbid runs. People also like to create Alts and fund them with their main. Also thinks.
---
Just get some spirit gear.  Its effect is magnified on warriors and you regen insanely fast
---
I think at this point without enrage sit spam trigger being a thing, going for fury leveling over arms is kind of a moot point and now it truly doesn't matter. I think AM and 5/5 Tactical Mastery from arms plus impale and overpower crits will make arms leveling much better.
---
This is what I'm looking forward to the most. PvP was basically impossible at 500ping vs Americans. Vividly remember having spells cancelled and being backstabbed by players who are clearly in front of me on my side. Very excited!
---
Anything after rank 10 will usually require premade BG running. 
---
Private servers are not that good to go off of due to population size. 
---
Being in the top .03% of 5k players is a lot easier than of 1.5k
---
Consumables, respecs, enchants, alts. Sometimes a new crafting recipe comes out and there's some BoE item you want to buy. There are classes that have some seriously expensive items they need if you really want to optimize, like frost/shadow damage wands. Or maybe you want to be the first guy who runs around with [Teebu's](http://classicdb.ch/?item=1728) which would probably cost you thousands of gold.
---
Upon hitting 60, pretty much everyone needs at least ~2k gold just to cover the basics: epic mount, enchants, professions, a few BoE pieces (e.g. Devilsaur set, Stockade Pauldrons, Heartseeker) and a full lineup of Traveler's Backpacks. That's like the smallest "done with the economy" package. 
---
If you have no more actual purchases to make, you can just randomly farm a little gold here and there so you can respec and maintain consumables. At this stage, you should be able to sustain yourself on just a few hours of farming per week unless you're trying to do something like grind PvP ranks with flask on all day.
---
I do miss some of the features of classic. I really liked the flexibility you had with the talent trees for example. 
---
But what made wow the most awesome gaming experience of my life was the people I played with in the beginning. We were all learning the game together and having a blast. No trolls. No elitists. Just people screwing up and having fun doing it.
---
I'm playing retail right now. I'll be playing classic wow when it comes out as well. Successful classic means more successful retail simple as that.

I remember back in cata people would flame me for having S still bound. Then we did progress on heroic ragnaros where you had to form the triangle with your entire raid and if anyone was a pixel too close it would explode and kill everyone. Used my S key to backpedal into place to make sure I didn't overstep.
---
Don‚Äôt really understand how rank 13 is achievable in 4 days. Rank 1-14 is only possible after many weeks even if you are #1 each week. So I don‚Äôt understand how what your saying is true
---
Nah that was Mauradon, Dire maul came in March 2015.
---
How does he have linen cloth in his bag?
---
Yeah, as a European I basically timed my log-on by when the Chinese would generally log out. The server became playable around 18-20 EU time, no point in logging on before that.

I made an addon that displays twitch chat emotes in WoW chat and then found out that one already exists. Mine is better though.

This has been confirmed as working as intended.

I was doing some similar on retail 100,000 boar kills, didn‚Äôt know we could self promote though

I'm thinking it means people are trying to do it and reporting a bug that it doesn't proc - but blizz are confirming that this is correct?
---
Races were not equal. There are different baseline stars for each race regardless of class. Neither were classes. Each class got a different attribute allocation for level ups. 
---
It‚Äôs impossible to answer your question because it depends on race, class, talent spec if we are ignoring gear.
---
Tipsout gonna roll on the RP PVE server and role-play as a dude that played vanilla.
---
I don't think they can unless Blizzard gives them permission to do so
---
If you are playing on a fresh account you are struggling with gold. Yes.
---
What?
---
Not true, the wow section is usually around 10-15k viewers even when the big ones are offline
---
And they sucked all the way to 30 too lol
---
Monkeynews goes over his leveling spec in [Tipsout's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzQ4P6huu6M)
---
That isn't what I was referring to. I was laughing at "Mobs respawn slower than on BFA" being reported as a bug.
---
A lot of BFAs economy mirrors vanilla. Anchor weed was incredibly rare and expensive at the start of the expansion because they took notes from implementing black lotus.
---
That‚Äôs why is every Warr Hamstring+kites in between wep swings. Avoids a lot of dmg and greatly reduces the number times they have to eat and get health back.
---
2x.  With 2 tauren it looks stupid but a tauren + anything else would not be so silly
---
Maybe, I think a lot of us haven't played retail in a while so not sure how much impact bfa will have
---
Except Druids can‚Äôt block which forces them to eat massively more damage. 
---
There are some bosses Druids can tank and are even arguably preferable - but they are not viable from start to finish in raiding during progression.
---
Felt this way for a few years now.
---
Decided to get some practice in for when classic hits.
---
I also have a hunch that something is off with elite mobs and mobs that are more than 3 levels above the character they don't seem threatening enough. But that's just going from memory and watching streams, obviously the streamers are better players than I was back in the day.
---
On pservers, I rest my case.
---
Apparently that's a big no-no and you should just auto attack if you're oom - but also you should be OK with mana pots and runes
---
I'm gearing for slightly longer progress fights with my guild haha we aren't tryhards.  Just trymediums
---
Played a Paladin in vanilla as well and focused on pvp. Rarely was there a time a rogue wiped the floor with me. Cleanse having no cd and no mana cost meant rogue poison was useless against us. If seal of command procd back to back we would just delete a rogue. They cant really kite us since we'll just heal and we have counters to oh shit situations with LoH and bubble.
---
Woah!    thats interesting, but I sure don't care!
---
I mean, I‚Äôve played on private servers, but not actual vanilla back in ‚Äò05. But I‚Äôve enjoyed my time on those servers way more than the time I‚Äôve spent playing retail. Excited for legit classic servers that won‚Äôt get shut down at a moments notice.
---
This is accurate. I remember so many people getting hit around corners from tauren even :p
---
Maybe appreciate that without private servers you wouldn't have this subreddit to mock and gloat at them.
---
go look up WoW rage on youtube, nearly every single video is PvE-related
---
Nothing to add, just really appreciate that attitude. People often make ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù and ‚Äúviable‚Äù synonyms in their heads. While there are certainly objective ways to make things smooth, what‚Äôs rewarding is subjective to individual players and I think that deserves space to thrive.
---
I really hope your guild succeeds and people bring some really creative and unique play styles/builds along with them! :)
---
well this is a classic so people wouldn't care about retail
---
i mean you dont honestly think the east is less feminine do you?
---
In absolute shambles that reckoning aoe grinding is canceled. Leveling a paladin is going to be a snooze fest.

He went to the spot that someone else said they found the mob, when the mob wasnt patting though?

Appreciate this, but...

Rule 1:  Content must be related to WoW: Classic
---
This is gonna kill me; I really want to play a Prot Paladin for 5-man and world farming content. Not gonna be much use in raid though :/
---
Thank you, cant wait :) Try both enemy and also friendly targets please, since I believe it was buggy mostly for friendly targets.
---
NA?
---
This is almost me. I can just about get myself to play dungeon keeper so long as I have something interesting playing on youtube to listen to. But I'm running out of stuff that I can stand listening to. Joe Rogan has a conspiracy bookwriter on who's refusing to answer his questions to draw out the suspense or some shit. It's annoying to listen to, even if ufo government conspiracies are fun.
---
Nah. It will spike hard on release considering it's in the live subscription. Everyone will try it out. Some will try it out a little longer. Eventually it'll be down to a healthy but "small" community. I doubt it will captivate millions of players but it should hold a handful of healthy servers, which is all that matters for this kind of project.
---
There is a chance for it to blow up so hard that Blizzard considers adding vanilla style content to keep the players, but I doubt it. Classic WoW is too slow for the average modern gamer.
---
yea i lol'd MUHSPIRIT
---
Respect ‚úäüòÇ love autocorrect

This gets me more hyped for Classic than anything else posted here.
---
Been a while since I've seen CC in Ragefire Chasm ...
---
Late BC starter here, wrath beta test too. We‚Äôll probably have to wait a bit... but I check it multiple times daily anyway!
---
With enough gold, I'm pretty sure you could buy almost anything in Vanilla. GDKP runs will definitely be a thing.
---
As per a 1.12.1 comment on wowhead though, "The Galak Messenger wanders between the Great Lift and Whitereach post, mostly along the road". Would be weird for it to be wrong considering it was posted in 2006
---
Maybe my memory is fuzzy, maybe its because i never got to max as a kid, or maybe its just the case, but classic wow at max doesnt seem to smack you with 500 dailies/weeklies over the head. correct me if im wrong there. Also the leveling experience alone should take a normal player a month+. I start school the day classic comes out. Its a small bummer, but i dont feel forced to grind to max during that first week just to get my weekly mythic dungeons done, and emissaries, and that feeling is great ;)
---
It's really a description more than a comparison, I don't know the answer to your question. Interesting but not a direct rebuttal.
---
I should have been clearer in my reply. I blame it on my hangover. I agree 100% that it did not reduce world PvP
---
There is so much wrong with this comment that it heavily outweighs what you‚Äôve said correctly. 
---
Weapon skills?  Really?  That‚Äôs a non issue. You can level up weapon skills pretty quickly even while leveling. This should not be a consideration at all. 
---
Also white attacks make up the majority of your dps.  Not sure where you are getting the ability damage from. Maybe in short mob to mob less than 15 second kill times but anything over that and your white weapon damage is the majority of your damage. 
---
Fury has very little to do with dual wielding while leveling. From level 1-30 and arguably 1-36 you should be leveling 2h fury to maximize talent contributions to dps.
---
Long story short...
---
Spec fury and use a 2hander from AT LEAST 1-30....you can then respec arms if you want but I personally would not recommend switching until 36 and even then might as well just wait till 40.
---
If you remove the votes of all classes except Priest. Priest is the most picked one. ??? I dont get your sentence.
---
Yep. Pretty much. 
---
Can't wait for TBC servers to be honest. The joke back in the day was that 2.0 is when WoW finally left beta.
---
Bravo. Spot on!!
---
Blizzard has limited time and resources to fix bugs. People reporting every straw of grass that ain't there is just cluttering this thread and actually doing a disservice to valid reports by burying them.
---
But I guess you already knew that cause you can't not it, right?
---
People seem to forget that blizzard has client and server files from 1.12.1
---
I'm assuming that means the data wasn't corrupted. People complaining about damage values, regen, etc are clearly misremembering things due to playing private servers.
---
Client side related things may be off, maybe even spell batching could be off, but the damage calculations are most likely correct. I mean humans have trouble remembering events that happened 10 minutes ago, some of these idiots think they held on to minor details from 15 years ago? 
---
You think you remember, but you don't.
---
I feel like this should be on betting sites. APES vs. Progress vs. Salad Bakers vs. GRIZZLY. Who did I miss?
---
I'd go with Progress.
---
It's cause that guy didn't get op, with their clearly 500 IQ knowledge of vanilla. they obviously DESERVE to be in it instead. Even though people like Joana are probably one of the best people to have testing it.        
---
Might be cause we're applying common sense
---
This is good to know, that if I put in the effort in it can still be quite an even fight. I was just very concerned with wotf mostly and on top that I have no stun or snare break.
---
Dark templar?
---
i dont think playing something just cus free mount is a terrible idea. As a kid i played warlock purely because i saw my friends sickkk whitemanes chapeu, sexy succubus, and a free mount. it was a trifecta!!
---
I think that there will be enough people in the same boat as you that it shouldnt be too difficult to find a group for those dungeons even though they are less convenient. How far off hours are we talking? You could try maybe playing on an EU server, or a server with a high oceanic population

These "dark Vanilla nights" that people "remember"? They never existed outside of a couple zones. Most of the zones on BfA are as dark as they were in Vanilla, some are even slightly darker. I feel like this meme about "dark Vanilla nights" is never going to fucking end no matter how much I try to dispel this myth.
---
No you see, the server files aren't remembering correctly. My human memory is flawless. /s
---
I cannot comprehend this mindset. It is baffling, an enigma shrouded in annoying. Just fix nonsense like this and be done with it.
---
You haven‚Äôt browsed this sub before? 
---
The sad part is that people are just angry because they feel left out. I guarantee you people would be loving it if they had beta access. This will go on until the game is live Im afraid
---
This comic is very relevant to Mekkatorque Mythic by the way. Every single class has something to mitigate fall damage except shaman... we have to cry for grip or slow fall. :^)
---
Yeah mother smolderweb runs in lbrs starting at 40
---
it doesnt limit my options, it limits yours. I am faster at going backwards than you with s, besides I can use for an additional keybind
---
The tauren size and facing away ones are definitely not as they should be, at least not from the clips ive seen of people testing it.
---
Cant wait to gank people as an unded roge.
---
God I am so excited.
---
it was confirmed weeks ago?
---
So, it came out that you don't need a sub to get into the beta.  You just need a sub to access the beta servers after your account is in.
---
This kind of behavior is really common in FF14, so it's nice to see classic boys adopting it.
---
Huh, funny how everyone loves classic now
---
Wow what a cop out.
---
LMFAO
---
Thank you so much for your response. I have been so back and forth on this it‚Äôs honestly been ruining the whole experience for me.
---
I guess I‚Äôm leaning more towards rolling Oceanic and hanging with the oz guys. I played with a bunch of them on PS4 due to my location so I‚Äôm fairly used to how crazy you guys are lol. 
---
I truly hope I can realm transfer. It‚Äôs a dice roll, if I can that would really work out. Do you know how I can locate some Oceanic Australian guilds that are recruiting?
---
afaik locks were weak early vanilla
---
Definitely doable if u know what you are doing and run with decent players. 
---
I ran molten core with my guild as shadow and did alright. You do need to farm more consumables and have better gear to make up for it. But staying shadow for pvp fun was a good enough trade off for me.
---
all my irl friends started around 2012 and they all have access
---
Unless the streamer legit wants to grief, I think RP or RP-PVP if they're available are your best choices.
---
Wrong sub maybe?
---
so which version would u recommend me playing?
---
I have never played vanilla, but I'm definitely still rushing to 60 ASAP. Some people, like myself, find the fun in efficiency and finding the best way to make your character as powerful as possible as fast as possible. I dont give a shit about reading reading quest text, understand lore, and all that other stuff. I like playiong the most efficient way possible and being the fastest/strongest character.
---
OP is straight up telling people how to play and I dont think that's right. The information he gives is good, but everyone should play how they want, not how someone else wants them to.
---
They're complaining that it's too high. But the warrior in question is wearing dual spirit stam rings, so yeah.
---
Looks like respawns...
---
Again with this. They have a 1.12 reference client, there‚Äôs no proof of any altercations that affect gameplay in terms of numbers that are different. They aren‚Äôt guessing on any values. 
---
You‚Äôre a salty bitch because you‚Äôre stuck on reddit with your tinfoil hat on instead of enjoying the beta and being happy. Get over it.
---
&gt; Is strong in PvP
---
Not really. They get shit on in duel tournaments, and they're not required in premades.
---
Not bad in ZG with bloodvine
---
No no, I played vanilla in 2005 and I can tell you how everything worked back then. My memory is CRISP my dude. I have this shit down to a science, Blizzard are wrong in everything they do.
---
I think you could even drop a scare beast on the adds if I remember right
---
The Flight Path Animation Set is still bugged. They don't bank or dive while on the flight path, instead staying exactly horizontal when flying. Compare this video below to the same flight path on the beta.

Most people that unbind it, bind it to something else. So yes. Obviously, the majority of WoW players dont care or are not competitive enough to care. And in classic it wont matter to much.

A streamer going to a role-playing server what could go wrong?

SomethingIRefuseToClickOn. Part 1.
---
The first epic I [saw](http://classicdb.ch/?item=1981) was ninja'ed by a rouge. After I cooled down, I made screenshots from the group chat, and sent it to his guild leader.
---
Next day when I've checked he was guildless.
---
I'm talking mostly about retail players coming to classic which there are a lot more than classic fans i'd say.
---
Word. When I leveled to 60 back when I was 16, I took something like 12 days of playtime and then instantly started another character. I didn't even know there was endgame content.
---
The amounts of wipes on the first couple trash pulls until people had figured out how to deal with them...
---
I agree with skinning, but I'm still skeptical about whether mining/herb will be worth attempting to train since nodes may be far too contested for you to level it up at a reasonable pace. If it's too difficult to level, then enchanting would be the next best thing since it would allow you to D/E soulbound items. Herb or mining could be trained post-mount.
---
No. I think we're all in a bubble.
---
Then I am happy to inform you that you can use an optimal heal raid spec that works just fine for aoe farming and tanking dungeons. Something like this: http://classicdb.ch/?talent#sqxubgoxVGuI0z
---
You do not need BFA.
---
You just need an active subscription, and the base game. Which is classic.
---
Lol, Why is this downvoted?
---
Guess we have a lot of salty keyboard turner/clickers in this thread
---
They didn't, he made it up.

And that's why we don't want phasing !

Awesome
---
Ah okay that's good to hear.
---
Thanks all the players playing there, not only the nost team, blizz wouldnt have gave a shit if not for the 20k+ aktive players. team effort. just like the classic experiences.
---
Yeah you can... What're you on about? You can't track herbs and minerals simultaneously, which is why he asking about whether he should go with Skinng + Mining OR Skinning + Herb.
---
That's only the case up to level 40. With whirlwind Axe and MS talent leveling a warrior is pretty easy. It's tough for the first 40 levels, but hey.. Classic. You should consider using pots that restore HP for 30 minutes, there is a pretty cheap one around level 20 if I remember correctly. Also scrolls and food buffs. You simply need to use what the game is offering or suffer.
---
I do love a ragu.
---
hmmm so I'm not seeing anything in there mentioning Verdan the Everliving. Maybe tips was right lol
---
I'm probably a minority here but I actually welcomed a lot of new class abilities like dual shaman and spirit wolves.
---
The things I didn't like was the homogenizing classes, instant gratification teleporting, no more community or challenge except high end raiding.
---
mage is the easiest &amp; the most versatile
---
It‚Äôs actually a lot more if you are even half decent in pvp, because you need to use macros.  I probably have more than 20 in PvE as well, but that depends on what class you play.
---
To be honest, this is the kind of reaction I was hoping we‚Äôd see once Classic launches. 
---
Some of the naysayers are coming around and admitting they were wrong.
---
It‚Äôs easy to think that everyone advocating for Classic is just blinded by nostalgia when you last played the vanilla version of the game almost 15 years ago (or didn‚Äôt play it at all), but the game really does speak for itself when you actually give it a try again.
---
I think he does a pretty good job at analysing why a version with less features can actually be more enjoyable and how ‚Äì for example ‚Äì the social dynamic is immensely affected by the more dangerous world and lack of convenient grouping tools.

mine was never messy at least in my eyes, people have different opinions tho so what may be messy and atrocious to you, works extremely well and is clean to them.
---
Twice a day? I don't remember getting that even once when I tried out BFA on launch.
---
Nothing to do with phasing or layering, this happens on 1.12 when you switch zones. There is a herb in Trisfal Glades that you can see but the second you zone into Silverpine Forest it disappears, this happened in original as well. If you are going to go on about phasing or layering at least use legit examples.
---
Herb/Alchemy your gonna need the pots
---
This is a problem arising from private servers. The community doesn't shift enough and neither does the content so it devolves into this ridiculous min-max bullshit and you get shit named "meta".
---
Classic never had metas, and if I hear talk of metas while playing I'm going to slap a bitch. Fuck that wannabe bullshit.
---
My mistake then :D, I thought there was no point in checking that because of them saying it will pop up on client. Thanks for informing me on my misinformation.
---
&gt;These are the little things that really break the illusion for me and I find them important.
---
Me too, however some things cannot be fixed and you need to learn what does are before whining about them.
---
Yup, suggest invite said player is "just like" automatically porting you into a dungeon with 5 random players. 
---
Exactly the same.
---
We can show them, but getting emotional over a game does not make sense to me. I suppose it depends how I view the term emotional being used, I read this OP as if he is tearing up over getting to play a game. Which IMO is laughable.
---
This is great the dynamic has change from "yeah its all nostalgia you dont know what you are talking about" to "actually we see what you were saying and we agree"
---
... can I have that minute and a half of my life back?
---
Only thing that actually keeps WoW at these steady 25k is esport aspect of it:  
---
people pushing m+, newest raid or arenas.  
---
I think WoW has been on twitch and other streaming platforms long enough to see, that its not good game for streaming. As basically any other MMO.  
---
Now you can argue that "hey, WoW has big numbers sometimes" and that would be true, but its addicted strictly to either big event having place or people just watching personality that happens to play WoW in current time.  
---
Basically thats the twitch right now. Almost every 5k streamer is watched mainly for personality, not particular game, if he happens to play your favorite game it doesnt mean it grows. I none of big streamers doesnt do that it doesnt mean there is a decline.  
---
Im hyped for Classic since dropping BFA 2 months into xpac, but this subreddit right now literally looks like Artiffact sub when NDA was lifted
---
&gt;who's only basis is wrong data.
---
No reason to continue dialogue with you if you will just repeat your mantra.
---
not to mention it actually takes a fair bit of practice to not die every other pull
---
&lt;insert laughing emoji&gt;
---
Same...
---
I agree with a lot of what you said except for new mechanics on existing fights.
---
TBC content and loot rescaled to level 60 on the other hand could be cool.
---
Tipsout is a terrible player. God watching him and sodapop play wc made me cringe. It is not a hard dungeon ffs.
---
I thought only warriora have defensive stance
---
Can we stop staying world first? There are no world first in classic. The world first were all done in 2004/2005. Nothing in classic is ‚Äúworld first‚Äù it‚Äôs just click bait bullshit
---
This is a pretty weird blue post to see given that the beta is absolutely filled to the brim with bugs. Especially, "we‚Äôve reproduced the exact inconsistency they had back then." is pretty rich. Good job reproducing things exactly, maybe you can figure out the thousands of actual bugs, inconsistencies and oversights before bragging about how you're perfecting things exactly as they were.
---
Such a wonderful summary!
---
Yikes... I don't know what's more cringe, Swifty's complete and utter cluelessness or the video itself.
---
Haha, look he does something funny, lets add stupid effects and look how funny it looks Haha
---
What patch is that video on ? Considering blizz has a working vanilla client, I'm more inclined to believe them than a random video.
---
Dude, your mistake wasn't being a terrible player and wiping on easy as fuck bosses in WC just to make a scene to get clicks. 
---
Clearly you need to suck more and make videos of yourself being a shit player.
---
He always was a cool guy, big of him to admit he was wrong.
---
&gt; I'm going to love leveling warrior Simply because I know 80 percent of  the people won't stick to it for the reason they won't learn how to  level themselves properly. 
---
I mean people had 15y to learn about how Warriors were the destroyers of worlds with a bit a gear, and you have dozens of guides about how to level up your Warrior. It may have been the case in Vanilla but i doubt it'll be this way for classic.
---
Paladins and Shamans are on top of this poll, though! Remember they are faction exclusive, so per faction you will have twice as high percentage of them as it says here.
---
Well at the moment ZERO. I‚Äôve yet to hear of anyone with that ISNT a content creator get in with an account t newer than 2006.
---
As time goes on they may allow new and new accounts in but no one knows.
---
Yea man. There are a few recruiting in the classic oce discord and the regular classic discord. The guild I joined is also looking for members but we all want to hit it pretty hard (goal is server 1sts but we will see)
---
Finally decided to warrior  tank in classic. I hope i do well and people message me to assist with run's, or quests. That was actually what cemented my decision.. the community aspect of the role.
---
I loved the shaman addon that used the op macro language before it got limited. All I did was press one button and it would target the member with the lowest health with the proper rank of the heal...
---
Hes not wrong though
---
In Low level BGs you will get one shotted by twinks or people 7-8 levels higher. Wish VGs gave xp
---
If it unfortunately doesn't turn out that way, alternatively everyone interested in RP-PVP could get together to pick a PVP and make that the unofficial RP-PVP server. I know in FFXIV their community does that since there's no indication of any RP in-game.
---
Only Alliance can be paladins and only Horde can be shamans. So, theoretically, if the other classes are evenly spilt between the two factions, paladins and shamans would be the most popular class on each faction.
---
Does this mean that it's higher or lower than what people expected?
---
Blizzard chose THESE people for the beta. Unbelievable.
---
There is no point of checking it via email as they are often really late. For example MrGM got his email about 24 hours after he got in beta.
---
Arthas also got retconned a bunch in the novel
---
Excited
---
How does one obtain the base game? Does it come with the sub or does it cost extra?
---
Hopefully a solid niche. 
---
Hype and retention aren't all that linked, I think.
---
It's always been about community and adventure to me. 
---
I enjoyed new abilities. New classes. New stories. But when everything got homogenized, dungeons and instant queues. Everything just died. 
---
back in the day the only time I was ever alone and quiet while playing well was when I would stay up until 4 in the morning in the barons killing zebras.
---
Nowadays I'm always alone playing WoW.
---
Can people fuck off telling people how to play games?
---
Yeah, that definitely effects a lot of different interactions. One obvious one would be being able to kick or blind a succubus while opening on a Warlock, and still get the full combo point kidney shot after cheap shot ends.
---
I'd rather die younger and enjoy life than die old and hate every minute.
---
Every healer spec is at least viable. Literally every single one. Pala healer, priest healer, druid healer, shaman healer, it all goes. Pala is the most mana efficient healer in the game too.
---
In classic wow, do rares give a ton of xp? Or do a lot of them have specific green drops? If so, that info would be really good to have.
---
Oh okay thanks for the explenation. Can you pick horde paladin in retail?
---
My endgame consisted of chilling out, killing the undead in EPL and chatting with the guildies while listening to some nice music. I get that I might have missed 90% of what max level content WoW offered then, but I loved every second of it and still remember it fondly.
---
This is what I'm going to do in Classic. Play the game, explore, collect blues and purples, play AH, craft and what not.
---
I dunno about NA but in EU i heard only about 60 players recieved an invitation at first for the beta. 
---
I really doubt they have enough testers to  fill a realm so they maybe didn't even implemented the Layering tech.
---
The Hunter pet can and will remove you from stealth and you can trigger wrath while sapped.
---
Yeah, trollblood elixir. Really nice stuff for warriors.
---
You realize most of these false reports (e.g. &gt;Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth.) are coming from retail servers and not private servers? 
---
What's with the private server hate on this sub since it blew up? You guys are mad that people continued to play their favourite game of all time when it wasn't available officially?
---
The second one, though...  
---
Is that the real backstab sound? I remember it as being a way higher pitched sound (Its an iconic sound really)
---
Cant find any real classic footage without music where rogues are using backstab, so I cant confirm it.
---
Unfortunately we are getting 1.12 AV which wont last for days.
---
Classic! I was new to wow last year and tried retail, ended up quiting to play vanilla instead. Join us on August 27th or other totally legal servers
---
[From behind?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3TVkxaJ5Y8)
---
Are we allowed to post private server videos now?
---
Ahhhh, still thanks hah
---
Yeah we only like Nostalrius on this sub for some reason. We hate all the other ones. On top of that, all private server players are saying that private servers are more accurate than the beta so they should be shunned. 
---
/s
---
Aw man! I LOVED Flinrlocke! :D
---
More like get schooled retail-tards.
---
The SP in the video has VT on his bars putting the video in the TBC pre-patch rather than 1.12.
---
This has been brought up many times. ;) Reddit is just shit for anything which is not "look at this cat picture and then forget it until the next one".
---
In any case, that's my worry too.
---
Blizzard is trying however. From the interviews I gathered they will monitor things closely and will spin up new realms if necessary. I think they don't intend to ever have 10 layers on a realm, more like 3-4 max. If after the initial rush died down there are still too many people on a realm, there will be queues and likely a free realm transfer option to less populated ones.
---
The paid beta testing and character reservation is also partially there to gauge interest. Those who do so are surely quite dedicated and will probably play long term. So how many of them there will be is a good indication of the expected long term population. (Although I'm sure the money grabbing is just typical ActiBlizz greed too. :) In case of character reservation, they explicitly said that it's there also for measuring interest.
---
With all that, I'm still worried they'll underestimate demand and there will be overpopulation on the initial servers. Ah well, can't have it all.
---
But nobody has access to that client besides Blizzard, and the game is running ont he BFA client, so you don't know if all the coding is still being processed correctly.
---
For HP regen, I am still unsure how off it is, as HP regen is suppose to be a bit higher than mana regen. But there is no fucking way the mana regen is right, people are literally never running oom.
---
and dungeon mobs damage just seems to low, like a rogue shouldn't be able to tank at all for more than a few seconds without popping evasion.
---
and Blizzard could actually be better at either confirming if its correct or not by communication more on their bug threads at their forum
---
You just triggered my PTSD.
---
Yes, some clarification would be awesome.
---
It should be possible to do 5 man‚Äôs and there are multiple detailed, decent guides out there ‚Äî some have already been linked by others. The one on Barrens Chat and one by Totemtank are both good.
---
But there are a few caveats:
---
1.) These guides are predicated on pserver information. Things may be (and probably will be) different on Classic. Don‚Äôt assume they are 1:1 until proven.
---
2.) Even doing well, you‚Äôre almost certainly not going to tank raids. But if you‚Äôre not going to raid anyway, it‚Äôs not a big deal.
---
3.) People, as you can already see, are going to be dicks and try to tell you how you should play the game, spend your time, and effectively what you should be doing with your 15$ sub. It‚Äôs shitty. You‚Äôll probably have a better time with a group of friends. Otherwise you‚Äôre going to be scrutinized, criticized, and basically have to prove your own capability every time you go into a dungeon. Which can be part of the fun if you like! Just keep it in mind.
---
Finally, optimal and even viable are NOT always equatable with fun. Play what you enjoy, just also realize you will have extra difficulties tanking than, especially, the warrior.
---
I like that he isn't just performing a 180 and leaving it at that. He clarifies hes still going to play the current game, and gives reasons why the old game is also enjoyable, and why you can still enjoy Classic, even if you arent a super turbonerd 14/14 naxx raider.
---
You're right, and that's exactly what they should be doing. Beta testing has never been about trying to get the players to go out of their way to debug the corner cases. I swear some the people on this sub want to get salty over streamers sooo badly.
---
No, that doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong.
---
Blizzard is using a 1.12 client for REFERENCE, not as the actual client. The client we are using to play Classic is a downpatched version of the BFA client.  
---
If you want confirmation, just check out the Classic footage of the last Blizzcon. Health regen values, crit values etc etc were all clearly off and they did fix those for the new beta client.  
---
It's fair to say that something minute as regen etc. aren't things people usually remember and it's probably not accurate, but to say that Blizz client is perfect and probably not flawed in any isn't a good idea.
---
Better safe than sorry. I'd rather have people report something as buggy even though it isn't and having Blizz doublecheck everything by using their 1.12 client than people not reporting something out of fear its just their flawed memory and us getting a flawed version of the game.
---
It was Jewelcrafting.
---
Looked correct to me. Smaller due to zoom or FoV perhaps?
---
Bugs are being found pretty consistently. Raid content still needs to be tested thoroughly, etc. Aug 27th is fine.
---
So did i get this right? Hes confused if its intended that when you sit down and somone hits you it is a crit for sure? 
---
It sure was like that back in the days.
---
Nice call mate
---
Have we seen anything past level 30 to confirm this? Any dungeons? Any raids?
---
I‚Äôm hoping they take the time and get this right although I am anxious to get started ü•≥
---
&gt;This is just a stupid bug
---
*Feature
---
Comes with the sub
---
lvl 12 Fedfennel in Elwynn forest dealing 109 - 131 dmg. Daum is this true?
---
I know it's going to be hell and I can't wait.
---
It should only happen on Nost/Ely/LH, it doesn't happen on Kr*n*s for example, you can cross the river next to durotar and you don't see any phasing
---
Rouge is a colour, not a WoW class.
---
RemindMe! 1 year
---
You just start subscribing and automatically gain access to the base game plus everything up until including Legion (lvl 110). DO NOT purchase the base game from anywhere; they still sell it but there's no need for it :)
---
Seems about right. But thats my point. It is quiet similar. Just hate on it because Classic and Retail cant just coexist. 
---
I dont know. In my mind they are completely seperate games. And that is fine.
---
I‚Äôm going to go ahead and assume your voice also sounds like an annoying cunt irl
---
Anyone from EU got in beta yet?
---
Are there EU beta server or just NA?
---
&gt;no one cares how you think how other players should play the game
---
you care - enough to write a lengthy whine post
---
One option is to try and find a late night guild (for the US).  These are around, but I don't know of any off hand.  This would allow you to play on US servers and make long term friends, but once you are back in the US, you will have some knowledge of your server.  On top of that, you might have a good reputation that you can leverage during your transition.
---
Clearly got the wrong people involved in playing the beta
---
 Its just sharding for the first zones guys, relax, blizzard is reasonable.......
---
 Guys its just layering so we get a smooth launch.....
---
 Guys after 2 weeks layering is off for sure, Blizzard is trustworthy and never lied to its players....
---
 Guys be reasonable, few months of layering is not a big deal.....
---
 Guys blizzard have to keep layering as permanent solution because it is healthy for the realms, they have to keep their costs low and its 2020, get with times.
---
Yes, we're already organizing this, but we shouldn't really...
---
In Retail barely anyone says anything, even hi/bye.
---
Those pillagers were no joke.  I died to them about 3 times today.  And died once to a drakeling in RR.
---
I‚Äôve been leveling a BFA character and never had the bug at all. I‚Äôve had it on Pservers but not on live.
---

---
No one will have gold to buy your herbs or ore so skinning is good to dunp on vendors for the extra gold
---
Ive been annoyed by this myself. White and yellow dmg numbers arent treated equally. Critical strikes dont stick and the numbers fade out way too soon.
---
Addons cannot replicate this since its a matter of how the text is animated.
---
Asmongold and Mcconnell have made a video about it. Ive spoken to Staysafe who dont seem to notice a difference at all /Shrug.
---
Waiting on a damned beta invite so I can make a proof of concept video. 
---
That said. This topic seems like a non issue to Many people so it probably wont get the traction needed for a change. 
---
Just like warrior charge and rogue stealth animations they arent vanilla either.
---
Annoying website articles that under no circumstances should ever be linked to.
---
Wait, what's the issue? I recall in vanilla (I'd assume around) 1.12 you got crit from sitting. We used to do it as ret pallies, and testing crits infront of IF
---
or is he saying, when you stand up you still get crit?
---
hope so, 1 server would be nice.
---
So this is why most of the beta invites were to accounts from 2004 lol
---
Stabby McStabb stab.
---
Yeah I need to really setup my hotkeys for stance dancing.  God it has been forever since I have needed to do that. Also mouseover sunder.
---
I want mining/eng for pvp but isnt fadeleaf for blind and swift for energy tea going to be very expensive?
---
Just here to shout: "FOR THE HORDE!"
---
Picking Paladin just because you get a free mount might be the most stupid thing you can do.
---
Pick whatever you want to play, bite the pillow and earn the gold to buy the mounts.
---
Idk about you but the droprate on that thing was horrendous! :‚Äô) So much time spent getting it

"Repairs"
---
Thanks for the honesty. I‚Äôm concerned people will clear out 4-5 packs get invited to a diff layer and repeat.
---
me too. I dont care if it takes longer, its just way more fun
---
its coming out august 27th. end of...
---
Makes tanking more involved.  You have an aoe pack.  You use mousover sunder to tag mobes but first you run in with charge, hopefully you have tactical mastery.  Then Demo shout, pop rage, TC, stance dance to protection, start applying armor, watch timers on TC, after you get sunders up reapply TC by stance dancing next time you have low rage, also keep an eye on Demo Shout.  Tanking is Vanilla was really involved.  TC only effect 4 targets also.
---
how the fuck have we not heard this name yet?
---
get this man an AMA at *very least*
---
Find new friends with the Horde
---
The shield grants slow fall ..
---
 Don't need defensive stance to use... But warriors do
---
literally everyone on this sub has heard his name, maybe you're just living under a rock
---
Just stack spirit
---
They changed the formula on it to use fake splenda sugar stuff. Tastes bleh.
---
&gt; Still, August 27th seems way of. Why not stick with "classic summer"? 
---
They are sticking with it.
---
its the equivalent of going into a market value discussion about Messi and then asking what offside is.
---
The imps where hell.
---
100 days 12 hours 48 minutes
---
You can, he is wrong.
---
There hasn't been any official listing of what servers there will be, but there have been Oceanic servers (Australia) in the past.  I would assume that would be the best option.
---
I.. I don't remember! :(
---
Jokes on you that's what lots of people did. Including me all the way until Aq.
---
I agree completely. The only thing pushing the WoW section over 50k at all is hype - no matter if it's with BFA or with Classic. My assumption is, that Classic streams will add up to around 20-30k viewers down the line (when soda, shroud etc. leave due to their viewers dropping), while retail will usuaully hover around 15-20k. After the hype has died down of course.
---
And then, each time a new Phase gets released the hype will pick up again, just as it usually does with WoW patches.
---
This subreddit has two problems, that i don't think even come from the access to Beta: 
---
1. it feels like all the posts here are either memes (just like the /r/wow subreddit) or posts of "look at my googled screenshot of this ugly place in desolace and upvote me for nostalgia points" 
---
2. the circlejerking. For a community often claiming they have the high ground in terms of social aspects and morality, there are plenty of people who don't accept the notion of people liking certain aspects of BFA (even with all its massive problems), or have differing opinions regarding classic (don't want to play on PvP server? downvoted into  oblivion because you are a pussy and play the game wrong), as well as constantly proclaiming how **all** the WoW subs will be mainly, if not only, playing WoW Classic and Retail will die out in no time and similar notions of that sort
---
Oh, and of course the influence from twatty players that play(ed) on private servers is strong here. 
---
I mean, I was someone who hated the idea of Classic servers in 2016, but that was mainly fueled because of my experience with private server players hating on anything post Wrath (or even TBC for the extra hardcore ones) and I getting kicked out of a guild for saying I actually liked MoP, back on Nost. It has been negative for most of the time. But I also learned the bad and good aspects of the TBC and Vanilla and I can now talk about them properly instead of just blindly hating. 
---
I just wish the majority of people here were like that.
---
Yes, but some beta testers have tested it and found it to proc which is a bug as it shouldn't per the statement above.
---
Cheater.
---
I honestly wouldn't advise it. Sounds wrong but prot is arguably worse at low level thanking than arms, so you'd be crippling your leveling as well as your tanking performance.
---
That said, don't let me talk you out of it. For me classic has always been about flavour over efficiency so if you want to play a rock hard Tanky Boi, you go ahead and live that fantasy.
---
Where did you find this misinformation? My warrior in vanilla had mining and skinning. My hunter in the beta has herb and skinning.
---
I think a lot of people who think they can run MC are going to get initially steam rolled by trash when they go in for the first time. Or maybe not. Perhaps the grind to 60 will have taught them private servers aren't the same as classic.
---
However, the thought of seeing Rag for the first time (again lol) and hearing him proclaim "By fire be lightly toasted!" does make me giggle somewhat. :D
---
I think a lot of the increase with warlocks is the patch version the game will be. Warlocks had a terrible rep starting out. Was just awful for the longest time.

Silithis, because it wasn't itemized when I did it, so you could stay for hours and hours without having to hearth and sell.
---
it was only 8 at the time because of the hardware limits, they upgraded this to allow for 16, but again this was just because the hardware could not handle infinite debuffs. not a "design" per say.
---
I think the best bet is to read some guides to specific classes, and then just reading them for the ones you're interested in. I generally find loads of materials that are class specific, but not much that is universal. 
---
When you have a better view of that, your can perhaps start looking into WSG premade tactics, etc. 
---
That being said, I funny thing anything can replace practice. Like you, I've never been much of a PvP'er, but wanna get better during classic. So I've read guides, and I've created characters on various PvP oriented private servers, but it just takes a long time to translate a guide into an instant reaction.
---
Not gonna clash with BFA 8.2 which is expected late June or early July.
---
Shaman and Paladin are the most played if it will play out like the poll.
---
Yea thats not a friend buddy
---
Its in no polished state it has a core and some data wallpapered on top to cover the cracks.
---
watching people like Tips/Lirik/Asmon is the worst thing ever they consume content regardless of whats there and it gives the impression of oh its ready to go.
---
Perplexity is a good stream to watch where him and a number of people are actually spending hours testing spell batching, polymorph bug hunting and how combo points are operating.
---
"Chose" is such a short word... I would say "randomly chose based on financial considerations decided on by the accountants and other beancounters" as being more fun to throw out there.
---
lol, the irony of your statement
---
Could you upload this Masterpiece?
---
True that, good luck to you all!
---
&gt;Can we stop staying world first? There are no world first in classic. The world first were all done in 2004/2005. Nothing in classic is ‚Äúworld first‚Äù it‚Äôs just click bait bullshit
---
Rofl, Salad Bakers and Grizzly? They are no where near top anything.
---
How does one reach a point in life where this is a desirable use of one's free time
---
His second channel is actually much better.
---
Guilds with cringy latin names, how very vanilla.
---
10/10 for nostalgia
---
People can run the private server version of MC blindfolded.  If the first few day of the beta has shown us anything is that these private servers were way off in many aspects.
---
With that said, I think they should leave it as is for everyone who is looking to come back and experience the things they missed out on the first time around.  Blizz has already said that they would be willing to look into new content for Classic if it does well (and after the last phase of course).
---
Or a warlock. I still can't decide between a warlock and a mage.
---
No pretty much same with humans are gonna be a pain in the ass cause every warrior and rogue wannabe minmaxer will lvl human
---
When I got the release date it all became worse cause I had the Hopes that it would release earlier... and now I have to wait 100+ days for it. But I guess I now have 100+ days to choose if I'm gonna be warlock or hunter.
---
They do not give a ton of XP. As far as drops go, they *ususally* have a chance to drop something interesting. But some dont. Low level rares often drop bags - but not all of them. Many have an increased chance to drop gear - but not all of them.
---
Firstly, it‚Äôs world rather than continent. Secondly, no you‚Äôre quite right. Humans will have a mare early on. Lastly, I expect they will start off with a high number of layers for the first 6 hours, maybe something like 5. So if there is 10,000 on your server, then you‚Äôll have 2,000 in your layer, or 1,000 horde/alliance. As you‚Äôve noted it‚Äôll still be tough for Orc/Trolls &amp; Humans (humans often ~40-50% of total population. Undead and Tauren should be the best experience.
---
Not if we're talking about the 40 lvl mount.
---
No extra exp. Some of them have unique drops, both BoE and BoP.
---
Tauren hitboxes can't be right... 
---
slightly bigger, sure. but atm you could hit raggy from the majordomo chest it seems.
---
Read the latest post of blizzard with non-bugs being reported as bugs, Josh is capable of testing, not the majority of players on this sub or private servers or retail servers. Get down from your high horse of stupidity and understand the point.
---
Isn‚Äôt it possible to change the fontsize and style, like it was in the real classic?
---
yes, thats correct. Rares are often hard to kill, especially low level ones. However keep in mind these are raw damage values before armor.
---
These developers are truly inept.
---
Add the most immersive server type to an immersive sandbox MMORPG? Nope. Doesn't make sense. Nobody wants that. /sarcasm
---
Cool, thanks for the info. In that case, I would think that showing the drops on this site would be very useful.
---
The primary issue with using the 1.12 client isn't the bugs, it's how it can be abused hard by hackers, as well as its inability to communicate with Blizzard's modern systems.
---
Not everyone is interested in playing the game the same way as is you.
---
If you don't like it, don't use these kinds of resources for information.
---
Yeah.  In TBC Blood Elves could be paladins.  Then in Cata, they allowed Tauren.  And now I think the Zandalari Trolls can be?
---
i mean fury only works at 60 anyway, dont know why people recommended it.
---
you wanna go for arms, specially if you are in a pvp server
---
Thought I was the only one who noticed this. Found two good videos to illustrate this issue.

Again, I didn't say that he is not capable of fixing stuff, idk his experience maybe he played pservers before.

People complaining about Warrior regen are a joke, 15y of Private Servers bullshit and entitlement and still they dont know that EVERY CLASS HAD A DIFFERENT HP REGEN.

Speechless.

There's quite an emotional back story to the Guild's name.

Fantastic, you're going to be doing god's work, son. I can't wait to get ganked by you.

---
While i appreciate the attempt at blowing some fresh air into this subreddit, it seems that a diarrhea stench were caught in the gust on the way here.
---
Based on what exactly? These guys are dedicated af and know the game inside and out. They will surely be among the top guilds.
---
I would not want to be on the opposing faction on their server.
---
Hehe. Well, I have two friends that are programmers that are joining me and they would really like to play Alliance, so I'm ok with that if it means that I get to create the guild with them. (:
---
It's not hard, it just tedious as it takes 30 seconds or more to kill a single mob and  it's basically non-interactive beyond auto-attacking with the occasional judgement tossed it.
---
Gives off a strong "you think you do, but you don't"-vibe. 
---
You want classic? Here, have it with all the inconveniences that not even private servers had. I'm not unhappy about it tbh.
---
Thanks, this is what I need.
---
Just go herb and have a guildie make the pots.
---
They're so overpowered in duels that they're not allowed to go Soul Link spec in duel tournaments... That's why they lose there.
---
ya oceanic is pretty close. ill get good ping also
---
No, but using that as an excuse to whitewash all the arrogant misinformation isn't cool.
---
There is a halfway point as well.  Jump half, eat, jump 2nd half, done.
---
god i hate bfa
---
Hahahahahahahaha
---
It is zero chance that I get in. I haven't played retail WoW for a long time and thanks for "2th-authenticator" I can never relog on my main account again. Even tho I provided Blizzard with my real driver license and I still use the same mail-account and still have the same BANK. But the CS at Blizzard are a bunch of a-holes.
---
Just most of the time you're killing mobs with slow AA. My advice is to find a good series to binge watch and sit back between judgments :)
---
You‚Äôre going to make lots of friends ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
To be honest I don't remember addons used in PVP. But for sure one tip - be always ready for an attack. PVP servers had serious gankfests on contested zones, and when you lvl, you also learn each ability of your class. If I remember good I had over 1 000 kills before reaching 60, most of them without visiting BG's. 
---
When you reach experience cap, you know what to do and how to react against other players. I can't help you much more, because I was mostly PVE oriented and reached like Knight rank on main, and commander (?) on alt (rank for free mount). 
---
Memories are great, but a lot of time passed and it passed like 10 years since I've played WoW for more than few weeks.
---
If they listed Verdan the Everlivings damage is working as intended it would have been a legendary moment
---
I would go mining/skinning and drop skinning at 60 for engi. Save all ores and level up as far as you can. Then either buy the rest or farm it yourself to max out Engineering.
---
No point going LW since you won't be able to keep it up to date without wasting alot of time (If efficiancy is important to you). Also it will cut alot of profit from skinning without much of an upside. If you're not THE leatherworker in your guild getting all the recipes there is no point in keeping it at 60.
---
Email, I am not at my PC

---
I'm in love with your comment.
---
But mastering that control is so satisfying! And tbh, all it takes is a few extra keybinds and practice to make it super easy
---
What item is that? Tried figuring out on my own but I *need* to know.
---
Oh man I remember how many ppl added me because I played heal and people whispered to me "Can I add you? You are a good healer" Good times, I hope I will see this again
---
I'm struggling to use that server to find a good levelling route - STV is a joke so I've ended up at lvl41 without going there. Down side is I'm now struggling with quests as I've cleared everything in other zones so I've had to just grind mobs for so long.
---
Ohhh okay thank you
---
Watching the testing perplexity and his friends are doing, there is a lot if room for improvement. And this is only rogue stuff! In my opinion it‚Äôs a good decision that they take there time.

What about the damage numbers? A lot of people have been reporting that mobs deal significantly less damage (not people like Tipsout in WC) compared to Vanilla. I watched Sodapoppin and Asmongold yesterday and they didn't even stop to drink or eat, also elite mobs in dungeon are doing really low damage too.
---
This community manager didn't mention anything about these things.
---
Won't happen, even if it was. 8.2 likely drops in July - they wont want this to conflict.
---
THIS, asmongold read a donation on stream today where someone asked why he wasn‚Äôt reporting any bugs. He responded with ‚Äúbecause there is nothing wrong with the game, the only bug we‚Äôve found is when there was no water in deadmines‚Äù
---
Streamers aren‚Äôt good beta testers. Blizzard just want to drum up the hype I guess.
---
Happens all the time on other servers
---
yeah, i dunno, i went and found actual vanilla videos and they looked pretty much identical from what i could see.
---
even if they weren't... like, seriously? are we going to complain about text sizes? what about other things such as color blind mode, ultra wide support, grass swaying and other things that were, very clearly, not in vanilla if this is apparently an issue.
---
I thought blizzard said they wouldn't be sending emails? Is it in your launcher now?
---
Oh hey look, another one of these "you should play and enjoy the game the way I do" threads.  
---
How about no.
---
Fuck the ama, get him a bonus.
---
That's exactly what I plan to do. I want to see all the dungeons accessible to the mighty horde.
---
I played a holy paladin through vanilla, and they're stupid strong.  
---
If you want to heal and also be an armored beast, roll a paladin and enjoy.
---
Nah you downrank your heals and it's all good. Both are an excellent choice and both are playing with the 5 second rule. Pre-casting heals and only healing if people actually takes damage.
---
Vanilla is much slower compared to retail. If chain casting is a dealbreaker then this might be the wrong game for you.
---
Unfortunately reporting people for griefing RP was a pain the ass. If you tried to have an RP event then a pure PvP guild infamous for specifically targeting RPers for shits and giggles steamrolls you the GM would just shrug and either say that's just how world PvP is or has the balls to suggest they're "RPing" (pretty sure the nonlore names, dancing on corpses naked and spamming AoE when we finally got somewhere to deflag isn't RP). 
---
I used to be on an RPPvP server and while plenty of guilds had an agreement to not attack anyone that was RPing (Actual RPPvP aside) one or two guilds made it their mission to stomp on every RPers sandcastle because they knew nothing would be fine about it. It was at a point where while out in the world, if we saw a single one of their characters nearby, we knew that in about ten minutes that alt would tell their guild where we were and in about ten minutes we'd be ganked by half their guild.
---
What was hilarious though is that these guys were shit at actual PvP, hence why they target RPers I guess. If we had half decent gear and were at max level we could actually beat them. But every time they would then bring more and more of their guild because "We can't lose to RP fags!" (Literal quote provides by a friend who infiltrated one of the guilds).
---
Unfortunately before the addition of transmog but while PvP gear dominated that aspect of the game, chilling in RP gear meant we'd be one shot. Eventually I got sick of it and moved to an RPPvE server instead.
---
All that being said, vanilla RPPvP servers were okay. Most people were cool and had "rules if engagement" that boiled down to "don't be a dick to RPers", and the power gap being fairly small between levels and gear meant griefers often had to fight an uphill battle since there would be so many RPers in one spot. Wrath and onwards is when the oneshotting and excessive griefing cane into play. So hopefully in Classic it's a similar case.
---
!remindme 88 days
---
MadSeason on YouTube did a really good video on this not to long ago. Free mount doesn't really apply to the epic version. 
---
On the first tier I believe it's pretty easy (I was a warrior during vanilla and it was so damn long ago I can barely remember)
---
But the epic tier for pally and warlock ends up near the same cost as buying it from a vendor but the difference being that only those classes can have them.
---
That said I will be rolling Pally aswell because I like healing too but I also love Ret in vanilla with all the different auras.
---
But the entire reason I will roll pally is to raid MC so I can wield the hand of rag, then go full T2 and look like all those people I admired in If when I was 16 years old.
---
I never got to raid past the first boss in BWL and it's something I desperately want.
---
That makes sense for tauren vs non-tauren. Do you have any clips of Tauren vs Tauren from back then?
---
Haven't played vanilla, how will Dun Morogh look like in congestion? I want to play a dwarf paladin :)

Amen brother.

Classic is the perfect game for this. Be a good player and a nice guy and you will NEVER have trouble finding decent people to play with.

Well congrats dude!
---
I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
Theres plenty of that. But its not all mobs. Some mobs have the opposite. Lower spell resists and higher armor. The private servers had to guess on everything except beasts, so the values are all over the place.
---
Thanks! One of my old friends on my friends list got in and I was so bummed. 1 day later, bam, it's go time! Haha
---
I think they are just so used to getting everything they want since they only play with viewers and have to share between eachother.
---
Notice how Esfand thinks of only him and Asmon. ‚ÄùDude, its good for tanking‚Äù, yeah but there‚Äôs a hunter next to you...
---
The entitlement is real. Pretty sad how they just assume they can take whatever they want.
---
Updated Navak's time since I got to see a screenshot of his played. He has a shorter /played than themechanic now. The top is in order of real time lvl order though so that stays the same.
---
Wrong, theres video proof that the hitbox was actually that big. Its in this thread.
---
i mean that sucks but its beta which lasts few months, characters get deleted anyway. just to be clear im no asmongold fanboy, i strongly dislike that invidual
---
Am I seeing this wrong? He's a lvl 21 Paladin and the Undead is a lvl 11 Rogue?
---
Example number 1 of why to avoid streamer servers. 
---
Also, its classic, this will become their reputation and no one will want yo be friends with them or run with them.
---
They have 15 years of data of what people are doing during summer, and how/when/if they come back.
---
I can't see a world when they would change the release date. Release dates ate very important business-wise.
---
How long is the beta lasting?
---
All the info you would ever need my dude.
---
http://classicdb.ch/
---
He got scorched.
---
This IMO isnt fair. So far, people have questions Lock pets despawning, Tauren hitboxes, Warrior health regen rates and more. Each time a video has popped up proving Blizz right when they say they checked the data. Heres the Tauren hitbox proof:  https://youtu.be/CgV6Gk7LfK4?t=18 
---
At some point I feel like people needs to let it go. They are being honest, asking for a video (which is basically what ppl are doing by saying they don't believe it) for every single small issue is untenable. And its also just denial. Seriously...
---
I returned to Legion after a long break from wow and tbh i loved the class halls, spec speciality and pve lore.
---
My return only lasted short while though cuz in 2 months i had already gotten 3 characters to max level and high gear score, it was just so incredibly easy to gear up.
---
Can't wait to actually spend some time building up my character again in Classic. And be part of a living server communication.
---
damn you seem really upset about being bad at a 15 year old game
---
Imagine playing WoW with a streamer, thinking that the two of you are gonna be on even terms and won't have an advantage over each other.
---
Sorry, but the guy had it coming. Big streamers like Asmongold don't give a fuck about you. People have got to stop treating them like they're doing some sort of non profit charity work for puppies without legs. No streamer should ever get away with pulling off scummy shit, buuut there ya go. I'm sure his fanbase has got a lot to say about this other than spamming twitch emotes.
---
Stiches ...

---
Communities are build from level 1 to 60. A lot of the people who ended up on my friendlist was after teaming up with them _multiple_ times during leveling. There's _always_ a couple of people who you see doing the same quest as you at level 12, and 4 days later you meet them on the same quest but at level 31.
---
I don't think this is a huge deal, but I'd probably have preferred it if everyone was 'assigned' to a layer for the first couple of weeks, and the only way to change layer (temporarily) was to join a group with someone from another layer.
---
XDDD

Doesn't say in the email or in the beta forums. Speaking of which, i'm going to make a post of what I just found on the beta forums.

Man chill out. It‚Äôs not gonna have much of an effect other than creating large world pvp clusters or the occasional dance party in org. Not a big deal.
---
You get a pass if the guild was created with that name way back then, but for real, whenever I see a latin named guild, I slightly cringe at it. I just feel like it's a bit forced.
---
Thx!

Griefing streamers actually sounds pretty fun. The guys are incredibly obnoxious and all of a sudden they‚Äôre just another toon running around azeroth all vulnerable. Gives an even playing field to take them down a notch. I might sound like an asshole but I don‚Äôt like streamers or watch streams but anticipate having fun with this.
---
You know what its not really a fair call considering I plan on playing a Frost Mage.. 
---
My rotation is a solid 111141111411114
---
I cant agree more
---
The guy is a little aggressive in that video but his point is correct an mmorpg not just wow should be about the journey but time and time again it's just about rushing to the end. This is why vanilla leveling is fun and retail sucks ass. The journey to 60 is rewarding and fun and by the time you are 60 you hopefully have a fundamental understanding of your class, role (not always the case), and your appreciation for the world around you.
---
I almost did a spit take when he said that would be good for tanking on his stream
---
The not a bug thing has already been posted Haha.
---
I hope I'm right behind you! Enjoy man!
---
Damage calculation is not done on the client, it's done on the server.
---
there's very little difference between a shadow healer and holy/disc healer until you get into Raid fights.
---
Talent-wise your efficiency doesn't really start to manifest until fights last 3-5+ minutes, which is also the point shadow struggles as a dps spec anyway. That doesn't happen in dungeons, so all those efficiency talents don't matter as much.
---
Your gear is what will define you.
---
Just stack Owl or owl-like stats as you level, and you can do both fine.
---
Especially early in the server life-span there probably won't be anyone to craft and sell Shadoweave items (you can't do the quest to learn the patterns until about 5 levels after they start losing their luster), you'll probably be struggling to find +shadow items anyway, so any +damage you do end up with will likely be +damage/healing (it also becomes much more common from BRD onwards).
---
Just keep a few mana pots on hand to make up your healing spells being 15% less mana efficient.
---
And make sure to practice your stop-casting to squeeze out extra efficiency.
---
We had a shadow priest that some times healed whenever my resto druid had to tank while we were leveling (i was normally the healer but occasionally the warrior we usually played with wasn't on and had to improvise), and he never had any issues keeping me alive, despite Druid tanking being dog-shit back then (Dire Bear form was weaker for most of vanilla than Bear form is in 1.12)
---
Oh ill delete it. Rip.
---
While there are phasing issues Blizz is aware of this is simply the border between two zones. Happens on pservers too in that exact spot.
---
Ahhhh right i was assuming it wasn't proccing
---
When you play solo Mind blast, shadow word pain, mind flay, mind flay, mind blast, wand until dead works pretty well you want to be mana neutral between pulls and have about 75% mana when you pull so work out a rotation that works so you have max up time.
---
There was a hugely famous meme when one Paladin one-shot Kazzak with a Reck-bomb.
---
They quickly patched it afterwards. The history is well known, but this is a case where 10+ years of private server bugs distorted people's memories of the timeline of Reck-bomb nerfs.
---
Oceanic. Dodges the bullet... Who TF wants to watch an Australian play? Have you ever listened to your self if your an Aussie? Especially over seas? We sound f'n dumb lol
---
I used to do that and even buy twink items on auction house on Nostalrius lol.
---
There's nothing "official" about this sub/R/ - it was one of dozens created the moment that Classic was announced. This one just gained the most traction.
---
The rule "Don't post private server crap" is one that is self-imposed, not due to legal ramifications.
---
"You think you want it, but you don't." Good job proving it right by the way.
---
These threads always pop up and I always wonder why you all complain that mediocre games are mediocre, instead of playing good games.
---
Yes, it's a current Beta bug related to spell-batching.
---
Waiting for addons to massacre the vanilla experience.
---
That‚Äôs what you get for rolling on a PVP server
---
*shrug*
---
Addons work
---
Doesn't apply if they're a streamer, cause people want to feel special unfortunately
---
Have you meet Son of Arugal while questing?
---
And here I am. Watch. Your. Back.
---
Ping from SG to oceanic servers (WoW) is around 100ms
---
I used to have 10 FPS during raids, but I don't see that as part of "the authentic experience".  
---
144 fps classic wow is the \*beautiful\*.
---
Arguably more reason to not ninja it though? Like if it doesn't matter, then why bother stealing it. Compared to if it was actual classic and you having some gain
---
Not really. Plenty of stuff out there that's entertaining (Factorio, the Legend of Heroes series, They are billions, Grim Dawn, GalGun (oh yea boiiiiiiiiiiiii)). I'm taking the long route with Classic anyway, and I don't see it as some kind of "forever-game".
---
That's the real vanilla experience.
---
Spirit is actually good for warriors 1-40 while solo leveling, common misconception that it wasn't. Just information people should know.
---
is that a addons to download or ? I'm not following what you saying
---
They're both douchebags. Dont watch their streams.
---
I am not really getting the "bitching" vibe that people here complain about from either side. It seems to me that the reception to the beta has been much much more positive than during the demo.
---
if everything on the website was made post TBC probably not
---
Yes. You can download a beta recount for example off of github
---
wrong. you're not faster than me going backwards. you can't go backwards at all if you unbind your S key, so you're slower!  
---
at best, you're the same speed as me strafing after turning 90 degrees
---
Gnome mages, locks, some warriors for escape artist if they PvP, dwarf priests. Probably won't be as bad as elywnn though?
---
Does it show anything in your account management? I can't be bothered to get out of bed just to be disappointed.
---
Right but they still need to test it period. No point not testing something in a beta because people thing it's just there for them to get their fix and they should have uninterrupted gameplay
---
I don‚Äôt like it, but it‚Äôs unavoidable when using a more modern client.
---
It's already confirmed to be a bug in a recent bluepost, so don't expect to keep it.
---
Patchwork the DPS was kinda important. I think they said you need X raid DPS to be able to kill him and we measured our raid DPS other bosses to see if we could attempt it.
---
If you were on Beta, you'd be surprised how *high* it is on Classic :)
---
I dont remember.... :(
---
From the looks the chat wasn't that happy they took it from themechanic so it probably had some negative backlash but regardless themechanic has gotten huge playing with these guys he started with 8 viewers and ended his streaming averaging 300+ so im sure it's all good also he isn't that mad because he's gonna farm a cloak that's better tomorrow, just for some context also no im not an asmon fan it just doesn't matter much because it isn't bis
---
Why did no automatic roll thingy come up?
---
Honestly, I think the misguided rumors are part of the game.  
---
Imperfect information adds mystique. :)
---
Everything is easy if you have enough knowledge and skill though. I assume people mean that warrior is generally harder and require much more to level than other classes. Potions, AH gear upgrades etc also aren't going to be a thing the first month as the econopmy is not up and running.
---
I agree.
---
I have been a mythic raider for years and I'm absolutely not using recount/details/skada at all in classic. 
---
1) it doesn't remotely matter
---
2) it's silly when the game is being designed so intentionally unbalanced that a meter is only even useful for 3 specs in the whole game.
---
3) my nostalgia isn't about the dps I did, it's about how I felt doing it.
---
Not only that, weakaura litreally work in classic supposedly i was asking if any addons can but Idk about 2004 classic API vs 2019 classic now.
---
TitanPanel was still relatively popular as far as MoP, which is amazing if you think about it.
---
Fine, each to their own. I am not bothered one way or another about how you approach the game, just expressing an opinion.
---
Yea would of been in bad taste but they wanted to I'm sure
---
Asmongold is probably one of the worst for that too tbh
---
He's playing a character. Do you think he's being serious?
---
They said they use current wow api not classic API. They said in blizzcon ages ago that they would not allow the functionality of vanilla addons, but that ended up just meaning they were using current wow's api
---
Graveyards in Wp near the ally flight master.
---
Hell yeah I'm going to repeat it.
---
why make 2 posts about this?
---
Its vanilla wow so T0 T0.5 T1 T2 T2.5 T3
---
Ohhh so blizzard isn't going mess with it at all?
---
It is a chest. Items looted from chests don't get roll prompts. You would normally roll before opening.
---
OP suggests you to take your time and be lvl 19 by phase 3 :D
---
Nobody sorts by new.
---
They might, but they said in recent interviews that current addons will work from current wow with just a bit of tweaking. But they didnt say how far they will tweak the system for classic
---
I feel amazing about it. I used mpowa as well on pservers for a few buff reminders etc.
---
There's already a WeakAuras version in the works.
---
Before anyone complaints, that it destroys the Vanilla experience:
---
What about PallyPower?
---
Totem Timers?
---
Engery Watch?
---
Swing timer trackers?
---
PallyPower even semi-automates buffing people.
---
I'm only saying it before anyone comes up with stupid things like "addons ruin the classic experience".
---
T4, T5, T6 and Glad armor are all TBC
---
Actually excited they are working on it
---
Lots of time to get in shape for Classic launch though! Perfect for losing 10kgs so you can gain them again playing Classic!
---
to be fair, we're replaying old content so everyone already knows how strong what class is in this version of the game.
---
False. I sort by new.
---
Everyone overseas loves the accent mate. If it wasn't the 10 hour time difference I'd love to watch an Aussie stream. Your guys sense of humor is something else.
---
you need to half the votes of all other classes (and then remove the oposing faction class -&gt; Pala/shaman) and then recalculate the percentages if you want to compare paladin or shaman for actual % on your faction. 
---
For druid, count that 70% of all the druids will be alliance druids, and only 30% ish will be horde. The inverse for warlocks.
---
These polls are usefull, but you need to do a bit more calculating before you can really understand them. just reading it like above is very far from the truth.
---
An opinion that strongly suggest this kind of playstyle is bothering you ;)
---
got me wondering if there going be a limit of addons going on in, can't believe WA can work because of spell ID and such
---
What about Hunter Pets and companions? Is that a thing? I think I did that before TBC??? Maybe this would be useful...
---

---
I mean, they were posted literally straight after each other, so
---
first off back paddling is slower than strafing. second is that you can strafe back.
---
Let me guess, you have no clue about this game?
---
I don't think they can take all the credit for his recent increase in viewers. He was the first streamer to 30 classic is also just really popular. So it's not like they made his streaming career
---
Is it only from alchemy?
---
I hate this imbecile.
---
What res is this, curious if I could use it in wallpaper engine
---
Yeah, it's been a while but as far as I remember it's far easier to have a Warrior as your first alt. Having a party of friends ready at 33 for the Axe gives you a significant boost. But as I said, it's classic. Leveling a Hunter up to Level 10 without a pet is also super hardcore (and fun ;) ) between level 7-10. But of course it's getting super easy after level 10 which is a lot faster than reaching level 33.
---
addons were a part of vanilla.
---
whether blizz should limit what they can do due to using the newer client well maybe.
---
while leveling you'll get to laugh in your bubble as you hearth away from pvp.
---
This whats me to play the game even more! WHAT?
---
Right!!
---
Asmon was and is always a dick and fairly toxic. People just ignored it or thought it was funny. Imagine doing SFK and getting cloth shoulders ninjad because it has +1 agility despite the 8 intellect.
---
Yeah for sure, I don‚Äôt think I expressed my opinion real well. The open world/leveling experience is pretty much completely missing.
---
Ahh, right.
---
I've said this before, not about this instance though:  when you act like an asshole when it doesn't matter, you are more likely to be an asshole when it does.  You should be a good person if it "matters" or not.
---
no reason, i formed my sentence poorly. dick move is dick move and tells alot of azmon :/
---
It's being re-developed at the moment actually for Classic https://i.redd.it/llwky178txy21.jpg
---
is mizkif a streamer? i was corpse running in stranglethorn on my level 4 yesterday and i saw him running to duskwood
---
I bought 30 days game time but my account was created in 2018... They got me with the gambling LMAO. Oh well, if they really plan to invite accounts from different years I might just end up getting in with a miracle. At the end of the day, the game time is a cost of a breakfast, I can stomach it I guess....
---
The regen thing was always a moot point anyways. The only argument you ever see against it is the "feel" of playing warrior, and people have demonstrated again and again that the regen numbers do match vanilla footage and known formulae.
---
Same thing with tauren attack range and reckoning sit procs. One side argues by feel, the other by references.
---
Imagine caring about streamers as much as this sub does.
---
Glad that Rogue isn't actually that high up
---
Huh.
---
I thought it was kind of a giant war game, orks vs humans and what not.
---
Fuck streamers and yank them every chance you get. I will grief all these streamer cucks
---
Fuck these guys are clowns.
---
If you kept up with ArenaJunkies, you'd understand.
---
I noticed it aswell on a stream. It looks god-awefull.
---
And people still watch these guys? I don't get it
---
A friendly reminder that this behavior will get you a bad reputation in no time. Everyone knows everyone on the server.
---
This is the price you pay for knowing about the release date early!
---
It‚Äôs very true for me and I know this because it was like that way back in the past. Although I must say that I‚Äôll still play hearthstone at work. When at home, WoW 100% of the time.
---
And I don't give a fuck about bit streamers. Guess we have something in common
---
&gt;Then wtf are you responding to the comments for ?
---
IDK you reaction for a person not knowing Josh was very funny.
---
His Chest, His Loot
---
Trolls could definitely be shamans.
---
Also: don't forget fixing bugs sometimes isn't as easy as it may appear. The most simplest of bugs are sometimes the hardest to fix.
---
Nobody in software engineering can tell just by taking a look at the bug report, that the code on lines 9999-10020 has wonky interactions with the code on line 500 that cause a bug, although that is one of the worse cases. Maybe someone forgot to set a flag or a bracket and in hundreds of thousands of lines of code that isn't easy to find in a few minutes.
---
Best examples being Eyes of the Beast and the disappearing orb in Temple of Sethralis in BFA. The former one apparently just stopped working and they just weren't able to fix it nor was it worth the time to do it. With Classic they had to reverse-engineer the 7.2/8.X clients to make it work, and shown in a new interview, that they found the solution and that the ability can be reintroduced even on retail.
---
Then you got one of the BFA dungeons. In temple of sethralis there is a gauntlet, where you have to pick up two orbs and put them in eye sockets of a gate to open the path to the last boss. Sometimes, if unlucky, the orb vanishes and won't respawn, forcing you to reset the dungeon, whcih is harrowing in Mythic Plus. That even happened on the MDI with ten thousands of viewers on twitch.
---
It's in the best interest of Blizzard to fix that bug, yet even after over a year of Beta and release the bug hasn't been fixed.
---
Sceptics will say that Blizzard can't be assed while realists (me included) will say that it's no easy bug to fix.
---
100% right, funny how now the beta is out these streamers are showing there true colours.
---
Oh shit yeah ofc.
---
No, no they couldn‚Äôt. There were only Orc Shamans. Same way there were only Human Paladins.
---
I don't get the hate on streamers. They get their key to promote the game. They don't get it for free. It's like a modern day analogue of TV commercials.
---
Media people got their first peek on games since at least Wolfenstein 3D and probably even from atari consoles.
---
They don't recieve the beta because they are good players. They don't recieve the beta to betatest. Blizzard are giving keys to betatest to other players.
---
But Belf Paladin is fine?
---
My concern too, like why not fix a bug that you know exists and fixed later in the game? Will it be a permanent feature until a later phase?
---
Oh is that a belf? I assumed it was a human.
---
Stream link below - they are using group loot.
---
Go to 02:49:43

---
When did he win the chest? or is standard procedure the first to open gets the chest? I think that works great for hunters who can feign and open the chest before the boss dies.
---
/&gt; blizzard would never lie to me
---
The way I always played was I f someone in the groups finds a chest, they just call out /roll and whoever rolls highest, loots the whole thing.
---
yea i saw that on twitter, make me wonder if raiding going look like lol'd after tracking buff / debuff / boss casting / range check / movement etc.
---
No. Trolls and tauren could as well.
---
From  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Shaman](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Shaman) :
---
&gt; The shaman class was originally only available to three of the [Horde](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Horde) races: [tauren](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Tauren), orcs, and trolls.
---
Obviously some mobs might be easier than on private servers, but in general I've heard private servers made it too easy. Especially when it comes to raids.
---
You don‚Äôt have to use them if you don‚Äôt want to.
---
Unless you start changing server layer every time you log in and out, that way you wont really know the other players leveling up around you.
---
group loot doesn't work on chests?
---
Aye my man!
---
Don't overestimate your own self-importance. The only one you are hurting by not playing is yourself.
---
appreciated
---
How does one NOT find this desirable?
---
which is why phasing ruined the wow community
---
Just a little something I putted together for hype of classic Wow.
---
Hi, /u/post_ironic
---
lol asmond with another fake reaction.
---
It‚Äôs really people own fault for even grouping with any of them best to avoid realms with streamers once Classic is out
---
AH - OK.
---
I noticed throughout the stream that whomever gets to the chest first wins it - the other people in party also got to chest first but in this case this was the only one that had a blue - rest of chests in steam had greens
---
These 2 replies make me feel better. I was ignorantly expecting it because I so badly want to play it more than any other game in the world. I started in 2007 and been EXTREMELY dedicated except for WoD and since season 2 of BFA. I want to test everything I ever seen go wrong on every private server. I hope you guys get in soon!
---
The old tea bagghing argument for the s-bind.
---
The circlejerk around hating tipsout on this sub is insane. Y‚Äôall need to chill and stop gatekeeping
---
I just played with shroud for a bit. I was doing a quest he was on and he randomly invited me. He chatted with me a bit and we ended up doing a few more. Not all streamers are dicks just like not all republicans are racist. 
---
If people who happened to be steaming are assholes, eventually their server with blacklist them just like people got blacklisted back in the day.
---
The lesson of Farenheit 451: it's easier to watch TV than be your own person. 
---
I'm not much better, though.
---
Oh cool! I also enjoy playing the occasional game of OverwÃ≠ÃùÃºÃùÃ§ÃüaÃ®ÕùÃØÕôÃòÃ≤ÃºÃútÃ∏ÕûÃºÕÖÕöÃªÃºcÃ∑Ã∑Ã†ÃπhÕèÃüÕâÃ¨ÃºÕéÕàÃ¨Ã§ :)
---
not like addons didnt exist back then. Addons literally played for you back then
---
1.12.1 talents make a HUGE difference. If you lvled in vanilla in an early patch you would definitely have had a harder time than if you did it in a later patch.
---
I sort by new occasionally. 
---
But this thread isn't going to become hot anyway, even if there're 100 of it.
---
I'm hoping they decide to make new level 60 content instead of expanding to tbc/wotlk....
---
Decuraive literally played for you back then. just saying
---
r/Mizkif is 2 blocks down
---
I don't really watch either of them but I looked at the vod of the hunter and he doesn't seem to care that much. Did they agree to roll on chest loot previously? If not then none of this matters and you're getting upset over something that has literally 0 effect on you.
---
What does it look like on your client?
---
No, in retail.
---
bro hes making millions a month and fucking the pussy off of pink sparkles while you sit in ur moms basement jerking ur dink with ur midget ass hand 
---
get real lmfao
---
This is helpful, thanks. Blizzard games seem to be pretty well optimised for low spec systems. It's good to know that it can run fairly well on integrated laptop graphics which is really surprising given your laptop CPU is fairly weak relative to today's laptop CPU's.
---
I mean, it will be limited. It doesn't really matter anyways
---
You never heard of Arena Tournament ? Then I cannot take seriously virtually anything you say about PvP, since it was the biggest PvP phenomena in WoW's history.

---
You probably started after Wrath or at the very tail of it (actually, since you say MoP had great PvP gameplay, that's almost 100% certain).
---
&gt; Wrath PvP was all about blowing people up 
---
Completely wrong, and even the vids I just linked are evidence of that. Go ahead and show me these Shadowmourne R1 cleaves on any PvP video, I'm certainly there's plenty of evidence for your claims, is there not ?
---
&gt;  Shadowmourne DKs/Pallys/Warriors 
---
The simple fact you talk about "Shadowmourne Pallys" jut goes to show you don't have a clue about the subject, sorry, let's end it here.
---
As you do the exact same thing lol
---
Do you not know how to google? The very first link has multiple sources.
---
They raced to loot the chest before anyone could even try to roll on. Just because the hunter didn't this scummy behavior get to him doesn't mean it isn't scummy behavior. Watch the stream if you really want context.
---
It seems tipsout isn't as experienced as he sounded like he was, but also I don't remember him ever saying he was experienced in the first place. Ugh its so hard to stand up for tipsout while looking at this pic lmao
---
You need gold for respecs, repairs, mat for consumables, enchants, crafting items. 
---
You need gold for equipping alts with better stuff for leveling.

Scholomance

I was just kidding. But to be honest I'm not really a fan of macros that really influence the outcome of combat. Macros like the warlock soulshard seems accapteable to me.
---
I‚Äôd say zero

I think it was confirmed that ppl who subbed after the beta release won't be able to get invited for testing

It seems to be whomever gets to the chest wins

Sit **does** proc crit. This crit **should not** proc Enrage/Reckoning according to the recent blue post.

There may also be differences between PvE and PvP behaviour.

---
Ah, fuck off your high horse. No one is "whitewashing arrogant misinformation", what are you even talking about? These jabs at private servers at every opportunity gets tiring when the reality is that none of this would exist without them. It has always been known that things are different between the real thing and private servers, no one has ever said otherwise.
---
This happened AFTER the cloak ninja. Asmon already set the precedent on how chest loot works at that point.
---
A CS person made an ambiguous post some people interpreted as that. That's a very long way from 'confirmed'. I think there's a very good chance you get within the next 30 days OP.
---
15 years is a long time, friend. Especially for those who didn't play private servers.
---
I love how elitist everyone suddenly is.
---
Just gonna grab the popcorn and watch this sub lose its collective shit.
---
welp, bamboozled then
---
its not a bug just because you dont like it idiot, let them recreate vanilla like it was
---
Someone said it above:
---
&gt;Blight's Blope
---
Sub gets you 1-110. You only need to subscribe to be eligible for beta. If you want to play the latest expac BFA, you will need to pay a separate fee to upgrade your account to BFA. Max level in BFA is 120. Best of luck
---
Probably depends on spell batching.
---
You guys are being ridiculous. He rushed to open a chest in a beta. The hyperbole about little stupid shit like this is out of control. Don‚Äôt watch his stream if you don‚Äôt like him.
---
No addons means no enemy cast bar, no enemy HP, no cooldown tracking, no swing timer. Means mediocre at best PvPer.
---
Look at that subtle off-orc coloring.  The tasteful THICCness of it. My God, it even has a Playable mark.
---
that's the worst part, I do not have BFA at all (not interested) so I most likely bought wasted game time
---
Because it was a pedantic comment about pserver players vs retail players and giving more relevancy towards the former which is bullshit. I gave an answer debunking this statement and went ballistic on it despite me being right just because you couldn't fathom not being relevant.
---
This whole affair was a waste of time.
---
Yes! I love action cam. :)
---
For hating streamers this sub sure talks about them a lot.
---
Turn out they weren't lying and it actually was really hard for them to find a way to do it. Who would've thunk.
---
waiting "patiently"
---
Oh my glob he forgot some of the sidewuesfs fuckin PHONY
---
This is nonsense. I played a paladin through all of Vanilla and will do the same in Classic. Prot spec is largely useless but they are the best healers in both PvP and are great in pve. You can also raid heal as shockadin spec which is strong and fun to play in PvP. Ret can work in 5 man's and for PvP but you won't be raiding as Ret. 
---
Also you have the best utility in the game which makes for some fun wPvP encounters. Finally spec holy and team up with a warrior friend to wreck everything in BG's!
---
This is just sad. Lmao it's a beta chill out
---
usually someone is nominated and the guild 40 man farms for that person
---
Because most people can't remember shit from 15 years ago. Private Servers have given people a lot of wrong information and it's hilarious.
---
Ally scum....
---
Hehe wish you luck buddy
---
Done and DONE!! Looking forward to this!
---
Arcanite and Elemental transmutes triggered each other though if I remember correctly. They have different cooldowns, but using one will stop the other being used until it is off cooldown.
---
What's really embarrassing is you actually thinking people would respond positively to your post. Yikes!
---
"Only vanilla experts and hardcore pserver players can play muh classic". Lots of people haven't played vanilla since it was current dude, and a lot of people might not of even played retail in years either. Let people enjoy things.
---
As long as they all agree on loot distribution. If that method works for them all then great.
---
But I'd recommend if it doesn't - then always the option to leave group.
---
The paladin epic mount is NOT free. It's gonna be a bitch to get.
---
we're talking about a 15 year old game here. your computer is the opposite of a potato when it comes to wow.
---
Because he is an ignorant moron who pretends to know everything when he knows less than nothing. He's a leech, he's a scumbag and he's a child. Cries to the community about giving him money because he lost his job, reports a guy to the police for writing "lmao" on a meme video about Tips. Reports a boss in WC to be bugged when there is tons of evidence from old sources that it wasn't bugged, but he was just being bad at the game, and yet he still claims it was bugged in this video.
---
He deserves all the hate coming his way.
---
There's a saying "know your class". To be good in PvP, you want to know all the other classes too.
---
Also learn by doing (duel a lot).
---
Also have good binds and addons.
---
Disclaimer: I suck in PvP, always panic and do random stuff.
---
Who cares about this guys wtf if you all played wow since vanilla you should be grow ass people now
---
chill
---
How olds that guy he would've been what 9 when vanilla was out?
---
Sodapoppin was healing after every fight when I was watching.
---
why do you think that's an argument? did you see him say somewhere that he enjoyed and advocated for decursive to exist? I didn't but his post is really long so I may have missed it somewhere.
---
Lol no it's not. No game is worth 'pushing through'. If it sucks, and you're not having fun, stop wasting your time. You shouldnt have to grind through 50 hours of boring, monotonous garbage to get the cookie at the end. Its lazy game design and blizzard need to learn a lesson.
---
I did the same. Fingers crossed for both of us.
---
I think the mass tests will be open betas to active account holders. Guess we‚Äôll find out soon enough.
---
Cant wait for all the wow thots to degrade the average quality of classic streams :D
---
His age doesn't subtract from the validity of his statement
---
On my server it was different IIRC. I think rolling before looting is dumb since someone might actually need it.
---
Look at the video. There was clearly no prior agreement.
---
Perhaps they are referring to this post?

well you clearly do, considering your last two posts are sad whiteknight attempts while trying to portray an ''i dont care'' attitude while shitting on the sub
---
And afaik will not be present when starting zones are over.
---
Yes that is correct. Two Taurens fighting naturally have a bigger hitbox.
---
Its how it worked in Vanilla, so it's not a bug.
---
They fixed nights again during legion / bfa. Cata through to WOD, they were super bright.
---
Are at all surprised though?
---
I main a mushroom since TBC
---
That‚Äôs what I am saying. He can‚Äôt be legit pissed, right? Is everyone being serious in the comments?
---
But people wanted vanilla WoW as it was, with all its quirks and bugs no?
---
Oof gotcha. Well buy BFA and farm up some gold until you get beta access to make classic free forever =)
---
&gt; literally know nothing about almost any quest. 
---
Imagine how bad you ahave to be at the game when you dont know the quests.. /s
---
Its higher than people thought because they have been playing on private servers with incorrect formulas.
---
I did watch the stream and it looks like you're more upset than anyone actually involved in the situation. From what I can tell, they didn't agree to roll on chests. Looks like a first-come-first-serve type thing.
---
The hunter said "roll" after it was looted, his buddy even said "I don't think they saw what you said, just whisper them", which he didn't. If he whispered them and still got ignored, I could see why you're upset.
---
It's only scummy if they said they would roll, and then didn't when something good dropped.
---
LOL that's rich. Talking about being on a high horse while defending arrogant people putting others down for DARE QUESTIONING their supreme private server knowledge.
---
Go away, kid.
---
So if I resubbed 2 hours after the beta went up I am forever out of future waves?
---
The problem for me with most new games today is i am just instantly turned off by the lack of depth they have.
---
Tried out that WWZ zombie game, great gameplay quality but quickly realized once youve ran through each mission once, youve basically seen all the game has to offer, unless you like a watered down pvp mode.
---
I need something to invest in properly, not these quick cash graps where each update is just another new cosmetic set to put on amongst the 50 you already have.
---
I am right there with you brother, we coming home soon.
---
I could not give less of a shit what streamers do.
---
&gt;Asmon streamed this [https://clips.twitch.tv/IncredulousFantasticCroquetteDeIlluminati](https://clips.twitch.tv/IncredulousFantasticCroquetteDeIlluminati) pretending to lose the sentry cloak in a roll.  
---
&gt;Other stream shows they blatantly  ninja looted the cloak without rolling. 
---
That clip definitely didn't show them pretending anything, it showed esfand looting it from a chest.
---
I agree that that's shitty AF, but I don't think there's anything dishonest here.
---
Private Servers have been guessing values. Blizzard has the true values so shits harder yo.
---
I don't know the fight, but with a 10 minutes CD would that be enough? Especially if the group wipe in between, you can't use it anymore right?
---
I know a lot of you are extremely excited for this game, I am too. Try not to direct any hate towards someones lack of knowledge. Yes of course some mechanics can't be forgotten like learning to ride a bike but it's just been a long time for some people. I understand where OP is coming from with a few content creators I can think of but definitely some streamers could be cut some slack JUST A BIT lol
---
Yea, it's like spirit*0.8+6, whereas other classes(it varies a bit) often have spirit*0.25+6 in hp regen.
---
That occasionally happened in retail and BC.
---
Wow that's an insult I haven't heard since middle school.
---
I played vanilla and I've forgotten about some quests, or secret passages myself. It's been 15 years..... How much do you remember from when you were 9??? I bet everything right????
---
Paladin for me.  I leveled every other class at one point or another in vanilla/TBC, I just could never get past about 25 or so on a pally.
---
I remember the stardard being you roll before you open in vanilla. Highest roll gets to open the chest.
---
Hi, /u/LucidDreamState
---
Devs like like long anwsers.  
---
The more info, the better
---
I had occasions where the roll thingy did pop up when someone opened a chest, at least for the Green and above items... or my memory so wrong. :/
---
24 hour ban in classic or a private server? I didn't know blizzard banned for using/abusing obscure mechanics like other games do?
---
I think it is certainly dishonest to just ignore the roll request from the group. You can even see asmongold hover the hunter when he read it.
---
No, that was BC onwards. Bosses that spawned chests with blue loot could be ninja'ed no problem. Dire Maul tribute and the seven dwarves in BRD worked like that, so yeah.
---
In other words, priests have enough mana to end the fight with 5% and paladins have so much they end with 70%?
---
Skinning/mining then drop both at 60 for engineering and herbalism so you can get your own fadeleaf/swiftthistle and solo farm herbs in ZG.
---
They're not sending keys in email. They'll let you know you're in tho
---
Not my proudest moment.
---
They are supposed to have the real database, and there are enough old videos out there.
---
This is soothing and calming. Love. It.
---
What are you talking about? Are you talking about Miz or Tips? If you're referring to Tips, what does he have to remember from when he was 9? He started playing in Cata or some shit lmao
---
No u
---
No you both
---
60 mount / riding skill  
---
repairs  
---
consumables
---
AH  
---
PVP Gear
---
I don't know, would that be sustainable with a 9-5 job? I never really farmed gold and have no idea about current prices. If it's literally farming gold every day then I'd rather pass. My salary ain't that good but even I could still pay 15 bucks a month xD.
---
ITT: People not getting the acting.
---
Because hating them, doesnt mean, you cant talk about them.
---
you wouldn't have made the posts in the first place if that was the case my friend
---
Maybe because they don't want the community to be ruined by them.
---
I mean... post Cata world and quests are longer in WoW than vanilla quests were. That being said I would be much more restrained with opinions on this topic, especially towards streamers that are playing every expansion. But overall, streamers are like celebrities, obviously they would do a lot to get viewres. It's their job after all.
---
I'm pretty sure the hunter wasn't acting
---
15 dollars ?
---
Man deer meat is getting cheap.
---
Just 1 RPPVP for NA and 1 for EU is all we ask. And if they get to crowded, make another.
---
2412 hours
---
That desperate to play a broken game that needs bug fixing huh?
---
Who gives a shit, its a beta and the cloak is completely worthless
---
I didn't die, just had to autoswim for a minute or so.
---
Big streamers are putting on a show. If the ninja loot gets chat's blood pumping and eyes locking on, it might just happen. I understand it a little, but I'm dodging streamers 100%.
---
SilverDragon AddOn does this in-game and actively scans for these mobs.
---
Blizzard does not want sitting to proc crit talents in classic, but as of right now you can do it with well timed sits using the sit button. Not sure if it also works with /sit
---
You're reading way too much into this just to hate on streamers.
---
Your reading comprehension sucks. Where do I put people down for questioning private server data? I specifically say that things aren't the same on private servers and on Classic, but the vitriol towards private servers is surprising seeing as they're the reason this subreddit and Classic even exists. Blizzard would not have done this without the massive private server playerbase.
---
"Kid."
---
Yeah ok, we're done here, you're clearly the kid in this conversation.
---
If you don't like them then don't watch them.
---
What‚Äôs your experience? And I‚Äôm just sharing my opinion as someone who has played since 2004. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying BFA is perfect or even good. But I am saying I find the PVP, mythic raids and + really challenging and fun in the endgame. And if you are subbed in my opinion before giving up for the game being ‚Äútoo easy‚Äù or ‚Äúboring‚Äù try the parts of the game that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or ‚Äúboring.‚Äù
---
Hope that makes sense!
---
Can you test Battle Shout threat? I've heard some people say it generates massive threat in a 5man party(more threat for each person buffed), but I've also heard taht was a private server bug.
---
Nostalrius was average ~8-10k online, peaking at 14-15k. While crowded, it was _definitely_ playable. I'd definitely say I prefer 9k pop over 3k pop.
---
Explain how you‚Äôre in ‚Äútop guilds‚Äù in vanilla when the current expansion is BFA?
---
Your memory is wrong. Chests have to be rolled on before opening in vanilla.
---
Because this is a list of NOT bugs.
---
Mobs doing too little damage sounds like a BUG. So it wouldn't be on this list.
---
So why exactly is the entire sub praising Nostalrius to the high heavens when it turns out it's all down to Omar figuring a way to do it? I mean Ion says it right there, Blizzard didn't object to the idea of Classic servers, they just didn't think they could actually do it, not without taking too many resources away from developing retail. 
---
&gt;People have asked questions at BlizzCon for years "you're ever gonna do legacy servers?" and when we said "no" in the past it wasn't because we had some philosophical objection to the idea of it-- it's because we didn't see a way of actually making it real. 
---
And yet the thread on the front page with over 2000 upvotes praises Nostalrius to the high heavens. The idea that private server makers are in some way responsible for making Classic happen strikes me as ludicrous at best, and massively misleading at worst. In fact according to Ion in the same interview, it was Nostalrius *closing down* that got Blizzard to take another look at the possibility of making Classic happen:
---
&gt;A few years ago, I think in 2016, there was a really big outcry around the whole topic and the community really forced us to take a close, hard look at it and to say "ok, we don't think we can do this". But what if we look again, what if someone told you we had to find a way to do it, what we might come up with, and some of our programmers tried different approaches. 
---
Can we honestly say that if Nost was still up, that we'd be seeing the release of Classic in 3 months time? I don't think so. The private server crowd were more than happy to play Classic for free and many hated Blizzard anyway, as evidenced by the outrageous outcry about layering recently. Seriously, the private server community are the first to shit on Blizzard for anything they do. I'm no Blizzard fan-boy; the last Blizzard game I bought was Wings of Liberty, and I never played WoW past vanilla. But at least I didn't play on pirated servers, mouthing off Blizzard at every opportunity, and then pretend that it's thanks to me that Classic got made. Classic got made because an engineer named Omar Gonzalez figured out a way to do it.
---
 Summary and long is good, using the in-game report on the actual mob itself is best. Just keep in mind: 
---
&gt; \- Feared players and NPCs run fast.
---
This includes mobs that run away with the  "X attempts to run away in fear!" emote, they are currently not considering this a bug, it is accurate to 1.12 according to Blizzard.
---
I also got an invite to the Beta this way!
---
Just want to test a few things before I decide on my final race choice.
---
Forcing you to buy gametime for a game you don't want to play (Retail) to have *chance* to get invited to beta test a completely different game that you actually want to play. Blizzard never used to forced you to have an active subscription to retail to be invited to a beta of another game. This shit is just lootboxes and gambling in games all over again. It's shitty Activi$ion tactics which should be outlawed and spat upon.
---
no
---
The videos you posted don't show that either. They just show the hunter typing roll then it ends before anyone really have time to respond. I guess you could be right that they didn't roll or give it to the hunter after the video ends, but it could also be that you cropped this just right to make streamers look shitty so you can cash in on the reddit circlejerk.
---
Also, dishonesty is not the same thing as shittyness. Not rolling for chests or blues in chests is not dishonest, but it is shitty.
---
If they ever do raid content everyone else in their raid is going to be pretty sad about the loot system in the guild. Can't wait for the dramas (:
---
you cant buy them from vendors or similar, if thats what you mean
---
Ya uh what
---
umad
---
PS. Wasn't bugged
---
Asmongold brags about how he used to do this all the time in BC. Why is anyone surprised that him and his friends are dirtbags?
---
You can search streams easily. If people try shit properly it's even easier
---
If the group wipes it's gonna be atleast 10 minutes of walking back assuming everyone died in a good spot to be rezzed and only a handful of players need to be resummoned back, it'll be even higher if you have a disorganized pug type of guild/group. 
---
Mind you that the bellowing roar from raid bosses is cast at random intervals and not on the dot so that's just accounting for maximum misfortune. You'll get your stance dance off 50% of the times (speaking anecdotally maybe I was just an insanely lucky tank) and even when you inevitably screw up as a human would do there's even more misfortune to be calculated in for it to become a raid wipe (every single person getting crit, every single person being feared in the same direction, getting breathed at the same time as getting cleaved). 
---
As for Onyxia in particular if your group hasnt killed her under phase 3 after the 5th bellowing roar (how long you can maintain fear immunity completely solo) the problem doesnt lie with the race-min/maxing of your healers(or shadow priest) and finger pointing them out is just petty and reactionary. And for Nefarian you'll hopefully have passed the dps check bosses to make the fight trivial at best.
---
I played a tauren warrior and would request our Tremor Totems to be spread out across the ranged except for Magmadar progress, I don't remember the dynamics of that fight exactly because I was only 13 at the time.
---
OMG that's actually SO COOL. I love how they have a reference client to check these things. Classic is going to blow my mind, I better make sure I discipline myself to go to sleep and not play more than 14-18 hours a day when released lol
---
the GM or main tank (often the same person lol ) gets it
---
both were talking shit
---
And on this list it says that ~lvl 10 mobs should be doing around 30 damage, while on the beta thats the damage that is being dealt in deadmines, and BFD was like 40-60.
---
Yeah, armor reduces some of it,but I still think damage is too low
---
I mean, not to defend him but agi gives armour
---
The full 5+ hour streams are up. You can go look at them before you try an excuse their behavior so that you know what you're defending
---
Think its just a notification email to let you know your bnet account is flagged for access. No key in the email.
---
if you haven't actually logged and played in you can refund the game time, just mail support
---
I am also a fan of bloodcraze! It soothes the pain of being crit by mobs while leveling
---
I wanna quest in duskwood and always has my camera looking at my back because of Mor Ladin!
---
I'm sorry when my english isn't good enough to make a correct statement about what I wanted to say. 
---
"...I don't remember addons used in PVP" - wanted to mention -&gt; "I don't remember correct names of particular addons."
---
As I later said it has passed 10 years, for me it's enough time to forget details from game.
---
Mediocre however should be a compliment for me ;-) Mostly played PVP as designated healer for better players farming honor up to highest ranks (before raids where auto created in BG's).
---
Summing up I've suggested on starting with knowing OP's class from first lvl's and learning from outdoor PVP when going for 60.
---
I didnt even go to middle school
---
I got kickd out for bashing a kids head in 6th grade
---
im a fucking savage beast
---
Weren't they coming from Booty Bay? If so he would be marked for PvP for 5 minutes after.
---
You were never in barrens chat were you.
---
Except people plan on playing WoW classic for a long time right? So eventually they're gonna HAVE to do something with it. I agree that from the start everything should be a snapshot of patch 1.2 or whatever but after naxx...I'd love to see them continue the game while keeping true to the themes of vanilla WoW.
---
Current wow is pretty shit. Now onto classic - will you enjoy it like you once did? Nobody knows until you personally try it. I hate when people ask this question because it‚Äôs impossible to answer. Nobody can tel anyone if they will or will not enjoy classic wow, all we can do is tell you what the games like and you can decide on your own. I personally downloaded a private server last August and tried a newish server to try classic and I loved the shit out of it. It‚Äôs a pretty good game to be quite honest
---
Only thing you are wrong about is Trade was 100% used to find groups. Trade hit all the major cities, general only hit the city you were in which is why Trade was used for group finding.
---
look up what gatekeeping means before you use it lmao
---
I'm just defending myself against people calling me a liar or saying that they had an agreement.
---
He's not even that good. Compare Asmongold DM tanking to Preach running RFC. Jeez.
---
"Cleave is really good for holding threat on multiple mobs" - Asmongold.
---
You're Welcome, i'm working on video 3 at the mo, hopefully upload it later tonight
---
Not sure why I would be mad, I'm in a good mood today, the hatred for Tips doesn't affect my general emotional state.
---
I only need to read the title on this one. nope
---
Yes but in vanilla you already afraid the mobs.. to not pull more than 2 (and some cases more than Duskwood darkness adds to the atmosphere.
---
&gt; Are blizzard monitoring this thread?
---
100% yes
---
[This is you.](https://i.imgur.com/Qj4Vf5A.jpg)
---
the logic of warrior is enough str and stam to just being able to kill x number of mobs (1 being ideal) and the rest in spirit as combat time is a lot less than resting time. this just means that one point in spirit shaves off more time than 1 point in str.
---
to me this is the reason classic is so good everything has a benefit even if it isn't clear even to the dev at the time how good it is. it is a lot of they just made a bunch of indepented systems and made it work. todays wow is a lot more intended partly since WoW players today are so much better at nailing this shit down that random systems just made to try and work together would just get broken down in 2 days of what can be skiped and is not worth it even if it was super complex and hard to understand.
---
Most people here will tell you yes but that is because theyve experienced vanilla and retail and needless to say the difference is huge. You cant really say what others might like personally but i hope i can help describe the differences:
---
WoW classic is like the car that takes a while for you to get to your destination but by so you experience the joy of the progress youve made and everything doesnt flash by fast. Once you reach your destination the feeling is great.
---
WoW retail is like the flashy sportscar with all bells and whistles on that is all about getting to your destination as fast as possible, the most easiest way possible.
---
Although retail has many things that are great additions to the game it also has a lot of stuff thats made the game feel more anti-social i think. 
---
If you like being part of a big community, a server that feels alive and your name to be familiarized then classic is the obvious choice to me. 
---
Just a heads up though, it will take longer work to progress your character.
---
Here's a Q, did you resub before initial beta invites went out or after?
---
It's beta.
---
Haven't been ingame since the demo, would that count? But I don't think they'd refund it if I said this to them a few days before expiration lol.
---
The player they ninja's mentioned over and over again throughout his stream how he felt he got ninja'd
---
I understand, thank you.  Its been a while since I played TBC (when I started wow).
---
I'm spending some time with Dota Auto Chess as it is a game I can easily drop when it's classic time. But yeah, I'm also not starting something "serious" as I would have to drop it again in 3 months...
---
A good bug report answers these questions.
---
* What happened?
---
* What was expected to happen?
---
* Can you recreate the issue? How often?
---
* If you can reproduce it which steps are required to recreate the issue?
---
* If you can't reproduce it, if anything, what did you attempt to do to reproduce it?
---
Checked my email -&gt; Blizzard EMAIL OMGOMGOMG -&gt; Hearthstone -&gt; Bleach
---
Arms is Better no question if kiting works as on pservers though.
---
&gt; I did watch the stream and it looks like you're more upset than anyone actually involved in the situation.
---
so what?
---
I can't. Too scary.
---
ok blizz i resubbed and played retail 30 mins before getting bored, now GimMe
---
I‚Äôm planning on 40 boxing the open world stuff and paying a guild for the bwl stuff lols
---
At least we know Blizzard is responding appropriately, knowing they aren't bugs.  I was afraid if enough people reported something that they would "fix" it. Tauren hitbox was one that came to mind. A lot of people on Twitter, Reddit, etc thought it must have been bugged.
---
Who even cares man, why go around hunting for things to get outraged at?
---
Did he say "that was a good roll" as in pretending that he won the roll, or that the chance to get that item was lucky?
---
Who the hell doesn't roll for chests? That's standard operating.
---
+1 for Galadriel
---
You're supposed to use the beta to test features and try to find bugs, whether that be through normal gameplay or bug hunting. It's not a demo... DON'T STOP AT 15!
---
Oh man yea i really miss the community and every server had popular characters (for bad or good lol).
---
You want me to explain to you how it's possible that I was in a top guild in retail vanilla when current expansion is BFA?
---
How do those things even have anything to do with eachother?
---
Also, since you seem to think no one used consumes in vanilla, care to explain this?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smNKU0Lihk
---
Wasnt this exact same image with almost the exact same text posted less than 2 days ago?
---
r/iamverybadass
---
I think it's more that players these days don't wanna be 'left behind'. so you feel the need to rush to endgame, even though at the end of it, it doesn't actually matter because you have a slight gap before the first raid tier with expansions. Are Molten Core + Onyxia released from the get go? Because that will make the incentive to rush without question for a lot of people. Also a lot of us work now, so we gotta use our time effectively, which we naturally would try and rush threw it to try and 'catch up' with players. I'm gonna find it hard to take it slow, even though I would like to.
---
This isn‚Äôt gatekeeping lmao
---
Maybe reading the whole thing would make you come up with an actual argument as an answer.
---
ok, thanks for the heads up. ;)
---
no way im subbing just for a shot aat beta, they ain't seeing a penny from me til release lol
---
I totally agree except that i wouldnt recommend engineer and enchanting for your first character. These are very expensive. Even training the recipes will be expensive.
---
Getting your first mount at 40 is not easy, you need to save every last piece of copper to make it.
---
But if you are paladin or warlock, and have free mount at 40, then by all means go for it. Especially paladin will benefit from engineer a lot!
---
Or you may be druid or hunter and you are ok with 36%(talents) and 40% speed already :)
---
It's a shame really, since Asmongold isn't half as stupid as most people might think. He can be very entertaining, but his high position in the streaming community turned him into a bit of a douchebag.
---
Your argument is to alter the class balance from its original state. I don't care what argument your making for it. The answer is a 100% no from me dawg.
---
Seriously. This subreddit has turned into complete cancer. They make the whole classic community look horrible.
---
You're right Esfand does lie and say "that was a good role"
---
yeah, it is actually great for tanking. It does also give warriors AP
---
It was filled with trolls And Chuck norris, very mild to todays standard. Barrens chat was not bad at all.
---
Best thing that could happen: give him the company. Whole thing
---
We‚Äôre getting the 1.12 version, which is 10 man UBRS.
---
People are afraid of any deviations from vanilla since they‚Äôve been burned by blizzards vision of balance for the past 6+ years.
---
How would the game improve if boomkins were viable?
---
Because if you don't call out shitty people nothing ever improves
---
This sub really needs to calm down. It's beta. Nobody minds who ninja's this or that in a beta. Also this sort of thing is going to happen in classic honestly, you need a thicker skin because if you react like this when it happens to someone you don't even know, you're going to lose your shit when it happens to you.
---
Well I honestly can‚Äôt get understand how people idolise these kind of people, in real life pull Scumbag shit like this and ur getting punched in the face just as it should be.
---
\*laughs in clothie*
---
I'm not really defending anything. I'm just saying your "evidence" requires taking a bunch of stuff you're saying on faith, which makes it bad evidence.
---
Bro some of them might have been fine with it philosophically, but the reason they get shit on is perfectly legit. Before we had do you guys not have phones, there was you think you do but you don‚Äôt. Both are shitty things to say said by a shitty company, no matter what wall of text you type out.
---
The name is in honor of our previous GM who died, we were just kids when we named it so the translation isn't 100% accurate. It reads Sun at Night, but to us it meant "A light in the Darkness".
---
It has nothing to do with the modern client, addons like that existed before aswell.
---
Reading is hard, isnt it?
---
How can we even answer that? You do know WoW Classic is not out yet?
---
Blizzard said we'd get RP servers, but we wouldn't have any rp-pvp servers. See the Faq
---
Sorry, but especially in classic there is an understanding to ALWAYS roll on chests. The argument'' they didn't agree on rolling for chests'' is a little lame because it is like an unwritten rule.
---
yeah but he could either be dumb and think that the items stats rolled well, or that it was a "lucky roll" to get that item.
---
If there weren't any private servers then blizzard wouldn't even have thought about it. It showed that there was interest. So yeah, Nost are 90% responsible for classic
---
agi doesnt give warriors AP.
---
That being said, it's still a great tanking stat.
---
this one is pretty self-explanatory
---
My evidence doesn't require anything to be taken on faith? It is all literally documented and laid out for anyone to look at...
---
lmfao fat kid
---
listen here i would literally go to ur house fuck ur mom and sister eat all the food in ur fridge and play clsasic wow on your pc while u sit on the couch and cry because there is literally nothing you can do
---
Yea, would be OP as hell and always sold out if that was the case. Thx
---
Great and i hope blizz has 9k servers for you. I just want a no sharding 3ish k server as an option.
---
We wont really know until classic launches, because the first run of a dungeon on asmons stream the day the beta releases obviously isnt representative of long term interest which is what would be relevant to long term WoW design decisions.
---
I support the classic community in no changes in order to preserve vanilla and its place in gaming history, but in terms of design lessons going forward it would be a shame if blizzard were to afraid to make decisions an instead opted for stagnant design where they just try to make a WoW clone essentially rather than try and dissect what makes classic good. Your comment on how poor itemisation, spell ranks, having to grind mobs, make classic good seem like that to me. They are certainly a part of the vanilla experience, so it makes sense that they are in classic, but i dont think they would be good in retail. Imo the good design philosophies of classic could be utilized in retail while dropping some poor aspects because of course old WoW isnt perfect either.
---
Is anyone honestly going to say they would rather grind mobs than have interesting quest design? Maybe you'd rather do vanilla levelling with grinding than modern levelling with quest design, but we arent forced to make binary choices like that so shouldnt want to. Vanilla's levelling pace and experience with a full complement of quests would surely be better. This is just an example, and i think blizzard should see how different aspects of classic play out before trying to asses which elements of the game will benefit retail ( as some surely will) and which elements retail can do without, which imo is equally as obivously the case in at least some instances.
---
And firefin snapper later, when mages can play fire again...
---
He is one of the most irritating clueless streamers. I'm just so glad that the classic community on servers will spit out jerks like him. Though it will be harder with stupid fanboys around, but over the time stuff like this will get attached to your name. Thank god classic is coming.
---
That's exactly what I was referring to.
---
I wasn't hunting it just happened in front of me and thought people would be interested
---
Turns out it was a bug and they're looking into it. I don't know enough about layering/sharding/etc to know if it makes any sense testing with 100 people on a server vs. 3600. So you're right maybe it does make sense to test it now. But apparently, they aren't. So I guess we'll have to wait until more are invited before we can see it tested.
---
I don't think it is, it changes literally nothing about the game other than suddenly an orange person shows up on your damage meter, how is that an improvement?
---
Done need a popular streamer promoting ninja culture though.  Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs beta.  A lack of character is a lack of character.
---
Right before. 1 day before.
---
Defcamp watched the clip on his stream and he remarked that he didn't end up dying but it was a huge oh shit moment.
---
This is kinda off topic, but does anyone else find it strange that the Warcraft 3 remake comes out after the WoW classic release? Not only in terms of the lore timeline, but it would have built more hype for classic and Blizzard would've got more sales on WC3 Reforged.
---
Do you have an armoury link to show us the last heroic raid you cleared as current content? Willing to eat my words but i'd be surprised if you raided hc (not to mention heroic isnt the highest difficulty, so you're not even close to understanding where the difficulty is in retail).
---
People would certainly complain if they removed the difficulties easier than heroic in retail, but there is difficulty present people just arent forced to do it as they are in vanilla
---
Hate to be that guy, but I'm assuming you are grown up now? You don't need to police others' language
---
Need moar DOTS
---
This has always been possible as long as you abuse batching lag ‚Äî the game keeps track of "getting crit" and "checking whether the player is sitting" at different points. The issue was that private servers made any /sit activate Enrage/Blood Craze/Reckoning, so you only had to press it once per stack. This is far more unreliable and time consuming, so it's still not worth it unless you want to build up stacks for a PvP fight or something. 
---
Also, yellow abilities will proc crit effects even when sitting. That was also discussed back in 2006.
---
Either way they clearly ignored the hunter asking to roll for it.
---
That's disgusting.
---
How about you provide some insight as to what we're supposed to be seeing.
---
Everyone should have a got a roll. Is that actually a bug with the chest? idk.  If that was live, i would have wanted to get a roll for sure.
---
Hahaha no he‚Äôs not, the only ass he‚Äôs getting is from hookers.
---
I think he is mad because he is assuming that the only person in group (the paladin) that won't just flat out give it to him if he asks got the item. Therefore he isn't getting it so he is mad.
---
oh I get it, you're right dumb addons also existed back then :)
---
You're still gonna get that? Layers are up to 3k pop. So if you're locked into a layer on launch day...you'll have a bunch of people struggling to hit mobs. This was a bug. Blizzard's looking into it. That's what beta is for.
---
Me: decent play esfand.
---
Esfand: ^^
---
Put that PTO request in now
---
Absolutely, it's the element of **surprise** that retail lacks.
---
Moments like these are far less epic if you actively seek them out. /r/wow loves to say BS like "well you can still do that in retail!!!" but they completely misunderstand why these moments feel epic in the first place.
---
And by "these moments" I mean fun and surprising moments happening with strangers in the world randomly, most importantly happening on the *path* to your goal, not as a goal themselves.
---
That is clearly phasing. There's no way a almost dead mob just disappears like that and two other mobs take it's place.
---
This just in, lots of people suck total ass at WoW. We know this, but those players just aren't doing the difficult content. A big part of vanilla WoW, as i understand it, was that it was more casual friendly than other MMOs hence why endgame content requires an almighty (and thus rewarding) time commitment but not as much actual skill.
---
The simple fact is that they have implemented difficulty far beyond vanilla into retail, but people arent forced to do it for prestigious rewards. By contrast vanilla forces you to do content that is easier than modern hc/mythic, but far more difficult that pressing the lfr button, if you want any of that prestige
---
Weapon skills? Yes really. If you're trying to take up a whole new weapon at say level 25-30 that you have no skill on at all, you will almost certainly die before you can kill a mob because your weapon skill is so too low to even hit the mob. It's just ironic that you guys are complaining about the extra miss chance so much when leveling weapon skills increases your miss rate like crazy. 
---
White attacks, like you said, won't make up the majority of your dps when you're fighting most mobs for such short periods of time. Effective rotation of abilities is critical to efficient farming. What mobs are you fighting while leveling where this stuff is that important? Are you grinding dungeons? If you're gonna grind dungeons, just level Prot to practically guarantee your spot in a group.
---
The best parts of fury are towards the bottom of the tree. At level 30, you've got 20 points into the tree. What are you even going to get with that? 5% crit and bonus to your Shout? Some increased rage gain? The other bonuses like increased offhand damage, and 12 crits in 12 seconds are barely going to apply to you because a big-ass 2 hander has such a slow attack speed. And at that point, you don't have other attack resets like Whirlwind or Mortal strike. You might as well just go Arms to 30 if you're gonna do the 2h route for the decreased heroic strike cost, and deep wounds overpower combo, which is actually reliant on your weapon damage, unlike the skills in the fury tree.
---
You guys are living in some fantasy la la land where you've got this complex path laid out thinking you're gonna get every item you need in the perfect world. Then you're gonna blow gold and time on a respec mid leveling? Average joe is gonna be running around in half greens with a level 16 belt for 30 levels lucky to get a decent 2h outside of his class quests.
---
Actually, your reading comprehension sucks. I was clearly talking about people on this sub putting down others for questioning their supreme private server knowledge.
---
God, you're so dense it hurts.
---
Yeah and Esfand and Asmon fought among themselves to loot chests earlier too, Esfand even bop'd or something on Asmon when he tried opening a chest earlier before Esfand looted it in front of Asmon. It's not like they're doing it to be assholes, they're having fun competing among themselves over who gets to open it.
---
Esfand even tried to trade the cloak to asmon, it's not like its useless for a tank to have Agi and on the other hand they should've considered the hunter, but saying "roll" they might've not even noticed it in the chat at all.
---
Dishonest it is not, and I don't even consider it ninja since they didn't steal anything, its a first come first serve mechanic for chests and you're not compelled to give anything to anyone. Shitty move, but nothing else.
---
They can always whisper whoever looted the item and ask for it. 
---
The guy who looted it can then choose to do things:
---
1. Be a nice guy and trade it to the other person who actually needs it because being nice and helping gear out your allies is the right thing to do. 
---
2. Recognize that the item has value and put it on the AH because gold is important and you need that gold more than the guy asking needs those 9 str/6 stam gloves.
---
I know that they both slobbered over the chest, but isn't the paladin in the wrong way more? He didn't even offer to the hunter and said a bunch of shady things about keeping the item.
---
Not like raiding Vanilla raids with 1.12 talents/gear ever was going to be very hard.
---
I got 6 months. I better get in.
---
sorry, ranged AP  
---
every bit helps with those early crit gun pulls :p
---
Nostalrius died for our sins.
---
I literally haven't seen that happen once in 9 years
---
True. I guess it just dependen a bit on the server how it was handled.
---
I tried giving sodapoppin an extra shot because i do believe people deserve another chance to prove they've changed but already the sense of entitlement was so strong it made me sick.
---
He was heading towards the gurubashi arena for the trinket and a dude was going aswell and soda only "allowed" him to join to help HIM get the trinket (even though he already had gotten 1 earlier)
---
This is beta were talking about, the stuff you do, let alone collect and gather the blue arena trinket, doesn't even matter and yet ALREADY these people are showing such levels of entitlement.
---
I don't blame the younger audience for failing to see how shitty a behavior this is but damn if you can make sure i am going to avoid the hell outta these streamers servers.
---
i made something to help you :)

My view is that i dont see either version as the pinnacle of WoW, and think a synthesis of the two could make WoW the best it could be. As someone who wants to play that game, and thinks that making the game as good as it can be is a reasonable goal for devs, they probably should try to learn (although likely wont). 
---
I agree classic shouldnt be made into that synthesis, because it is produced not to be good but to be the exact thing that people have asked for (because it is enjoyable to them obviously). By contrast the goals of retail should be to make it as good as it can be, and incorporating elements of classic design would certainly help that
---
So will i be able to grind classic to pay for my sub, or will i only be able to use retail gold to buy game time?
---
Just wondering, in case anybody knows:
---
-	what are the hardware specs requirement for the classic client? 
---
-	is beta active in EU too? Any EU folks got invited?
---
Super hard to get a world first if you are the only ones being able to play LUL
---
It is an improvement for all the Druid players. It¬¥s an improvement for the Shammies and overall better class viability. Yes I think a game where is one orange player and 9 blue is better than 10 blue. If I look at things through your eyes, it would be ok if the raid consisted of 3 colors that can do the job the best and the game would be perfect.
---
You mean cricket.
---
Incoming tilted BfA teens with waxed eyebrows
---
I am aware of that. I even noted that in my post. Just because they believe it is working correctly doesn't mean they are right.
---
i want to play the beta. I don't want to play retail. Would i be paying for just a chance? This doesn't feel good. I'd like them to clarify.
---
Even if they weren't trying to be assholes they still were. The in game chat was not moving that fast and you think both Esfand and Asmongold both didn't see it?
---
and the hunter was pretty far from being a random (not that it would be any better) also. (its a beta big whoop but...) he was server 2nd level 30 AND he is in their guild. shame is the emotion that will save the human race.
---
World of Warcraft and Taylor Swift. 2 of my passions
---
If I'm playing with my friends? I'll steal a chest once in a while for the laughs.
---
The element your missing is that gold is a far more important part of the game in vanilla. This is due to loot not being handed out for free. So the ability to make a decent living with fishing appeals to people. Feel free to skip it and use any other method, but definitely have one.
---
lmfao basement dweller wat the fuk do u think pink sparkles is?
---
I definitely wont upgrade my account since I have 0 interest in BfA.
---
Talking about Asmon
---
the hunter wasn't even upset.
---
The trouble is for people who aren't wild about classic, and also aren't enamored with the more recent retail changes. Classic has glaring flaws, and retail has equally if not more glaring flaws, so the prospect of a game that could bring the two together is a really appealing one.
---
Classic is certainly existing to please a certain fanbase, and as a community/fanservice project that's ok, but retail is 'the' game as it were and i think their goals should be to make it as fun as it can be. If that includes incorporating elements of classic design then so be it. WoW never would have changed if Blizzard were only trying to emulate what the game was at the present moment, so the odds of them incorporating new philosophies in the future as well is high. Hopefully they look to classic for that influence
---
Just an FYI:
---
People aren't watching thinking this is his real reaction. Everyone knows it's acting. It's an ironic reaction, he's not attempting to fool people. People find it entertaining because they know it's fake.
---
I had no idea üòÇüòÇ
---
Or you can be soda and have your raid protect you while U loot it
---
The story in the book states that malorne was hunted so he fled, got help from elune, they made a child, which is cenarius, who was raised by malorne and ysera, since elune couldnt raise him without being physical. Thats why he and his offspring have a big influence in the emerald dream, since he was given these responsibilities from ysera when he grew up.
---
Since cenarius is the first teacher and therefore  founder of druidism, thats why druids have their original toolkit made from nature(malorne), aid of the moon ( elune) and the big rp connection to the emerald dream (Ysera).
---
&gt; Yes I think a game where is one orange player and 9 blue is better than 10 blue. 
---
But you can't articulate *why*, so that makes me actually wonder if you've thought this through.
---
&gt; If I look at things through your eyes, it would be ok if the raid consisted of 3 colors that can do the job the best and the game would be perfect.
---
Not saying it would make the game perfect, but it wouldn't make the game any worse than it is now.
---
I don't think the fake reaction is the only thing people don't like
---
It might not be Bis but IIRC aint Sentry cloak the best twink cloak? Sure this doesnt matter in Beta but if this were the real Classic I would assume it would be worse?
---
Or, and this is pretty wild, they dont want their two products to compete with each other and so maximize subscription time... You know, the obvious answer that anyone would tell you if not blinded by a desire to see retail fail. Classic launch will hopefully be bigger than a single patch for retail, seeing as its the launch of a beloved game, but even if they expected classic to be tiny they wouldnt want to stack its release with another of their products because then people would play less WoW overall and pay less sub fee
---
Well, I certainly lost, as I did it TWICE! First on my main account, then after seeing all the old accounts getting in, I bought a month for my June 2005 account that has nothing on it (yes, they are separate battle net accounts).
---
been playing some fallout: nv since i never really got into it before, it's good but idk if it's gonna last me 3.5 months lol
---
I mean Asmon is like a goldfish and don't pay attention in game and constantly forget selling things too because hes busy reading chat.
---
I can't say much for Esfand since I don't usually watch two in the same group.
---
The in-game chat is not moving fast, the stream chat is, I don't know if they saw it and ignored it or if they did not see it, but Themechanic also said later that he didn't particularly care when they exited the keep and then he found out about an engineering cloak at the same time, so I don't think there is any hard feeling for the people involved.
---
But yeah, it was shitty not to consider the others but that is more or less where it ends IMO.
---
That's the sad part.
---
better to make a video titled "who am I and why you should care"
---
Do BGs..... It's phase 1 ffs
---
Well, if you really like to gamble, in my opinion you are more likely to get in beta if you spend the 15$ in lottery tickets, win the jackpot, and buy someone‚Äôs account with beta access out of the jackpot money...
---
"You think you do but you don't"
---
I read the comment section before watching the video. Y‚Äôall really THAT MAD about this? What the fuck lol. ‚ÄúOh no I got a random code in my email for a beta!‚Äù What nonsense.
---
And calling out shitty people is a huge part of the closed realm/social justice aspect of vanilla. People keep saying they are excited that reputation among players matters again and then refuse to react to recorded instances of players being blatantly shitty.
---
Omar you beautiful bastard.
---
Thats the thing about the big time streamers, they live in a small bubble of fans licking their asses only, channels where you're only allowed to condone the actions the streamer does reguardless of how shitty it is.
---
My fear is if a streamer is big enough that they will basically run a server.
---
Can you imagine being in a raid with a streamer knowing that every drop they want they just automatically get?
---
I just hope those streamers are gonna be public about what server they roll on so i can avoid those servers like the plaque.
---
Ultimately i think the worst case scenario is queue times, which arent the end of the world. They know that  by phase 2 if they just pull the plug and collapse all layers into their single servers the community cant call them out because this is what they asked for. They would probably open new servers, and offer free transfers to those servers to try and resolve that issue
---
Thanks, I still have no idea what I'm supposed to make of it though.
---
Lmao, ‚Äústreamsniping‚Äù. 
---
That term didn‚Äôt exist in vanilla, and the term is used as some disgusting made up privilege.
---
I can assure you, that on my undead rogue, if you are streaming on my pvp server as the opposite faction.
---
I will find you, I will kill you, repeatedly.
---
Why are posts with Office ;&lt;
---
He will get to enjoy perception when he needs to find Shadowmaw Panthers in stv tho.
---
Its naive to think that a big time streamer rolling on a server wont affect the server. 
---
Personally id like a healthy good community server to roll on not one where you apparently have to worship the ground a person walks on just because they have a stream.
---
Bleeding Horror 4/8

---
We don't need / want the modern client! Just give us the classic WoW client!
---
I'm pretty sure they weren't reading stream chat. If they were the chat was also saying roll too.
---
well you said you "just bought it" so I thought you had like 28-29 days left and hadn't logged in. If that was the case you would probably be able to refund it if you talked to support
---
the bright purple lines that look like MS paint are being rendered in-game towards mobs that he needs to kill for a quest.

People seem to forget we used to play on CRTs/early shitty LCDs which made it look darker.
---
If nostalgia is strong in you, then it will be worth for few months.
---
Love it. It was also possible in vanilla but got broke fairly early. It was used to locate nodes and herbs etc. it will probably get broken in classic, but I‚Äôd definitely use it to autopilot everything 1-59.
---
I *highly* recommend not watching *any* guides. Go in blind, learn the game by playing and discovering.
---
It takes time but it'll take a lot of time even with guides. Going in blind will give you otherwise unattainable fun experiences.
---
It's a game, not a job. It was designed for "casuals". It's not hard just time consuming. Play it, talk to people and play together. (Ignore anyone who'd talk down to you because you don't already know things. Find those who'll help you.)
---
&gt;ITT: People thinking Blizzard re-wrote entire classic WoW off a whim and mistyped regen health values. No, that's not how it works. They polished a 1.12 build and served it to you.
---

Huh, really? I thought it was something he did in paint to point out something else.

HAHA YOU ARE MEMER XD
---
Can I see the bluepost?
---
Someone killed 2 mobs at the EXACT same time? I dont buy that.
---
Wins #1 spot for most constructive post of the day.
---
Honestly, go play on a pserver for a while and see if its a game for you.
---
Its a timesinking MMO. If you already play a lot of MMOs then sure, odds are you'll like it cuz it is (arguably) the best version of the most popular MMORPG ever. But if you are just looking for a new game to play, then its like playing D&amp;D in a way. It takes more effort then a normal game, and if its not your thing you'll just feel like you wasted a lot of time.
---
Hell no.
---
There is a pattern you see among classic content creators, most of them are pretentious dipshit. The reason is all you have to do to gain traction for classic WOW is to shout "classic is better than retail in every way" and more brainless dipshits will worship you.
---
I would take your post more seriously if you didn't consider the other stuff blizzard has done. 
---
You say Nostalrius closing down was what Blizzard got them to look into classic, but it was also Blizzard that sent a cease and desist letter to Nostalrius to close it down ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalrius)). 
---
Don't forget without Nostalrius there wouldn't be a demonstration (lack of better word) of how many people were interested in playing Classic WoW. 
---
Thirdly, don't also forget that Blizzard's president J. Allen Brack, himself, said "You think you do, but you don't". It's clear the vision that Brack did object to the idea of Classic WoW.
---
Looking forward to more players realizing how amazing old school WoW is.
---
This is how it worked in Vanilla I believe, you could stand up at the right time and trick the game.
---
Doesn't change that people take it as its real and as an "example" of why not to watch streamers. To each their own, but I don't like when people are being disingenuous
---
I absolutely love that we have streamers who don‚Äôt know the ins and outs of vanilla sharing terrible tips and stuff to the new players. 
---
Vanilla was all about not knowing what you‚Äôre doing and learning your class and what it can do. Discovery is a big part of the game and the excitement new players feel while leveling. The fact that these some of these streamers are accidentally paving the way for that to happen for many new players makes me happy, despite how I don‚Äôt really like to watch them myself.
---
Watching Preach tank classic was super educational!
---
Kiting definitely has its merits, although compared to a properly played Fury the benefits aren't that substantial. However as I hinted, the amount of extra effort you have to put in makes it a quite more intense grind.
---
They're bad for servers so you can't really blame people for not liking them lol
---
What plate gear stats should I focus on for 5 mans? A lot of the BiS is Cloth, Leather and mail for Holy so I'm guessing not ideal for taking on a tanking role or AoE farming.  Should I just stack stamina?
---
So are the streamers, so why is it so hard for them to act like decent human beings?
---
Done; I made some Deadmines wallpapers for you! I know you didn't specify what exactly to make a wallpaper of, so I made one of Sneed and two different versions of the Ogre Juggernaught at the end. Hopefully one of them is what you're looking for!
---
Who knows how much of your personal data was leaked through a 14 year old client if you were playing on pservers, I mean its kind of similar to using Windows XP today lol. I really want the new client, they ported vanilla over so nicely I mean just look at it.
---
Keep me out of the most uninformed "we" please.
---
AFAIK stances and abilities do not share GCD with eachother.
---
I was thinking that too. These would be great wallpapers.
---
You rock man. Thank you very much
---
It's the looking at chat in between then shouting louder that got me.
---
I‚Äôm tempted to sub now, but I also don‚Äôt want to be burnt out on wow when it launches
---
aka Private servers
---
It is fake and i can tell that because there are no destiny and cod on launcher

---
The best way to get good at PvP is just by doing it. When you do it enough, you learn how people react to certain attacks and how to predict what people are about to do next. You learn what works, and what doesn't.  
---
You can read things as much as you like but in the heat of battle you're probably going to forget it all straight away.
---
There doesn't need to be any other argument than "it's not Vanilla". Classic's one and only purpose is to bring back Vanilla. Not to create a new "balanced" version of it.
---
Would love to see if you have any cool items or gear on you if you decide to resub.
---
Private servers are responsible. Nostalrius led to that exact huge outcry that led to Blizzard giving developers the time they needed to figure out a viable approach to making Classic. Without private servers and Nostalrius in specific, Blizzard would've never given someone like Omar the time to work on trying to find a way. Even if he somehow did manage to find a way in his free time Blizzard might've just told him "That's cool but we don't think it'd be well-received nowadays".
---
Private servers aren't responsible for the technology, but for proving the continued interest as well as showcasing the scale of the audience. And yes, that makes them absolutely vital to Classic being a thing today.
---
Agreed, this whole sub fucking circle jerks around hating different wow classic streamers and content creators. Incredibly annoying.
---
WoW streams are boring, its a boring game to watch.
---
Both haters and whiteknights are just nerds that enjoy the celebrity gossip show.
---
Well that happens when anything takes 10x the time.
---
Imho priest is more versatile and fun to play as you have multiple buttons to press, choices to make and ways around emergency situations. 
---
Pala on other hand, as others already suggested, is 2-3 buttons spec and a buffing machine (god forsake being only pala in 20 or 40-mans), but your heal efficiency is next to infinite. Just get some +spellcrit, spell power and intellect and you can heal 24/7/12/365 , and still have mana to spare.
---
Quarantine the streamers to one server
---
im mad
---
Dude, are you kidding? Just a few years ago Blizz was saying they weren't gonna bring back classic. Then they realized that hundred of thousands of people were playing on shitty bootleg servers that might go down at any time. 
---
Seeing the success of classic private servers and the outcry from players and all the big streamers when Nost got shut down were the only reasons they let an engineer fuck off for several weeks to work on a classic prototype. 
---
It was 100% classic servers that made them rethink and reconsider making classic, not trying to downplay this guy but you gotta be delusional if you don't think private servers and the shitty engagement of retail is what made all of this possible.
---
ITT: Zoomer is mad. Zoomer upset. Zoomer angry because idol was insulted. Maybe Zoomer is an NPC irl and is the definition of the "Orange man bad". But in this instance, Zoomer can only say "Streamer are god"
---
this doesn't make any sense. your assuming people choose faction first class second which is a massive assumption.
---
Layering will make it much more playable, there will be a hard cap on how many players in one zone.
---
If you‚Äôre really worried maybe try to nail down your 1-10 route. If you get your timing fast you‚Äôll be well ahead of the pack.
---
But whats more pathetic, complaining about streamers, or complaining about people that complain about streamers?
---
I knew I remebered it being like that when I saw a post about this on this sub the other day. Kinda weird thing to have though lol.
---
Or baseball for anyone honestly.
---
These guys aren‚Äôt really doing the game like we did back then really. They are all trying to push levels.
---
What happens at launch is people will make groups, through chat and such, to kill stuff because it goes faster. Remember Grimnik (sp?) names troll in Dwarf starting area? You grouped to take him down and the elemental because it went faster.
---
You also do dungeons on level as the gear was better. These guys seem to be skipping a lot of that for the stream.
---
The bait PepeLaugh
---
I dont know where the random selfie is coming from, It isnt even me.
---
Seriously who??
---
Well done?.... I guess?
---
You think raids are the limit?
---
Say the streamer just for lols want to block opposing faction to enter onyxias lair? or any other place cuz LOL.
---
Or what if he demands that he must get the world bosses every time theyre up? Or be the one banging the AQ gong quest line?
---
Nope, id rather stay away thank you.

---
i would also recommend not rushing leveling to do end game content since quite frankly the content is not that hard and the tactics are 100% figured out (we are so much better at playing the game today than when vanilla launched)
---
sure you might want to do it but there will be groups running MC when naxx is out simply since for the health of the server and top guilds they need to gear up more people. so the train will keep on rolling. that is how TBC and part of WotLK worked aswell (in WotLK people ran naxx and maly and obsidian shrine all the time while ulduar was out it was only TotGC that killed that norm)
---
Literally my point. 
---
Don't play with streamers, don't have these problems.
---
Do you plan on getting the mount from doing aq questline? Then you're going to have to go real hard and be very dedicated once AQ is released.
---
But until then you can just join a good raiding guild and slowly get geared up.
---
People ‚Äòrushed their ass off‚Äô in vanilla too
---
I mean, did quests to level...
---
There is value in beta players just playing the game without trying to force bugs. The point really is to have a large chunk of players do what they normally would to find the last few bugs that an actual player would witness before release. Intensive bug testing is typically for internal QA.
---
And no one gave a fuck.
---
Yep, there was something like this for raids I think and they took that out fast enough. Good thing there is a beta to find this stuff
---
It's all good man. I did the same. Many of us did.
---
I‚Äôm already in shape, though. Maybe I could put on 5kg and then lose them in time for Classic!
---
Anyone else hate druids that fucking need on everything? "Oh I guess I can use this for my tank spec.. and my dps spec.. and my healing spec, and leather is good, and so is cloth... oh and I need the mail and plate for my enchanting skill."

I'm not talking about any specific streamer, btw.
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of criticism on his understanding tho, misunderstanding those experts he brings in. I do not know how true it may or may not be.
---
it's hard to not comment on it when you post 10 second clips from their twitch fucking 40 times a day on this sub
---
Probably going for a Dwarf Hunter, any recommendations? Or is there maybe a source with lots of leveling routes?

Don't posts like this get deleted because there's a recruitment thread somewhere, where it should be

I‚Äôm personally glad it‚Äôs not util August 27th.  I want to spend my summer outside and not have a pit of regret in my stomach when I‚Äôm on vacation with my family because I‚Äôm missing WoW Classic play time.  Sounds incredibly ridiculous, but it‚Äôs how it would be, sadly.

I wish it was august already...

I know, they mention that a couple of times on stream themselves, but I fear I might have to play more or less like them if I don't want to get trampled by everyone else xD

Gnome masterrace my friend, prepare to be the center of attention from ALL the ladies in Ironforge ;) (NPCs only sadly)
---
Should make a gnome chad, undead virign meme about this lol
---
people who unironically main gnomes for their looks should be the first conscripts when WW3 breaks out.
---
There is some sort of stress test later next week I‚Äôm hoping we all get a mass invite, I can‚Äôt stop watching Classic twitch streams!!
---
I do indeed, is AQ available in Phase 1? Or only Molten Core?
---
It doesn‚Äôt make anything more playable, at all. It‚Äôs going to put an entire servers worth of people in a single layer.

I cant see a recruitment thread, nor can i see this thread in the general list of threads either, same with random selfie guy in the pic. I cant see that either.

I've played over 2000 hours of oldschool runescape. I can handle grind.

And what you get in return is the first pic

Just use gold guys. free time.

A great way to pass time untill release!

I should start trying to find my own copy somewhere in the storages.
---
I wonder how that'll work, would there be a chance that there's a dwarf-only layer or something in dun morogh? Would be interesting to see 3000 dwarfs or so on the same spot xD
---
*You* haven't laid it out, is what I'm saying. It might exist somewhere on the internet, but it's not in the three links you've posted.
---
Nice try Tips!  You won't get out of this that easily.
---
Sounds like the guy is joking.  No need for outrage over a non-existent prank he never pulled.
---
You know what‚Äôs puzzling to me? The absolute level of SEETHING from Retail Community. Here is their chance to improve retail game in the ways they‚Äôve never even seen before. All these WoW Devs playing Classic Beta, learning from the very basics one more time. What it means to be a part of organic MMO community.
---
It‚Äôs almost as if 80% of BfA Zoomers are so socially outcasted, they are afraid of their only cope becoming a social game once again.
---
I like asmon hes a overall funny guy hes been ninja looting since vanilla and scammed people back in the day so ya not the best person but entertaining 
---
And esfand knows alot about game thats why people watch him
---
For king and country!
---
ey, atleast every single wow streamer on twitch has access. even the ones with 5 viewers. randomly picked btw.
---
And then you get opened up on by a Rogue and die because Blink is on cooldown.
---
Cancelling fall damage with blink is great but I'd be careful using it in BG's.

I guess that's a track you can take. It kind of annoyed me, but I that's ok.
---
Yeah, it really was. Made me feel better about pserver experience working for Classic, too.
---
Good ... good ... let the hate flow through you ... 
---
... and this is proper response to streamer if you don't like him / her 
---
... you shouldn't be afraid of playing on same server with them ... they should be afraid of playing on the same server with us ... bbooahahaahah :) 
---
... if I'm gonna end up on the same server that any streamer ... I simply don't care ... but ... BUT! ... if any of them starts to ruin my PvP server trust me I'm gonna be their worst nightmare ... they can't find me ... well ... I can find them ]:-&gt;

Shut the fuck up.
---
Welcome to Toxic!
---
We are a North America based guild playing on Alliance. We will roll on a PVP server when they announced names.‚Äã
---
We are a semi-hardcore (we will lean more hardcore towards the start) U.S. raiding guild and have been playing together since April of 2015. We have raided mainly Vanilla content, but have delved into TBC and WOTLK as well. We run a 9 Hour raid week. Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Mondays are the focus of our main group. Before enough content is available, or enough alts to do more than one raid, raid times will be used for focus farming or remaining dungeon gearing. We look forward to having a stronger PVP presence in Classic compared to our Past. We look at skill, attitude, and gear/dedication to character in that order. We do not carry dead weight or people who clash with the guild.
---
While we take the game and the experience very seriously, we are realistic about our capabilities. The majority of us are in our late 20‚Äôs to early 30‚Äôs, maintain a full time job, and take care for our families. Wow has been a cornerstone in many of our lives for the past 14 years. While we are always pushing to do the new content, we do not leave our friends behind. The best part of wow that we all cling to over the many years we played is friendship and the relationships we make along the way. We are a gaming community with Wow being the focus of all of us!
---
Here at Toxic, we hope to bring a different type of guild from most. We want to be tight-knit, supportive of each other, not afraid to point our friends to become better; we encourage friendly competition; we look for members going out of their way to assist; we want to be that old school fun guild that doesn't feel like a job, but rather a community of friends who want to kick a little ass! I will put a lot of effort into bringing very popular posts and guides into a central location on our website ([http://toxicgaming.us/](http://toxicgaming.us/)) to allow for your focus to be on the game, rather than trying to research how to best play your class, or where to go to level a profession.
---
Our Leadership:
---
Our leadership has experience leading in all retail walks of life up: from Vanilla up to and including the Draenor expansion. The guild leaders, Pronator &amp; Michaelfox, have been around since the game was first released in 2004. They have experienced all end game raids during their prime.
---
Loot System:
---
Loot Council- The Loot Council will be made up of class ldeaders, and a random rotation of regular raid members. We will do a prioritized loot system where we are distributing the loot in the most fair way possible, based on BIS and class needs. We plan on putting a ton of effort into ensuring the right gear gets in the right players hands. We have always prided ourselves in being completely transparent with all decisions and encourage all to talk through all loot (outside of when we are raiding of course).
---
Main Raid Times:
---
We raid from 10 p.m. till 1 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (7 p.m. till 10 p.m. PST). Currently, the days we raid are Wednesday , Thursday , and Monday. Raiders are expected to be online an hour or so before raid for raid buffs and to pull on time.
---
We plan on going for every world boss that we can unless it is at an extremely unoptimal time.
---
We plan on doing a secondary raid group on weekends, strong alt characters or members who cannot make the primary raid time will make up the majority of this raid group. We will treat this raid just as serious as the primary raid.
---
Our Goals:
---
Our main goal for the Toxic guild is to progress as far as possible quickly (but enjoying the content as well) and also competing with other fellow guilds for progression.
---
Our Expectations:
---
We expect players to be the best they can be, always! This means you should know your class in and out (doing proper research from credible sources). You should have all the addons, macros, and keybindings your class needs in order to be the best. Don't be a clicker, no one likes a clicker.
---
What about PVP:
---
While &lt;Toxic&gt; is mainly focused on the PVE side of the game, PVP will also be organized and encouraged. There are quite a few BIS or easily obtainable PVP items for PVE raiding. We will be coordinating guild pre-made battlegrounds and other fun events!
---
Why Toxic?:
---
We are unlike any other guild. We take time to try to mold our entire team as a cohesive unit. We have done many super fun RP Events including Halloween in the Crypts of Karazhan, Christmas &amp; New Year's parties. We have celebrated unique birthdays as a guild and many other strange but incredible events. We are all in when we set our minds to something. Our player base in our 40 man bolstered an unprecedented 25+ of our team having a 90%+ lifetime attendance to raids (100+ raids). Don‚Äôt ask Why, ask Why not!!!\`
---
Our Current High Recruitment needs are:
---
Warlock, Resto Druid, Dwarf Holy Priest
---
People who play on Off hours/weekends, or dont always want to raid are more than welcome to join as well, we want to always have something going on. We will accept any role interested in our non primary raid times currently, as well as anyone who is just looking for a home for classic.
---
Look up Pronator on Youtube for some of our older raids, and guild meetings to get a feel for us.

If they do this, i hope you will be there to calm down everyone else's favorite underperforming spec being brought up for "a change".

Druid can do everything, but aren't great at anything. Far more that what a paladin or shaman can say.
---
^ blizzard employee trying to get another sub in for the company.
---
Damn you‚Äôre one of the more authoritative type redditer I‚Äôve come across in awhile.
---
Did someone show this to streamers yet?
---
I think it was posted the day of, or one day after the announcement.
---
I like what you've said.
---
A well known PvPer. Ofc you might not know him if you have never followed the scene :)
---
&gt; The only way for Classic to be considered a failure in blizzard's eyes is if Jim Sterling makes a video about it, basically. 
---
Yes, I'm sure a Jim Sterling video is much worse than people not playing.
---
Lol are you undead rogue by any chance? 
---
Almost cut myself on that edge
---
As it often happens, people mistake the root problem.
---
It‚Äôs not Blizzard. It‚Äôs Activision. Blizzard is owned by Activision. And Activision are very, VERY, greedy.
---
It‚Äôs going to be 3000 or so people throughout the entire Azeroth. So dwarf gnome starting zone will have like 300-400, pec like 600, human like 600, etc
---
Give me another reason for dying your hair? :P
---
Undead rogue you cant make this shit up lol
---
Who is Jim Sterling?
---
Broken link!
---
You may have actually been in since day 2. Everyone for the day 2 wave is just getting emails  now.
---
Walmart bro?
---
God I hope this is sarcasm.  If it was you're good at this Sir, had me going.
---
AQ is phase 5, so it's going to be a while. Phase 1 is MC and ONY.
---
Just consider that the Mount will go to the most dedicated in a guild or the guildmaster or an officer.
---
Go on a pserver
---
This is some lowkey scummy shit.
---
Link proof or delete the thread. CM's have stated you need a sub to be invited, it's linked multiple times in this thread and others.
---
Dude is trying to get less people on this forum to sub to increase his own chance of getting in.
---
"and then, we fucked up all that hard work and player experience and immersion, by introducing layering"
---
ion hazzikostas
---
Exactly. The fear is that classic is flying under the radar of the greedy executives at Activision right now, but once it becomes an obvious success, they will notice it and force 'profitable' changes upon it.
---
That's really not relevant to the argument. Blizzard or activision-blizzard, what they want out of Classic is a PR boost, not sub money.
---
Hahahaaha ... EPIC :) ... 
---
... just imagine this scene ...

I still don't really understand what was so difficult about it - why not just run the old client? Sure they were missing data, but that applies to running it on the new engine as well, lots of re-invention either way.
---
Anyone care to explain it to me?
---
The player base of Nost forced blizzard to consider it. Then one thing leads to another. They are both needed, one wouldn't of happened without the other.
---

I think that's a great idea
---
It's a weapon buff. Pet's don't have weapons. It will not work.
---
If you have any items from vanilla that don't drop in the game anymore they sell for tons. The faded photo from the linkin quest chain can go for a lot, as an example.
---
Holy shit dude.
---
Imagine this being your life.
---
If it‚Äôs retail no I‚Äôm not following the scene. I only know 3 pvpers
---

---

---

---
Just saw this, googled and ordered one within the last 5 minutes.
---
They were missing data. No data, no working game.
---
It‚Äôs only sarcasm if there‚Äôs a /s at the end, it‚Äôs reddit law! /s
---
I completely agree. 
---
Also I believe some of the hate comes from the community losing trust over time. When the guys trying to be a voice for the community showed consistent lack of knowledge and willingness to sell out people started to question them.
---
Also this https://youtu.be/MU0jeCEmHz8
---
Wow, that was epic!
---
He literally says it WASN'T bugged at the end of the clip
---
He has the cute elf ears, and all the other people in the comic are horde races
---
Of course they want money though. They always want money.
---
I still watch Asmon but not so much as I used to and I've been watching him since 2016. He has changed a lot, I know almost every streamer does when their streams go popular, I've been on Twitch since 2012 so I've seen more than enough of this, but still it makes me kinda sad. 
---
Now don't get me wrong, I wish him all luck. I remember being happy when he hit 5k viewers without a sub button, and then happily subbing after he got it because he was definitely the most fun WoW streamer to watch and I wanted to support him. I'm happy even now for him too because 100k viewers is just insane.  
---
However I kinda miss his old personality and streams where he was being more himself and not acting or pretending that much. But I guess that's only me, because he's doing now more than fine.
---
What clown you are. We  are not living in a perfect dream world. They came up with the best possible solution and douches like you are still hating...
---
Their goal is to keep the BFA players happy thats why they are doing all this sharding and such.
---
Another streamer dick rider. You don't belong here.
---
Pretty vile and retarded hes dumb but ur gay
---
As a general principle, yes, if you don't take steps to defend your IP you can lose sole claim to it. But private servers has existed for years, and blizz rarely took any serious interest.
---
As I understand it, they are pretty much all based in France, which made the costs of actually litigating these server closures more expensive than they were worth.
---
Yeah I do see that now.
---
Being a company concerned with profits is not greed.
---
Its good business. 
---
greed is such a stupid word to use.
---
cuz she's toxic
---
2nd streamer dick rider in this thread.
---
Lol
---
He's been pretty well known since TBC. He played for Complexity with Happyminti at one point.
---
It's not viable, we have now have Bnet that needs to be integrated, modern hardware to run these systems.
---
Yes we have private servers, but I like my private data being private oddly enough.
---
I can't believe some of you subbed for the Beta. It's such an obvious cash grab.
---
Video Game journalist who makes very angry videos about video games and their companies actions. He sometimes bases his hot takes on socialist critiques of capitalism. It's extremely entertaining, he dresses up and stuff. He's an amateur wrestler I'm pretty sure, and his aesthetic is based on that, I think.
---
Do yourself a favor and look up his youtube channel.
---
Awesome! Please add notable loot if possible :) Some of those drop bags at a high chance and thats awesome when leveling :)
---
Normally no, for classic yes.
---
&gt; But you can't articulate *why* 
---
Yes I can. You are the one who cannot form a real argument.
---
1. this change would help Druid players to be viable with more than 1 spec in the raid env.
---
2. this change would help other under-performing casters such as ele sham or Spriest to be more viable in raid env due to their bad mana management
---
3. this change would deepen the Balance druid¬¥s class design: being the caster¬¥s support class
---
Seriously who is Ven? Get out from under your rock.
---
Hearthstone is a boring game to watch
---
Ion said no rares, no world bosses in tje game until we arw through layering.
---
Smh bad troll
---
I've seen a lot of bugs so far. Does still seem to need some work.
---
At this point it doesn't matter either way. There's no way they are changing the release date at this point, they would have an absolute mutiny on their hands. 
---
Tons of people put in PTO when they saw Aug 27.
---
Haha you got me ... 
---
I'm undead rogue in heart ... this was my first character but somewhere along the way I got lost and because of my old friend I created alt alliance on his sever NE Hunter and ... I stayed playing with him ... 
---
So ... undead rogue in heart forever !! :P
---
The old client has an old renderer (DirectX 8, probably?), and no support for modern os's, it's 32 bit, doesn't work with the current blizzard launcher, has security holes... that's just the tip of the iceberg.
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
Someone not having the same opinion as me = toxic.
---
You have waited upwards of 12ish years or so. You can take another 3 months. I believe in you.
---
Lol same here. I tried playing all the classes but god I couldn‚Äôt find any fun in the current game...
---
Oh shit I've been compromised
---
that's just false, there are hundreds of rares that will be in the game on launch
---
I've seen the launcher with the dropdown option for the beta. Does that mean i need to download the 60GB for BFA first?
---
And he's been in the team from the beginning of Vanilla since 2004.
---
Hey Astro, it uses the legion client as a backend. Although there is a lot less 'stuff' and high res models and textures rolling around everywhere, I'd probably use whatever hardware specs Legion was given as your requirements.  
---
EU people did get invited.
---
But in this case they want positive PR more than they want what they consider a very small amount of money.
---
I'll agree that there's a possible future where Classic is like 50% plus the size of BfA, and the executives takes a look at all the money they're not making in the form of monetization, and in that world they'll probably implement a cash shop and stuff. But they're not expecting to do this, that's very clear to me.
---
They have European lawyers I‚Äôm betting - they are Activision Blizzard after all! I remember seeing Nost in gaming news before it got the C&amp;D so that may have forced their hand. Don‚Äôt think I ever saw private servers make news like Nost.
---
Didn‚Äôt mean to delete, but yes it was just posted.
---

Haters gonna hate, lovers wanna love, I don't even want, none of the above....
---
He is currently an active subscriber.
---
Probably not, because we‚Äôve never seen he source code of the servers. Even private servers have no real internal info on how WoW servers work. They reverse engineered something that acts like a WoW server, and filled the blackened database with data that was obtained by various means. Nano from Nostalrius admitted to have learned mob damage values from old YouTube videos and archive.org fan sites. 
---
If I were to guess, the database scheme used by the the 7.x code was very very different to the 1.x database data. This sounds like a potentially complex database task. But I‚Äôm standing in the dark here, have no real idea, not a DBA etc.
---
Just be grateful for dedicated servers. The entitlement of a portion of this community is mind-blowing.
---
Priest leveling is somewhat repetitive and boring, but the end-game play is worth the grind.
---
Not rolling need on things you won‚Äôt wear is a good stance, but telling everyone you plan to roll on offspec stuff gets annoying if you try to list out every item.Every melee class is going to roll on something like Hand of Justice when it drops, regardless of spec. It‚Äôll upset melee DPS, but that‚Äôs just how some of the rarer loot goes.
---
Trade chat *was* used as LFG - it‚Äôs the only channel that spans all cities.
---
And if you‚Äôre farming nodes, you absolutely don‚Äôt care about other players around. Something like thorium or black lotus is first to click gets the worm, regardless of who cleared the mobs.
---
They tried to get it to work, but couldn't get any of their currently security into it. 
---
Coming from a software engineering background myself, I completely understand why they did it. And I'm that they did.

---
The retail reddit is also so sad and empty, despite having 10x the subs of this one.. To be expected, it's a game where communty means nothing. The opposite of Classic.
---
Thank you so so much! Big thanks to everyone who posted the links for petition, who were spreading the information, to developers, to Blizzard, and specially to the whole wow community - i am proud to Play with you boys &amp; girls ! Cheers! 
---
Sorry for my bad english.
---
with classic having the modern wow raid frames it makes healing a lot more appealing for me.
---
Love this mentality. If you‚Äôve checked out for 10 years maybe be quiet on a few things you know nothing about.
---
They're not saying he's the one responsible for it. They're saying that he was the one who figured out how to make it work with the modern client.
---
You really quit even before TBC? Have never heard of it before, even if it's obvious that it had to happened with some people. Would really like to know what drove you away back then, because the usual "Pandas" answer can't be used for another 3 expansions after that.
---
War Stomp is a stun not a slow.
---

---
lul imagine stanning a country known for brutal, murderous imperialism
---
anchor weed is brack rotus
---
I hope the community aspect isn't lost after all this time. Even if the game is the same, the players are new or have changed over time.
---
little column A, little column B. It's not good business if it shoots your future profits and growth potential in order to get more profits now.
---
What's ok to get emotional about then? I'm not tearing up just because it's wow, I tear up because of the memories.
---
And because you didn't get that, I'm inclined to assume you don't have very strong positive memories of wow
---
Fuck tips and fuck you fanboy
---
Not when the announcement was made by blizzard. Learn to context.
---
Without that he wouldn‚Äôt know how to do it. Probably one of the few, that is why never guys didn‚Äôt think it is possible.
---
Been having fun on the Wildcard realm of Ascension.  Neat concept that‚Äôs not burning me out waiting for Classic.
---
COUNTRY ROADSSS TAKE ME HOME
---
Mulgore roads, take me home to the place where I belong.
---
Wtf, I saw this at work and thought he said offensive stuff but he just made a simple joke? What am I missing here
---
The mount of AQ? I thought it was everyone that showed up at the gates at the right time with the quest completed?
---
I guess I‚Äôm not hardcore enough. I‚Äôve never been into pvp tbh
---
except he definitely did lmao
---
It's not a bug. Ignore the character models, the circular hitbox is all that matter. If the two circles intersect than for all intents and purposes you are on top of each other.
---
Yup, keep giving Blizzard a free pass. I'm sure it was Activision that's ruined wow over the years and Blizzard has done nothing wrong
---
Amazing how Blizzard was able to segregate it's one game... Retail players remain in big cities only using raid/dungeon finder...
---
Wait, was that sarcasm?  Is it a double negative because there was two?
---
i did it with 3 accounts ...
---
I've not been watching streamers but I was under the impression they're being fed greens/gear by other players and are therefore probably overgeared compared to the average player?
---
Why are people here so negative about retail? [There is plenty of community events going on for example on my server we have this](https://stranglethorn-bonfire-bash.tumblr.com/post/184874610206/lets-kick-off-the-season-with-an-exciting)
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people have to be so negative about a game they don‚Äôt even play...
---
I think [this](https://i.redd.it/b0j1aag43j821.jpg) picture of active WoW subscribers shows the main reason of why Classic got the green light. 
---
I don't see any reason of why they won't add in ways to monetize the game in a couple of years, just like they did with the current version. Its an option that will always be on the table and if they think they can do it, they will. Even if it is a PR stunt to improve their brand, it won't be forever.
---
As a druid from launch to 1.07 or so, there was very little difficulty finding a group. And I was feral specced. We did DM, Stockades, SFK, pretty much everything. I think the longest I had to wait was an hour. 
---
Then after getting frustrated with my druid, I rolled warlock. I felt that this made grouping much faster, because the CC fear + succy + healthstones and all the other utility you brought to the group was much in demand. 
---
My alt priest, who made it to 50, was of course in high demand (even shadow specced), but healers generally are.
---
Maybe it's *just* rogue, or rogues and hunters, because as I remember, they were the most heavily played classes in vanilla. I can see it going the other way if warlock becomes FOTM for Classic, for sure.
---
Group finder didn't change any of that; the demographics of the classes played considerably changed over the life of WOW, and especially during TBC and WOTLK.
---
No it‚Äôs not.
---
I‚Äôve spent so many hours in Dun Morogh as a noob that when I hear the music for it brings back detailed memories me sitting at my computer desk playing it.
---
Imagine being this stupid
---
 I'm aware of that but its a really fail fake reaction.  It might have been amusing if he had any comedic ability but it was just meh
---
I didn't even know beta tests existed when i played, i was 11 or 12 i think (i remember sunwell being available when i played or got to 70). Waiting is killing me for sure though, i threw a sub at them in hopes of getting invited soon XD
---
10k viewers as we speak
---
I think it actually means a lot that players like Venruki are showing their support for the game. The retail player base that is part of the nay-sayer crowd is swayed by this sort of stuff.
---
My guess is the soul-crushing realization that all of his awesome gear was so easily replaced. Bad itemization move from Classic to TBC :/
---
Rolling need on something you can‚Äôt even wear is a good way to get blacklisted. It might slide with PUG dungeon leveling, but at the end-game when you need to run 50+ of the same instance for one BIS gear piece, you‚Äôre going to run out of options if you piss in the pool.
---
Prat allows taking notes with alerts on players you encounter. I always note people like this and when I see them in chat, I let everyone know. That‚Äôs everyone in trade now refusing to group with you.
---
I plan on bringing back WotLK‚Äôs BlackList addon, but this time allowing filters to be shared across friends, guilds, or the entire realm. You won‚Äôt make it long if enough players downvote you.
---
Hahahahaha .... :) ... .... ... ... ..
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt understand why people have to be so negative about a game they don‚Äôt even play...
---
They don't play **anymore**
---
A chest?
---
Here is why "The scene is so much bigger than bfa and I'll lose alot of money if I don't jump on the hype train and make classic focused content instead"
---
Most of these accounts are purchased on eBay and then they pretend they're just coming back, especially one's with zero alts and a single char in  full gear
---
Oh my God it must suck to be you.
---
A whore that likes her job.
---
Have you seen the thread here on the taurens? And the one on the regen? Most people here don't know shit either it seems.
---
And the first 6 months or so were full of disconnects and being stuck in combat. I remember meeting someone who had a 60 in early 2005 and I was blown away.
---

Boo, you whore

Kinda make sense tho, if you are being made of fire, i dont think you would mind being hit with it.
---
&gt; the private server community are the first to shit on Blizzard    
---
&gt; But at least I didn't play on pirated servers, mouthing off Blizzard at every opportunity   
---
&gt;  and then pretend that it's thanks to me that Classic got made   
---
&gt; why exactly is the entire sub praising Nostalrius to the high heavens   
---
&gt; The idea that private server makers are in some way responsible for making Classic happen strikes me as ludicrous at best 
---
Yeah, we get it. You dislike and look down on people who play on private servers and they are leeches to your eyes. It's not very hard to tell.   
---
You're just looking for a way to discredit the Nostalrius peeps because you don't want to give these "leeches" any credit because they're all evil criminals and we shouldn't praise these people.
---
&gt; it was Nostalrius *closing down* that got Blizzard to take another look at the possibility of making Classic happen 
---
Yes, you said it yourself, though you left out some important details so it fits your narrative.  
---
Nostalrius closing down created a huge outcry, lead to all this drama like "You think you do", the Mark Kern ordeal etc etc. It's easy to forgot the chain reaction that this simple "closing of nostalrius" caused.
---
It's thanks to that engineer who found a possibility to downport the current client, but it's the Nostalrius drama that started all this and that pushed Blizzard to do it.
---
Seriously, do you honestly believe Classic would've ever been a thing without Nost? For the longest of time you would just get the "Wall of no" and "Nostalgia" shit from retail players and on the official forums, and only after the shutdown Blizz cared to take a closer look.
---
Man, I can't believe how hostile people are towards private servers sometimes. It's nothing to do with some kind of malicious leeching. These people just want to play their favourite game. That's all. And yes, everyone who participated in the movement, including Nostalrius, deserves credit for it.
---
Praise be to Omar, first of his name!
---
Good way to make sure everyone quits your guild before the gates are opened.
---
Absolute fucking legend, we would not be here without this man.
---
If you bang the gong within 10 hours of the gong being banged first. Then you can get the mount.
---
It's still going to be a ton of dedication and the help of your guild multiple times to complete the quest. So maybe only 1 - 3 people in your guild will be done in time.
---
And there will be other guilds as well trying to complete it first.
---
Shhhhhhh you wake the babies.
---
I am messing with Dark Souls 1 now trying to do one more pilgrimage also playing Dawn of War2, nothing is actually interesting me tbh. Classic WOW is only thing that can help me get my interest back in gaming.
---
I have an active sub right now but I barely log on, I just felt like this comparison kind if reflected how I personally feel and which I prefer, I'm not bashing retail but it just doesn't feel the same.  I imagine a core base of this sub are here as they feel the same. If you like retail that's great! To each their own.
---
To be completely honest.. I do think classic will have a higher active player base than retail. And this includes the obvious population drops that will happen, I still think more will actively play classic than will play retail.
---
The arena is a free for all event... If someone isn't there to help you get the trinket they are an enemy.
---
Yes.  
---
I think of it this way; retail has solo content, 5 man replayable content, raid replayable content and PvP at the moment and as far as I can tell it's essentially dead because the RPG aspect of the game is gone. This is partly because there is no community in any aspect of WoW anymore apart from perhaps RBG's and most specs are watered down boring copies of each other with different visuals.
---
Classic brings back community, spec uniqueness outside of simply visuals and the RPG aspect of WoW. I can't wait to play a Shaman again and have my totems matter, play a Druid again and have shapeshifting be an integral part of my spec or my Warrior again and have stances. 
---
I used to be the guy that laughed at the notion of "immersion" but the old saying "you don''t know what you've got till' it's gone" rang true for me in BfA and Legion. I've leveled and geared every healer in both Legion and BfA looking for a spec that played different to the rest. I looked for something that spammed more than 3 or spells, had some sort of continuity and fluidity to it but never found it. I've been looking for immersion and flavour and fun for 2 expansions and ironically I will have to go back to the game without expansions to get it.
---
I don't think I'm the only one, or even in the minority here. Everyone I know in-game has spent all of BfA leveling and gearing multiple characters because any one spec they play in raid/m+/PvP can't hold their attention for more than a few weeks at best. I think a lot of people are in a sad sort of limbo in BfA because it's the first expansion where it's painfully obvious that the RPG element of WoW is gone and **a lot** of people are going to be keen to find it again in Classic.

I relate to this soo much. In vanilla was in a guild that was pretty targeted by the horde. I learned not to join the guild on my alts until I was much closer to 60.
---
I switched mains
---
An epic gamer moment*
---
And my axe!
---
This sums it up perfectly.
---
It seems people have forgotten about all the drama and all the attention classic got on the media thanks to that shutdown.   
---
Big names were reporting on it and were grilling Blizz for details, we had those huge petitions and the Mark Kern letter &amp; meeting.
---
All of which would've never happened without Nost.
---
4 is the only good solution. Keep track of how many carapace each person helped gather, then normalize the amounts so each person gets a set amount of /rolls based on those numbers.
---
Classic is Blizzard's last chance to redeem themself
---
What version you got my man?
---
Yeah exactly, soda made it sound like he was preventing people from finding his server, but what we want is TO avoid the server, we dont want to accidentally choose the ones hes on.
---

If they let it into classic.
---
That's his whole schtick and some people enjoy it.
---
I thought the intent of layers was that you stay on your layer. So logging in and out wouldn't do anything. The only way to go to a different layer was if a friend from that layer invites you to their group.
---
Definitely big thanks for this guy can't wait to return to the real Azeroth in August üôÇ
---
Hmm I'm reading up on it, seems I do have to be quite dedicated, wonder if there will be server agreements to wait a little before you can bang the gong. Also seems like it won't be something that can be done day 1 of the release of Phase 5, looking at the materials needed by both factions.
---
You going to play Classic, as you are so against the company?
---
I mean, if you delete all the "which class should I play?" And the"i hate blizzard but also love blizzard"...this sub has a smaller regular post count than the other sub
---
That's cuz ur sassy
---
Won't be raiding as Ret.. except if your name is Esfand.

Iirc fury wasn't super strong until the 30s or 40s at least.

I'm assuming you're EU based on this comment. Is that place great? It's pretty unknown here in the US

Did not get in :C
---
I'm not a vending machine, I'm a person
---
&gt; God, you're so dense it hurts.
---
Ironic.
---
Honestly from what I have been seeing. The streaming and all the hype about classic is turning out to be a toxic mess, where people are getting super defensive and gatekeeping because they want to feel like they know more than someone else about a game that was around 15 years ago.  
---
All the posts associated with streamers, and even streamers vs other streamers has turned into a toxic mess. For me it‚Äôs really kind of killing my hype because of all of the elitist behavior from people that think they rule the game.
---
You think they migrated the schema to the new version? I would love to know the details, since from my experience migration from legacy systems to new ones is often time impossible.
---
It's removed.

Who knows these days man

You can proc enrage (or other habilities that proc when you get hit by a critical strike) if you sit and get up in the exact moment when you recieve a hit by a mob or other player.

Anti botting updates, security patches over the years, improved network stability, etc.  There is a lot that goes I to a "client".
---
honestly unbinding a movement key isnt meta, its just stupid.
---
Why would a sword hurt fire? 
---
Like come on, nothing in this game makes sense. It‚Äôs a stupid game decision that ruins class fantasy and options. It‚Äôs just as bad as BFA limiting mages to 3 distinct specs. Limiting player option sucks.
---
I‚Äôll just wait until the 27th then. No point in resubbing just for a unlikely chance for me to get beta access.
---
Timeline and context. Heard of it?
---
Wow, very cool. Now we know.
---
your a casual if you unbind asdw. sorry mate
---
based gonzalez
---
Clearly they've (we've) sinned in the eyes of our benevolent lord Blizzard and must be whipped through the streets.
---
But in their main post it's both sub and game time... So what???
---
BOLG.
---
I got an invite last night, was able to get on this morning.  I subbed originally 1 month after the game came out but I had unsubbed for a couple of years, didn't do last two expansions, but wife convinced me to get back on a couple months ago.
---
Wife has been playing since about 6 months after launch, all expansions, regular raider, everything.  So far no invite for her which is really a bummer.  I guess while I'm at work during the week she'll have to play using my account.
---
I think it is possible that it will be more popular until all the phases are over and then retail should get more popular (if next expansion doesn't suck).
---
What is a feminist Alex.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
seriously. i agree with OP but this could easily end up going either way
---
Yeah I'm sure that's the only reason he's enjoying it. Did you even watch the video or are you trying to gatekeep enjoying Classic WoW?
---
I'll quote it again in case you did not apprehend what the Community Manager said.
---
&gt;‚ÄùIf you are not currently an active subscriber then this would disqualify you from being considering for future beta waves.‚Äù
---
"used to do it on a private server all the time" which is exactly why it might not work as you think it will. Kinda looks like pservers may have gotten a lot of stuff wrong.
---
They don't know that we know they know that we know.
---
By version you mean?
---
Bought in the UK in 2006 so all classic maps present and accounted for.
---
I never played vanilla, but let's be a little realistic here. There's very little the classic leveling experience has to offer, that I didn't experience as a noob during TBC.
---
Yes, give mages heals!
---
Classic and modern share the same base. In a sense Classic will always will be "running" on the latest client.
---
thank you
---
What. There are no shields in the game that grant slow fall.
---
Yea I have to agree with this simply because BfA is hanging by a thread called '8.2' and the hope that it will fix most of the expansions issues but after 8.2 ships and people begin to realize that the 3 main selling points of BfA (Islands, Warfronts and Azerite) are all garbage people will stop playing. That along with the retail players who quit to play Classic will be enough to seriously damage the retail game population.  
---
Finding RBGs, Arenas and high M+ keys even now is difficult. I can't farm my PvP Island achievements unless it's prime time or on the weekends. On non-push affix weeks I can't find anything higher than a 12 90% of the time. Retail losing a significant portion of its playerbase due to Classic and a dogshit expansion is going to remove much of the 'MMO' aspect of WoW.
---
one of us, one of us
---
Where can I get this template?
---
You're delusional.
---
I think the success of classic is going to change the development course of retail. In that sense, I can see it being a possibility.
---
A couple more things that aren't mentioned. Bank slots (last one costs 100g), reagents, ammo, tips for crafting, buying recipes and usually you don't have 300 of your profession at fresh 60 so the rest of those skills for crafting too. 
---
To stretch on the epic mount if you're new then you don't know it costs a base 1000 gold which is a lot in Classic. You can get it discounted with reputation and PVP rank too.
---
I quit before TBC.  I went from
---
Everquest to DAoC to Shadowbane to WoW.  So by the time TBC was coming around I was burned out.  I checked back in around MoP and WoD.  Played Legion for a little bit, but probably haven‚Äôt renewed my sub for longer than a month or two since I left during Vanilla.
---
I really hope it does
---
Salutations!
---
Will it support 21:9 aspect ration?
---
Huh? Don‚Äôt you just get another talent point when you level? What does this mean?
---
It's the possibly best solution they could have ever come with.
---
In fairness, I am made of carbon, but I don't like it when people throw coal at me.
---
For the record: I am okay with people throwing diamonds at me...
---
If 15 dollars is gonna break the bank you need to get your shit in order.

We should make an r4rclassicwow lol

Who is this guy ? Does he heard of vurtne? üòÖ

I bought a subscription for the same reason, and my account is from '06. I regretted it immediately, as even still my chances of getting in are so low.

Fortunately Blizzard was kind enough to refund me.

He seems genuine to me. But if you wanna be cynical, be cynical.

I'm almost one year clean after thousands of hours playtime, but that Compendium dude...
---
But it's not nerfed. You just cant precharge.
---
The talent does exactly what it intends to achieve which is to let you have a large burst when you finally catch up to people. It's so easy to kite Paladins that pretending reckbomb is a crutch is pretty strange.
---
That does not happen in retail though. You can sometimes have weird phasing issues if you are on certain quests, but you wont just clear a place and them have all of them respawn unless you randomly group/leave a group of some kind.
---
I am all up for classic, but hearing people spread bullshit like this is pathetic.
---
Just ask for a refund, they gave me one.
---
So you admit you're ignorant but decided to try and gatekeep anyway. Ven is about as OG as it gets.
---
Watching a stream where lvl 25-30 ppl in a raid of 6 getting 34-45 xp from red/skull mobs.

Taking 70 dmg?! Seems low for a crushing blow.

If I decide to roll a Warlock on Alliance, it will have to be a Gnome. I'd never play as a Human.

your class isn't fire mage
---
Im sick. (Cough cough)
---
Because you think it looks nice.
---
Feel like I'm going crazy. What happened to half the people in this subreddit?
---
Yeah because the game is only open to a small sample size of its community right now. Wait till the actual release.
---
Nice kill!
---
I logged in for a bit to look at my characters, and they still refunded it for me. 
---
They were super nice about it.
---
Why other mmo‚Äôs didn‚Äôt measure up in a nutshell
---
I think classic will be more popular for the first month. Then have a steady decline, with a small bump when each phase is released. 
---
Because that is the same behavior every other Classic/TLE/TLP/Vanilla type server has had for every MMO for the last ten years.
---
Great video overall but damn the smacking of your mouth gets pretty annoying quick.
---
just subbed for a chance to get a invite. wasted 13‚Ç¨ i guess
---
Nearly every pally I see in high lvl pvp would /sit charge reckbomb and dump it on someone, including Esfand.
---
They've fixed/not reproduced other interface issues, so I think it's kinda arbitrary. Maybe this just happened to be something they could implement without much trouble.
---
100% true. Feels so epic to see a Raid group launch past you to get on the same boat as you
---
Soo a random internet guy
---
yeah beta toally ruined everything for me rn. all i want is to get an invite. i rather play 10 alts to 30 than keep playing league of legends
---
Generational gaps, vanilla players don‚Äôt watch streamers.
---
Glorious
---
0% chance
---
You are retarded lol
---
Having a hard time seeing them crack down on map note addons.
---
None of those describe why the game would be better for it, so apparently, you can't.
---
Yikes, how is letting mages use their original spells in the first raid akin to giving them completely new abilities from a different role?
---
Why are you so disingenuous in this conversation?
---
Real mvp
---
yeah that is a single one 5 day credit and I assume it was some issue with your account specific or maybe some issue in the US ? I am EU and dont have this 5 day credit ;)
---
my last one day credit (for server issues, which means down or even laggy) was 15.11.2008, which is around the time activision got full control ;)
---
Yeah, I was still playing few times per week altough I don't like BfA, I still finished +10 for a weekly chest and 2.1k PvP for another chest.
---
However now when I see people playing beta? Hell I can't even login into BfA anymore without thinking about Classic. I'll probably try to hit 2.4k and then I'll quit until 8.2. Who knows if I'll even play 8.2. I tried PTR already and the content looks nice, but class design still sucks and no PvP vendors, so nothing for me to make me excited about BfA
---
Thank you, Omar Gonzalez. The *hero, restorer of worlds and messiah of our religion* we need but don't deserve. &lt;3

I have 48 keybinds in classic on my mage

Never met a pink haired person that didn‚Äôt want attention.  Dudes especially.

And I'll quote their official fucking notice "To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we‚Äôll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net 49 Account." Notice how it says sub OR game time.
---
Frost mage has blink, sheep, spellsteal, decurse, conjure water/food, portals, invisibility, time warp, rune of power/incanters flow, temporal shield. 
---
It's only fireball, fireblast, arcane missiles, that sort of thing that's really removed.
---
I‚Äôve been wondering about the same question. Hope we‚Äôll get an answer :)
---
Calling him Todd Howard is kind of an insult if you ask me. If we erase TES 4 Oblivion and TES 5 Skyshit from history, then it's not an insult.
---
Game engines have a lot of functions that determine "things". 
---
If you have some data (x,y,z) and you feed it through your animation function "f", then f(x,y,z) will show some animation. 
---
But now in the modern engine, they found some optimizations to the animation, and they combined the data points y and z to now be "w". So they also slightly changed the animation function "f" to "f/*". So now running an animation is f\*(x,w). 
---
When you take the new function and apply it to the old data, f\*(x,y,z), the x component "might" load correctly, but it will not have enough data for the "y" and then "z" will just never load. Or the function will just return an error all together.
---
Yeah Na
---
\&gt;LFR was not invented for fresh players between the ages of 15 and 25, it was invented for the aging 40+ year old who couldn't commit to a fixed raiding schedule
---
how old are you?
---
And a yell goes out to anyone jn the area notifying you it's about to be set.
---
Interesting, well thats good in my opinion. Focus macros would make mages and rogues especially even more crazy in pvp.
---
Just goto the wow client and check
---
‚ÄúFeared players and NPCs run fast‚Äù yessss that was my favorite part of early wow.  Let the one mob you‚Äôve precision pulled run into that large group of death.
---
Classic did have metas that's why even back then you heard paladins and druids complaining about only being allowed to heal, warlocks complaining they couldn't use their dots and curses, dwarf priests being selected over other races etc. Etc. Just because you weren't aware of the meta back then because most people weren't playing at a high enough level for it to be know to them doesn't mean the meta wasn't still a thing.
---
Just play on an RP-PvE server. Most if not none will never play on one of those. If they do it's to mess around. Will not be long term.
---
They let a lot in, general chat is full barrens and the server was getting lag spikes.
---
Sounds awful
---
Drip drip drip... Pee on you.
---
I only had one character all of Vanilla, because that‚Äôs all I had time for between school and a full time job. I guess I bought my T2 Holy Paladin too.
---
Good question. No idea. It's possible they had to reverse-engineer a lot of things from the old world too, due to differences that could not be abridged. It would be a great AMA for this subreddit, if we could get Omar Gonzalez to talk about the technical process a little. However, there's a good chance this is all secret-sauce, non-open-source software that they can't and won't talk about in public.
---
Lol nice
---
Thank you Omar !
---
Didn't people clarify that you can get an invite without a sub, but need a sub to play it? I think a lot of people might've wasted their money.
---
Because it's a 15 year old game.   You know what it is and what it is not.
---
Toxic
---
What gatekeeping are you talking about? I never said you couldn‚Äôt say anything
---
I think the real heroes don't wear capes.
---
No need to swear. You still don't apprehend the time-line. The Community Manager said one day ago:
---
 ‚ÄùIf you are **not currently an active subscriber** then this would disqualify you from being considering for future beta waves.‚Äù This overrules their previous post. I will translate: subbing after the CM's post will have no impact for your chances of getting into beta.
---
Tips? Yeah, he is
---
Hmm, ye for sure; it would increase the skill cap for all classes tbh.
---
Is it really that much of a stretch? BfA is the least popular of all expansions outside of perhaps HFC patch in WoD.  
---
We are less than halfway through BfA and the three major selling points of the expansion are completely, unquestionably garbage. I don't know anyone who does Warfronts for fun. People afk them on alts. Most people who did Islands each week are now capped at 50 and have stopped and those that didn't do them still aren't. I was 47+ on 5 healers without doing Islands since week 3 or something. Azerite has been such a success that it's being almost entirely revamped mid-expansion and even after 8.2 will still be the same mixture of either mandatory gg traits for some specs or forgettable useless traits for others.  
---
It's not a secret that this expansion has been poorly received, even more so than Legion for example which got its fair share of hate prior to 7.2.5 which was mostly focused on bugs/balance grievances. Legion however introduced World Quests, PvP talents, Mage Tower, Artifacts, Order Halls (replayability for alts)and **Mythic Plus.** We are about to go into 8.2 with no expansion features capable of carrying the longevity of the game till the next expansion like M+, Mage Tower and Order Halls did for Legion.
---
I'd love to see what hours /played looks like right now in BfA since the Classic beta launch. I'd be willing to bet it's the lowest WoW has had in a decade.
---
At least that one didn't say "15 dollars bucks"
---
I just bind my skills to my mouse buttons. With shift Ctrl and alt even with a 2 button mouse that's 8 skills, with a scroll wheel you can bind up and down too so that's 16 skills on your mouse.
---
&gt; that deadmines run "looked" too easy
---
I haven't seen the DM run in question and I'm not really saying that you're wrong, I just wanted to mention that player skill makes a huge difference in how "easy" things look. Tiny things like casters moving out of melee range and utilizing the 5sec rule can make or break a group.
---
The lengths people will go through to play vanilla
---
WESTERN PLAGUELANDS
---
They're different games. Both will thrive and you'd be deluded to think otherwise.
---
If my duping exploit still works ill win
---
Yeah, been watching streams. Theres definitely rares in the beta
---
More badass than [Omar Little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYj7q_by_2E).
---
I wouldn‚Äôt have known with all the whining these ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù players are doing over people streaming beta
---
Yes. I resubbed for the beta, BUT I just tried the 8.2 PTR. Plan on doing as much as I can to see the story just to watch all the cut scenes on YouTube months from now before my sub vanishes till August. If I do get Beta then my plan worked exactly as I intended it to. If not, I will see you all of you filthy alliance Aug 27th. For the HORDE!

Like I said, don‚Äôt worry about grinding to 60. Were a couple months away. STV is a joke in any PvP classic realm, as is any highly contested area. It‚Äôs half the fun. Yes, getting ganked sucks but I wouldn‚Äôt change it for the world. 
---
Everything about Vanilla immersion is special.
---
Its absurd that a company like blizzard doesnt have the OG build anywhere
---
I want my spec to be.
---
Well elementalist(fire/frost) at least was my favorite.
---
I‚Äôm just saying if you are criticizing blizzard for this current decision, I criticized them in 2004 for a similar one. I just found it stupid and limiting.
---
With enough spirit you'll just regent hp anyway. No need to eat.
---
In MOP, I had a heal as a mage while PvPing with a Druid partner. Symbiosis ftw
---
If I had consumed enough soy throughout my life to unironically play Alliance, I would totally play gnome
---
That makes sense, but what would be so bad about running the old data through the old function, even if it's not as optimized as the new system?
---
Well, yes.  
---
But they didn't let ME in. I'm constantly closing and re launching the Launcher hoping to have access, lol.
---
Not sure how it's a repost, I posted this literally as soon as it happened. Oh well.
---
Go watch the hunters stream for 5-10 minutes after it happened. He was clearly jaded about not even getting to roll and then learning that they aren't even going to equip the cloak.
---
Yea, I believe this is just both interactions occurring on the same frame, so the server can't interpret before/after.
---
Rouge ftw!
---
"sitting on your bars somewhere never being used" is exactly what I like to hear. That's what separates the scrubs from the actual players. Makes skill involved. Most of those skills in vanilla had a place and knowing when and how to use them is what proved your mastery of a class.
---
14 year old memories of redridge mountains spring to mind ü•∞
---
Since it's players that make the community it'll change especially in the first phase where all types of players will come.
---
Join a guild that think like you to avoid the "follow the hype even if it's not my type of game" crowd.
---
You are giving the general populous way too much credit.
---
What's wrong with TES 4 &amp; 5?
---
He‚Äôs not, and it won‚Äôt be remotely close either
---
same here... minds will be blown.... at first reactions will be OMG ack this sucks/is hard, then later realizing it's actually better.
---
where is this statement
---
Why do you clowns think Blizzard should be immune to criticism. Also why do you have a problem with people playing their favourite game of all time and making that game playable again when it wasn‚Äôt being made available in paid form. I honestly don‚Äôt get the rationale of you anti private server whiners and blizzard white knights.
---
Youre an idiot
---
yeah this has been in wow for as long as I remember. dont you just love toxic dumb streamers.
---
This sub has a tremendous number of subscribers in comparison to the game's release date. If you've ever been to any dedicated sub before a game's release, it almost always skyrockets in sub count once the game releases.
---
&gt; I criticized them in 2004 for a similar one
---
its not a similar one though.
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say Island Expeditions, Warfronts and the Azerite system aren't enjoyable enough to make people play BfA for the next year until the next expansion. Shocking, I know.
---
Mage Tower, Mythic Plus, Order Halls, Suramar and Artifact skins were enjoyable enough to do that in Legion which for me and most of my Bnet was the first time we played from beginning to end of an expansion with no breaks or unsubbed time.
---
Given Classic is going to hit squarely between 8.2 and 8.3 I'm going to hazard another guess and say that 8.2 won't magically fix the issues BfA has, even the Azerite system it's trying to hard to make fun. Thus Classic will get a lot of attention from the significant portion of the playerbase that will likely return to their habit of quitting an expansion halfway or so through the cycle of expansions and will pick up Classic instead.
---
Is this 2560x1080 or 3440x1440?
---
Read the comment above me and tell me the only the reason I called him toxic was because of his different opinion
---
You‚Äôll see üòÅ
---
Nothing, the dude is just an edgelord.
---
Yeah BfA is good for a solid 20th place on twitch
---
Can confirm. I vividly remember using this mechanic to reposition bosses on my warrior tank
---
Indeed.
---
He confessed and said it wasn‚Äôt bugged at the end of the video lol. I don‚Äôt like Tips that I watch his stream but damn give him a break.
---
The irony isn't a good look here.
---
Digging this high fat low carb video
---
I know they sometimes talk about their new systems like storing spells as a sequence of actions in a table, rather than having it hardcoded, so I would love to hear some cool snippets.
---
Lmao
---
&gt;Y‚Äôall
---
Y‚Äôall y'all y'all y'all y'all y'all y'all y'all y'all y'all y'all y'all y'all y'all
---
Well said.
---
Uh... the old client runs fine on Windows 10. Source: thousands of people playing on private servers with the old client.
---
So maybe it's time for this sub to get a ''beta clips megathread''. I get it, everyone is hyped for the beta etc, but this sub is slowly turning to twitch highlights subreddit. Seems to be pretty low quality clips for the most part too.
---
/u/SoupaSoka any thoughts?
---
Hahahahaha "first bug submitted boys"
---
Does appearing offline hide you from /who? If not, maybe Blizzard could implement something for specific influential players.
---
ARGENT MAMMA...
---
That's a private server bug though so not sure why thats relevant. Nerfed implies the talent got changed to be worse than it used to be but it's working exactly as it should do in Vanilla.
---
The only people I know who got beta have been actively playing since vanilla. I've been subbed since BC and haven't gotten one.
---
so you want to play fire and frost but you're upset that sometimes one of those is more effective than the other?
---
Would you argue that Fury is still better for duo leveling, even with shaman WF totem ?
---
fking clown
---
This was my initial thought when I saw tips tank/kill 3 mobs in the beginner zone at the same level. His health was barely touched.
---
I was rank 12 as a paladin in vanilla. I raided Naxx and cleared AQ40.
---
Paladin was the most frustrating class to play at the time. Every single spec felt unfinished and spamming rank 1 flash of light is not my idea of a good time.
---
But hey, if your idea of a holy warrior is watching your friend smash faces while you wear a green dress, have at it.
---
Absolutely this.
---
Both were extremely buggy at Launch
---
All this Blizzard defending isn‚Äôt gonna get you a beta invite you bootlicker.
---
The vocal minority is this way a lot of the time. Don't let their toxicity ruin your hype for classic. They'll be in their niche group of people/guild and leave the rest of us alone. :)
---
üëã
---
I think the 5-day was after they got DDoS'd during the WoD release.  I also got a 3-day and a 1-day around the same time as yours (22/11/2008 in EU format), probably from the shitty launch of WOTLK.  
---
Only other credits I got were a couple of 1-days from WOTLK.
---
THIS is what peak Male performance looks like.
---
This is great! Ty!
---
/u/Gerzy_CZ forsen1 I c czech bajs
---
I take it you don‚Äôt work in a large corporate that was registered pre-2000s
---
I had the same opinion before but people have done a good job of explaining why it just isn‚Äôt a realistic possibility.
---
Actually not. All the bugs, small or not, that an average player will find without looking for any bugs, are most probably also those that get fixed in internal QA. With all software, you always rely on the customer testing it, as they might use it in ways you never even considered while developing it.
---
This list is so good. I can already taste the real classic experience over here.
---
Let's deactive battlenet. I'm sure people won't connect over discord or any other messenger. /s
---
Let's be honest here. Times have changed and it's 2019 and not 2004.
---
Don't forget the snowballs! :)
---
Yea, they wouldn't pop that often. I distinctly remember leveling in STV and it started raining once and was pretty excited to see all the effects. I still haven't seen a snow storm.
---
It doesn't "need" to be integrated at all. Everyone uses Discord these days anyway.
---
Thank you Omar!
---
Iirc clearcast didn't got removed from buffs until spell hit/miss mob. In case of mage proc i think for a time it was possible to cast fire/frost/pyro bolt and use insta cast like fire blast to get 2 free spells if quick enough (before whatever-bolt reached mob). Pretty sure it got fixed somewhere down the patch lane.
---
"it just works..
---
.. long enough for you to pay us, then it all falls apart"
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people get defensive about honest criticism.
---
He's a method player with 43k subs. The point of the video is not why we should care about them, but rather it's a person who doubt classic wow and has had their opinion change 180 degrees after playing. It's the exact type of response we want and a bit of 'told you so' which is nice.
---
Walmart won‚Äôt give time off for one day if you ask 3 months in advance?
---
For inconsistencies.
---
I don‚Äôt like game secs forcing things arbitrarily, I want the game to be more organic. I don‚Äôt like the new talent system in BFA because it forces a specific school, and in vanilla I didn‚Äôt like tiers that forced mages to raid a specific spec via resists IE frost in naxx, fire in MC.
---
I see them as very similar.
---
&gt;Anyway, even if you could cast fireball or arcane missiles or whatever, it would not really add much, just be a bunch of spells you have sitting on your bars somewhere never being used.
---
Every skill has it's place. Just because you dont recognize that doesnt make it true, and I suspect you are just not that skilled at playing Mage. I am not judging, I am just saying Vanilla has a lot more complexity than people give it credit for.
---
Yeah but theres no reason Blizzard has to encourage this, anything that can be done to retain parity and not engage a slippery slope should be done right?
---
Fire blast was used because that was the instant cast spell mages had. Arcane missiles were used because it was a bit buggy and followed people behind walls. Fireball/scorch was afaik not used unless you played some sort of elemental spec. 
---
In retail they have added a whole bunch of new spells for each spec. Instead of them all using the same spells just with different bonuses you now use entirely different spells depending on your spec. I fail to see how that's a terrible thing.
---
Oblivion is actually a much better game than people give it credit for. It has issues, for sure, but it's a solid game.
---
And this is coming from a rabid Morrowind fan.
---
Sometimes I wonder when enough is enough. This post is so incredibly #nochanges overkill that it hurts.
---
No, being able to talk to people to organize groups via [battle.net](https://battle.net) is not going to kill anything. Tons of guilds had people on their voice chat, or even better, ICQ and similar messengers for "offline" availability (meaning, not currently active in voice, but still online). Nowadays it's just simpler as people are always online. Next you're telling me people playing classic should not have mobile phones to be available 24/7 because most kids back then actually didn't have them and finding groups required a PC :/
---
here is way! viewcount!
---
&gt; Vent/TS were for voice and not actually talking 
---
Did that make sense in your head?
---
What personal data? My in-game names, my account name? That's literally it. If you mean IP address or whatever, then many games have that unprotected. Just about every FPS game to start. I live in a van so it's whoever's IP I'm "borrowing" at the time anyway. I'd still use XP if I had it. There was nothing wrong with it and I'm familiar with it. 
---
It doesn't look like what my old videos looked like. It's soul VS souless.
---
Too late, already happened.
---
4+ months for first phase please. Those saying &lt;3 months are crazy
---
&gt; A more nuanced point would also be how launching Classic from battlenet will impact the feel of the game
---
9/10, you actually got me a bit riled up.
---
imbecile is a strong word dude
---
It‚Äôs like everyone who didn‚Äôt get into the beta are frothing at the mouth
---
It's no longer 2004 and people aren't gonna go back communication wise.
---
Are those tables available for other characters?
---
Yeah, and it's riddled with hackers, bots, and other security holes that have been getting patched for nearly a decade by third party developers. Patches that would a) never be used by blizzard because they're an actual company and follow laws, and b) would never hold up against millions of users stress testing it.
---
To view the gear list, move to the second tab named 'Gear'. 
---
If you want to use a personalised list that calculates stat weights, make your own copy of the document and input the gear, talents, race etc. that you are using to the 'Main' tab.
---
The original list was made by Guybrush for Nostalrius. I have updated it and added a few features.
---
Leave Britney alone!
---
Premature clown in his non-natural environment.
---
No. People want community and now they got an accountwide friendlist where they got all they friends connected on every character.
---
I think the point you're missing is that those friendlists encourage talking to other instead of anonymously queueing into LFG.
---
Yeah my account is fairly new as I lost my old one. I hope they'll send more invites, cause I raided up to Naxx and I should be there.
---
I guess they want a wide variety of players testing things out, even the stupid ones..?!
---
*Starts crowd chant* OMAR! OMAR! OMAR! OMAR! OMAR!
---
Everyone knows who he is. "AND DOWN GOES VENRUKI."
---
I watched him speak at Blizzcon a few times in 2017. He was at a panel discussing the video game industry and the path to take to make it a career. He was the only one on the panel who seemed to be honest yet hopeful for all of us there hoping to make it. Gave clear and descriptive answers to any questions asked of him so its very cool to know he was the one who made classic possible.
---
You need opinions on gameplay of old and new players to keep the game fine, i‚Äòm also a bit salty i got no key cause i‚Äòm a classic veteran and played the game through till cataclysm on a high end raiding and pvping niveau
---
&gt; Because you think it looks nice.
---
So you want attention.
---
Not only that, you‚Äôd be paying for a negligible chance. Some CS rep tried to confirm that buying a sub now wouldn‚Äôt get you access but mucked up the wording and confused everyone even more.
---
The game might be 15 years old by name and content but the engine is definitely modern. A computer that meets minimum requirements then wouldn't even run this version of Classic now. A computer that meets minimum requirements then couldn't even run a modern operating system today either.
---
You can't really think that classic will have these requirements, can you?
---
Windows 98/ME/2000/XP
---
800 MHz or higher CPU	
---
32 MB 3D graphics card with hardware transform and lighting, such as GeForce 2 or better	
---
4 GB or more of available hard drive space	
---
256 MB or more of RAM	
---
MacOS X 10.3.5 or newer	
---
933 MHz or higher G4 or G5 processor	
---
ATI or NVIDIA video hardware with 32 MB VRAM or more	
---
56k or higher modem with an Internet connection
---
No, of course not. That would be silly. But we don't have minimum requirements released for this version of Classic. That's why I made a post like this, to maybe help people put into frame of what it would take to run this 15 year old game that's built on a modern client.
---
&gt; Why would a sword hurt fire?
---
Because it's wielded by a magic, strong motherfucker.
---
If you are talking about other classes, not that I know of.
---
I mean this post and your hate for tips.
---
His stream is very genuine, give it a try.
---
I‚Äòm vegan for 2.5 years but lol
---
And our fathers' fathers' fathers!
---
I'm not talking about vanilla, I'm talking about BfA. We have a bunch more offensive spells in BfA than we had in vanilla, so adding even more would either change our playstyle a lot, making it really awkward to play (having 6+ main rotational spells would be weird as fuck), or never be used, because we already have other spells accomplishing the same thing (why fireblast when you can ice lance for example?), and why fireball when you can frostbolt (that even applies to vanilla)? 
---
&gt;Every skill has it's place. 
---
Yeah, and a bunch more fire and arcane spells would not have a place in a retail frost spec.
---
I‚Äôve never met someone who considered September to be the summer. You‚Äôre literally right but colloquial usage of the term ‚Äúsummer‚Äù is generally June, July and August. September through November is widely considered Fall
---
The biggest delusion I've seen the last few days is the idea that Classic will launch and everything will be good and we'll play this game forever. 
---
Even in its heyday WoW was dependent on support to keep people playing. We're gonna have the progression we've been promised, but once that's over and done with there are no more do-overs. There is no official launch to look forward to. Blizzard can start new servers and do it over again, but the interest for that will plummet hard and fast. No matter how much you think you love it people will grow tired of doing the dungeons and raids and ganking in Hillsbrad eventually.
---
Now, this is the point where you might think moving on to TBC is the answer, but there's a fairly large group of the audience that's just craving that vanilla experience and want nothing to do with what the game developed into after.
---
There's just a fundamental issue with how people are desiring this very specific experience and the fact that that experience requires evolution to remain interesting over time.
---
What are you saying you heretic
---
Ok but literally what else do you want people to post about, you‚Äôve covered everything there is to do with classic?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKhjezrkJNU
---
And this is why I cant take anyone seriously who said "Vanilla raiding was super hard and your private servers are just bugged"
---
Because almost every video and screenshot I see have the raid decked out in gear that give them half the damage and healing they would have had in proper preraid gear.
---
Because the less button there are, the less ways there are to use your character.
---
Sure you can switch specs and get new abilities, but that just makes it feel like you have less abilities unless you're switching specs all the time.
---
I like to use FFXIV as the best example. That game, while enjoyable, had such stupidly long global cooldowns that there is effectively a strict mathematical breakdown of how to do things. Exiting that pattern of 4-5 buttons was such a huge self-destructive process that you essentially had no other way to play. It was incredibly boring. If i can go 1-2-3-4-5 on my keyboard for every fight over and over, while just walking around to dodge fire, there isn't anything compelling about the game. At the same time, there is no way to really show mastery or feel accomplished about overcoming challenges.
---
That's his personality.  The idea here was clearly to invite internet personalities to beta test first because drama creates notoriety.  Seems to be working swimmingly.
---
Yeah because there has definitely not been hundreds of these posts already...
---
There is zero point of having players like that that have no idea whats going on and only submitting useless stuff like that and wasting peoples time
---
Classic is an easy profit. They spend way less on it than it will make them.
---
Nothing more, nothing less. They make it because they know it will make money.
---
They literally cover this in the dev water cooler post.
---
Oh god that's embarrassing. Typical streamer cringe too "boys!"
---
I really hope this gets the attention it deserves. Amazing work dude, works great.
---
EZ CLAP
---
Can't wait for Kungen to crush this little guy
---
It's not these posts that is the problem, but how long they have been posted for. 3 years of waiting can really bring about dry times.
---
Did they attack the mob around other mobs? I remember even touching them would trigger the other mobs.
---
OMAR COMIN
---
&gt; To assume blizzard can just host a mangos server and be done with it is both short sighted and ignorant.
---
Of course not, *they have the original*.
---
And yet i‚Äôm here refreshing every hour. Man this game is gonna fuck up my life.
---
Stop bitching
---
&gt;Yeah, and a bunch more fire and arcane spells would not have a place in a retail frost spec.
---
You not knowing how to use your tooltip =/= spells not having their place.
---
But go ahead and downvote me. Just know I'm not the one's who is wrong :)
---
There will probably not be any server agreements. And if you want the mount, know that you will need a whole guild to help you with it.
---
I would invite you to look up the definition of the word whining... read it carefully. Maybe get a grown up help you sound out the big words :) 
---
All I did was point out a difference that people seem to care about, as is the intent of this thread
---
Was it easy, OP? I have an account with a bunch of tunes but I've forgotten servers and names. Can you just browse the server list and find old tunes?
---
Yeah, really curious about this.
---
When it comes to Tips, acting like you're top level master of all vanilla because of playing some private server, posting lots of content explaining how stuff works etc and then showing on stream that nothing you know is reflected in reality, explaining his own shortcomings as bug and reporting it just harms his own credibility as content creator. I don't hate him but i won't sub to him or twitch or YouTube or any other platforms.
---
Making a gnome is worth it just for their train emotes.
---
Because I‚Äôve found out that life is much better sharing positive stories about things you enjoy than sharing negative things about activities you do not enjoy.
---
I just don‚Äôt get going out of your way to criticize a different game in a different subreddit. Just seems very pathetic to me.
---
blizzard dont care about people submitting bugs, thats why they gave beta access to big streamers first
---
If it‚Äôs bigger than BFA than the core idea behind this post is still true
---
Classic will die in a few months save for basement dwellers after a few months. The harsh reality is many of the people excited to play simply do not have the time, or youthfulnesss to them anymore to enjoy the game.  
---
Most of you here have full time jobs and families are are incompatible with the time requirements for classic. Moreover, classic requires a lot of divergent gameplay to even be enjoyable, something that grown adults have trouble doing. Just look at retail, no one does anything unless there is a reward worth getting. That same mindset will be with this community.
---
classic veteran? Uh... it‚Äôs not out yet dude.
---
This subreddit really seems to blindly hate all streamers no matter who it is lmao.
---
Actually guild had forums or webpages with some tools to register people participating in raids or not.
---
literally exact same meme posted 7 hours ago.
---
You're insufferable dude
---
N-..no... there is no opinions on the classic gameplay. It‚Äôs just classic. Thats it.
---
That‚Äôs precisely the person you want testing your games. You want as many different perspectives as possible to interact with the game for the best overall experience.
---
I haven't done any testing with it so I'd just be guessing, but I can definitely see that changing things. I'd say with just a healing partner Fury might still be better since it does do more damage, but it would probably be close enough to make it a coin toss.
---
That‚Äòs what did it to me. Admittedly, I leveled to 70 but quit soon after because I felt like we were chasing the carrot.
---
Can you provide a download to this mp4?
---
How miserable are you. Its not sharding ffs
---
thanks :) that‚Äôs cool, there is hope of maybe getting to help out with the stress test even if it is quite unlikely to get in beta directly
---
Got the same thing!
---
classic x retail doesnt matter, the real winner here is activision/blizzard
---
why do we need his "opinion"?
---
How does this help though? We aren't testing a new game, we're trying to recreate a game. Idiots submitting bug reports like this one don't help that.
---
we just want to play the fucking game.
---
For real. im not a big fan of alts, i had a bunch anyways on other servers
---
All of those things are viable for making gold. Mining, herbalism, dungeon runs for cloths, farming Fire elementals, it all works tbh
---
I know back in the day ore's and raw materials were easy cash. Then the big payouts were mainly grinding for those BOE blues  &amp; epics from drops.
---
I hope he was trolling when he sent that bug report....
---
Everything past sept 2015 is complete projection btw.  I‚Äôm not saying the numbers are better than those displayed, but they aren‚Äôt telling us and we will likely never find out unless they cancel retail WoW sometime in the future. 
---
They are keeping the numbers in house because they are down, that‚Äôs for sure.
---
If most people think something is the lost valuable and farm it , then the offer would be higher and higher dropping prices ... ah will not be the same AH that was back in vanilla
---
&gt; Because the less button there are, the less ways there are to use your character.
---
Most mage buttons in vanilla where not used very often though. You had a lot of things you could press, but they were not very useful most of the time. And the spells you actually used a lot were very limited. Unlike in BfA where you have a fairly large amount of spells that you use very often, and still a similar amount of situationally useful spells. What is missing in BfA compared to vanilla is a few somewhat redundant spells, that did mostly same thing as something else (mana shield/ice barrier and mage/ice armor for example), and didn't really affect your actual combat gameplay (it's mostly a prep thing, like chossing which food to eat). 
---
There is a big problem in BfA with how they have removed a bunch of spells we previously knew. But that is compared to expansions like MoP, not vanilla. Mages can do a lot more stuff in BfA than we could in vanilla.
---
TRUE LULW
---
A recreated game still has bugs. And if the bug report is silly enough, it will just be discarded
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all in the game‚Äù

---
In Vanilla, Druids and Warlocks were super unpopular because they had major conflicts with the game design. Are they still fun? Sure. But their problems aren't for everyone. 
---
Druids are true examples of Jack of All Trades. You will excel at nothing. Anything you can do, someone else can do better. You will likely never be the best tank, never be the best dps, and never be the best healer. It's the point that you always have access to all of these options that makes it interesting. If  you just want to heal and do nothing but heal, then pick another class like Shaman. If you just want to dps and just dps, pick a rogue, etc. The class was made to be a mixture, so you gotta enjoy doing multiple things to really get the full feel out of it. 
---
Shamans get Ghost Wolf form at 20, i think, which makes them one of the most mobile characters in the game.
---
Enhancement endgame shaman build is very similar to a 2h Warrior. You get stormstrike, which is an auto attack reset, which is used exactly like Mortal Strike. A majority of your damage comes from Windfury buff which only has a chance to activate. The whole idea is you're hoping you get a proc to obliterate something. Those long periods without procs makes that class go from insane hype from 1 shotting something to insane banality from standing there waiting on a proc every 3.5 half seconds of auto attacking.
---
unless they reposted it or saved it for over 3 months, that's 1.12.1
---
it's just silly how it feels like there's multiple people in charge of deciding what we get in classic.  on one hand we get the old mount system because it's a more rpg system.  on the other hand we get annoying crap like this because 1.12.1 is TrUE VaNIllA
---
 Yea they let you view your account and play any character below level 20. You are unable to log into any character above 20 unless you have a subscription.
---
If you're account has existed since vanilla and opted in you got one it seems. They don't send an email it just shows up in your launcher.
---
There's a pretty good amount of people on the beta servers right now.
---
u dum
---
Very responsive!
---
We finally know who the basement guy is!
---
Finally, someone who understands how board meetings work.
---
It can help develop the ‚Äúwelcoming new players: this is not a bug!‚Äù list.
---
Shouldn't there be an armor rating on it at least?
---
backpedal master race!
---
Yeah as long as you didn't delete them.
---
You need to opt on for WoW classic beta. Also you don't get an email or notification. It just shows up in your launcher.
---
Akchually it's Flight's Pope
---
Yeah ofc, a guild is definitely a requirement. I don't know, wonder what it'd feel like to miss out on the mount after so long, I really need to do that stuff.
---
That's how it works on retail, so I guess it'll be the same for Classic. You need to have an active subscription and opt-in to the beta. Then you might have the chance to play/test the closed beta. I was subscribed to WoW from 2007 to ~end of 2018 with the beta opt-in and never received an invite (I was there for Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion and BFA. WotLK, I joined too late in BC). Not a single invite for the beta. So if Classic si like retail for this, our chances (or at least mine) are low
---
Having recently played enh shaman to 27 in a pserver, mobility picks up at 20 with ghost wolf and I find enh particularly fun to play while lvling. That said totems are the core mechanic of shaman (any spec) and unless you like that (which I do and accounting for the amount of totems there are, gives a lot of depth to the class), shaman is not for you, imo.
---
Classic Bajs FeelsOkayMan
---
Most likely yes, since it's running in the same client as retail wow technically, with the same graphical options. That being said, I would like to get a definitive answer from someone in the beta as well. Also, if everything scales properly.
---
I mean.... I guess you're right about that.
---
No one wants to sit and watch everyone else have fun in the beta when is there is like 0.1% chance of getting in yourself..
---
His stream is literally titled "First Time Classic (Beta Virgin)" did you expect him to have a lot of knowledge about the game?
---
I had some streams on in the background while I was playing, and I swear to god the HP regen thing just became a meme that kids were asking their favorite streamers just to sound like they knew what they were talking about. It got asked soooo much.
---
Where is 1:00 at? Darkshore?
---
Warrior is an interesting case because of having stances, you can have different macros only usable in a certain stance and it's kind of wierd to set up but at the same time very important to get yourself effective keybinds because stance dancing can make it very difficult to do what you meant to do.  Plus many abilities are only usable in a specific stance
---
As a raiding shaman and raid officer I was keenly aware of our equivalent of "meta" and how it affected classes, but it's the whole formalisation and that just gets on my nerves.
---
Put simply, all that absolute min-maxing was reserved for some very few guilds because the rest of us cleared content just fine without it.    
---
Yeah we lagged behind, but no-one cared.   
---
Actually selecting priests based on race for instance, jesus christ how utterly lame.    
---
We obviously optimised to a point we had to, but we ran with a feral druid (where right now that's considered "AGAINST THE **META**, IT'S NOT **OPTIMAL**"), essentially a bunch of tryhards stroking their own dicks by agreeing on what's zomg best.    
---
To each their own of course, but absolute min-maxing doesn't make sense in the context of a general forum such as this because 99% of people here don't need to get it in their heads that if they don't roll a dwarf priest they may as well just not play.
---
Because you lost a bet.
---
This looks so really good. I'm impressed by the design - it's very clear follow at a glance and navigate in.
---
You'll be okay baby
---
Thanks for the kind words.
---
I think they are just watching said streamers and recording bugs themselves and discarding alot of the actual submissions
---
I do
---
Are these R Kelly lyrics?
---
Discarded by a person? Wasted man hours. Discarded by a bot? Potential for legitimate bug reports to fall through the cracks. This is not the kind of person we need beta testing.
---
OK relax. Better is subjective. Just because you live in the past doesn't mean everybody has to.

Venruki: Just play it and you'll see it's good
---
Literally everyone that played Vanilla:  No shit.  That's what we've been saying all along.
---
Well I do but not WoW streamers. WoW is a great game, but it doesn't seem conducive to good screaming.
---
I'm looking forward to hearing more from people who didn't support classic, regardless of whether they like it or not.

Okay but at the same time you can go to an account buying website and see that a single guy is selling over 300 characters JUST like this one. Not saying this dude is fake, I don't think that, but that doesn't change what's for sale
---
Nah, it's justified.
---
You would be correct for pretty much any other game besides classic. Your logic is fine for companies developing a new game that aims to reach as vast an audience as possible. 
---
Classic has already been developed and blizzard has said they want it to be exactly as it was when it launched. Bug testing in this beta is not designed to have people submit bugs to improve the gameplay it is to make blizz aware of mechanics and items not functioning as their original incarnation did.

My gnome rogue has a giant pink beard as is tradition
---
People who didn't play classic might do something differently that a person who played classic or a p server does, which could lead to a bug. If you just invite one section who knows it inside out they will never get other results

I've been keeping an eye out for him since he spoke at length at Blizzcon - 2018 I think? I knew he was something special.
---
Priest. Use SW: Pain on your warlock friends target. That‚Äôs 3 strong instant cast dots (by level 14) which should be enough to kill a mob of appropriate level. 
---
Keep two or three mobs tagged at all times and keep him healed and you‚Äôll basically have zero downtime.
---
This looks great, can‚Äôt wait to try it out later. Thanks!

There was a post yesterday with info from a blizz CM that seemed to suggest it‚Äôs too late to sub for a chance at being invited.

Hunters who don't know how to deal with their deadzones do deserve to lose.
---
Hunters are don't know how to play will lose against rogues, yes.

You're confused because their are so many bad hunters out there.

I want to imagine it was him in the Blizzard headquarters churning away on the code just to please the classic community. :,)

Yeah and neither am I, wtf are you on about?

You can disagree with my assesment if you want, the fact that you're making things personal just goes to show how little faith you have in your own arguments. They can't stand on their own so you resort to name-calling instead.

I dunno, dressed up in a suit to stay home a few times. Feels fucking good with a few beers, like I can take on the world.
---
&gt;why bother having to talk to someone in game through general chat to get help finding that quest mob/npc or get a group for Dead Mines together when you can just ask anyone you know, people who aren't even online
---
You mean...like a phone??
---
I love Omar! He's software developer, he don't just talk, he's CREATING things. He seems to be that type of classic programmer: closing up in that room, 2 weeks after walks out with working product. He's so passionate about Classic, it's just hard to miss when you see him talking about it. He's the true hero of the Classic. I'm sure that there are other "invisible" people. You're mostly seeing people who are trained to talk with community. But game is created by a lot of other people you won't ever hear unless you're reading titles. We should all appreciate their work.
---
This is true i didn't get to loot a corpse because my party fazed before i looted.
---
Well, they found a way to do it in a way that \*they\* wanted to do. I'm sure they could have done it with the old school methods, but I'm sure it was NOT going to be cost effective to re-engineer the old to work with the new. Instead, they're making the new work with the old.
---
Exactly this. The game isn't just here for us
---
No it's not. Stop projecting.
---
The downside is rolling for the same gear all the time.
---
Chicken druids already have BiS dance moves.
---
Their ability to boost the raid's morale will increase everyone's performance.
---
Do you even classic?
---
One more thing that would make it feel more like vanilla is. Forums for individual servers like there used to be.

Never going to know exactly how many people are playing Classic WoW either for the same reason. Even if Classic pops off the statement would be "We have X Million amount of subscribers" not we have 4 million Classic subs and 2 million BfA subs".

You guys must really love this guy. I had never heard of this guy before he started popping up on this subreddit, and now he's sitting at 11k viewers on Twitch. This circlejerk is hilarious.

For real my dude. I kind of hate most of them because they've turned gaming into a job. Not just for themselves, but for everyone.
---
Like today? Or referring to yesterday?
---
&gt;A more nuanced point would also be how launching Classic from battlenet will impact the feel of the game, just easily downloading the game and going away to make a coffee and coming back to it being installed and ready to play is far from how it originally went when vanilla game out, **in vanilla even installing the game meant you earnt the right to play, carefully inserting each disk one after the other** and watching those bars rise till the WoW, not Battlenet, launcher came up and you were ready to start the adventure.
---
Surely you can't be serious? This is the most ridiculous example of r/gatekeeping I've come across, jeez Louise.
---
I just hope that this constant stream of non-issues is some sort of coping mechanism, its just a question of time before people start suggesting time machines or mandatory memory wipes "...because the game wasn't 15 years old when it launched last time #*nochanges*".
---
Doesn't really matter as you level that quickly and the quest greens are plentiful.
---
Another reason why we need a list of servers that streamers will be inhabiting, so we can all avoid them like the plague.
---
So the people downvoting you, do they want toxicity in classic? Who are these people?
---
Nothing like getting ganked by the wandering elite while doing your quest
---
It's not gatekeeping, it's just how it felt at the time, I'm sorry if you can't relate.
---
Yeah, Shamans are fairly immobile.  They plant their totems and feet and start to turret out heals and lightning bolts and constantly try to keep up with their team for totem buffs.
---
Druids don't pick up, imo Lv30 is the peak of Druid existence.  You're just about as strong as you'll ever get.  As feral you'll always be a psuedo damage dealer with gimp (and VERY expensive) healing spells.  All you're looking for on gear is leather for the armor, stam, and int.
---
As a Druid main myself, you've got to understand that even if you play better and come more prepared, sometimes you'll still lose and underperform.  You've got to love the class for what is is.  It doesn't really pick up, it keeps getting harder.
---
This is probably one of the dumbest posts I've seen on here.
---
Parkour's definition is PvE.
---
Seriously who is this person???
---
I thought oblivion was better than Skyrim
---
Wait for the Stress Test and watch the Classic WoW Streams then.
---
That'll be a more accurate representation of how it'll look on release.
---
Did you even read the first half of my comment? I literally describe in detail how that wouldn't work.
---
Priest has for more synergies with Warlock than Shaman. No matter if Holy/Disc or Shadow specced.
---
Shadow dmg dots, Renew to top up your life tabbing Warlock and you both walk around slow like potatoes until you have a Mount. It's a very strong combo which works together very smoothly.
---
The only "downside" is that you often need the same gear while leveling, but honestly it's not that big of a deal. Maybe one of you should go tailoring, while the other goes Alchemy.
---
The optimal combo for a Shaman is with Rogue or Warrior.

---
Lmao!!
---
Druids are pretty gimped in vanilla (real talk), how you described them is correct, it doesn't pick up at 60. Jack of all trades masters of none. including the healing "trade". 
---
They are the best flag runner in wsg, thats about it in what they excel in.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Enh shamans aren't about rng, despite what people say, that only ppl that observed them from outside think. and its a common myth that being spread for some reason.
---
they have a ton of outplay potential in pvp. as you get a ton of outplay abitilities, like short cd spell casting interrupts, grounding totem (consumes any spell of the opponent), offensive dispel, slows for kiting, offhealing, weapon swaping to become more tanky, you can get rogues out of stealth with totems etc.
---
thats why personally i like shaman, they have a ton of tools to deal with any opponent really, and outplay people. so it makes it more fun and dynamic to play.
---
though you, as enh you have hard time getting in raids. so you mostlikely gonna heal in raids.
---
enh/restor is an ok spec (0/30/21). pvp, you have instant self healing button to heal you (nature swiftness). though less damage potential comapred to a standard enh/elem spec (20/31/0) - i personally run and enjoy the most.
---
elem shaman  (30/0/21) is a very good spec, though you need a good gear for it. it rapes ppl. 
---
i'd reccomend you to play a shaman. as for mobility they arent as mobile as a druid ofc (nothing is). though more mobile than other classes (as you get wolf, so its not an instant cast but still can be usable). also you get slows so you can be more mobile by making other ppl slowed if it makes sense :).
---
&gt; He was heading towards the gurubashi arena for the trinket and a dude was going aswell and soda only "allowed" him to join to help HIM get the trinket (even though he already had gotten 1 earlier)
---
You giving him shit for this? Obviously he'd only join him if he wanted to help. He's been dueling the guy and having fun for a while before this.
---
The rogue could've simply said no and contested soda for it.
---
This is in no way streamer entitlement in this case.
---
Great work bro!
---
I resubbed today I'm hopes of getting in th3 beta. I'm going to farm gold and stack tokens until classic or I get a beta invite.
---
Stances had their own .5s global that did not affect other spells. Defensive stance-&gt;taunt was 100% instant, no wait time. 
---
Same as Druid forms, u could always kitty form-&gt;stealth immediately
---
"We want Classic WoW to be a huge success so Blizzard keeps supporting us and maybe we can even overtake retail in popularity!
---
Except people who aren't old fans, FUCK THEM!"
---
He's saying he "feels" his spells hitting harder when upgrading his gear. Except spells doesn't increase in damage from Intellect.
---
Omar, we salute you.
---
* surprised pikachu *
---
bug testing like this is so important to game success and playability by ALL players, new and old. that includes people that have never played before, and might not completely understand game mechanics. By letting unfamiliars test they have a better understanding of how new players will interact with their old (versioned) game

I played vanilla servers for 3 years on the original client, kindly piss off with asking them to use that piece of shit. Every single version of the client post-1.12.1 is better by far

Well it is what it is and he‚Äôs just one out of presumably thousands. Blizzard will handle the report appropriately nonetheless
---
I saw that, and I respectfully disregard this. There seems to be quite a few cases of non-subs receiving invites.

I honestly think they just send out invites and your likelihood increases if you're 1) a current sub 2) been a registered account for a long time

I'm sorry but isn't the whole reason for being 'punk' is being rebellious?

Didn't this guy say he would kill himself if they announced they were doing classic?

Seeing all of these videos makes me really excited. I never got to play classic wow,  but I distinctly remember someone bringing their WoW box to the bus stop when I was in elementary school and were fawning over how cool everything looked

As a Tauren, I would like to thank you for everything you've done for ~~us~~ ... huh I mean the environment !
---
I'm pretty certain mobs in the outside world have rather something like 125% speed, you would run just a tad faster than them as a feral Druid in improved Cat Form (talent granting +30% move speed as a Cat). 110% is very slow, it's pretty much the speed of a player with Minor Speed enchant on his boots, hardly noticeable.
---
I was overwhelmed. It was like I needed to do 20 different things and it was never explained to me why they needed to be completed.

One thing I don't remember in Vanilla was this amount of toxicity.

Why not just roll for it?

They won't email you, only way to tell if you're in the beta is to check your launcher.
---
&gt;ageism

Oh no, a buzzword. I guess my entire assessment of what happened must be wrong.

&gt; reeeeee why won't Blizzard specifically cater to MY hardcore GAMER lifestyle.

For someone who says they're 25 you're awfully childish.

Still don't count on it check your launcher. I never got an email, and most people I've talked to ingame didnt.
---
A small portion? Are you mad? There is enough to cover an entire server no issue. These are the people who will stay after level 30 too. I think its silly to ruin a server community for the sake of tourists personally but tahts what they decided to do I guess.

Ah I see. Just glad they can no longer ambush with it.
---
I did, I just didn't think the argument that a billion dollar plus valued multi-national corporation, that originally developed the game, was somehow less capable than a few dudes with no financial backing whatsoever and which had no access to the original code, held enough water to even be worthy of a response.

Legacy software is very costly to maintain and expand. You can covert the old data, but its not that easy for the code itself.

going to be duel levelling with my warrior friend and me Paladin :)
---
obvious troll report.  and no should not be in beta if making troll reports.  same goes for asmon or anyone else, ive seen them do it.  Thats bullshit.
---
No Esfand is just a natural liar and really stupid, almost a con artist.
---
0/10.
---
Yes, because that whole BETA thing means none of this will be fixed or adjusted will obviously just be a giant shot show correct?
---
Omg Blizzard wtf dude I‚Äôm here checking bnet every fucking sec hoping to get in.
---
This was amazing. I'm not planning on using a specific route, but I just went through the Horde Orc route and it gave me lots of ideas and a general feeling on how I should be leveling. I'll suggest this site to anyone that asks me for tips for leveling in the future.
---
I have that same gear list on my comp, but I updated it to reflect the phase not patch, and added links to the items of gear and quests if you want it, I can post it when I get home

Wait what the hell?? We didn't ninja Sentry Cloak at all, it's literally still in my bags for BoE. We later on said let's give it to someone in the guild for some kind of event, maybe for twinking in case they roll out battlegrounds during beta testing (which I think is probably a possibility). It's a level 19 Cloak in the beta, if the hunter really wanted it we would have given it to him, but he's level 30 and the cloak is level 19 which is probably why he didn't push for it. To be fair, I didn't even see him type "roll" until just now but he didn't ask again.  
---
We've literally been taking items that have dropped for us and giving them to other players, last night we purposely ran Deadmines on my stream with lower level players when I started my Verigan's Fist quest (even though it was going to be slower) instead of running with the level 30's that wanted to come, because we knew the lower levels could get more out of it... lo and behold the Rogue we brought. Minii, got a Cruel Barb!   
---
Asmon and I will banter on stream, mess with each other, etc. Just like friends do. But we're not going to intentionally do something to hurt someone else's playing experience. Stop trying to twist what happened to push some false agenda, it's ridiculous.
---
I've had it bookmarked since you started and will definitely be using it. Thanks for sharing your hard work!
---
Looks like classic wow will have its own mod Ash.
---
That guy was awesome at Blizzcon.
---
that is the stupidest thing i've ever heard
---
you give out one beta key to a streamer and get army of people watching at his screen noticing bugs he can miss + if streamer doesnt report bug some of his viewers can
---
LUL
---
Have you ever been so triggered that you lost your healthy sense of humor?
---
Except that "friend" can be anyone.
---
Seeing how everyone knows the AW event is coming this time around it will be all those items for turn ins as well as cloth of all type for the rep gains when that is added.
---
I agree that there is something off with mob damage, on Tips' stream at the moment, mobs 7-10+ there level should be doing more damage to them especially, and mobs around your current level should do enough damage after 2/3 where you need to drink/eat and as you say some elites especially in dungeons doing much damage at all. I hope blizz atleast look into this and confirm whether values are correct in the next week or so.
---
Let's be honest here, most people play gnomes for the passives
---
Hey man, if you know the correct values feel free to submit them here, on the official forums, or in game since I'm sure you have beta access.
---
Cool, can‚Äôt wait for the challenge.
---
Lol no rares 
---
No herbs too I think
---
[Okay](https://imgflip.com/i/31adwu)
---
As you can see he is an "influencer"
---
Are you comparing private servers to classic or are you comparing vanilla to classic? I mean private server stats, damage and such is all guesswork while blizz has the actual data. Classic is most certainly different than private servers, but out of the 2 its the authentic one.
---
I‚Äôm a teacher and definitely feel this pain as well.
---
Ermm, well personally I have never been, put I know its a pretty expensive place to go, and if you look at some pictures, its what comes to my head when I think of paradise.
---
If you saw my last comment, ignore it, I thought you was replying to the initial post.
---
What a joke
---
lmao QQ
---
To be fair, talents aren‚Äôt making as big difference in the DM-Stockades. Some of the dungeons were nerfed iirc.
---
I move to 72 hour ban anyone making a post like this.
---
Isn‚Äôt it customary to roll for a chest before you even open it?
---
[And a tune to listen to!](https://open.spotify.com/track/118NqsNujF3Co4lekdVulW?si=PVvTXSBkTcuYyoGusig3MA)
---
Literally the entire point of sharding is so people can rush to 60 without issue or ever having to group up. Why would you think people wont?
---
Exactly what I was thinking. People are going to be playing this game a step ahead now. We already know what's coming and what was valuable. Plus people have a lot of online sources to search for stuff. The old methods of gold farming are going to be altered because of popularity, like price gouging and reselling vendor skill books, but some stuff will always earn gold like Professions.
---
Yeah because we won‚Äôt have server Discord‚Äôs setup the day they release those names and those completely make Bnet obsolete anyways
---
Then there are very bad rogues out there as well if you expect to win against a rogue lol
---
You‚Äôre overreacting and posting the same video over and over. I was in a top guild too and we didn‚Äôt spend all of our time farming consumes. You guys can‚Äôt have been very good.
---
They can still spot actual bugs. Not the ones where parameters are wrong. But those where the game crashes, fonts don‚Äòt render etc. they actually compliment classic experienced players pretty well. In the end it is just a matter of scale.
---
&gt;**in vanilla even installing the game meant you earnt the right to play**
---
Sounds like gatekeeping to me.
---
I can nostalgically reminisce about installing WoW and other games contained on several discs but to try use that as an argument against Battle.net-integration is absurd.
---
So, do I need an active subscription to qualify?
---
gauge + vanish, hunter won't remove shit =)
---
Yeah... I'm pretty sure you're the one who has no idea. I've been a developer for just shy of a decade. But I expect you'll probably just think I'm making that up, so, I guess, have a nice day?
---
Thank you Omar... I love you.
---
&gt;I mean, you're quite literally laying the blame at old people's feet.
---
but not necessarily \*because\* they're old. I'm just saying that's the demographic the "bad actors" I'm referring to are coming from. There are also people from that demographic that DON'T want dumbed down content and DON'T want to skip progression. The point is I see far more people from the older generation ask for that than I do in the younger generations. 
---
Put more succinctly, the root cause of our issues stem from people who belong to the older demographic, but the problem is not inherently age. Age may affect someone to have those predispositions in some way, however, but I'm not labelling them as the problem simply because I "hate old people" or whatever.
---
We didn't care much but a few people definitely conpeted for top DPS
---
The problem is conflicting design ideals clashing in one single game. A large majority of the retail playerbase hated anchor weed and the large price tag and constantly complained until blizzard had to inject large amounts of it into the economy through world quests.  I'm fine with them being separate games but I'd like to see retail embrace their differences.
---
Shut up and make me a portal.
---
Man people are right when they say the classic crowd is never happy.
---
Don't worry about the gear - there are plenty of quest rewards for both of you as well as Tailoring.
---
If you both want to same gear from certain Dungeons (Arugals from SFK good example here), you just run the dungeon a couple of times. Maybe make your own Groups to ensure there is no 3rd clothie with you. Try to find 1-3 tanks to add to your friends list and you will always have instant Group wherever you want to go.. it's easy to find Rogue, Hunter, Shamans to group with.
---
Yep. Things are going to be different this time around for sure in regards to some of these things. Can‚Äôt change that.
---
Yep. Really dont like the direction this subreddit is taking.
---
I think the people who have the spell are the people who probably want the spell.
---
I feel like this is bait, but if it isn't, what are you doing here man? Because the longer you stay here the more you'll become fond of our beloved game.
---
They're in Asmons guild. Of course he gets first dibs on loot. If they joined thinking otherwise thats they're fault. 
---
Fucking Asmon hating Op LULW
---
I wish I could live in a basement too and be deluded into thinking I was smart.
---
Only nostcore private servers have it.
---
&gt;This is intended and 100% working as it should
---
Then show me it happening in vanilla. How it works on private servers is irrelevant.
---
The second video ends right after the hunter requests a roll so no, that's not evidence that his request was ignored.
---
I don't understand why this is such a big deal technically. Why can private servers run classic so easily but bliz has to go through months of development to produce this? Don't they have the original client anyway?
---
The asmond run at least was a very careful one. They never overpulled and used correct tactics. 
---
Was watching musclebrahTV earlier today and they quickly wiped from overpulling
---
We don‚Äôt play it because we physically can‚Äôt endure it anymore. People weren‚Äôt begging for vanilla because we hate the idea of new content/expansions. It‚Äôs just that the new content was so game changing in almost all bad ways so we had to resort to the past. 
---
I don‚Äôt feel bad talking shit about retail at all. I feel bad for the people who still work there that have integrity and love for the way the game should have been made. But the facts are facts, whoever has seniority over there turned it into a cash shop. A have whatever you want, when you want it bullshit iOS feeling game lmao. Sell outs
---
It's beta, it's getting erased in a couple months. Maybe that's why they did it? If he does it in Live then that's a bit different.
---
What about the warlock mount? Is that cheaper/will I have to wait until phase 2?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs really the only downside though. While you‚Äôre leveling a lot of gear is from quest rewards anyway so it‚Äôs really not that big of a deal. Warlock spells do decent damage without gear while leveling and dots can‚Äôt crit if I remember correctly which means int gear won‚Äôt be as useful to the warlock in comparison to the priest. 
---
Int will be mostly contributing to mana pool size then, which is moot for a warlock because he can tap and be healed, so giving the priest priority on gear makes more sense since the heals can crit and the priest will have a larger mana pool to heal up the warlock. 
---
The drawback here is less stamina for the warlock, but this is compensated by blood pact, fortitude, VW tanking, health stones, etc. 
---
You will also have amazing CC. Hard elite? Dot it up, mind control it, and watch it rot to death.
---
what they patched was the reckoning talent, but the sitting crit triggering those was still a thing till 1.12 if I remember correctly.
---
Im not sure why people are so surprised and angry. 
---
At first, welcome to classic, the place where each 5th guy in the group is ninja looter. 
---
At second, come on, its beta with 30 lvl cap. Who gives a fuck about not getting blue cloak that would only be useful for the next 5-6 levels?
---
At third, Asmongold always said he loves to scam people. 
---
I mean, yeah, that sucks but doesnt deserve such a huge negative reaction.
---
Dose it matter the harm was done, if you punch a guy in the face your done in for assault if it‚Äôs a troll or not
---
Me too!
---
## Omar Gonzalez - A Real Machine !
---
Have you not heard his reminiscing about being a ninja  looter and very proud of it?
---
Asmon was always a huge asshole and will never change.
---
This list does reflect phase 1 instead of a certain patch. But yeah I was thinking about adding links to items as well. Could certainly use the link though!
---
Does your list have a Fire Resistance tab? I added Frost Res some time ago, but never got to making Fire.
---
We‚Äôve had tens of thousands of new subs in the past few months. Bound to happen with that many more people hopping on the hype train. This sub is new to them
---
He is pretty entertaining and is usually very tryhard, something not everyone always enjoy.
---
We should petition to bring back Captain Placeholder
---
#noboats
---
Its a beta though. Who cares? Everything gets erased soon anyway.
---
I played Horde on Illidan and ally on Dragonmaw. I think I saw T3 like 4 times on Dragonmaw, but it was hella common on Illidan.
---
Hell on Dragonmaw people looked at me with envy over my Hakkari warblades.
---
More crits!
---
I played both in vanilla and when my guild decided to move back to our horde characters for TBC launch I was so happy. Tried playing dwarves occasionally on private servers (only acceptable ally race), but as soon as I arrive in Ironforge I say to myself, these are the enemy.
---
Horde is home.
---
At last you choose the right faction ! :-)

I really think there is something off with mob damage being too low in general for ex. on Tips' stream at the moment, mobs 7-10+ their level should be doing more damage to them especially, and mobs around your current level should do enough damage after pulling 2/3 where you need to take time to drink/eat, and elites especially in dungeons doing much damage at all. I just hope blizz takes the time next week to look into this and confirm whether values are correct or not, so that we can move on from the issue of regen rates, damage/health values etc. which are where the discrepancies between vanilla and pservers would be most highlighted.
---
??
---
You guys are seriously over reacting.
---
&gt;Asmongold talks about how he ninja looted in vanilla all the time
---
&gt;Asmongold makes a video telling people how to ninja loot the best way.
---
&gt;People get surprised when he ninja loots stuff
---
Can we add people who play Pandaren unironically on that list?
---
But also there was a LFG channel that capital cities were sharing tho. People strictly told me that say things that you want to sell etc @trade channel or people ignore you etc. :D But mine was rpish server (pve/pvp/rp server can't even remember it's name atm) and due to that server was little bit strict even they changed r14 warrior's name cause it was not really RP related name and GM's thought this shouldn't be a case for r14 warrior (true story:). But yes I might change it
---
I would recommend hunter, easyest class to solo level imo.

---
I found this helpful!
---
Juked lmao
---
man I'm so pumped. I haven't cared about streams in years, but catching people running Deadmines or just shooting the shit while leveling has been a lot of fun, to say nothing about what they're betaing.
---
Yes but they don't want to use the original client. They've spent 15 years fixing bugs and exploits used by hackers and cheaters and they did not want to launch Classic with those bugs again. 
---
You should lookup the Blizzcon video where they talked about the technical challenge of creating Classic. He actually explained why they are doing it this way.
---
Holy shit i lol'd at this
---
\&gt;you had to use the **in game** functionality to achieve your objectives
---
literally next statement
---
\&gt;sure you had small side programs like vent or ts depending on preference
---
bnet client is basicaly irc
---
We're discussing this and other things. Nothing to say yet, but yeah, it's getting a bit excessive IMO.
---
They are handing chances of beta access to all current subs. What % of them do you imagine are exactly as inexperienced as this guy? Heaven forbid they should simply choose those who opted-in who played during vanilla, regardless of sub status.
---
Checkout Chimly‚Äôs video on the music of Duskwood.

https://youtu.be/qGvoXYAzmyo
---
Only way it could get worse is if he did misrepresented celebrity interviews
---
is the classic experience more about getting resistance values correct or not getting sharded?
---
&gt;Most mage buttons in vanilla where not used very often though. You had a lot of things you could press, but they were not very useful most of the time.
---
You seem to be using the same thing that we're calling a positive as a negative. Recognising the times at which you should use situational spells is what separates the good from the bad.
---
Arcane Missiles is a powerful tool for the damage pushback on casters. Against casters it can be a good choice to purposely get your Frost/Fire school locked by an enemy interrupt and then just AM them down. An enemy caster with no shield/damage pushback resistance talent is very susceptible to the frequent damage pushback, and damage-wise it's not bad at all either as it has great spell power scaling. With Improved Arcane Missiles it is also the best tool that a Frost mage has to deal with something like a pet that isn't CC'd or in general any case where you can't avoid taking a lot of damage pushback, as they have no other way to prevent damage pushback.
---
Fireball has uses to preventing a Rogue from restealthing as any spec, as well as as an opener against enemies with an on-damage-break CC (like Polymorph) when you don't need the slow. Fireball has considerably higher base damage, making it a decent opener even for Frost.
---
Scorch is also the best tool even for Frost in a number of cases. With a shorter cast time it's less susceptible to damage pushback, particularly invaluable when you don't have Improved Arcane Missiles. It can also be the spell of choice simply when you don't have time to cast a Frostbolt due to the enemy getting into melee range soon.
---
Frankly the fact that the only thing you mentioned was the LoS punishing with AM, followed by plainly discarding Fireball and Scorch as "unused", makes it so that I can only conclude that you're not all that good.
---
Yeah, it's pretty sad that guesswork is dominantly more accurate than the 5% of the game they have revealed to us via this beta. Being able to check doesn't mean they have the man power to verify everything. Just look at current 1-30. They clearly didn't verify any of the things I mentioned as they are all empirically wrong, so what makes you think them having the ability to verify means they actually will for the countless wrong values?
---
It doesn't matter if they have the absolute truth booted up in a room somewhere if they don't have the man power to correct the countless things that are wrong?
---
I didn't watched enough streams, but i saw the aggro range was so damn small i can't relate to this in any way. players on the same level as mobs aggroed them if they are directly in front of them. should be like 10 times more as i can remember.
---
&gt; the root cause of our issues stem from people who belong to the older demographic
---
are you speaking generally or just WoW? I'd argue baby boomers fucked up society both economically and morally, for sure.
---
But when it comes to WoW, it's more complex than "well must be age that's the problem." People go to college, and sometimes take 2 jobs just to make ends meet, even in the 18-25 demo. I'm sure you'll forgive me for being hesitant for accepting anecdotal evidence of "well I just see 40+ doing it more." Do you know that \*for certainty\*?
---
I'm not saying you hate old people, but you definitely were definitely targetting them \*because of their age\*
---
You're probably right and I did experiment a little with a "tourist mode" but ended up scrapping it since I couldn't figure out what exactly to say. I want to allow users to change keybinds to their preference and will likely figure something out in combination with that. For now you can hit 'Q' and check the references table if you forgot the meaning of x. Thanks!
---
Have fun playing with yourself on what ever dumpster fire of a private server stays open for Tipsout to play on.
---
Haha, not an issue of your English really, I can imagine a native speaker being misunderstood in a same way :) All good points then.
---
Private servers are just as bad in replicating the vanilla experience, one example is in private servers a certain type of mob will spawn in the same spot every single time however in vanilla it was randomized. In vanilla you had to clear the unwanted mobs away to make room for the quest mobs to spawn. this is just one thing which is def wrong on private servers but no one talks about it.
---
Why are they letting someone like that in the beta test? Because, in someone's head, it's okay to advertise a product to your long-term, hardcore fans as "coming this summer," when in reality the only people you're going to guarantee full summer access to are media personalities, and all the die hard fans need to be happy with paying for a chance to maybe participate, or they can just wait and be content with the small fraction of a summer where they can actually play too. A human being actually thought this was okay to do to their most fervent customers. Unbelievable. 
---
It's been real. Peace.
---
&gt; Mana was beyond critical and using mana shield to protect yourself actually burns that mana from the damage it takes. Ice Barrier was a flat protection amount. 
---
Yeah, so how much difference does it actually make from a gameplay perspective to just have ice barrier (like in BfA) instead of having both mana shield and ice barrier?
---
&gt;Retail makes it to where every situation uses the same thing. Period. There's no difference between raiding, a dungeon, pvp, or farming.
---
That's not true. You have spells that accomplishes certain things. You have your 5 single target damaging spells, you have your 2-3 aoe spells (which you mix with single target usually). You have your 10 other spells which has a bunch of situational utility: blink, freeze, counterspell, ice barrier, invis, ice block, icy veins, slow fall, spellsteal, decurse, frost nova, cold snap, cone of cold. If you play PvP you have a different spec with a few other abilties, and use those existing abilities very differently from PvE. Dungeons and raids uses mostly the same things, but that's the case in vanilla too. For actual farming I don't really know, never done that in BfA, I do world quests and stuff instead, or professions. 
---
Vanilla is the same, but instead you have 1-2 single target spells, 1-2 aoe spells, 4-5 not useful spells (in PvE), and a similar amount of situational spells as BfA, but slightly less useful (spellsteal and invis exchanged for frost/fire ward and evocation, pretty much).
---
Private servs are nothing like vanilla, and they had a 1.12 client but they had to make it run on the current infrastructure for integration with b.net ect
---
Streamers will not be public about their servers, they're really selfish. Unfortunetaly we will have to waste a little bit of time on launch logging onto different servers and /who their names. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425939728?t=9h7m18s
---
It reminds me of a beaten dog with horrible trust issues. The classic community was shit on for so many years that they developed into hyper-defensive gatekeepers who will mob down anyone they deem unworthy.
---
There are dozens of us
---
Super Pally Ball
---
I‚Äôll have to look when I get home, but i literally might be able to just remember a lot of the pieces. If you continuously update for phases you are a saint btw lol
---
Some things are better some are worse, what I hope is that retail benefits from looking back at some good things from vanilla/classic and reimplement them into retail.
---
How do you know they are wrong exactly?
---
I love that he cannot find the quest mobs because he has no quest helper, and he is tempted to submit a bug for it. :facepalm:

I'm playing through Warcraft III .. it helps, a little. I can't do pservers anymore, knowing that classic is out there and I could possibly get a beta invite.
---
This sub is toxic as hell.
---
 &gt;If you go to WotLK, certainly you will see epic stories and adventures there, but many players say "oh by then raids were casual and the dungeon finder started to erode a lot of the sense of community."
---
Im glad Ion said this. Wotlk gets way, way too much love.  Wotlk was when the game truly went downhill with LFD, easy raids, multiple raid modes, ultra welfare epics.  No thank you.

We can't just give away our trade secrets lol

Watched Swifty‚Äôs stream the other day, he tried equipping a chest and some legs in combat when it didn‚Äôt work he said ‚ÄùNO! Blizzard! U should be able to equip and reequip gear in combat!‚Äù He then proceeded to report a bug...
---
&gt;Literally everyone that played Vanilla: 
---
More like private servers players, I know quite a few vanilla players who are sceptics of classic
---
I'm in the beta. I've already killed a rare spider in fargodeep mine. There are herbs all over the place. My herbalism is at 30 now.
---
Exactly this. Perhaps a better word than greedy would be nearsighted.
---
Nah man, it'd open instantly, the graphics were simple yet identifyable, it wasn't tryhardy trash that took ages to load. I quit mid-cata and I hated that fucking client. There's no reason to fix what isn't broken.
---
600 USD a month and 40 chars to get to 60? Hardcooore, otherwise reported for account sharing/buying
---
No go
---
I keep hearing this, and no we definitely burned flasks for first-attempts like crazy. I've never done a vanilla pserver so I'm not mixing them up.
---
The tanks were flasked 24/7 in BWL or higher. For first attempts everyone was flasked.
---
Enjoyed the stream, can confirm what you said. Welcome to r/classicwow hahahahahahah

Do you have a mythic Jaina kill? If so how much did it cost?
---
Not sure if trolling, but you it's still quite a grind, even if 100 people are involved.
---
Video evidence. Also the plethora of people clearly feeling it's wrong. Feelings are anecdotal but enough of them make a consensus.
---
They can‚Äôt just copy and paste the code and run it through a compiler. Updating a 15 year old game into a modern infrastructure takes redevelopment and time to re-evaluate parts of the fundamental game engine.
---
Shroud is the most down to earth big streamer. I think it‚Äôs because he knows what it‚Äôs like being the little guy. His stream was pretty small and fairly niche back when he was still on c9 playing CSGO.
---
I just got my old account back, and none of my characters are in it. I was considering renewing my subscription, but I just wanted to make sure. I have three accounts listed, my old account name, WOW1, and WOW2 (which is a trial account). The one named after my old account name should have my characters, correct?
---
You initially disregarded him and began backpedaling so hard once you knew he played in BC, you're pathetic.
---
Abominations in WPL i got a Krol Blade off one of them sold it for about 600 gold.
---
Very well formulated.
---
&gt; Blizzard haven't verified if the player regen or dungeon mob damages are correct yet.
---
If they haven't, why haven't they done that yet? They've had plenty of time.
---
This sub is just really fuckey and will flip from "man Im so happy and hyped" to "FUCK BLIZZARD FUCK STREAMERS FUCK SHARDING" ever 10 seconds. Dont think too much about it.
---
No and you know why? They had to rework every single hunteritem (sets) cause they had int on them and they wont rework any items
---
Have to remember that Ven is a retail player with an audience of retail players.

And yesterday my girlfriend started complaining a little about how moronic I was behaving. I didn't realize it myself, but I've been acting like a teenager in love, or a kid before Christmas. Excited and happy, but kind of grumpy/whiney because I don't have access yet, and I curse those who have in silence.
---
Been checking my account every hour, and refreshing reddit and the forums on my phone all the time.
---
It's getting kind of pathetic really.. Haha!
---
This game..
---
not just a hot take, but a bad one
---
Kevin Jordan (Vanilla WoW class designer) has said that it was not something he would have liked happening and did not intend, so you‚Äôre absolutely right in feeling it was wrong
---
That does make sense, but how do you motivate people into contributing hours of their time..? In an ideal world they would just because they're grateful to the GM for all his hard work, but :)
---
Wtf is going on
---
For ore nodes thing can share one of my experience with a jerk that trying to click on my rich thourium @ slithus. I hope won't happen in classic  while I am mining :D
---
You probably will get more informed answers in the weekly What Should I Play Wednesday thread, and, since you play retail, if you post about what classes you play most and what you like about them there. There also are some links in that thread to some extensive write ups on Classic classes and how they differ from retail, and what life is like playing them through the game and at level 60.

However, if by casual you mean, "I do not intend to raid in Classic and don't care about the meta," then just play whatever you want. Anything can be made to work if you don't care about keeping up with the meta, and what is best will depend on how you like to play or what sort of things you want to do. If by casual you mean you won't play many hours per day or week in Classic, then the most important thing is to play something that you enjoy playing, because you're going to be spending a looooong time with it you even get to the level cap. So just make sure it's something that makes you happy to come back.
---
No
---
Wonder if they tell their board members this is the case kek
---
And let‚Äôs get blood elves while we‚Äôre at it
---
Can we get a source for your values? If you are just guessing that the values are closer with no actual proof, then I fail to see the point in this post.  
---
Private servers are way different from Vanilla. Would be very interested to see where you are getting your numbers though. I mean, you can be stupid enough to make a post like this without anything factual to back it up would you?
---
Hi, i'm not speaking of the hunter resource 'focus'. I am speaking of the secondary target, like /target focus
---
Blizzard has to incorporate their entire modern server infrastructure. Hints from that Ion interview talk about their modern client/server "learning" how to interpret classic data, which indicates that however classic data is structured, its wildly different from retail. They didn't want to have to develop an entirely new client+servers for classic.    
---
Omar is an engineering god. Not all heroes wear capes.
---
Yeah not the 100k+ watching Asmongold do deadmines and the total 180k+ of the WoW category the other day.
---
Dont rush to a conculsion too early. Also no matter how much people like leveling noone will quit the game over some diffrent values on level 20 elite mobs. If the late game is alright then it will be fine. And I have played 4 years on private servers aswell and so far what I see excites me.
---
Just gonna leave this here so you can see what it will be like if you raid with a streamer.
---

---
Honestly, the actual classic launch is going to be a minor shitshow of retail people freaking out and acting like they're vindicated because classic will just appear like a shit game to them. I really hope the backlash doesn't harm the long-term health of the game.
---
That's not the point. That's not a good reason to cheat people even in the short term for something that doesn't really matter all that much. 
---
It's just not something decent people do.
---
This should be an intentional course of action.
---
What does that have to do with any of it?
---
Venruki is a very genuine guy so I‚Äôm not surprised at all to see him come out and say he was wrong. I hope to see more of this but most content creators are too prideful and stubborn. Either way, great to see Ven enjoying the game. Always been a fan.
---
Im sure they will fix it if not before release then after when more and more complain. But if you want to prove your point, watch a beta player level in Durotar and compare it to Joana's stream. That should show close to what the damage was in Vanilla
---
Who‚Äôs that walking on my bridge?
---
&gt;We may down the line if it's something that players want. When we say the shop I mean specifically only the services that were available in the original Classic period. Things like server transfers and **race changes** were available later in Classic. 
---
Is this true?  I remember race changes being added much later, in wotlk I believe.  Originally I thought it was only server transfers and possibly name changes.
---
I sold an account in 2007 and recovered it recently after saying I was hacked.
---
Damage on the Beta is pretty accurate from what I've seen, try checking old Videos from Vanilla or Joana's video series before making accusations like this.
---
I said more authentic. A thief is more of a good person than a rapist/murderer, doesn't mean I said thieves are good people.
---
Deadass honest I have no clue what‚Äôs happening rn. I can‚Äôt tell if we are joking or not
---
what are you talking about this is me at my happiest
---
This is the natural order and should be an intentional course of action.
---
Yea I think so too, works really nice for semi-casual guilds where people won't nolife for a main nolifer.
---
Well said.. uh, written.
---
Uhm guys, he found a bug because those boots do neither have armor nor durability.uld have. Can we pls stop
---
I have backpeddle bound to shift S.   So if I back peddle its because I want to.  This also let's me use s as another keybind
---
&gt; I'm not saying you hate old people, but you were definitely targetting them \*because of their age\* 
---
Plainly wrong. I'm pointing people in the old demographic out as being the root of the problems in WoW that we have today, but I'm NOT saying it's specifically \*because\* of their age.  
---
But I've already explained this multiple times, so that will have to be the end of it. If you disagree with my assessment, that's absolutely fine.
---
I can appreciate owning up to being wrong.
---
On top of that, pretty solid video tbh.
---
So no actual evidence. Ok then.
---
Was a hobby of mine to screenshot when this happened. I didn't look through all my screenshots but took a few. I loved these.
---
OUT OF MANA
---
Shaman: Mail
---
Warrior: Plate
---
I got downvoted for this in the past, but mark my words: this will be OSRS all over again.
---
He had res sickness.
---
While solo'ing taking a mana break every 2 pulls is about right - at least for a mage.
---
Haha that is what I was planning on doing! Making this for myself as well, couldnt find a comprehensive list for Phase 1, only lists with 1 or 2 options.
---
He don't, it is just a kid / troll who want to make him sound somewhat important. Not understanding that beta is the time where lot of bugs and incorrect values still exists makes it pretty clear.
---
Wow, great reply and definitely made me reconsider keeping on with shaman! Much appreciated! 
---
Can you share your thoughts on professions? 
---
Another bonus is that I can be an orc or troll, and not Tauren.
---
good bot
---
Too real..
---
My point isn't that private servers are 100% authentic, it's that private servers currently have a higher % of authenticity than classic ever will, bad pathing and static respawns included.
---
Classic private servers are a community engineered attempt to recreate the game. It's an emulation, not a copy. They're pretty wrong and tough especially compared to the level of quality Blizzard puts out. 
---
Just because some communities have been passing around the same code someone ripped and filled in *years* ago doesn't mean it should be easy for blizzard. 
---
Blizzard didn't want to start with a mess, or guessed values and locations. They wanted to back to the way it was, and capture the world exactly as they left it. In order to do that, it took a lot of reverse engineering. 
---
The modern WoW client is very stable and fixed s lot of issues that popped up over 15 years. The game has grown immensely and just trying to dust off old code is going to leave people frustrated at best, and leave the game buggy and unplayable at worst. 
---
So it's a matter of backtracking their work, while managing to keep the necessary fixes and updates needed to run the game st a modern experience on modern computers. 
---
But a lot of the old devs are gone, and no one specifically saved instances of the game to be recalled. 
---
So it was a lot of picking up the pieces, with a lot of newer guys unsure of where those old pieces might be and what closet door has them hidden. And then once you pull em out, clearly these old parts don't fit your new car. So do you strip down the car and make the old parts fit, so you rebuild the car as it was in the past -- and if so what instructions do you use to get it right? Or do you modify the *old* parts to fit on the new car?
---
All of these have different implications of work needed to be done, potential outcome of success, etc etc.
---
Yes it is. No one would care about how good they look if it wasn't for other people caring.
---
Send this to Blizzard HQ.
---
Yea it was so hard that one dude managed to figure it out himself...
---
The whole "we can't do this for technical reasons" is so obviously a lie, and it always was. They just never really tried. Put your best engineers on this and of course they'll find a way to make an old game playable. Suggesting otherwise is absurd.
---
Even in vanilla, people in my guild were always on vent.  Even if they weren't in the game, we had folks who would log on to chat while they were doing homework.  If we wanted to do some 5 mans with people who weren't online, we used the phone to call or text them to log on.  Communication in battlenet will just make it easier to connect with your friends.  Imo, not a big deal.
---
You clearly haven't or you must be astronomically bad if you think just making old software run is the way to go forward.
---
To qoute Venruki from the video
---
&gt; It really is noticable when you get one single upgrade of gear. You get one piece of gear that has 6 intellect on it and 3 stamina and you actually can feel your spells hitting harder
---
I call bullshit. Spell damage doesn't scale with intelligence. There's a minor crit scaling which is way below 1%, nobody can feel that.
---
I don't follow Retail WoW and I have no idea who this is, besides what he said in the video/what I read here. But he's making things up, which seems quite obvious to me. So I'd tend to believe he's just jumping on the hype train or maybe sponsored by Blizzard.
---
This guy is a fool.
---
People take it way too serious lol. I watched that part on stream and thought it was hilarious. You taught a valuable lesson aboht blue BoE's.
---
Use your words buddy.
---
Are we just supposed to take your word on this? It‚Äôs more likely you‚Äôre in the wrong here
---
Seems like a true scumbag move.
---
Okay, whats your opinion on mouseover macros and castsequence being in classic beta atm then?
---
"People think my favorite streamer is stupid, it must be because he tries so hard and they just aren't into that"
---
lol streamer fans are the worst.
---
IGN? We can compare raid achievements pre BFA if you‚Äôd like? Just gonna embarrass yourself though lmao.
---
All those warriors are going to be so sad because they are going to be threat capped in raids much quicker due to blizz  keeping the obviously bugged /sit shit on pservers.
---
But it's aboslutely trash, runs like a dog, a bitch to maintain. Want more examples ? Just read the hell online that it is to maintain legacy software and you'll see how fucking not worth the effort it almost always is compared to developping a new solution.
---
What in tarnation!?
---
Jesus really?!? Oof
---
This guys hacks.
---
Some hardcoded parts might be wrong in the scripts. E.g. boss using an ability too often, or there's a mistake in a formula. 
---
For me it wasn't completely clear whether all the scripts are 1.12. Subtle things like - does charge apply a root or a stun to the target?
---
It‚Äôs an artifact of being on 8.2. They will fix it.
---
I would say if you like socialization then yes
---
Simple. If you played on a private server recently you'll have seen semi-regularly Russian kids taking them down for "ransom" money or just for fun.... The client is a very old piece of tech with lots of ways to exploit. A company like blizz could never allow that to happen it would be a disaster. A complete security nightmare.
---
Funnily i linked this exact same video earlier in a discussion:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpg3f1/whats_with_the_content_creator_hate/ensnrqv/
---
NE Human face is the best. 9/11
---
How about ‚Äúno‚Äù
---
Think about it like this -- if there isn't an official RP server, the RP'ers will designate an unofficial one to all roll on, and that could be your server. So even if you dislike RP, it still benefits you for there being an RP server.
---
Wow you figured it out.
---
Congratulations detective Sherlock
---
Yeah I‚Äôm going to level them simultaneously very slowly by grinding üòã
---
Just to add my two cents,
---
I don't watch streamers, why would I want to watch some one else play a game ? 
---
If you don't like them stop watching, because 1 they don't care about you or your opinion and 2 like previously mentioned they have fan boys who ass kiss (sad generation) so they will never change.
---
Stop talking about them, stop linking their streams +1
---
(I don't even know who your talking about but it saddens me that gaming is in this state)
---
How has gaming become a job for everyone if it's a job for only a few people?
---
Read the comment above me and tell me which person sounds more toxic.
---
hoooohoooheeehooo
---
Same here, brother! Exactly why I main a Tauren.
---
No, chests in classic don't prompt a need/greed roll. The party usually rolls to see who can loot the chest.
---
I keep seeing those post but I won't lie, I never understood.
---
How do you "resurect" your vanilla character ?
---
I main warrior, I have every single ability in their arsenal macro'd so that if I try and use it and am not in the right stance, it puts me in that stance. Then I can click the same button again to do the skill. I never use the stance bar, nor do I use the stance-dependent main hotbar (I turn them off in UI). My icon layout doesn't change because it doesn't have to.
---
The big three are on the mouse (rage/zerker is middle button, charge/battle is thumb up, shield block/defensive is thumb down). That's all I need to stance dance and spam the big three when needed.
---
Thanks for an actually intelligent reply. 
---
My argument is if this much is wrong with the tiny vertical slice they are allowing us to test, which they very likely have tested more than anything else themselves before allowing others to see it, then holy shit the end game is probably fucked to all hell.
---
I hope I'm wrong, but I believe I'll be pointing people back to this post a lot.
---
OP's point is, there're too many flaws and too little time.
---
No, from like a company policy standpoint. The suits require every game Activision Blizzard publishes to have full Battle.net integration, or they don't publish it.
---

---
So mine has a bunch less options, but If you want to grab some of the quest/boss/pattern feel free!
---
\&gt;but I'm NOT saying it's specifically \*because\* of their age.
---
\&gt;just retarded. And it's the older generation that's the problem
---
hmm.. well alright then. anything to say about my other points?
---
Why did you deleted your comment bud?  Answer my question
---
It‚Äôs reddit,  not sure what you expect beyond a bunch of nerds spazzing about streamers and trying to one-up each other all day.
---
I respect this video
---
nice meme
---
Needs more alpha female troll face. Fuck, she was horrifying.
---
Somewhere I think I got a whole bunch of people with NE textures, they looked wicked with the facial markings.
---
Values can definitely be wrong for a variety of reasons. 
---
I'm pretty sure they converted the old db to a new format, so bugs could come from that so there could easily be errors from that.
---
It doesn't take more than one faulty entering for values to completely screw up and it has happened before on retail.
---
Wrong values are unlikely, but not unheard of.
---
Nah I expected it. Just thought I‚Äôd write this cos it‚Äôs kinda annoying. Legit off putting knowing these are the people that will be interacting with.
---
Lets play retail!!! LOLLLOLOOLOLOLLLOOOLOLOLOL
---
Yep I've decided on the morally grey side for classic
---
I agree with everything but honestly practically every dungeon is worth it unless you are literally racing for a server first or perhaps are in a cut-throat guild.
---
I‚Äòd rather add 0.5 days to my played but spend 20% or so or my leveling time inside dungeons.
---
Also class mechanics are a thing. Dungeons ease inexperienced players into hopefully learning what they are supposed to do.
---
Arms was always the leveling spec. It's far superior to fury, the sit-crit shit from p-servers is putting out a lot of missinfo.
---
I feel like that argument can also be used against then: Why show you're willing to ninja loot that won't matter once the beta ends?
---
give him a break, hes autistic
---
&gt;xDlate: Do you plan to take some ideas from Classic development and apply them to live servers?
---
&gt;Ion Hazzikostas: One example that I can think of--let's take a look at how our code evolved. We removed the ability called "Eye of the Beast" from hunters and, as a result of several code changes, it was actually impossible to us to reinstate it in modern WoW-- it would be a tremendous amount of work. Well, to make Classic happen, we had to do most of that work. There are still some bugs to fix, but we actually think in the modern game, thanks to the work we've done to make "Eyes of the Beast" work again, there's no reason we can't give hunters that ability back in Battle for Azeroth, and that's like a small example of something.
---
According to this statement it looks like they had a lot of work to do reverse engineer the functionnalites and implement them in the new code. More than simply migration, I think they just recreated the data in the new system instead of simply trying to migrate it and adapt it on the fly.
---
&gt; Yeah, so how much difference does it actually make from a gameplay perspective to just have ice barrier (like in BfA) instead of having both mana shield and ice barrier?
---
Learning to answer that question yourself is exactly what separated you from the average player. That's exactly why I am happy about Classic. You don't know the answer, so there's obviously room to learn, since you already seem to know everything about retail.
---
Link to the post saying it isnt intended?
---
THE PHASING WITH THE CROCS - This is intended on Private and retail vanilla. It DID happen back in the day.
---
I'd argue for the latter. I'm not a big fan of either but in that moment and how quick it was, its normal to refer to the RNG of said chest when something sick drops from it. Common old school terminology imo.
---
Take a gander at /r/wow when you get a chance. Toxicity isn't limited to this sub, kiddo.
---
It‚Äôs only 9:50am relax brotha
---
I guess time will tell. Thank you.
---
This is where you really need to start providing videos from 2006 vs videos from the Beta. I've seen one person  doing so, and his example showed that Beta is Blizzlike. Do you have much to counter it with?
---
I hate people who talk about private servers... literally no one cares. I never played one, never will... and that is probably 90% of us. The other 10% are people who played incorrect private servers for years convincing themselves that they are playing the truth compared to blizzard who has archived data of how things really are... plus it's a beta for a reason.
---
My bad then, sounded like you weren't
---
You guys sure are sensitive af
---
This sub has a hate hard-on for content creators.
---
i cant i have too much karma its throwing me off balance, i need a certain amount of downvotes to stay mentally sane
---
Thing is, a lot of people making accusations like this don't even bother to check old Vanilla footage to backup their claims. I've seen a few people say the damage is wrong, and I've been able to look at Joana's guide and prove that's it's accurate.
---
Didn‚Äôt say it was. I browse wow daily. It‚Äôs got some idiots but overall it‚Äôs good discussions and nobody is regularly posting streamer clips to flame them nor blindly hating anything. The most hate you see there is game mechanics, class design and narrative. Not to people.
---
No. Stop.
---
The term ‚Äútoxic‚Äù is way overused, get lost.
---
[I mean I‚Äôve been a pretty causal raider since Vanilla](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/wyrmrest-accord/nacilep#zone=21&amp;difficulty=4), I‚Äôm just saying oversimplifying the entire game as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù is a bit disingenuous. The high end content is just a difficult or even more-so as ever before.
---
Don't take me wrong, i like venruki, but this video should have been 4-5 minutes long. Do a bit of pre-work, think about what you want to say, maybe write down some bullet points and you won't be babbling for long minutes, using the same fucking adjective for everything at least 5 times.

This feels like an adderall induced monologue.

Sorry. I‚Äôll find a new term.

Does ‚Äòfull of cunts‚Äô work for you? Cunt.
---
i have done it before i will do it again but also this time i will have friends and warriors are amazing to level with.
---
any class with a heal is a instant A and any class using attack power is a B. pretty much only mages, warlocks and an other warriors is a bad combo partner.
---
warriors issue in classic is there lack of regen out of and in combat. they have a great buff with battle shout, insane damage mitigation and solid damage output for the time they can do it. i mean take rogue it dosen't seem like a great combo but the warrior will have aggro this means the rogue gets back hits always along with the battle shout is a stacking effect that is not to be underestimated.

Ok that is bullshit wtf blizzard
---
Im up for class balance. Just number changes so the dead specs have a bit of value. Itll only bring more variety in to the game if they did. But this sub is hateful so this question is going to be met with alot of criticism and hate.
---
I hope they put cass balance back to what BC had (keeping Shaman and Pally on their respective side)
---
no u

&gt;Their values are simply too far off on too many things to believe they could possibly make it authentic

Stop what? I'm just asking for peoples opinions while sharing my own. I'm not asking for Blizzard to implement anything.
---
That's probably why they did it. Because who cares? Its a fucking beta. Nothing that happens here matters except for bug reports. I'm not defending the guy, I don't watch him or care about streamers in general. But Reddit is making a big deal about something so stupid. In 3 months or less this whole thing won't matter anymore. If he does it on Live in end game dungeons and raids then I can understand people getting all pissy.
---
Cause now you gotta keep up with how much they play or else you'll be left behind /s
---
Jesus Christ, this is actually funny that people are so upset by this. People here are trying so hard to find any reason to hate the streamers.
---
Not real useful at lvl 30 that
---
Yeah I know, it really will effect the experience.
---
We shall worship this man, nay, this god among men as our eternal savior and shall keep him close to our hearts always.

Why would you sit and watch someone else play a game you would rather play yourself and also pay him for the privilege
---
There is a thread on the wow forums where they are porting over addons by request and linking them for download for the beta.
---
Noggenfogger
---
This sub has a large number of frothing at the mouth neckbeards, good luck explaining anything to them. Most of them are just whining about not getting an invite to the beta yet.
---
Same thing i thought about, i know "venruki is genuine/kind/goodguy" but why now? The private server scene was up for so many years that he could have tried it before, but nope, just when the audience is shifting.
---
&gt; You‚Äôre overreacting and posting the same video over and over. 
---
You're calling me a liar and posting proof that I'm not is "overreacting"?
---
&gt; I was in a top guild too and we didn‚Äôt spend all of our time farming consumes.
---
Maybe your server had a bigger population than ours making buying consumables actually possible?
---
&gt; You guys can‚Äôt have been very good.
---
Yet we still managed several top 10 world kills.
---
fanboy alert
---
Maaaan, you havent lived until you've run out of ammo in Dead Mines, and had to rely on your ghost kitty and whatever random stat stick weapon you had for DPS.
---
this.  so much this.  It's what people are forgetting.  Things still need to run through Retail to work.   While having the original 1.12 numbers is great, it still needs to run through the Retail "process".
---
Yes. It got worse in the last couple of months.
---
People now bitch about streamers, new players wanting to check the game out etc..
---
Be glad Classic is a hit with streamers. Be glad new people are checking it out. It will give Blizzard a reason to support Classic. 
---
Stop being whiny bitches.
---
Calling someone a ninja is hatred and toxic or what?
---
but what about during the demo when the regen was way too fast? Was that just a bug?
---
Wait which streamer ninja looted
---
Fireball was used to open on rogues with a dot, scorch was used if you got locked on frost. Need I go on, pleb?
---
Because it‚Äôs entertainment. Why watch sports when you can go play sports? Why watch cooking shows when you can go cook? Why watch movies when you can go daydream?
---
&gt; Against casters it can be a good choice to purposely get your Frost/Fire school locked by an enemy interrupt and then just AM them down. 
---
Isn't it better to just bait their interrupt? 
---
But yeah, classic PvP is pretty decent from what I've seen (don't know much about it though), the problem is the rest of the game, where gameplay is pretty damn boring. 
---
&gt;Frankly the fact that the only thing you mentioned was the LoS punishing with AM, followed by plainly discarding Fireball and Scorch as "unused", makes it so that I can only conclude that you're not all that good.
---
Yeah I'm shit at PvP, never claimed otherwise. I'm just defending BfA class design, and mostly from a PvE perspective. I know even less about PvP in BfA.
---
Oh Cosmos what a terrible terrible UI. i think I got it to see raw mob health or lvls of ?? mobs or some other silly shit.
---
Can't wait until drathal/meta/frosthud, titanbar, xperl, and bartender are updated. Then it'll be classic WoW
---
&gt;Play BfA

Rolling pala lul
---
Imaging going on a huge rant and accusing others of being toxic.
---
while you can't really die as a paladin you really can't kill stuff ether and your toolset is missing a ton of stuff since paladins were left unfinished for vanilla pretty much a bunch of stuff they got in TBC was in the vanilla beta but removed since paladins were gods that did everything in all specs on a S tier level.
---
No. It‚Äôs not toxic. But the sub reddit is growing toxic with its attitude.
---
OMAR! OMAR!
---
Gnomes are hands down the best PvP race. Escape artist, engi specialty, and the deep deep shame the horde feels when they hear the shrill laugh of a gnome while they dance on their corpse. 
---
God I love this fucking game.
---
I haven't even heard of this one
---
Its astonishingly obvious that if you're willing to do it in beta, than you're willing to do it in launch. Knowing Esfand, he'll also try to make that excuse.
---
To be faaaaair
---
Yeah cosmos was already considered a reaally shit UI by then. It really stopped being a thing pretty early on. Be glad you didn't experience that exercise in frustration.
---
Oh you mean the odd thread about how classic is a bad idea etc. Yes, but it‚Äôs not constant hate to everyone who didn‚Äôt play lmao.
---
Dont forget only race with properly synchronised dances! Slap that ass

Hahaha, it's Dave Chappelle making fun of R. Kelley.
---
Sure, so Private Servers are 'more' authentic right now than the actual beta. So what? It's day two of a 3 month long beta. Clearly they knew it has SO MANY holes that need fixed. Give it a little time and let's see how much they fix. By the end of the beta I'm sure they will have fixed a ton of the crap that was borked during the ported setup.
---
My point is, you're complaining about toxicity in a toxic way.
---
You type at 279 words per minute? Very impressive. That's about 30% faster than the previous world record holder. I'll call Guiness up right away.
---
Hey, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into, don‚Äôt let anyone stop you
---
Because there's thousands of these old functions. Each one may or may not contain bugs/exploits. Bugs and exploits that many people know about, and are public knowledge.
---
All of those bugs were fixed... and the fixes are the new "live" functions.
---
They have 15+ years of bug fixes and optimizations in those new functions. Also, not to mention that the old functions have 0 functionality with their current server infrastructure. IIRC, there servers are cloud based. So if you have code that isn't compatible with that, you're going to run into huge issues.
---
The Resurrection Sickness is pure coincidence. Paladins are just that bad. ;)
---
^^^^^^^/s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Focus was originally available in vanilla from an add-on, I used to use it, it might have even been part of CT mod
---
They used 1.12 data for the demo as well but many items had strictly incorrect values there. Of course there can be incorrect values.
---
You just hate that you can't do the same
---
People are salty that they aren't in beta. Streamers put out lots of content. Some content is stupid, so people who are salty use that stupid content as internal justification for why they should have been chosen instead, and they react accordingly.
---
I think you‚Äôre used to people calling the game easy and it makes you mad or something. Reread what I said and you‚Äôll see the word easy isn‚Äôt even in it. I said the ‚Äúthe game changed in almost all bad ways‚Äù you also brought raiding into the picture and never once did I say the raid content was the bad part. I‚Äôd actually argue the raids are the only piece of good content in the game? What
---
So Azeroth Autopilot for Classic?
---
Oblivion had mob/level scaling though?
---
I noticed this too. Never had a problem with this sub before but it seems people are getting way to defensive and protective of classic. It‚Äôs like dealing with the jealous ex boyfriend or a guy who has been friend zoned by a girl he likes.
---
It's me
---
show me on the doll where the streamer touched you
---
Bro I made a post asking what irl obligations will detract from you playing WoW, a bunch of people responded well to it and I think it's currently sitting at 33% lol
---
Then a post asking if a dude should paly a Paladin is at I think 95%?
---
This entire sub is  ridiculous.
---
Nope. I type 189 words per minute. Feel free to join the 10 fast fingers associated discords and we'll all say hi to you! As I said, maybe over, maybe under. Wasn't sure!
---
Fucking idiot
---
Imagine being this petty ***IN A BETA...***
---
Waht if I generate code and prank pepol hahahah xDDD they would think it real and be sad hahah but I have beta xDDD - Tips
---
I distinctly remember having focus in vanilla in some way, since i was resident banisher on Geddon during noob-progression through MC.      
---
Maybe not a focus frame but at the very least, the possibility of /tarfocus
---
Right with you there. I cant imagine playing MMO with people here lul
---
I'm annoyed at seeing the same post every single day of some random dude dramatically begging everyone to be a casual. We've all seen this post 100 times by now it adds nothing to the conversation and people won't change their plans because you told them to. Some people will speedrun, some people won't, just fucking play the game and shut up about it.
---
So  there's a chance?
---
This sub is a lost cause Esfand. Their massive hate boner for streamers ain't going away anytime soon I fear.
---
&gt; Yes, but it‚Äôs not constant hate to everyone who didn‚Äôt play lmao.
---
No, but it's constant hate towards people who want to play.
---
It was never sold on and had been inactive since 2007.
---
Cool dude see you at Launch
---
Again, fuck streamers.
---
But will Ony deep breath more is the real question
---
so is paladins only bad to level or is it bad overall?
---
&gt;Need I go on, pleb?
---
Sure. I barely know anything about PvP, so can probably learn something.
---
Dude, ignore this subreddit. Literally all these goons have been doing the past few days after the beta was announced is shitting on streamers/content creators.
---
in my experience it‚Äôs never been ‚Äûmeme specs‚Äú slowing down progress but bad or lazy players.
---
Retail babies vs private server babies
---
Fair enough if you think that. But a post on a sub-reddit about the state of the sub-reddit doesn't seem toxic to me. Was simply pointing out why this is potentially bad and dangerous for the sub-reddit and the community of the game moving forward.
---
You're getting it wrong. By coincidence, I've just created a thread where I describe how to get AQ mount. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq2jko/who_gets_the_legendary_mount/ 
---
You can Google "scepter of the shifting sands" for the details too.
---
TL;DR: you're not getting it unfortunately.
---
Go fuck yourself.
---
I mean, I'm not the one getting defensive, but alright!
---
if you didn‚Äôt have an active account in 1.12 don‚Äôt expect to get in. you might get in on stress test days but other than than you‚Äôre not getting in
---
Would rather post before all the autists start collecting video evidence. I have other shit to do than find a video of a lvl 20 elite doing more damage than westfall mobs, if you need video evidence to prove that's not correct that's on you.
---
The title of my post wasn't "I have no life and have compiled direct video comparisons for everything that is clearly wrong to shut up the blond fanatics", it was "hot take"
---
EPL almost dying to an abomination then smoking his ass anyways
---
Seems like no one of y‚Äôall have watched the actual stream and are taking this clip out of context. They were goofing around the whole time and when esfand first wanted to loot the chest he was like ‚Äúoh wait. I love no you can bop people when they‚Äôre looting a chest‚Äù and then did it. There was no bad intentions behind it and it was just for the laughs. It was only later that asmongold found out about it .. it‚Äôs easy to y‚Äôall this streamers bad. But maybe don‚Äôt take everything out of context
---
They absolutely did. In fact, literally the first blue post was about how they had to normalize data. 
---
Old row: spell name, spell effect 1, spell effect 2, spell effect 3
---
The new format is: spell name, foreign key(s) to spell effects
---
with a separate spell effects table.
---
It's a game they've already made though! Just re-up the old files. Just host the Nost files on a Blizz server. Done. Easy.
---
Thought they gave out new keys automated by a system
---
BIG BOIS GOT BIG REACH

Person A is obviously lying.
---
Person B says "Person A is lying, I tend to believe he's dishonest"
---
Person C to Person B "put the fin foil hat away"

Are you actually serious?
---
Nah we just need to fill it with people that don't have smooth brains.
---
Oh fuck forgot how hilarious their dialog is.
---
I'm torn between gnome and undead as a race.
---
Get an addon like Mobinfo. It can track the average value of vendor trash from a mob. Go out and find mobs that drop close to 30S in vendor trash. Kill them while you level up for total profit.
---
What a god damn legend!!!
---
Sorry for the misunderstanding
---
My comment was referring your use of ‚Äúwhat we you want, when you want it.‚Äù As a cheapening of the competitive mythic/pvp scene.
---
Sorry for the confusion, I think we both agree that end game is the only good part of BFA.
---
Source?
---
LUL at all the salty guys here in the comments.
---
If someone wants to ninja they are free to do so. That's the beautiful thing about classic.
---
We all agree retail is shit. Classic will get more numbers for a while, they will male a ton of cash. Classic is what people want and we are finally getting it!
---
I'm legitimately looking forward to posts claiming the deep breath mechanic is implemented wrong and using nost footage as proof despite the nost devs being explicitly told by Ian they implemented it wrong when he asked how they did it.
---
I played on 2 PvP servers as you couldn't create horde and alliance on the same servers and on both trade was used for groups LFG was a dead server. Considering in retail it's still the same way I imagine Classic will also be using a lot of trade for groups. RP servers have their own set of rules so that makes sense. Cheers man!
---
(Whats layering?)
---
I haven't saw a post on the front page of it/actively supported by the sub-reddit active users that is hate towards the classic players.
---
Looks like one of those washed up drunks who hangs outside 7-11 to buy highschool kids beer and weed in order to party with them.
---
He said "That was a good roll" as in "that chest RNG was a good roll" because a blue dropped... 
---
Why are people in this thread bitching when they weren't there to see the stream?
---
Any proof of this?
---
If you think it is toxic now, wait until AQ opens and a big streamer uses their audience to snag the battle tank. you are going to get literal pitchforks then.
---
Imagine lying to make people think you are an even bigger asshole than they already think you are.
---
Tortured by not being able to play a game I played 15 years ago and have played in private servers since then.
---
Let's not act as if this is a new expansion with new content or anything.
---
Hi, /u/RainBugSix
---
You can also catch the turtle polymorph book from a lake in ZG instance  if i remember.
---
Innit. Guild discord gonna be constant twitch clips raging about Asmongold strafing left instead of right and why that shouldn't be allowed in the beta club cos of it.
---
I am sorry to inform you but people have right to their own opinions, even if they are not same as yours or don't make sense to you. You will learn that when you grow older. People being negative against something doesn't mean it is always toxic. Many people seem to mix up toxicity with just different opinion. Sure there is toxicity here but it is everywhere in internet.
---
if you want even a chans for AoE grinding you need a mage buddy for the duo aoe grind spots early on inorder to get ahead of the curve.
---
I sold my car. Went round to the guys house and it'd just been sitting there in his driveway! Never even used it!
---
Took it home with me.
---
Ite fam.
---
You sold it to someone. It became theirs. You stole it back. What if they see classic coming out and get hyped and go to renew their account only to find you decided to take it back?
---
This is the exact reason I never bought an account. Can never tell when the original owner decides to be a dick later on.
---
And yes, I've sold accounts in games before, so it's not a matter of principle or something.
---
&gt; they found a way to do it in a way that *they* wanted to do.
---
Exactly
---
I think of this after I read OP: https://i.imgflip.com/nn7jo.jpg?a432744
---
ITS A BETA
---
I see. Is it something you would like to see return classic or do you think the game is better/just as good without it?
---
This so much. I'm definitely in the camp that thinks Classic is strictly superior to the last 4-5 expansions, but changes and additions to the game is hardly inherently bad. 
---
I dearly hope Classic will cause a ripple-effect onto Retail so that we get to enjoy the best of both worlds.
---
i‚Äôm personally okay with it for a week or two but after that it should go away. i‚Äôm okay with it at the start because if not there‚Äôs going to literally be 100,000 people in the human starting zone on day one trying to kill wolves. it won‚Äôt be good for the game
---
Thanks for the irony.
---
&gt; But a post on a sub-reddit about the state of the sub-reddit doesn't seem toxic to me
---
Accusing people of acting like children doesn't seem toxic to you?
---
I guess you're just another example of a toxic person completely oblivious to his own actions accusing others of being toxic.
---
If you come for the Lich King, you best not miss.
---
&gt; Its astonishingly obvious that if you're willing to do it in beta, than you're willing to do it in launch.
---
Is it really, though?
---
Your crying over an item that literally won't even exist in 3 months and the fact that it didn't happen to you and the person it did happen to didn't react it proves your just trying to get some clout for starting shit towards 2 streamers who are actively helping others and don't make petty threads about other players.
---
No, i sold it to a chinese farming company, it then got banned and sat inactive for 12 years. i dont think they were missing it.
---
I'm not saying it's not OK for you to get emotional, knock yourself out.
---
This sub is significantly more nice during quiet periods. It‚Äôs a community that was used to getting no news for months or years at a time, and suddenly it feels like everything is happening at once. That stirs up conflict. The way the beta just got dropped on us has made a lot of people jealous and pissy about the streamers getting in.
---
Don‚Äôt let it put you off the game. The incentives to be nice while whining on Reddit are low. The incentives to be nice ingame - so people invite you to groups to get loot etc - is high.
---
Esfand trying to defend it by saying they‚Äôd give it away or something. That‚Äôs just not your choice to make. Roll on it. 
---
And Did asmon actually equip this thing? If ‚Äúthere are better things to use at higher level‚Äù then why does a 25 warrior need it? Lol
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why people keep pitching things that simply weren‚Äôt in classic. Class changes and the like. That is completely against the point isn‚Äôt it?
---
This is the kid who's going to report people killing him in world pvp.
---
That part would be fine, but "request to join" completely changes the dynamic.
---
\&gt; but he's level 30 and the cloak is level 19 which is probably why he didn't push for it
---
Yet you sent it to Asmon and he started wearing it, saying it was best in slot. Hmmmm.
---
You haven't been reading the posts on classic then.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bok0d2/wow_classic_082719
---
This is the top post for the week on the sub, filled with people insulting people who want to play classic.
---
I'm sceptical for myself.
---
I'm afraid that me playing classic again will kill the nostalgia i have.
---
I don't think it will capture the same magic that it had, for me.
---
And i'm a little scared the over the top min-maxing that is going on these days will make people absolutley go bonkers when trying to do the longer, somewhat harder instances that is in vanilla.
---
&gt;Isn't it better to just bait their interrupt?
---
Baiting isn't a fool-proof strategy. It's happened countless of times that I try to bait an enemy interrupt 2-3x and have them not interrupt me at all. I then do a full cast and they still don't interrupt. Or I just start re-casting after a bait attempt and then they interrupt at 0.01s because their reaction speed was so slow that they were trying to interrupt my cancelled spell still. There's also the matter of simply when to cancel. Is your enemy gonna try to interrupt at 0.5s? At 1s? At 2s?
---
In the end it's a perfectly valid strategy to purposely let yourself get interrupted on a school that you're not as bothered about. If he interrupts you, that's fine because you didn't care anyway. If he doesn't, that's also fine because you just got off a big spell. One thing is for sure, and that's that you're not wasting time by cancelling spells only to not get an interrupt tossed your way anyway.
---
There have been many people who never played Vanilla WoW that got invited.
---
This subreddit is driving itself insane thinking it's anything but RNG. Unless you are on F&amp;F or a streamer that Blizzard flagged manually, IT'S RANDOM.
---
You never encountered a beast master hunter in vanilla, Bestial Wrath made the hunters pet immune to most crowed control (you could snare it) and upped its damage by 50% now pair this how the original pet A.I. would stick it‚Äôs assigned target like glue and you were in for a rough time as a rogue since it would simply knock you right out of stealth after vanishing. 
---
The problem was, while being amazing in PvP, BM was utterly useless for PvE as pets would stand in front of mobs rather than behind as so would like die and no one healed pets. Anyway back on track, as a rogue your only goal when targeting a hunter was to kill it before the pet killed you.
---
Classic WoW Community and hating streamers, name a better duo LULW
---
you're such a beta pussy male LUL
---
Wal-Mart is a not a decent employer on even a base level.
---
Pretty much. For some people it boils down to "I deserve this, he doesn't, I was robbed of my beta access". Its just a really sad mindset.
---
&gt; stuff like force quit run through keyed doors
---
Lol I forgot all about that. Nobody had the ubrs key üòÇ
---
It's a beta..?
---
Put your hand up if you got 2 followers on twitch before realizing the dream was dead.
---
I'm sorry am I the 20 year old baby who just made a post about how a forum is toxic? Nah that's you kiddo. Enjoy the ride.
---
If you love something you'll always find time.
---
so many losers in this thread
---
"beta test" :D
---
Just think of it this way. If you like to group up and play support in pvp/pve then its a amazingly fun class as you make others unstoppable. If you like to solo pve/pvp or want to be the star with the highest dps or heals then it will be a terrible class to level and be 60 with.
---
While this is true, at the same time - it's not so wrong. The content creators of retail use retail as a way to get their bills paid and make money for their living. If they feel the natural progression is less money on their current status and more money in a different part of WoW, they have the right to try their best to make entertaining content on classic. Long as it's entertaining to a large audience - who am I to judge? 
---
The retail players who think the game is broken is funny, but at the same time, it's a good sense of feedback too. Blizzard will see how non-vanilla players play out in classic and see how the direction of classic needs to be taken to break into a new audience just as much as the old one. Such as the guy who reported the boots for no stats - it allows them to ensure that players know no-stats is not a bug and infact a common thing in vanilla. There's no need to hate on the guy that did it, just let him know it's a vanilla trait. I love seeing and witnessing the differences between retail and classic - it's great.
---
People who unbind s (back) probably don't play tanks. 
---
You kinda need to kite backwards for certain M+ affix (like this week's sanguin)
---
If you turn spin around and walk, your back is towards them and you can't parry/block/dodge.
---
paladins are good healer just really boring. you have really high efficency on your heals with insane buffs. but you only have two heals a slow cast or a fast cast one then picking the rank you want to use. there are no proccs there are no CDs those are the two things you have.
---
also you have no plate gear to wear so you will be wearing a dress since it is the best for you.
---
I obviously REALLY want to get in. But within time we will all be able to play.
---
So.... can we make shirts about this legend?
---
clown
---
There‚Äôs a magical thing called ‚ÄúBatching‚Äù where a process is done at an appointed time that you set up beforehand. It is extremely common
---
This Hunter should stick to retail, he's such a sperg.
---
It's probably just him getting some good damage rolls in a row after getting an upgrade and mistakenly attributing it to his +int, but it could be that he worded what he meant horribly. I mean, 6 int and 3 stamina is gonna impacts combat a huge amount &lt;lvl20, but it definitely doesn't make his spells hit harder lmao.
---
Stfu it's a beta. If you actually complain about this in a beta, you ARE a beta
---
Its a cloak in beta, are people seriously pushingh it
---
mm lets compare a bug report in a beta to punching a person irl.
---
Good comparison. I completely agree man Quin TRULY violated the beta here. I cannot fathom what Blizzard are thinking allowing a hugely popular twitch streamer into the beta that's solely meant for testing purposes. And he utterly BETRAYS their trust by submitting a troll bug report. Now Blizzard will NEVER get the time to fix the real bugs and classic will be RUINED. GG Blizz THANKS
---
oh, and /s
---
https://youtu.be/J6oTIjvw_-8
---
Hoes Mad.
---
You will be able to experience everything even if you start a bit late and play very casually.
---
Exceptions: legendary gear/mount, high rank gear (can actually be possible when you server dies), server firsts.
---
lmao, it's going to be fun to see all the crying about ninja looting when it goes live
---
Welcome to classic!
---
While there is hate comments in there - the actual post is 20k upvotes. Shows a lot of anticipation and excitement for classic. The people in the comments are hating on it, but they aren't starting threads to spark the hate - it's simple comments which I can collapse. I don't enjoy seeing hate on a front page where I can't exactly collapse it instantly or I've got to keep scrolling to find actual informative threads and good discussions.
---
T-T and I as an actual QA tester and classic player didn't get in, this world...of warcraft
---
This isn't a class change at all? It's a core game function?
---
Psure this was in vanilla in the form of an addon too...
---
They're the guild leaders? It's classic wow man, the guild leaders make the rules!
---
Also, who really cares? Ninja looting is part of vanilla and hilarious because it doesn't happen that often. This wasn't even ninja looting.
---
Yup the game's done for.
---
This will sound crazy to many, but I don't think the graphics are better.
---
I ain't 20, as the post says! :) I'm not the guy who commented on a post about how a forum is showing toxic traits to leave a lame joke! :)
---
The skinny guy and the beard guy.
---
Classic classic community
---
And a temperature to stay away from!
---
Ok, so he was wrong about one thing in a ten minute video. And only sort of. Your spells don‚Äôt hit harder, but he‚Äôs still right that you feel your character get stronger and it‚Äôs far more noticeable. You guys are so anti and so cynical. Like, zero chill.
---
Never played wow, watching these streams really makes me want to play, i played during cata but ive never been so hyped and excited for an mmo release until these streams since i had no clue on what it was like. The exposure really helps people like me who never had that chance when we were young to play since I was only 6/7 years old when it was out. I genuinely think classic wow might be bigger than it was when it first was released.
---
You must be shaking with anger PepeLaugh Also, its fucking BETA LULW
---
Would never want to. Total waste of life.
---
quin is a serious legit actual retarded person. he plays poe too and all of his rip clips are just him screeching uncontrollably.
---
I'll translate the OP's issue:
---
"I watched a twitch clip of a SINGLE mob phasing when the player crossed into another zone. Now, all the other mobs in the area were fine but this ONE mob just so happened to move past his geofence and phased. Therefore, I'm calling this sharding and will make a 'Sky Is Falling' thread on Reddit even though this has been a bug on SOME mobs and was even a bug in Vanilla."
---
SkY is FAlLiNG GuISe!!1!
---
its not
---
I mean it‚Äôs pretty easy to see how miserable people like Alexsensual and other similar posters here are... it‚Äôs very similar to the intel/alt-right troll‚Äôs here on Reddit just spreading hate, prejudice and negativity.
---
If you think it‚Äôs healthy to carry around such vitriol about a video game I just flatly disagree and would be intersected in why you think it‚Äôs a good thing to participate in and how it benefits you?
---
Asmongold also gifted 100 subs to his community. What an asshole!
---
This is different than TLPs though.  It's more like DBG deciding to do an official P99, which has shown a longevity that no TLP has come close to.
---
theyre literally mad they didnt get beta. you guys are doing great work for the wow community keep it up
---
Ya that's kind of shitty. Also looks like people did not want to call it out and say he lost why just give it to him? Oh ya, because he is a streamer.
---
QuinOMEGALULshit9
---
Tons of people who didnt play till cata have gotten in.  Out of my group of 15 friends who have been playing together since release day 0 have gotten in.
---
Dude, it's a Beta. Hunter is level 30. 
---
Your narrative is weak as fuck, hating for sake of hating.
---
I am interested in learning the 10 finger system. Is there anything you can recommend?
---
&gt; but fuck me
---
I‚Äôll pass
---
Yep yep, gonna need to dig out some old playlists to complete the feeling. So much Kaizers Orchestra.
---
Perplexity clip shows even more than that. Not entirely answers you question.
---
Yeah, what a fucking tool
---
Im gonna stop checking this sub until beta is over
---
It was confirmed by the support staff that it was banned for suspicious activity in 2007. I'm not going to lose sleep at night for recovering something that sat inactive for 12 years from a shady company that is definitely not in business anymore. Sorry for offending the moral police.
---
If he is doing it in the beta I bet he does it on live. Just watch.
---
Nothing toxic about trying to make WoW Classic as best as it can be, kid.
---
You are wrong.  Many who didnt start till cata+ are in
---
What if he wanted to give it to a twink.  Why are your wants more important than his?
---
Ok but what BS? I think there‚Äôs some assumptions going on. All I said is I don‚Äôt know who he is talking about. Then he said a PVP player. Then I said I don‚Äôt pvp so I wouldn‚Äôt know who it is. What BS are you talking about?
---
Streamers (influencers) are cancer to gaming
---
When I wasn‚Äôt in the beta I enjoyed watching to see what was what.
---
Woo woooooooo!
---
TBH I don't give a shit, he's just trying to misrepresent the situation to slant it in his favor which is distasteful to me.
---
Like Asmond just said on stream, it has nothing to do with being a streamer, it has everything to do with being an asshole.
---
I see where you are coming from, but I just think that the focus functionality is a "special case" because it was actually possible to mimic it back then. And now, so far, two people in this thread has stated that they remember using some sort of focus back in the day which I think is interesting. I know there are both pros and cons for having focus but in my opinion its not something that ruins the vanilla experience (at least not for me).  
---
The reason I wrote this post was just to hear other peoples opinions because maybe they have thought of something that I havent.
---
i agree 100 % WoD/Early Legion Asmon FeelsBadMan
---
‚ÄúWhat you want when you want it‚Äù was mostly referring to Heirlooms/experience buffs that completely ruin the leveling process. Also just sitting in cities deciding you want to raid or dungeon so you click a button and it‚Äôs yours. No need to apologize mate. Give classic a shot if you get bored üôåüèΩ
---
But based on what? Your feeling? (not trying to flame)
---
&gt;But I'm not willing to drop $15 for a chance to Beta test a fifteen year old game.
---
Smart. Lots of people do the opposite, they throw their money right at Blizzard and sub right now hoping they get a chance to play the Beta.
---
&gt; Imagine lying to make people think you are an even bigger ______ than they already think you are.
---
Twitch in a nutshell if it‚Äôs not pure gameplay stream
---
Thing is, no one is flaming streamers 'for no reason at all'. We have very good reasons. These people are allowed into a beta test because they're 'personalities' and think they 'represent the vanilla community' that has been fighting for this game for a long time. Then they go and submit troll reports, lie about if they even actually played vanilla, etc. They're representing us and they're god damn retards.
---
Don't play the game and leave the sub then, nobody wants to read about you throwing a tantrum.
---
I read this as ‚Äùseveral of my friends got stabbed just for the beta‚Äù
---
Someones job at Blizz is to only find ways to wring more money out of Classic, I guarantee it.
---
I think and hope it's simply not fixed yet. Hope they disable sharding for good and layering ASAP after launch.
---
dualspec imo
---
I'll look into it. The red line isn't appropriate for many of the horde zones either since they are very orange-ish. Thanks!

Its not going big, its nostalgia and hype of the first months. Classic will die fairly fast because of all the elitist base dwellers denying the need for updated graphics and environments. Classic made classic because of immersion. Its ugly graphics will kill it in combination with the annoyances that are not fixed.
---
In all honesty, there isn't. I learned to type quickly due to flash chat-room games and just managed to pick myself up from there. Learned about 10 fast fingers and other typing websites where you just get a score for typing so many words at certain speeds and just naturally began to use all my fingers. Been typing w/ all 10 since I was 11 years old and managing 140 wpm+ since then! I've definitely got a bit slower the past 12 months due to stopping, so constant typing is really just the key imo and learning the keyboard properly. I can recite key locations super easy and fast. I want to learn DVORAK just so I can say I know how to use a DVORAK keyboard too! x)
---
I felt the same way, but then I honestly sat back and realized, is that what made classic fun for the majority of the fan base? I don't think so. Sure, the top players will push end game content and world firsts, but for the rest of us that in no way means that we can't group up and guild up with our friends and clear content while having a blast. The best part of classic to me was seeing my character get stronger every bit of the way. That combined with the thought that there is actually going to be a community again makes it worth it in my opinion.

---
You feel the need to defend streamers who are falsely claiming things and leading people astray. This negatively impacts the community as a whole. Stop being an idiot and realize calling out people is better as a whole especially when they are wrong. We waited years for this, not going to have crap streamers ruin the experince. Go donate more of your parents money and sit there and think about what you've done zoomie.
---
i was actually a balance druid main in cata - wod, playing mostly high rank pvp, however as far as i know balance druid sucks dick in classic, so my next best class was hpally, but now im kinda scared.
---
Should have aimed for the head.
---
Venruki was in my guild back in Vanilla.
---
Changing a classes resource system isn‚Äôt a class change?
---
And the fact you can find hateful comments with the extreme degree of over moderation that is going on in there doesn't tell you something about the amount of hate that's actually going on?
---
I mean you can't switch gear in retail in combat, only weapon... so he's just an idiot
---
&gt;actual history
---
&gt;hamstringing slime monsters
---
hrmm
---
Some of these are good reasons - but they're not the flame them? People like Shroud, Soda etc. have played since early days of WoW and manage to respect that. I don't see most of them saying they represent the vanilla community - they're just enjoying their time on the game. Troll reports are a bit out of order - but they're troll reports and the situation will easily be diagnosed as a troll. Just because they don't use their platform either, doesn't mean they haven't been fighting for this. I know Shroud was definitely an active private servers player (he was caught with it open a few times accidentally too aha).
---
A lot of people didn‚Äôt want to do private because they‚Äôd get banned for streaming it... he‚Äôs a streamer. Plus the moral objection some have. You guys are so ridiculous. ‚Äú
---
How dare he like classic after playing the beta for 12 hours today!!!!‚Äù It‚Äôs never too late to come to the light side, quit gatekeeping.
---
What do you mean by that? I haven't played runescape in probably 14 years
---
Ehh calling out asshole streamers means you are an asshole to their fansbois, I get it...
---
Corrupted Ashbringer
---
&gt;  that's just 1-30, arguably 5-10% of the game.
---
You realize that fixing something in the 1-30 range automatically fixes that same issue in the rest of the game right?
---
Lets say, hypothetically, a bear is doing the wrong amount of damage in Darkshore.
---
This means the damage scaling for bears throughout the game is wrong, which obviously is a bad thing, however it also means that fixing the bear's damage scaling fixes the damage scaling of every single bear in the game.
---
Now replace bear for Furbolg, cat, centaur, whatever you want and replace damage with hp, armor, attack speed or, again, whatever you want and realize that many of the issues you're claiming exist are easy to fix.
---
2004 vs 2019
---
Technology
---
Draw your own conclusions from there. This shit ain't hard.
---
Make gnome /train is amazing
---
Uhh well it makes sense that people don't want retail babies coming in and ruininf the game _again_ when they finally got the game they want to play back for the first time in 15 years
---
It's never going to be the same for people who've played it, but it will be be for you. Don't expect that amazing sense of community because this game in general is a husk of its former self.
---
They are literally going to milk this game until there's nothing left, just imagine playing a game for every expansion and then having the same game re-released because people are so fed up with the current game.
---
Classic was fun because it was new and we were all new to it, more of an even playing field and learning together, about it.
---
Atiesh be the guardian himself !
---
Your sad haha...Look how horrible your life is that your salty this early in the morning ! You know it when they say ‚Äúkiddo ‚Äú in a condescending way LOL
---
Kappa
---
So laughable how many people are crying about this. Sums up Reddit and it's pitchfork mentality sadly.
---
And how would that even matter? You can't play characters for Classic, only for retail, which have 0 value unless they are some crazy shit with oldschool Tier 3, removed items etc.
---
remember this ? [https://youtu.be/1eTodlMSpXg?t=167](https://youtu.be/1eTodlMSpXg?t=167)
---
I don't think it supports the argument you made of going over to /r/wow and checking them for toxicity too. When in reality, it was comments regarding a classic announcement with the majority of it being support and excitement. Where-as there's literal front page topics on here that have been dedicated to hating on stuff.
---
This mean all those people deleted they old char ?
---
And i don't see (or at least haven't seen) them getting flamed. its the people that deserve to get flamed that are getting flamed. and whether they say it or not, if they're streaming the game to people who don't play it or people who are checking it out, they are representing our community.
---
He's talking about focus target. Not Focus as a resource.
---
Did you actually read through his post?
---
It's not about actually being the problem, it's about other raiders seeing you as the problem and getting burned out. 40 personalities is a lot to manage. 
---
Also having 8 shadow priests is literally useless and an active detriment to any raid thanks to debuff limits.
---
they setup free for all, and everyone in the party knew that
---
Chugga chugga chugga chugga!
---
What a naab... First he was against classic and now he is playing it.
---
&gt; first bug submitted boys
---
Definitely wrong though.
---
&lt;3 Omar
---
Thanks! It's on the list of things todo.
---
It‚Äôs almost like pservers made things up
---
I think a lot of people forget that the devs and creative team behind classic either worked on it back then or got involved with Blizzard because classic made them want to work there.
---
Their interest in making Classic WoW as good of a product as it can be is quite evident. They're making concessions and  even change their plans when they receive valid feedback from the team.
---
 It's the first time in years that we see Blizz focus on their older customers instead of their newer ones so we should at least be happy for that even if we don't agree with some of things they implement.
---
How would they know this is how he'd act? How do you know they wont revoke his beta access if he just wastes their time? This sub gets their pitchforks out way too easy.
---
To be expected.. A bunch of Vanilla players are being forced to watch as retail babies stream to cash in while they have to sit with their thumb up their butt for 3 months
---
That doesn‚Äôt help people who don‚Äôt follow streamers. I just want to know which realms to avoid.
---
Glad to hear :)
---
It‚Äôs not out yet.
---
Drops will come. Almost all rare mobs have an increased chance of a random green, very few have unique drops. But, I do plan on displaying that information.
---
You attacked him thinking it was just another retail player talking about something he doesn't know, when you realised you were wrong, you backpedaled and didn't assume anything you said and now try to spin it in a different way, just assume you screwed up and were a judgemental prick.
---
Did Swifty get dumber or did everyone else just get smarter?
---
There are a section of people here who are completly retarded. They are bitter people who most likely feel bad with their own life, and therefor turns salty and toxic to everyone and everything that has sucsess. They are morons, and I really don't think they are the majority of people in this subreddit. I hope so atleast.
---
The only thing we can really do, is tell them how toxic they are and spend our time spreading positivity instead.
---
The hype is real! =)
---
You might find your experience less salty if you get off the streamers nuts. ;)
---
See you in game.
---
Hey moron, there's more places on earth than just the states.
---
It‚Äôs in closed beta until 27.8.
---
So much this.
---
At this point all I can see here is a bunch of elitist gatekeepers who can't allow others to have fun with *their* game. Honestly, I would much rather have classic content in r/wow while this sub left for elitist assholes
---
This is just the age we live in now. People feel like the need to complain about stuff on the internet to give their meaningless life some excitement.
---
The beta is there to find and submit actual bugs, not for streamers to make stupid reports to please their audience.
---
You're proving his point. It's hillarious.
---
gatekeeping retards
---
That's interesting. I know there are several vanilla addons that provides focus in one form or another. The addon that I linked to in my post is one of the newer focus addons made for vanilla pservers.
---
Downvoted for asking for a source? Okay then. Logic isn't a source, but whatever you say.
---
the % authenticity of private servers has remained static. they hit a point of good enough along time ago, and its def good however blizzard has a 100% reference 1.12 client running to make comparison. 
---
they will iterate until its 100% perfect. As someone who bought Starcraft remastered they keep releasing patch's until it was 100% authentic (i.e fixing muta micro even though it was only a tiny bit different from original SC.BW).
---
I feel the butthurt flowing through you
---
Oh snap, he used the ‚Äòkiddo‚Äô word on the internet! Must mean he is a total badass !
---
I don't think that's true at all. They're representing their own brand. People aren't watching them because they want to watch a classic/vanilla player play the game. They're watching them because they want to see their personality play the game. They're representing themselves and their own brand of entertainment, not you or anyone else.
---
I mean, chests in dungeons have always been a /roll thing not a first person to open it gets it thing in my experience back in vanilla and on psevers. Always. The people that don‚Äôt follow that are either just assholes or genuinely new players that just didn‚Äôt know... but you‚Äôd think some of if not the biggest streamers in classic would know that, so that just leaves one option. The best part of vanilla was the community aspect and ignoring basic common decency and group protocols like rolling is pretty ridiculous for someone so massive in the community.
---
Then again, rules/common decency don‚Äôt really seem to matter anyway. Literally #MAGA.
---
The word ‚ÄúJoke‚Äù, also known as:
---
‚ÄúContent creators‚Äù
---
‚ÄúStreamers‚Äù
---
‚ÄúInfluencers‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs just the effect Blizzard games have on Reddit. Source: I used to post on /r/hearthstone
---
PTO 2 weeks, Reason: Vacation
---
Boss: Where you going bro ?
---
Me: Home
---
well your logic has been proven wrong because there are people with accounts created this month that have gotten in
---
You don't need to go to battle.net anymore, the restore button is the button next to create new character
---
&gt; then later realizing it's actually better.
---
That depends on what you want from the game.
---
Let's say you're a mythic raider on retail and play the game primarily for those. Chances are high (not guaranteed) that you will be bored of the end game in Classic, since the raids themselves have bosses that are somtetimes easier than BFA dungeon bosses.
---
People currently are leveling. You will use quite a lot of the tool kit and rediscover the old game, and that is good. But reality will soon hit at endgame and outside of PvP most classes boil down to using a single spell outside of utility (warlocks spam SB and keep their curse up, mages spam frost bolt/fireball etc.).
---
You press fewer abilities in Vanilla than you do in BFA **in PVE**.
---
Now, I think Classic is a bit better than BFA.
---
Oh weird, because I see some youtubers livestreaming it, guess that means I missed to opt in to beta damn.
---
Is this the same guy with boars to max level?
---
&gt; Be more receptive and welcoming. 
---
Their are big and concerning grievances the community has with the creators, belittling the people who have a problem does nothing.
---
Nope definitely vanilla but only in trade chat. Linking skills came later
---
Fingers crossed - I really hope Mr. Birmingham and Mr. Gonzalez will look into this.
---
Back at ya.
---
Hey Esfand mind explaining how on LB in 2018 you were one of the first people to get 5/5 AQ set in your guild despite being a pala? You wouldn't have loot counciled it to yourself would you? Or loot council probably just looked right over main tank and said "oh Esfand needs his full set ASAP"?
---
"I have already done sex, why am I doing it again?"
---
Because it's fun more than just once...
---
Sadly, moreso than ever, this game is like speeding from a light that just turned green to a light that just turned red and repeating. People are getting hyped to play a game that was new 15 years ago, and it's not a remaster or anything.
---
Blizzard milking at its finest, and that sense of community that made classic what it was will not be there, I wish it was.
---
Its just someone talking about how they enjoy a video game on the internet, its ganna be ok
---
I'll try my best.
---
I appreciate him doing this and going back after trying it. I didn't know he was one of the anti-classic people until now but it's cool that he admitted he was wrong.   
---
Waiting for Towelliee now. Every single time I tuned into his stream every few months over the years he's been complaining about classic, saying it's not gonna happen, rose tinted goggles etc.
---
Sounds like Asmongold and Esfand
---
Focus should sort of work for 1.13 aswell, you can have an addon **automatically** create macros for you like:
---
    /targetexact playername
---
    /cast spell
---
    /targetlasttarget
---
whenever you hit a given keybinding. Tracking casts, auras, hp, etc is just reading from the combat log/nameplates and shouldn't be an issue to add. (see BattlegroundTargets, works the same). The only downside is that addons can't create macros in combat so you have to set focus out of combat first, but I think there's a way to bypass this by pre-creating macros for nearby units in the background beforehand. Whether you like it or not, there is going to be some sort of Focus in Classic. Same with castbars and debuff timers.
---
Personally i'd like to see these features go away as they make the game feel more scripted in pvp.
---
:( sad days.
---
I can‚Äôt stand this shit either. I made a comment the other day that ‚Äúa lot of people in this community have matured worse than wow did in 15 years‚Äù and it‚Äôs true. People raging about others getting Beta because they ‚Äúprobably didn‚Äôt even play in classic.‚Äù Lmao like what... yeah but they want to play now and they‚Äôre advertising the game we all love. Patience is a virtue fellow nerds.
---
People were saying that tauren attack range on classic is far too long
---
People have said them all already but keep in mind a lot of these are consistent gold sinks. Every time you upgrade critical gear - you‚Äôll
---
want at least dozens of gold to enchant it. Every raid - you‚Äôll want consumables. Bills add up quickly, and wealth often equals power in vanilla. You‚Äôll need a plan for gold.
---
Thunderfury probs, it's literally an Elemental Lord's weapon, while Sulf is crafted by mortals (using the Eye of Rag if I'm not mistaken). 
---
Corrupted Ashbringer indeed too /u/Anilusion, given how it will change the world in WotLK. 
---
Atiesh ofc, the Guardian's weapon is no joke.
---
Lower-tier but still OP lore-wise would be Ironfoe.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it too much your chances were never that good to get a beta invite
---
I'm sure Blizzard totally appreciates troll reports from streamers who do it for content.
---
Uhhhhhh who? lol
---
Okiedokie.
---
Well just in case you didnt know there are no tests of any kind to worthy of invite. We get it you would be so much better as a tester....
---
You could prove to me Tipsout was secretly Nostradamus and would give me lottery numbers at midnight, yet I still wouldn't give that trashcan a single view.
---
&gt; Every subreddit on this website is toxic as hell
---
FTFY
---
You're assuming they're streamers by default, and not streaming because they're in Beta.
---
They can get easier to 300. At 16, where they start, they can learn 15s stuff but 1s stuff is still orange
---
Eww no. The expansions are what started the backward slide. Flying mounts killed player interaction and community. Arena split the pvp community. Both of those combined annihilated wpvp. Smaller raids forced guilds to cut half their friends. And there werent multiple raids you could PUG. Wrath introduced phasing which is terrible. And it also introduced the 3 worst pvp areas in SotA, IoC, and wintergrasp. One of which was so bad it was even removed from retail. Tbc and Wotlk also introduced daily grind busy work quests, where in vanilla you would go farm whatever item you needed, pvpd, or did dungeons.
---
If I decide to go for a sword it'll be that or Thunderfury!
---
I did, and somehow actually managed to think it was about Hunter focus the entire time, which is pretty impressive.
---
It just makes it easier for leveling up the professions
---
Try just not fucking posting??????
---
There actually was a prior agreement, it's just not in that clip, they said chests were first come first serve, that's literally how they have been the entire time they've been streaming classic, too.
---
That's not the actual client though, it's a rip that the community kind of hobbled together. Just watch some of the classic gameplay and already you're seeing people from private servers saying "Oh hey that didn't happen on the private server"
---
Hm, thanks anyways. It just never felt a natural urge to go from two to 10 fingers. I might check out some YT tutorials or something.
---
This has been confirmed as a bug in a [Blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/sharding-after-latest-server-restart/175660/88) and is being investigated.
---
What I find weird about this is that in the same spot along the Durotar river pservers had the same the exact same problem, in the exact same spot, because of exactly what op suggested.
---
You better save all your gold if your looking to get all your spells lol
---
Hmm that‚Äôs interesting. Thanks for the info.
---
What are you even talking about? I have made no posts spreading toxicity O.o
---
I'm merely informing how some people are acting, and a possible reason to why they are acting that way.
---
Why do you need Fire Res though, except for lolz?
---
Hmm full FR SL lock tanking Rag, must try... Although I think physical hits will oneshot quite quickly.
---
Yeah understandable. Check out 10 fast fingers and just do a few races a day.  It helps.
---
I hate to say atodaso BUT I FUCKIN ATODASO
---
Why even bring up /r/wow then ?
---
No no, I meant the positivity back at ya. It was a nice gesture and I was appreciating it! Sorry about the confusion.
---
You‚Äôre supposed to lose combo points if you switch targets.
---
I though it was the bigger guy with the beard, but not the pally the horde sellout
---
Yeah the streamers with over 30k viewers that did this, not the nobodies with 100- viewers.  
---
Just looking for reasons to be salty for no reason.
---
Wallpaper engine nice
---
The best way to introduce yourself to PvP is to... PvP. Duel whenever you can with people close to your level. Nothing beats practice (except huge differences in stats from gear :P).
---
I would say I'm above average when it comes to PvP, but nowhere near good enough, and I got there just through playing the game. You will eventually pick up on what needs to be done against which class (depending on your own).
---
Welcome to Classic wow. It's always been a toxic hole and it'll become one again. The good news is, people will have that reputation added to them in game and theylls suffer for it.
---
Just ignore it for now.
---
Why are you getting angry over the fact that people would like proof of your claims? You may very well be right, but your arguments are not very compelling as of now.  If you actually wanted to convince someone, there should be more than anecdotal data. And if you didn‚Äôt, why even bother making a post about it?
---
Yep mining too, that is why most guilds in MC have a set person who has +mining gear/racial to mine important nodes in MC
---
Hmm, yes, clearly an abusive person. Well done.
---
unless they close down the beta you will get in. the streams will get bored after a week at level 30
---
I still have an active WOW sub, but it feels like Christmas to me waiting on my beta invite, I started playing in December 04, I dont mind BFA, but not excited to play it like I am classic.
---
Silent was kind enough to point out I was completely wrong on what I thought you were talking about. I still think it is probably fine without it, but understand why it would be nice to have. I do use it often in retail, but I guess still just think it should presented with as few changes as possible is all.
---
I can‚Äôt help to find irony in advocating for maturity while also condoning ninja looting.
---
That's how you jump down from cliffs in WoW. If you go forward, you overjump 99% of the time.
---
Everyone has this train emote lol
---
Effectiviely there probably won't be a pure "streamer free" server, so it's choosing a lesser evil. Do you rather play on a big streamers server or accidentally end up on a small streamers tight knit server
---
I'm not saying there's no chance classic ends up going into the monetization shitter, I'm just saying that based on activision-blizzard's actions thus far, it seems that the "they're only doing it to make a quick buck" take is wrong. If you sort of try to predict what they'd do under that model, you come up with a bunch of stuff that they should be doing but aren't, and I think that's good evidence that it's not what they're up to.
---
7k viewers, it's obvious why he got beta access.
---
&gt; I know I'll get downvoted to hell, I'm posting this to point back to in 3 months to prove I called it right this early.
---
One is how you present yourself and the contributions you make to a worthwhile discussion on a discussion sub-section of a website, the other is a game mechanic that is very capable of doing so and in no way breaking any game rules.
---
Why even mention it yourself? Please stop grasping at straws and scrambling for relevance.
---
Yeah to both. Same patch as pally.
---
You have to keep in mind most classic fans (myself included) are older than most mainstream gamers... A lot of us don't like twitch culture. Now I agree that sometimes we throw far too much salt at streamers, but they do have a negative influence of server health and they do often employ tactics aimed souly at making money from young people.
---
Was hoping "Auto-attack on 1" would be the free center space.
---
I've only seen like, 3 clips of this guy, and I know I would never want to meet him in real life.
---
He's completely insufferable.
---
sassy?
---
there are people who created accounts after the announcement and got in. there are people who got in even tho they had inactive accounts. so no, you‚Äôre being sassy for no reason and also wrong
---
Thing is people imo are overestimating how much their communities will manage to help them, based on twich general metrics most of us are going to have 10-30 years on these kids, it doubtful many of them will even get to 60. Its not going to be like retail where a kid with a week sub can managed to get to cap lvl and give the streamer tons of free shit.
---
All those "this sub is toxic" are the worst...
---
All sub got good and bad side stop crying
---
You can still opt into the beta, your chances of getting an invite however are extremely small/nonexistent.
---
Just go here:
---
 https://us.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html
---
and opt into "World of Warcraft Classic". There's still time!
---
Sorry you're getting so much backlash man, I agree with your core message. This used to be a place more focused on sharing in the excitement and anticipation of classic but I've noticed a large uptick of toxicity too. Such is Reddit I guess :(
---
Dude who the fuck cares you overreacting nerd. It‚Äôs a beta
---
A kid wondering why people hate clueless, obnoxious streamers. SHOCKER!
---
This one - but you have to wait a little while before getting permissions on the server. Https://discord.gg/jGVV8xJ
---
For PR.  Quinn gets a shit ton of viewers, many of them specifically for him acting retarded on stream (watch some of his PoE streams...)
---
Reddit was always filled with people who hate everything, just avoid it like the plague it is.
---
Huh? You brought it up.
---
Ah, hahaha. Nevermind me, I'm retarded aswell =)
---
Entitled? I'm just saying that they lied.
---
I love how saying that a corporation lied about something or didn't want people to know the real reason for something is now acting 'entitled'.
---
The discussion a few years ago was Blizzard (and other people) saying that it was impossible and it couldn't be done, and us saying that of course it could be done if they actually tried. Turns out actually trying means it could be done. And either they lied or they knowingly made it seem a lot harder than it actually was.
---
No ones interested nerd
---
Tbh they both don't pair that well, so play whatever you think you'll enjoy more. Consider druid too. 
---
Keep in mind that you won't be constantly healing when leveling, rather very occasionally. Unless you're looking for more AFKy and slow experience.
---
I‚Äôll be the first to say I was a classic naysayer but the more I read about it and watch videos I could not be more excited for classic.
---
Unless I get beta access I might have to jump on a pserver to test out classes and decide what to play.
---
Tips, who else.
---
sounds like some neckbeard fake news shit there are literally accounts that subbed after the announcement and got in
---
If all you can scream us "toxic" while ignoring sound logic, then you're just validating every "toxic" persons action. Whether you think its becauss theyre looking for a reaction, or because theyre super shitty and think you're super shitty and have to let you know; ignoring the few positive and logical points they have to shout "toxic" really makes you the toxic one in the attempted discussion, or at least to the health of a continued discussion.
---
Is the girlfriend you speak of the wifu pillow background?
---
Loved the Wow's and RS wars back in middle school
---
There always was kids who played wow and who played rs  and the both groups called each other losers for playing the games...also there was a rich kids who payed both and had max level/gear...how they get it...don't know
---
What  coincidence that Rs decided to add 07 servers (that really resurrected Rs...for a while)  and wow decided to bring classic back...hmm
---
Personally never tried wow,played rs for 10+ years, but when classic comes i will be playing it
---
I understand :-)
---
Here's the unfortunate truth. The majority of people playing wow classic at launch, or even further in the future, never played vanilla. It's valuable data to know what new players are going to be experiencing. With data like this, they can implement tools to help new players not be so lost.
---
Its slow and steady, u don't die to much. Shadow word pain, shield and wand everything to death.
---
Say it with me, B-E-T-A. As in testing mode. Looking for bugs. As in not finished. Meaning 
---
, suspend your judgements because things will change.
---
Post proof. Melee range is wrong? Blizzard said Tauren had longer range in vanilla. Post proof. Post proof. Your memory is not an accurate database/server. Post proof.

---
Release day announcement.
---
PvP, as much as I hate getting ganked, the world PvP videos I see on Youtube look so much fun at 60.
---
the centaurs? i saw that video too but then someone commented that the mobs themselves might just be bugged because the same has happened on private servers.
---
Not trying to say there is absolutely no way there's sharding on the beta. Just pointing out that it's, well, a beta. And blizzard said there wont be sharding. Some concrete evidence with like actual players suddenly zoning in and out and I'll go get my pitchfork.
---
&gt; But we're not going to intentionally do something to hurt someone else's playing experience.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs the issue? You didn‚Äôt stop once to think if someone else in the group needed it or wanted it. The group is bigger than just you and asmon. You saw how angry asmon got because he didn‚Äôt get a piece of loot that he thought he deserved, right? Imagine that happening to the rest of the group.
---
Yeah but thata because the formulas were calculating wrong not because the values/data was incorrect. Because of scaling the new client calculated items differently.
---
In part I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs true but there are indeed also people reporting that spawn rates are off based on what they‚Äôre remembering from private servers. The problem here is you have people kinda being dickish about pservers having been  wrong about things for years and conversely you have some private server people who just refuse to admit that maybe these servers have been wrong about anything in any way.
---
Meanwhile, both groups look like dumbasses. I just hope blizzard thoroughly checks all pserver feedback against their reference client because I‚Äôm coming back to play WoW Classic, which should be the most ‚Äú Blizzlike‚Äù version of vanilla since it was retail, not a pserver.
---
Go eat another tide pod
---
People said wanting OSRS was just all nostalgia talking but now OSRS has 5x the player-base of rs3.
---
i'm going to start a guild dedicated to sniping and griefing whatever streamer ends up on my server
---
A friend of mine who played 30k hours of WoW (me 25k) and didn't know about Classic WoW coming back, I told him about it, he said he didn't have time for this... now he asks me to play on a Vanilla private server until Classic, I told him it was an alluring proposal, but I must hold off until August 27th.
---
The amount of people in this sub that think that their opinions are objective fact is staggering
---
I sold me 2007 account as well, or I should say attempted to sell. Got scammed, gave out my secret password. Person basically server transfered and deleted all my T1-T3 full warlock sets. I recovered multiple times, but other person recovered as well which I forsaw an endless battle. 
---
Since then I have created a new account and utlized it as my main. But I will forever regret the decision to try and sell. As much as I want to recover and utlize my old account again, the fear of the other person recovering  would always be in the back of my mind. Honestly just want to look at my old toon for the nostalgia of all the gear I aquired.
---
This is such an odd motivation.  So all you want is to feel superior in 3 months time? Really man
---
Are you saying he‚Äôs not wrong about submitting the report or that it‚Äôs a bug?
---
I don't think that's a bad thing at all!
---
Crocs on the big river the is the boarder between the two zones
---
And by "interested" you mean outraged. You may not have hunted for it, but you went out of your way to post it on this subreddit, hoping to start a hate train against both streamers.
---
I don't hate the player I hate the game, 
---
Streaming is fucking stupid and I hate all of them out of principle. Stop trying to make people watch you play video games. But the youtube/twitch celebrity bullshit isn't gonna go away ever because of the 0.01% of people that are actually entertaining inspire thousands more.
---
Swifty has always been straight up braindead with anything that isn't BG or arena related.
---
I‚Äôm not arguing that‚Äôs it‚Äôs always better to be constructive than being blatantly insulting, but I cannot stress how much I disagree in allowing ninja looting. While you can argue it doesn‚Äôt technically break the game rules it is a breach of ethics and is argue breaks community rules. 
---
I just fought it necessary to point out of the hypocrisy of asking for maturity and then support the stealing of things on something as trivial as a beta video game. To me that screams immaturity on the highest levels.
---
From what I can tell, it's not directed at EVERY content creator.
---
Just people like [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/PrettyBetterPistachioPicoMause).
---
Being a decent tank and having the key meant I was flooded with whispers constantly back then lol.
---
It helps an outrageous amount while leveling the professions, you can essentially think of it as doing stuff is orange for 15 more levels, 
---
Think about when you're leveling engi and your current "leveling" recipe goes green when you still need 5 skill points, well if you were a gnome you could've progressed 10 points ago
---
Or when you're doing herbalism on the Tauren, first off you can pick up earthroot instantly and instead of peacebloom going yellow at 35 (don't remember the exact level, just an example) and you maybe needing 2-3 pickups to get a skill, it goes orange at 50 when you can pick up mage royal and this sort of advantage continues all the way to 300.
---
Whether or not it helps endgame I'm not sure, I know that some engineering gadgets scale with engineering skill and the gnome racial makes them stronger than other races on pservers, but whether or not that's blizzlike, I'm not sure off.
---
I haven't herbed since retail vanilla so I'm not 100% sure this is the case, but I do believe Lotus is orange at skill 300 and yellow at 315, which means a tauren will never fail to pick a Lotus while other races will and there may be other plants for which this is the case, as I said haven't herbed in about 14 years so can't tell you, of course it's very minor but it still helps.
---
The client is the real client, it's the server that is an emulation of the real servers. It's not perfect at it since it pretty much had to be built without any knowledge of it's internal workings.
---
Some people seem to be inferring that I'm saying using the old client and server would be "easy", which is not the case. What I'm saying is that people with no backing were able to come up with a baseline workable solution without even knowing how it actually worked under the hood. A huge corp with the original code should be able to do MUCH better than that. The idea that it would somehow be "impossible" to do so is BS.
---
Personally, I prefer the way Blizz is actually doing it, but I doubt it was the easier of the two options. In my experience, it's still easier to add to old code than the twist new code to work mostly like old code without breaking anything.
---
At the beginning, maybe. But those smalltime streamers usually don't last long before they move on.
---
The bigger names, who actually generate quite some income with classic streams, will likely stay for the forseeable future.
---
Isn't Asmongold a known ninja crybaby anyways?
---
You're a really nice guy Esfand, but you're playing and palling around with a cocksucker who just spent 30 minutes preaching about how was and is a ninja looter and doesn't give a shit what people think about that.
---
Instead of playing with Asmon you should distance yourself from him, 'cuz your stream is still growing and you will keep getting dragged into his bullshit.
---
just come to a german server
---
Pvp is the only choice if you want to play the game the way the designers intended. You're missing SO MUCH content if you don't.
---
I'm saying he's wrong that it's a bug :)
---
He bent the knee!
---
you dont need a key for scholomance you can just die outside and rez on the inside. first mount is at level 40 which means you wouldnt be running scholo. wut
---
Here comes the streamer brigade, hoo boy. This is why people dislike streamer communities.
---
Jagex re-released a 2007 version of runescape a couple years ago, that that version (OSRS) is widely considered the superior game and has 4x the players compared to the original game (runescape 3).
---
Hi, /u/jksdfgg
---
I don't really agree with this. If they do something to reduce my enjoyment of the game, I will be salty. I shouldn't be happy that they only screwed the game up a little bit, not when they already have a game I enjoy but chooses to fuck with it.
---
\&gt;Their interest in making Classic WoW as good of a product as it can be is quite evident. They're making concessions and  even change their plans when they receive valid feedback from the team.
---
Yes but the devs are not the ones in charge of decision-making. This is one thing the nay-sayers are actually right about; if the executives wants monetization and sharding, you bet your ass there will be monetization and sharding. Yet you're right that the devs have indeed been able to bend over backwards responding to feedback. This is strange behavior from acti-blizzard, and does not fit with the basic "they just doing it for money lulz" take.
---
I wouldn't play even if I was invited, because that would be like playing on a private server while waiting - it will only ruin it for me. I have an itch to play and playing beta would satisfy it and also ruin it, because the world is barren right now with only a handful of people... not the most realistic experience. Not only that but I will have my progress wiped.  
---
I'd patiently wait for August 27th... I will even take time off work.
---
What an absolute retard.
---
I don't remember WoW having a very big following where I grew up. Everyone was on RS though.
---
But it really feels like we're given a second chance at the WoW glory days with this :D
---
I think this is huge. People with 10 years in retail don‚Äôt want to start a truly fresh account of characters. Shame, I think it‚Äôs one of the most exciting opportunities to come to WoW in all that time.
---
Swiftly was always senile, most people were just to young to see it.
---
Ask tipsout
---
Makes sense. I think that's one of the major weaknesses of retail Mages in PvP, that they pretty much only have one school of magic spells. So baiting for example is probably a lot more important than in classic where you can just switch schools for a bit.
---
In not talking about streaming, in this video he says that he was wrong and he thought that vanilla was just nostalgia, he didnt have to stream it, just try it before jumping on the "just nostalgia wagon".
---
Thats what i was saying, i don't care if he "dare to like classic and bla bla bla" i don't even know what gatekeeping means
---
I guarantee many of these toxic users on this sub never played vanilla either. They likely picked up vanilla using private servers, learned private server mentality and use that as justification to gatekeep literally anyone and everyone.
---
I have quite a few of these; rule 7 dumpster fire. lol
---
PVP, could be convinced to RPPVP, but there's no way I'm playing a PVE server.
---
I am not even arguing but anyways...lets leave it at that.
---
I saw a (unconfirmed) comment that said streamers werent announcing what realms they were rolling on.  I'm trying to go back and find it again, no luck so far.
---
Thanks for the well typed up reply! That‚Äôs all very handy. I was on the fence whether I wanted to pick a Tauren shaman or another race. I was very partial to Taurens in retail, but I didn‚Äôt want a generally useless racial. That does sound like it has some good uses though!
---
Nah I get that. Like I said, I envy you for enjoying both. I wish I still did.
---
yeah as the other guy said get him a bonus.  he's probably too busy for an AMA, the poor guy looks exhausted in interviews!
---
...yep.
---
There will be PUG raids made by players who still need that last MC drop, and their guild is not doing that raid anymore. And the average casual player can join once in a while.
---
Under 20 so you're basicaly 12 y/o
---
Welcome to internet kid, everyone is toxic/internet warrior, it is up to you to decide will you get triggered to trolls
---
Oh god....
---
I gave the support staff as much info as i could remember (email, character names, creation date, stuff they had done like the charger quest, names and addresses on cards used, ID scan) that only i would know. they told me the status of the account and merged it with my current battle net so its under that log in and authenticator now. they even gave me 24hours game time so i could actually log in to him. now he just sits on a starter account for nostalgia.
---
imagine not playing on a pvp server lol
---
Salt must flow
---
I can almost hear your neck beard growing from here..
---
I played ally my first time through, and only ever really saw that once I went horde later in life, thanks for the info
---
^This. Blizz has a legit 1.12 reference client they can check everything against... I‚Äôm trusting the folks with the actual code know what they‚Äôre talking about over pserver crowds who are remembering the game as they‚Äôve been playing it for the past few years which was built on estimations of values and whatnot - that‚Äôs not to say pservers are completely wrong, but the idea that they‚Äôre the Rosetta Stone of vanilla wow is stupid - the reference client Blizz has is key.
---
What in glorious glistening heavenly fuck?
---
Odd... It works fine on both my Android phone and using Chrome on my PC. Don't know how to help you. Sorry. :&lt;
---
Are you this passive-aggressive IRL too? Spoken like a true incel.
---
Why would you watch someone else play a sport?
---
They could make loads more money and are choosing not to. Why are they not selling it as a 30$ release if they want to maximize the amount of money they can make? They should be releasing a shop too, why aren't they doing that? Why are there no gold-tokens?
---
It's a dumb take, cause it doesn't fit with their actions.
---
#nochanges
---
Indeed, modern UI/API shouldn't allow for modern gameplay tricks.
---
Didn't think about that. It's going to be weird this time around.
---
Well... actually Asmon admitted to being a ninja looter. Said he has been forever and will continue to be. Shame he is tarnishing your rep as well, but don't and say he doesn't ruin play experience for others. Not to mention that whatever server he plays on will be scuffed and not like classic at all.
---
You don't remember the days when 07 runescape was being proposed then. Same thing. We had the naysayers, the diehard old school RS players talking about how the current game is garbage, etc. It then settled down after.
---
For teh looks
---
Loot the hounds! You will need +15 skinning skill as well to be able to skin all the corehounds.
---
I didn‚Äôt make it, was sent to me by a friend and I know he didn‚Äôt make it. Doesn‚Äôt pull from the hidden truths though.
---
To compound this, they'll drop you like it's hot if you so much as need time off for your mother's funeral.
---
I don't know if it's like that in every location (there's a lot), but my experience (and opinion of them) is shit.
---
"I couldnt have this NOW or the last X year/months/days ive wanted this so the devs MUST be LYING. Thats the ONLY reason I couldnt have ALREADY been playing this game" is basically what you just fucking said. Yes, you sound incredibly god-damned entitled.
---
(Obviously thats prob not your lines of logic, but thats EXACTLY how your comment reads)
---
too lacking in testosterone from basement dwelling to even grow a beard.
---
OP: Blizzard doesn't work weekends.
---
Blizzard: We will be holding stress tests on weekends!
---
Some guilds will require a certain amount of Fire Res for Rag/Vael/Firemaw, especially for progression. On private servers Fire Res isnt needed, but that might not be the case in classic.
---
So better safe than sorry, also completionism!
---
you live in van?  well thats ok then since you're the only person who is looking to play classic
---
if classic isn't what you want, don't play it.  no need to shit on things other people are enjoying
---
People here will mention what streamers Asmon, Soda and the rest have decided to play on when the server names are released.
---
"There it is."
---
Absolutely not. This is intended.
---
First is wrong. And I'll quote the CM manager again since you don't seem to understand. It's a new situation after the CM chimed in. ‚ÄùIf you are not currently an active subscriber then this would disqualify you from being considering for future beta waves.‚Äù
---
I don't think the community is particularly hateful, just very sensitive to people being sleazy
---
Too early to tell, they haven‚Äôt even announced the server names yet. Just keep tabs on where they say they‚Äôre rolling once the names of the servers are announced and avoid those servers.
---
Theit backlash will only feed the succes of classic. 
---
It's a stupid thing to be against in the first place.
---
This subreddit should pick its own server and alienate any streamer trying to play on it
---
You shouldn't excue ninja-looters just because they're streamers. If it was a 'normal' person they would be barred from joining any serious group and be put on a ninja-loot list. But the streamers always have their kiddy-brigades which gobbles their balls all day long.
---
I would hate to play on a streamers server, not because I hate streamers, but because often enough their communities are cancer.  
---
I'd love an 'No-stream' server.
---
Just accept that your first time in a new dungeon will be hard. Every time after that will be much easier, you‚Äôll know the way, the packs etc.
---
Man i was so happy when i found this sub. I want to know everything about classic because i started in wotlk and people here are just disgusting. One would think they are all grown people by now.
---
Not my question at all
---
Hopefully there will be a publicly available, stickied list here. When the server list in released.
---
So by that logic when Classic launches on the 27th you would rather watch a cuck like asmon rather than play yourself? my god...
---
You must live a very sheltered life if this is the "most hostile and hateful" group of people you've ever seen.
---
Time to get out in the real world my dude.
---
Tell me how this is intended, if this did not work back in vanilla. The whole point of removing the focus frame is so stuff like this is not possible.
---
why downvote the truth tho
---
Internet points and comments don't bother me. Just wanted to let my general thoughts out on the reddit to see if anyone would be willing to admit the wrong and change. But it's eh, as you said - such is reddit! Looking forward to classic anyway and playing it how I wanna play it! :)
---
This was the same price 15 years ago. $15 usd a MONTH is entirely reasonable for 720 hours of entertainment.
---
Cool.
---
I dont get it, is it an addon?
---
:O
---
I hope someone does this
---
Also, I'm certain he knows some items don't have stats and he just fakes that he doesn't know while reporting 'bugs' for reactions. So funny!
---
But you ate them all and didn't share :(
---
It's not the mouseover that breaks anything, in fact that was perfectly doable with macros before.
---
It's that you don't lose CP, which I agree should be fixed.
---
I'm going to start a guild dedicated to stream sniping and camping whichever mongrel ends up on my server. I'll stream watching their stream and coordinating all of my goons to make the game unplayable for them and people can sub to me in real time. My patreon will be up shortly.
---
I wonder if there are even going to be enough servers to avoid them all. You can probably avoid Asmon or Soda, but I think every server is going to have at least one 2k Andy on it
---
Perfect example of what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
I wonder if those feelings are influenced by the fact that the only Vanilla wow anyone has played for the last 15 years has been on private servers...
---
Also feel free to share this video evidence.
---
Right on
---
The streamer hateboner here is real
---
there. are. literally. people. who. made. accounts. this. week. and. got. in
---
&gt; Fury generates more consistent rage
---
How? Anger Management gives 1 rage per 3 seconds, all the time, without fail.
---
Unbridled Wrath is only a 40% chance to generate 1 rage on weapon swings.
---
""""more consistent"""" ?
---
&gt;does more damage
---
Again, how? You have Imp. Battle Shout and +5% crit, but that's about it. Flurry rarely procs for 2h weapons. I'd say the various reductions, increased rage gen, Overpower crit chance, etc from Arms is much better.
---
&gt;has better survivability
---
If survivability is an issue, you should be hamstring kiting, which can be done on either spec. If you're using Demo Shout on mobs, you're doing it wrong.
---
&gt;Enrage
---
Not sure why you're factoring this in, since sit-critting does not work anymore. Enrage will almost never proc.
---
Enrage sit-critting was the only thing Fury had going for it that made it clearly better than Arms. Now the specs are just about equal in damage, but Arms has so much more utility.
---
Who's making you watch anything lmao
---
Yeah, people get too far with the hate they have for certain streamers here, often breaking the rules of this subreddit which don't seem to necessarily be as enforced as they would be over on r/wow. 
---
I can understand not watching or having disagreements with streamers, but it's starting to get similar to the hate that Classic receives from some players of BFA. Where it goes from "I don't like so and so" to listing how TipsOut personally kicked your dog while he tore up your beta invite.
---
I am not passive agressive at all. As I said, lets leave it at that. You said you didn't want to argue further before your edit so lets do that. It is fine with me.
---
Fair enough, that's a good opinion of yours to have. While not one I fully back, I can see why the concept of the thing itself is annoying and a downer to you - as it should be. I just don't advocate the rage that people are having.
---
It kind of is. You just don't roll on the servers that the big streamers are on. That's it.
---
Either you're wrong or they're bad at their job.
---
Step 1) Make it a digital release instead of free with subscriptions. They're leaving 30 bucks per player on the table for no reason right there. It's a new release, there's no reason to give it away for free when you could make people pay for it.
---
Step 2) Implement wow tokens. Gives you free money and makes you not have to deal with gold sellers.
---
Step 3) Implement cosmetic shop.
---
Step 4) Implement sharding. Sharding saves money on servers.
---
So, given your model, why are they not doing this?
---
LOL. Makes me feel much better and made me laugh too.
---
Big respect for the guy to admit he were wrong
---
just pick one of the dead realms, all the streamers are going to end up on the same realm because nobody's going to want to watch a streamer on a realm that doesn't have all the streamers on it
---
you are dumb, these streamers like asmongold dont give a fuck about submitting bugs, he doesnt read chat, hes just memeing 24/7 and doing stupid shit, meanwhile small streamers with 100 viewers are testing real bugs and submitting them
---
No need to keep waiting, towelliee has been saying since the Irvine event he was wrong about classic and was shocked to find out how much more fun he is having with classic. He just doesn't make many YouTube videos so the chance of him just making a similar video to this is very slim .
---
You might be right or wrong - but you definitely have a few of them nailed down. It's whatever, hopefully the release will boost numbers of a community that drowns them out eventually. Just sad that they're vocal at the moment.
---
That was some intense feelings from you from me asking a question to someone else, but ill give you a response anyway. 
---
I'm not Anti-private-servers. Actually, i have a level 60 rogue on 3 of the major ones. I'm far from a Blizzard White knight also, considering i currently don't have an Active sub, Haven't played in any capacity for a good while either as the current Retail wow is awful and have a blocked Paypal account because they broke EU law by not refunding me Destiny 2 before it had even released. 
---
That was some crazy assumptions you made about me on a sentence that consisted of 12 words that wasn't even addressed directly towards you. You got so heated typing out that message that you started with an Insult. 
---
I asked a question that was fair enough if someone is so against a company or despises there practices that much, no matter what product, why would that person want to spend ANY money in any capacity to further there reach lol. 
---
Also, you said you were not against the company but my question again wasn't even directed towards you, it was directed towards the person who stated that Blizzard was a shitty company.
---
&gt; guess that means I missed to opt in to beta damn.
---
You didn't miss it, you missed a handful of invite waves where your odds where shit anyway, just opt in and hope for the best :)
---
I didn't say the devs lied. I said blizzard lied. They're a company like any other. If i say "general motors lied about x" would you call me entitled? That'd be absurd.
---
I'm patient with the release, I'm in no hurry. Nobody owes me anything, all i'm saying is that blizzard says what's best for them, and thinking that they're gonna come out and say "yea guys we're not making classic because we're doing other things" is ridiculous - obviously they're not gonna do that.
---
This sort of buddy buddy relationship with devs that 'gamers' seem to have is so creepy. I don't play a lot of games anymore and only recently got into a few gaming communities, and people talk about devs as if they're their friends. Thanking them for stuff, posting threads about how they're appreciated and so on. Fucking weird.
---
You are an absolute child.

Its a nice thought, but ehhhhhhrh

---
Why would the level 30 need it?
---
Look at Captain Buzzkill over here.
---
Fair enough, you're allowed this opinion ofc. I don't excuse them, I just wouldn't rage as much as people are. If I was the person in the video that was ninja-looted out of gear, maybe I'd be a bit salty - but I'm not. People needa calm down a little.
---
What's a monthly sub cost now-a-days? ...$15? So 2 weeks would be $7.50 give or take. 
---
Worth it to reserve names
---
Only gnomes' is worth using, with orcs' as a close second.
---
That's kind of laughable. Many of these streamers are old PvP autists that are literally learning the best leveling routes to get ahead of the hordes of fans that are going to try and snipe and gank them. You probably won't be able to keep up with them leveling, and even at max level, BiS gear you would probably get shit on. That's not even considering the amount of people they could summon if they wanted to at a whim.
---
You are most likely in the vocal minority but the actual majority. Millions of people will try to play classic... most aren't on here and don't care about betas.
---
Yep. I just stick to youtube and watch videos on classic for the most part now or try my best to just scroll here and not read the opinions by idiots.
---
Having played in Classic, my warlock didn't break 100 gold until 55, and my hunter didn't until 44.  Granted, I was 15 and stupid, but I could see someone hitting 60 without ever having enough for a mount, especially a druid or shaman.
---
As for rezing inside Scholo door, I have no excuse.
---
While it would be an amazing gesture, that server would be so incredibly overpopulated it will have massive queues come phase 2 where they promised to get rid of layering completely.
---
And ZG island
---
People just need to stop being such fragile little snowflakes all the time. Jesus christ.
---
That's very interesting, thank you for that. I think you are making a good point with castbars and debuff timers - most people want to have a full vanilla experience but at the same time I believe that most of these people can't live without castbars and debuff timers either.
---
bla blah blah blah i‚Äôll @ u when i get in
---
I mean obviously if you ask him (his ego) like that he is not gonna say but yea should be easy to find out what server the roll on.
---
They are gradually becoming more and more dumbed down with each iteration.
---
Skills become removed or combined with other skills, gear slots become less. Game rules become more simpler and more forgiving. In Skyshit you can complete every storyline in the game with the same save file.
---
In Morrowind, if you join one faction and complete its storyline and want to go complete their rival faction storyline, they tell you "nope, get the fuck outa here, you are working for them and we hate them"
---
So you're literally not allowed to do it, you have to load a previous save before you started with the first faction or just start another character.
---
All of your actions affect the whole world.
---
You also don't have stupid quest markers to lead you to quests without you even engaging a single brain cell into work.
---
And also in Morrowind you can create your own spells with the Spellmaking system.
---
Basically, Morrowind and previous games are like Vanilla WoW and Oblivion, Skyshit, ESO and TES6 are like Retail WoW - dumbed down and available to the most casual of gamers and very unwelcoming to the original crowd.
---
I'm right there with you. My dream is that there would be some 'no-stream' servers. But I doubt it.
---
The best chance you have is to just wait. Someone is bound to create a list when the game drops. Just wait an hour.
---
It‚Äôs better than what he‚Äôs wearing?
---
Or, since apparently using it for a twink is a legit reason to need the cloak.. maybe he wants to have a twink in the future?
---
Best content I've seen in years. Revolutionary
---
NEXT
---
Pretty much this.
---
Nope. Just said some people might! There's definitely people out there who don't play games that the streamers they watch do. Not everyone wants to learn the game, learn the mechanics or has the time to dedicate. They just wanna sit back and put something on the side to listen/glance at a little while. A streamer is that something, sometimes! :)
---
Good point! Gnomish Death Ray scales with the engi skill too I think.
---
Sure would be nice to watch the interview without the russian voiceover
---
lmfao you're disgusting. there's no reason to ever hate somebody. "you're young" nice joke man, you're so old and wise/
---
J Allen Brack, is that you?
---
It would be pointless, you obviously lack reading comprehension.
---
i'm a 6x gladiator and asmongold can barely move his character
---
You could do that prior to patch 1.1, which is US release patch.
---
So if he's remembering the original vanilla beta 0.12 patch, hes not wrong.
---
PvP - for the real like feeling faction difference and hate :)  
---
also, there is no RP server at beginning, Blizz already stated that.
---
That tailor yelling his wares at the end was the icing on the cake. Small things like that add up to a living world.
---
what will be so bad about these realms?
---
Mouseover macros were definitely a thing in vanilla.
---
Get the pitchforks out! Get em!
---
You are basically lying then, fanboy. I do want to get disproved so I can better my odds at getting in but I'm not doing anything until Blizzard officials correct the CM's post.
---
Retail is too far gone.  
---
  They cannot fix the biggest problems of it without completely changing the game, the people that ruined the game because they feel the need for the game to cater to their every need would start crying.   
---
  They can't make pvp fun and quick, they can't flatout remove flying, they can't completely remove tons of mounts to actually make them special again, they can't remove lfr, they can't prune and squish difficulties, they can't give class niches, they can't make epics hard to get, etc.  
---
   Sadly, blizz decided to kill the game by focusing the people that shouldn't be playing it in the first place, "omg I work and can only play 3 hours a week" then sure, enjoy the game, but don't complain because you don't have the same things as the guy that plays 50 hours a week until the devs give them to you.
---
&gt;Excluding new players already sets your intentions for the group of people playing the game later on.
---
Sorry if I put the quality of testing above the feels of people who will literally be getting the entire second game for zero additional cost. Not much sympathy for the plight of "new players" in regards to classic.
---
Ah yes, this big whiny post crying about "MUH TOXIC MUH TOXIC" is going to make everyone be nice and friendly from now on.
---
Fair enough. But I think writing off my opinions because of age is a bit eh eh. Only because I've been exposed to a lot of communities in the past with a similar mindset that hated changes on certain games and wanted the revert the ways of old, but people disagree and wanted to keep the new. So I'm used to the mindset, just not the specific WoW one! But fair enough. My thoughts are more about the general state of the sub-reddit and it's threads/discussions rather than the people, though.
---
To expand on the travel analogy:
---
WoW Classic is like a cycling holiday, it's a lot of work and effort to get where you want to go, there are infinite options of things to do, and you're enriched and a better person for the experience.
---
WoW Retail is like a package holiday, you are shipped from A to B to C, you see what is on the tour, you take advantage of the short windows of opportunity to "do your own thing" but ultimately all the effort is someone else's, you're reaping the benefits of their work, not yours.
---
Classic is a time sink, you get the most out of it when you're prepared to put the effort and time in. Retail is prepackaged experience you can dip in and out with whatever time you have and not feel like you're missing anything.
---
Which sounds best to you? That'll probably be the one you prefer.
---
Really hope it does well, and maby we'll see a return of more hardcore/slow paced mmo's like EQ/Vanilla WoW.
---
15 years ago came out again, after 15 years ‚Ç¨ 13 is nonsense, many are not going to play for this
---
YES YES!
---
100% THIS!
---
Omar is the hero we needed. Omar is the silent savior. 
---
We love you Omar.
---
Huh? One guy figured it out in a couple weeks, it was sort of tough for one guy, what do you think would happen if there was a team working on figuring that out and not one enthusiast?
---
I hit 60 in Hellfire Peninsula a few weeks after TBC dropped. I hit level cap for the first time in Netherstorm at 7:30a, my play session started lvl 67 at 8p the previous night
---
Can we add people who can't tolerate that other people think their preferences are shit to that list?
---
Game subs have been getting cheaper over the years, because the price never increases.
---
Don't and would never expect it to! Just thought I'd write my opinions on the sub-reddit overall so people can read and moderators can read. Ain't making any demands! :)
---
They represent the community when they communicate ideas to blizzard. I think for most of the reasons stated people don't trust them to do that.
---
Then just simply ignore the streamers and play on a server that doesn't have them. Not necessary to make a bucnh of posts about how streamers don't deserve their betas and other shit like that. They're big way for Blizzard to advertise, they don't gain anything by giving the beta to some nobodies who just happened to play the game in the early days. And I'm saying that as a nobody myself.
---
You're a fool.
---
Not surprising to say the least. Dude is a meathead through and through. He's the quintessential 'dudebro' gamer.
---
Yes. At least if you're not entirely in a group of friends. Esfand forgot, and Asmongold doesn't care.
---
I was poor as fuck when I played as a kid too, but I do remember everything was relatively balanced. It felt like a pretty good system tbh.
---
That's literally nothing, and Asmon even being the easiest target would still be in a guild with other very very very skillful players, and again could literally probably summon 20-100 people at any given time just by asking on stream. Other players such as Sodapoppin would absolutely roll you and smoke your ass even if you brought friends along.
---
Can other races melee hit a Tauren, from the same distance, as a Tauren can hit them?
---
gold rates from quests and vendor items pick up rather quickly after level 40. you'd have to be blowing all of your gold on useless items from the auction house or unneeded training like skills or professions to not have it by 50. but ye
---
Potentially, but I also think that when it comes to restoring a piece of game-history - the streamers aren't here for that. They're here to boost up numbers, hype and to also do some bug reporting along the way as they'll be streaming the game full-time as their job and come across a lot more bugs than the average beta player would.
---
The funny thing is, this almost the exact argument people made back then. 
---
People paid it then.  They pay it for Retail.  They will pay it for classic.
---
Realistically if people dont like what streamers do, refuse to group with them. Their bad rep will ruin them and it‚Äôs enablers that allow them to thrive.
---
oh lol okay
---
I played TES games in this order:
---
1. Skyshit
---
2. Morrowind
---
3. ESO
---
4. Oblivion
---
I haven't played Daggerfall and Arena, because as entitled/spoiled/shallow I may sound, the graphics in them are too outdated for me to immerse myself. My bare minimum is Morrowind with untouched default graphics.
---
Skyshit lead me into the world of TES, Morrowind was the shit, ESO was OK at first, but now I hate it, Oblivion is OK, but IMO inferior to Morrowind, the only thing Oblivion had was superior graphics. The UI was a console UI on PC, the world looked very boring, the main quest was too boring for me to care about the characters or anything, the parts where you have to enter pockets of Oblivion through gates and basically do the same thing again and again was really a pain in the ass.
---
Seems like the best idea
---
Classic wow is going to weed you people out so fast, you have absolutely no idea. This game is for people who have no life dog. The stereotypes are true.
---
I don't think you realize they do have the OG build.
---
The problem is that they have made 15 years of progress on their codebase and countered exploits and hacks/bots in that time.
---
They want to engineer their modern codebase to recognize, and run vanilla. That's a pretty fucking tall order.
---
Who exactly are you pretending to quote? Having those with at least a minimum of experience with the product being tested is such a wild and crazy idea?
---
While I'm very excited for Classic, from the streams I've watched so far it seems easier than I remember? Certainly easier than the PS I've played on.
---
I think there is a difference between "Streamer" and "Content Creator" ... for the most part, streamers are just personalities that for SOME REASON people stick to. They don't really CREATE anything. They rarely have much "creative" talent, though many are really good at games at least.
---
Content Creators, on the other hand, actually make content. They write scripts, they edit videos, the try to make something new and entertaining or informative.
---
Streamers = TV Show Host, usually annoying and a real head-scratcher why they are famous
---
Content Creator = Show Creator, sometimes annoying but they at least have some talent
---
People 'round here, especially older folks, don't care for streamers. Content Creators are OK.
---
Isn't the point of Classic to remove all the pandering that got implemented into wow?
---
This is why I loled
---
soda is like the one remotely competent streamer and you're vastly overestimating him, it also doesn't matter at all
---
Assuming we do get Oceanic servers...
---
jesus fucking christ you're an absolute sperg
---
Youre right, its not really streamer entitlement as it just is plain simple entitlement but either way its just as pathetic to watch it happen.
---
And if you think my judgement is wrong you have yet to know about this streamers past entitlements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWAdB8IEb_o
---
My bad I thought you thought I only meant Asmon and Soda, I meant all the smaller streamers I do not know or care for
---
Vanilla is a game for men with hair on their balls, you‚Äôll need thick skin to browse this sub.
---
Nice blog post.
---
If you're a software developer I recommend skipping the comments on this post for your own mental health.
---
The artifact and hearthstone subreddits would like to have a word...
---
Paying 15 usd a month is huge amount for 15 years old content, plus considering you need to sleep and do your own stuff irl, its far less than 720hours. 80-100 at max
---
So I played in classic but for some of these items I can't remember if they were like that in the original release or if they are legit bugs.  Note that I am actually in Beta and not just watching a stream. 
---
\- Changing features in the character selection screen resets the animation.  For instance, I am playing an undead female character and when I would change her hair/skin color/etc the 'shrug' animation would reset every time.  It could have been like that in vanilla, I didn't make that many characters so I honestly don't remember.
---
\- Swim speed seems fast.  It could just be perspective but I definitely felt like I was moving at run speed. 
---
\- Quests being tracked will disappear from the tracker.  I had a quest that showed up in the tracker after I started collecting items.  I had a lull in item drops (yay vanilla) and the quest disappeared from the tracker.  Quests that I purposefully was tracking never disappeared so I am not sure if this is just a feature of the auto-tracked ones.
---
\- Mobs being feared through walls. 
---
Actual Bugs
---
\- Nightlash in Silverpine Forest for the 'Dead Fields' quest disappears after being targeted.  It happened twice and I never saw it respawn, despite killing a metric ton of gnolls.  The server reset yesterday allowed me to try a second time, thus the two instances. 
---
\- Moonrage worgens in Silverpine, specifically the ones where you have to find Arugal's book, spam the same message continuously. 
---
\~Level 15 and I am sure I'll find more but I wanted to start my input. I have died a ton so it feels pretty accurate so far!
---
I share his opinion. I started playing WoW when TBC was released in a very casual manner (I was 12 or so and terrible at the game). While I greatly enjoyed the experience back then, I have been saying to myself and my friends that classic wow would die imediately after its release. I thought people would delve deep in the nostalgia of it all and, once it was sated, would realise that the current iteration is so much better.
---
Boy, was I wrong. I got into a private server to test things out and I lost all the will to play the current game. Vanilla feels so much more difficult and challenging and immersive. The fact that you actually are encouraged to interact with people is amazing. And I have been having so much fun with it.
---
I truly hope people realise how great this game was. Even if you did not play during vanilla back in the day, hop in and try it. I have officially joined the classic wow hype train.
---
Thanks for your contribution to proving OP's point
---
This thread has been made 1.000.000 times. Use the search function.
---
You have no idea what you're implying when you say you want the modern client, do you?
---
You think so? Don't think everyone will roll on that since we'll have a healthy mix of first time players, people coming back after years not playing, retail players, and the private server scene. Not everyone playing Classic will have that emotional attachment to the name
---
&gt; video ends
---
There's a Watch Full Video option on twitch clips like this, so you can see the rest of the context.
---
Oh so I guess that‚Äôs why Blizzard had to make a ‚ÄúNot a Bug‚Äù post dismissing extremely common reports about quests and their objectives not appearing on the minimal. Contrary to what you say it‚Äôs obvious lots of people that didn‚Äôt play in 2005 are in the beta.
---
Don‚Äôt agree outside of boss mechanics being more varied. Specs are more viable but all the classes are homogenous are boring because of it. And I strongly disagree with content variety. 
---
I‚Äôm playing bfa now, all there is to do is dungeons and some island expedition bullshit and arenas if your into that. 
---
In classic I have multiple raids, zg and aq are still useful even when naxx is out. The best world pvp experience ever in wow, as someone who loves world pvp this alone beats all bfa contentx100. Gold farming is important because gold is scarce, profession farming is an entire endgame on itself and better than most bfa content, raid consumable farming also, better BG‚Äôs.
---
Classic has a million times better endgame variety than bfa.
---
Get that baby early on and you'll be able to make some sweet $$ opening the door for slow people.
---
There's people butchering and enslaving other humans as we speak. But Reddit posters are the most hateful people you've ever seen. SAD
---
You are literally getting upset that some guy "stole" a virtual account which rightfully belongs to him (as per Blizzard's ruling regarding account ownership, as they are the ultimate authority) from Chinese gold-farmers who haven't touched it for 12 years.
---
They added the ability for all classes to essentially do this exact thing with force macros before the introduction of arena. I played rogue since day one vanilla and little things like this make the class extremely viable in the right hands. Less than 1% of players will even be good enough to do this without macros (which people WILL use). My guess is that you'll still be able to make a macro to duplicate this if the manual mouse over was removed. 
---
It's really only viable in a 2v1 or worse situation for the rogue which already places him at a disadvantage so who cares? Have one of two people stay at max range and it's useless anyway. Kick does nothing against mele. Blind is already ranged. This is just another tool to seperate good rogues from the mediocre.
---
i honestly havent seen a subreddit this toxic since r/incel. you guys are fucking ridiculous.
---
I could give a rats ass if I get into beta. Played since OG beta, and am solely concerned with the **game being done right**, not the feels of those who are literally getting yet another freebie handed to them who are least qualified to test the fucking game.
---
Gnome rogue for alliance. But yeah, search for it. there's tons of threads on this.
---
k
---
I think it won't be needed (less DPS is actually harder for heals in these cases because longer fights, and the damage of AoE abilities is something known and possible to mitigate by GFP), but yea fair enough :)
---
A content creator truly worthy of beta access
---
See: "How do I Play World of Warcraft Classic?"
---
Fair enough. I actually thought at first you were the initial poster in the comment chain.
---
&gt;What is the least played class?
---
nothing against another discussion :)
---
Listen to yourself. You are the only one being hostile. At NO point did I spin anything like someone is just another retail player. I assumed it was from retail because the title says someone was doubting classic. Why would anyone that only plays vanilla doubt classic? Ur being extremely hostile and I think you assume the worst of people when you read comments. Honestly losing faith in reddit from people like you
---
It's not about the item, or the beta. It's the attitude and response. I guarantee you, Asmon will be an asshole on launch.
---
No you're not.
---
&gt;Yea it was so hard that one dude managed to figure it out himself...
---
Spot the guy who has no fucking idea how software engineering works.
---
Evidently he was pursuing a passion project and got it to a barely workable state before you open up the project to larger development.
---
It's very fucking rare where you throw multiple engineers at a single task, it's once you need multiple implementations that you begin to add more workers.
---
It makes the most sense that one guy did it.
---
it was a dumb example of why upgrades feel good, sure, but people are literally sperging out acting like this is some HUGE LIE he's LYING TO JUMP ON THE HYPE TRAIN TO MAKE MORE MONEY BLIZZARD PAID HIM TO LIE HE'S JOINED THE ILLUMINATI HE'S MAKING IT UP CONNECT THE DOTS SHEEPLE CLASSIC WOW WAS AN INSIDE JOB
---
like holy fucking shit this sub
---
OP doesn't play video games clearly. Don't take the bait.
---
The rage comes from more white dps when dual-wielding and less opportunity cost on heroic strike. 
---
Damage, again white dps, talents that contribute more to dps and more rage to funnel into damage.
---
You're misunderstanding the survivability argument, it's not about actually surviving, it's about minimizing downtime. Spending 10 rage on Demo Shout will save you way more time than spending it doing damage due to how many more enemies you can take on before you need to take a break.
---
&gt;toxic
---
A '2k Andy' isn't going to have the negative impact as Soda or Asmongolds tard army.
---
Inb4 you end up on a server where the biggest guild is "Alinity's friends"
---
honestly dun morogh races are the best
---
probably to prove a point publicly
---
... about your comment.
---
Fixed that for you.
---
They started monetizing early with blizzcon access for the demo, and now with the sub requirement for the beta (no blizzard game or expansion beta has ever required a purchase before). Nothing surprises me any more from actibliz.
---
I kinda want to play on a pvp server with 2 streamers on each faction, imagine the chaos
---
You had to sub to get a chance at getting the beta?
---
There were a ton of legitimate errors in the demo though (including regen rates) so you can't trust that everything has been recreated on the new engine perfectly, it still all needs to be tested.
---
That's only one of the reasons. There was a really good video somewhere that went through some of the points and why you should avoid servers with big streamers on them. Some that I can think of now is
---
\*Log in timers
---
\*Ninja-looting
---
\*Horrible PvP-balance
---
\*Economy crash due to people farming gold and mats for the streamer.
---
&gt; pretending to lose the sentry cloak in a roll. (listen to Esfand say "that was a good roll dude")
---
Asmongold and Esfand made it into a tunnel-vision race as they had been doing while duo, not remembering there were other people around.
---
Esfand said a "good roll" referring to the contents of the chest, meaning that the random assortment of loot was better than average.
---
Esfand forgot to /roll, and Asmongold never cared, but they were competing with each other for fun--not conspiring to steal it.
---
/u/EsfandTV - Don't let Asmongold or his enablers drag you into drama. **This was clearly an oversight on your part** but you will be held responsible for damaging the community if you support his cold, cynical approach to group interaction.
---
"You get an upgrade with only 6 Intellect and 3 Stamina and you can FEEL your spells hitting harder".
---
lol, that's like... 0.1% crit? 0 spell power.
---
Ok dude
---
/r/wow isn't as toxic as this place and this place isn't as toxic as /r/wowservers.
---
Lmao they're not going to start being your friend cause you defend them on reddit
---
Dude....I had another race and class planned out but I'm remaking my original gnome rogue now.
---
Fortunate for me I'm in EU which doesn't have any of the bigger streamers :)
---
My friend just got invited 30 minutes ago
---
That would be Pog if it's around 50/50 population
---
OMG thank you, I didn't know that, thought it was lore-less like DEoI!
---
My faith was misplaced :(

Omar GODzalez

All hail lord Omar! King in the blizzard!
---
Playing since closed beta as well actually. I'm not saying that mouseover shouldnt work (possible with addons anyways) but the remove of the focus frame makes it obvious what their intent is. Im not saying mouseover should be removed, but 100% guaranteed you're not supposed to keep your Combo Points.
---
Of course it raises the skill cap, so does the use of focus frames. But this is vanilla.
---
No doubt. I wonder if they play the old game internally for fun occasionally?
---
Godspeed. May the gank be with you.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq1znd/asmongold_and_esfand_ninja_sentry_cloak_on_stream/eo0wers
---
Yes.
---
so people just farm mats and send them to the steamers? lol lame af
---
Because nobody would pay it...?
---
dunno gnome rogue is pretty fun
---
gnome warrior tank too
---
&gt;Stop trying to twist what happened to push some false agenda, it's ridiculous.
---
How about you do the same? Hunter stated roll, you didn't. How is that trying to twist shit? Its more ridiculous how both Asmongold and you deflect. Asmongold is a know asshole and ninja, be associated with assholes, become an asshole
---
Most played - Warrior, Mage, Rogue 
---
Least played - Druid, Paladin
---
Hopefully they divide it to English/Spanish/German/French like in retail, otherwise there probem arises again, what if you accdientally choose a server the german community chose
---
if its your first time why are you getting a beta?
---
The only reason TLPs don‚Äôt show longevity is that they release new ones to kill the old ones. Every TLP since Fippy has at least tripled P1999‚Äôs active numbers. P1999 is the same people for years and years. There‚Äôs no influx of new blood. It‚Äôs not a healthy or happy server, it‚Äôs neckbeards fighting over 20 year old elf sim eCred via RMTs. 
---
Classic WoW is gonna do great. But it‚Äôs not gonna approach Live. It‚Äôs gonna be a ghost town in 2 years if it lasts that long. Remember also: In EQ, raid content is mostly viable for years. WoW raid content is only viable for months.
---
There is an armour rating on it
---
Not exactly. Quest routing takes time and I wanted to get started early in order to have a usable platform by the time Classic launches. Additionally, the ingame API isn't great for such an endeavour while modern browsers are very efficient and compatible on all machines. Quests are often cryptic and resources like wowhead see constant use, so it makes sense for the guide to be of the same medium for direct linking.
---
God i want to play classic but i absolutely do NOT want to play classic.
---
Maybe just learn to tolerate different people.
---
play on a rp server like a pussy, that said, if you try to avoid streamers on a pvp server, youll end up on a dead one and miss all the fun that is ganking streamers
---
the price is more than fair, as for single parents and multiple children ...well michael jackson sang it best "when you cant feed the baby, then dont have the baby". 
---
Sorry my jaded self coming through so back in ye old 2005 i was 14 do you know what my parents (both of them because i came from a stable background) said oh can i have ¬£15 a month to play a game that all my friends are hyped about?....i got told it was ridiculous and I had plenty of game that didn't have a subscription, when it was my own money I could spend it how I wish.
---
So what i did was go on to reddit and moaned about it being a pricing issue.....oh wait no i didn't I went out and got a job every staurday 6am till 4pm I worked my ass off on a farm. I would clean up animal crap and sort the incoming harvests (mainly potatoes which stink btw) but when I got that first wage packet DAMMM it was worth it.
---
After months of saturdays and the odd sunday morning id even earned enough money to retire the old packard bell desktop from toy'r'us and build my first real pc. Moral of the story being noone owes you anything not blizzard, not your parent, not society at large, you want something its down to you to get it.
---
The wow community as a whole is pretty toxic now tbh.
---
There are some bitter, sad people here.
---
It's really strange to see. It's almost like they echo the complete shithole of a community the forums are.
---
Wrong.
---
No. All you need is a sub.
---
Did a streamer ban you from their channel? It sounds like you've been severely hurt by one of them.
---
Filthy horde
---
kinda.
---
Just got invited, or just got the email?
---
The emails are usually 24+ hours apart.
---
100% support this and was going to post something similar.
---
The negativity needs to be limited, or at least constructive.
---
Share what we love about this game, I‚Äôve been playing since 2004, I love the slower pace, more challenging leveling, class design etc. of vanilla. But also just love the raids and PvP system of BFA.
---
Man do I wish BFA had the leveling experience, and class design of vanilla, it would be a dream come true. And hopefully with the following expansions we can pressure Blizzard to stop straying away from what made us love the World of Warcraft in the first place.
---
Your only argument is literally "It's a beta". Maybe some people do care? Have you ever asked yourself that? Better question is, why are you defending shit behavior?  Asmon is boasting about being an asshole all the time, get your head out of your ass, jc.
---
Yeah, think of asmo or Soda that has 30k+ viewers. Atleast 10% of those will be playing and atleast 200-300 of them will be playing WITH them, FOR them.
---
All in all, I don't think people dislike streamers per se, but the communities that streamers entail
---
But not uniformly, so it's good it's gone
---
Is it the same swifty as in vanilla? I think he was a night elf warrior
---
I can‚Äôt wait for players like this guy to attempt the level to 60 when Classic launches and cry until they quit the game lol. Hopefully I can kill a few of them in STV before they leave the game.
---
Oh yes Im a huge fanboy, sure. I like the guy but he's also an obnoxious dick too, I just think you're getting too big of a hateboner for no reason
---
Probably because they want a wider variety of kinds of people that are going to play this game, as opposed to just '06 OG NEETS.
---
I really think this will happen too. Having active classic servers should allow Blizz to get metrics showing what might keep someone engaged with vanilla but not BfA. Some systems they can't take back, obviously, but I foresee a redesign of how leveling works in retail at least.
---
Another possibility is that having classic servers may free up Blizz to make more drastic changes to retail. Not necessarily a bad thing either, if they can make a more engaging game in retail by making more changes to the systems that are definitively WoW, then it's not such a huge issue when the proper WoW is still there to be played (without risk of server shutdown). They may see more stable sub numbers when you have 2 games to play, allowing experimentation without so much risk.
---
I tried Gnome, but their obnoxious "I can't cast that yet" was too much.
---
Sorry but no
---
To be fair, there are a extremely limited number of items in the game that have no stats AND no armour.
---
&gt; Skinning targeting bug. When skinning a body, your target will reset to the skinned body when the loot window opens.
---
This is blizzlike.
---
epic
---
not to be rude but is this your first week on the internet?
---
It gets really fucking tiring seeing the same handful of posts over and over again.
---
-"resurrected my retail account! look, my vanilla character!"
---
-picture of game boxes
---
-picture of computer desk
---
-"what class should I play?"
---
-object labeling meme
---
etc
---
Just tons of super repetitive low-effort posts.
---
You had naysayers. You didn't have miserable shit to the extent that i've been seeing here.
---
Are you Blizzard to make this claim?
---
The beta is to find bugs **and** for marketing reasons
---
BC was a great expac. Wrath was OK. Cata was the first truly upsetting expac, at least for me.
---
The core game is leveling and exploring the world. Blow past that as a new player and it‚Äôs almost guaranteed they‚Äôll fall out of the game within 3 months.
---
How is it at 60? I was a wrath baby really, only got into the mid thirties in vanilla before I couldn't afford a subscription
---
Your opinion of my opinion strongly suggests you need to wind your neck in. As previously stated I really couldn't give a shit how you are anyone else approaches a game, it has no affect on me in anyway. If you on your breakneck trajectory to your own personal nirvana should finally reach it, I for one will not judge your methodology.
---
Commenting to come back later and look. Appreciate the work!
---
Even vanilla had community posts to help players. Like on the internet.
---
Well someone has to ring the gong on a server in order to open AQ40. And by the time the War Effort is going on most guilds will be clearing Ony/MC/BWL in one raid night. What else is there to do except for farming and leveling alts?
---
Being in a guild is a whole different thing in Vanilla than later expansions. It's a huge commitment but also something you are very proud of. People want to be in THE GUILD on their particular server. That includes guild-wide farming for legendary items. It may only be one person wielding Thunderfury, Sulfuras, Atiesh or riding the Qiraji mount but that only increases the guilds reputation. Same goes for having multiple rank 14s in your guild. That is something that will be recognized across the server.
---
We still had the tutorial pages, different to let people know about things without doing it for them.
---
True that.   
---
The classic community went through so much shit for so long to make this eventually happen, i'm not surprised they are a bit pissy now all the spergs are getting in on classic. Once it launches, the hype dies down and the community balances out after the initial wave people will calm down.
---
It's all about the population. 20k server with 10k Soda fans versus 5k server with 2k "random andy" fans.
---
Vanilla had bot community and the most hard core of facist assholes. Welcome!
---
As an example. As of the time of this post, "WoW" is logging in at 4th on twitch, has the top spot on twitch over the last few days, and will likely take it again later today. This is free advertising for Blizzard.   
---
Think of the symbiotic relationship here. Streamers want viewers, and companies want free advertising. The company breaks out a "beta test" that really should be really just called a "streamer demo" at this point, and the streamers get viewers. It's a win-win.
---
Let organic discussion happen. If it dies it dies.
---
all hail our hero Omar the Relentless
---
Lucky for us, the people of this subreddit will certainly be a minority.
---
How could we possibly know.
---
I like this
---
It‚Äôs listed in your drop down list in wow where your sub accounts are, will be listed as BETA. ( where ptr is )
---
Based Omar
---
Watcha gonna play?
---
Ofc, ive been part one a world event myself back in the day, i obviously just meant events done in bad faith, also a streamer has the power to start something which also they cant stop again cuz of the fangroup taking it too far.
---
Omg. I‚Äôm having a discussion with someone who keeps saying I‚Äôm a prick because I didn‚Äôt know who this PvP guy is. I‚Äôm like wtf! He thinks I‚Äôm being assuming that the guy only plays retail because I haven‚Äôt heard of him. It‚Äôs really frustrating because I thought he was trolling at first because it was so ridiculous! I just told him to take a look at his comments and see how he‚Äôs reacting. So immature. I feel you man, I‚Äôm thinking about leaving this sub and just sticking with YouTube for my news.
---
tbh considering asmons persona is boasting about all the times he screws people over, cant be mad at people for assuming the narative he himself always pushes.
---
BIG TRUE
---
Are you serious? Was anything I said not factual?
---
People on this sub is delusional if they think they'll easily be able to gank, and camp streamers, or form guilds that can easily do it. Some of these streamers at peak streams have more people watching them than there are current subscribers to this subreddit. You're just being delusional if you otherwise.
---
Dual wielding while leveling is awful and only makes your kill speed even more random from miss/dodge/parries.
---
If you think a beta is all about testing then you‚Äôre plain wrong. It‚Äôs to build up the hype as well. Including as many people (especially ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù), even if they haven‚Äôt played the original game, helps with that. Don‚Äôt you think?
---
he's doing it for the money, this guy was nowhere to be found when nost got shut down. he didnt give a fuck
---
That sword sure does cut two ways.
---
As of now I‚Äôm leaning toward PVE and ill tell you why. I‚Äôm trying to imagine what a PVP server will be like a few months after the final phase is released and all the top guilds have all of their members decked out in all BIS gear and are bored. I think it‚Äôs conceivable we will see roaming ganking raids terrorizing zones and making the game unplayable. I believe it‚Äôs conceivable that having progression locked at a certain point will drive world pvp to extremes even vanilla WoW never reached.  So I go back and forth between wanting to be part of that possible chaos and just playing it safe.
---
The haircut lmao
---
Nice burn bro - like sick.
---
"Failing" just means you have to try again.  The node doesnt disappear or anything, but it can take a few tries.
---
At some point leveling herbalism becomes difficult; I always remembered doing a LOT of extra running around to try to get the handful of levels between 60 and 75.
---
These are a pain because all the accessible herbs are "green" and the chance to gain a level on them is very slim.
---
This makes for a shit load of minor healing potions though.  Which are awesome to chug or hand out to random people you see.
---
Anyway, the point is that when I played Tauren I had to do less of this - I would say it only amounts to shaving a couple of hours off of your herb leveling time.
---
I think it's more of a flavor thing tbh
---
No one knows. They will only add people when they feel they need people.
---
The only way to know is to keep an eye on the subreddit exploding with a post that says "Just got in beta" with other people confirming as well.
---
Would be awesome if you added a loot table to this site. Great job anyway!!
---
Dumbfucks. I QA tested triple A games for 3 years, I wish I had the chance to properly test this game and provide reproduction steps, even film it. But dumbasses like this one get access. Fuck my life
---
Well yea, but Sulf/TF/Atiesh/ranks "farm themselves" while regular raiders still get  other things. It's like if you make raiders to farm Arcanite Bars for the MC legendaries, or farm consumables for those busy ranking. Not commonly done.
---
Oh look a zoomer getting out of the Twitch echo chamber to come in a place where people can expose frauds without being instantly banned from the chat.
---
&gt;army of people watching at his screen noticing bugs he can miss
---
What part of "he doesnt care about submitting bugs" you dont get?
---
&gt;if streamer doesnt report bug some of his viewers can
---
No they can't, and even if they did, they are bfa viewers anyways so they dont give a shit either.
---
Because you'll never stop?

---
The problem here is Person b is absolutely sure Person A is lying with bad intent and not just misattributing feeling the stat increases to placebo (like he thinks he‚Äôs getting stronger so he feels like he‚Äôs getting stronger). He is also level 18 in that video which shows he‚Äôs played for a good while, which someone who was just making shit up and didn‚Äôt actually like the game wouldn‚Äôt deal with.
---
Don‚Äôt take this as an ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù but I just think you‚Äôre being a bit of a dick here you know?
---
You sound like you jerk off to "content creators".
---
Strafting back is much faster...
---
I'd be surprised if there wasn't tbh.
---
EU's official language isn't English. I understand your worries and I'm pretty sure Blizz will make servers to certain language groups, but I think it's also part of the EU experience to have different languages seen in the game.
---
Does anybody know if this is the same Swifty that rolled with Infamous on Darkspear? I heard rumors as early as late vanilla that the account was sold.
---
Jesus christ , everyone need to calm the fuck down , ever since beta was release theres this witch hunt about who ever say something bad about classic wow . Quinn is a chill guy he troll and say shit all the time calm down ppl .
---
but THEY should be in the beta reporting things that arnt wrong too!
---
A game for people with no life with people who are saying they played it 15 years ago. That's depressing.
---
It never worked like this in vanilla. You're supposed to lose your combo points when you target something else, which included the original mouseover addons since they technically worked by changing targets back and forth very quickly. The inclusion of modern mouseover mechanics is clearly an oversight that should be fixed because it literally buffs a class. This is not working as intended and is actually a major buff to rogues in PvP.

Look, as a neckbeard, I didn't quite make it in life so I find solace in ripping on steamers. What else am I suppose to do? I'm border line a incel and if I can't rip on random people on the internet, I might as well get a rope and chair and find the nearest ceiling fan.
---
Gnomes are a plague on this earth and they need to be stopped
---
Lol it means first time playing the beta. If u don't think Swifty played vanilla I have a lot of questions for you. He was probably the most popular player in vanilla. He is wrong in this clip but come on man
---
You dont get it...when a big streamer joins a server, their audience IS the population. Like a plague of locusts, they'll come and go, leaving nothingness in their wake. Seriously though..once the streamer quits, the server takes a shit.
---
Was never offended or hurt by anything on the sub. Just wrote my general thoughts on it.
---
This is very helpful but he doesn't mention battle shout at all. Battle shout if I remember correctly was sort of a secret weapon of good tanks.
---
This is why I'm not entirely convinced that re-releasing expansions is the right choice here. It will only extend the lifetime of the product by a fixed amount, i.e. it will still inevitably die once wrath is re-released and they run out of content.
---
If classic is the success that I think it will be I think Blizzard really ought to consider an alternative approach to ensure long term success. Only time will tell ofcourse.
---
I'm sure the QA testers enjoy filtering through all of this garbage. Not a waste of time at all
---
I hate the fact that people will use these type of Addons - that's probably just personal bias though
---
Nice job.

I wish the Collector's Edition was going to be delivered *before* Classic's release.

---
"hey you! over there! stop having fun and doing your own thing! i hate it. it's bothering me."
---
That's just sad.
---
I was temporarily watching Esfand stream yesterday and they were having trouble with a higher level mob. It was a challenge for them and they then began to seriously recommend level scaling mechanics as a good "solution" to the "problem".
---
Retail streamers and their familiars are such babies, it's incredible how spoiled they are when they don't get to faceroll effortlessly.
---
Btw including new players to classic is what makes classic great to a certain point. Those are the players that can experience the world that you used to love so much and will have that experience for the first time. People like you honestly just piss me off.
---
You're right, and I hope you're also right in this case. Everything you say I agree with and just hope that the actual in-game communities and experiences are not the ones I am visioning from my exposure to this sub-reddit.
---
there audience is a portion of the population.
---
Druid looked least played to me.
---
I've watched every season 9 timez
---
not doing this *yet*
---
Well mine has a volume number in side. I think it's edit version 2?
---
People do hate streamers, but I don't see much hate for new players.
---
I‚Äôve been making these points since Wrath introduced heirlooms, ez mode and dungeon queues, but people adamantly disagreed with me on the forums back then.
---
You're practically melting right now
---
Realistically, ‚Äúbfa sucks‚Äù should be the free space and 5 other spaces
---
I thought so too but after pserver playing and classic beta playing i realize its very fun but it doesn't rewrite or take away from my vanilla memories. I enjoy it for many of the reasons for this video and others but since its been 14 years or whatever it feels new. 
---
It is really a good experience and we will see how end game goes ( im mostly looking forward to the leveling experience for now) But I do not expect this to ruin or change my nostalgia at all it will most likely be new nostalgia 4-5 years down the road
---
What he actually said is he doesn‚Äôt report anything unless it‚Äôs a blatantly obvious bug because he isn‚Äôt 100% sure on if it was an actual thing in vanilla or if it‚Äôs a bug most of the time. 
---
I get you people have some irrational jealousy fueled hate boner for streamers in the beta but let‚Äôs try to be accurate mmmkay
---
Some people need a busy social life for fulfillment, but for others a small circle of friends and a hobby is enough.
---
Others are dedicated to their career or kids, but some arent.
---
People have different lives. That's all I meant
---
Sure, they can farm in either their pve or their pvp spec, but the specs are still different.
---
There's literally NOTHING that could validate being toxic to each other, even if the one being angry has some good points. Toxicity absolutely deserves to be called out, arguments like ad personam always drive the level of discussion down. Blaming someone who calls toxicity out for worsening the health of discussion is just wrong, outright illogical.
---
That said, I don't really want to take sides in this discussion. I definitely think that OP could've handled his cricisism much better, but there's no need for such a horrible blame shifting to validate insults.
---
What? I'm not even talking about 100% of the sub, you moron. I'm talking about the people that help the threads  to the front page of this sub-reddit which aren't meaningful, relevant discussions. Literally just threads to hate on people for no reason. 
---
Perfectly capable of being mature at an age under 20. Can see you aren't though! :)
---
Thats why people should avoid streamer realms at all costs.
---
Great speculation.
---
I disagree, vanilla endgame is fun but it‚Äôs missing the challenge. I enjoy competitive play and to me the more simple rotations and mechanics just make that aspect not as strong as current content.
---
That said endgame is pretty much the only thing that BFA does well and the only thing that holds it back are the poor class design that was amazing in Legion so hopefully they can fix that soon.
---
has he just been trashing the idea of classic in general or did he go on a rant about classic being too hard or something? I haven't been watching any WoW stuff since I quit years ago
---
Yup. Prime reason to not commit to a server until a week or at least a few days after launch so you know where all the big names have settled.
---
Just what i was looking for, Thanks
---
:(
---
Haha, this place isn't toxic. There's actually a lot of friendly comments. You're overly sensitive if you feel it's toxic.
---
Lmao kid, help your pa out.
---
Warlock as Sm/Ruin
---
You could use it like that, but I made it quite open-ended and flexible so you can pick and choose your own adventure. I play this game because of how satisfying it is to make incremental progress over time, but as an adult I kind of need to make the free time I have count.
---
Vanilla wow has no built in indicators where and when quests open, and even if it did you would end up doing ten loops around each zone while completing singular quests each time when you could wait for a critical mass of quests and get away with just one or two loops. With this guide I can set goals and schedule things to, for example, save contested zones like STV for a weekend to play during off hours to avoid getting ganked for hours on end.

Just seeing how well Asmon did on a 15 year old dungeon, well, gotta ride the money/hype train too ya' know.
---
Why is it when i go to make a new character it starts me at level 5.52?
---
Watched a bunch of MadSeasonShow classic coverage and watched a shit-load of montages from 2005-2006. I really like the look of both mage and warlock - but warlock soul shard mechanics put me off it slightly. Will probably play Mage and Warrior and level both (uni student so plenty of free time all the time) and see how the abilities feel. Rogue was my original choice but Mage and Warrior both neck-at-neck for it now.
---
so all of those people world wide are going to go on to the same US server at launch? your telling me absolutely nobody will join that server who does not watch asmon?
---
\#Omar2020 #makeazerothgreatagain
---
Correct, I don't map out the initial zones since they are very small, self explanatory and have class specific quests which I don't want to deal with. Everyone gets out of their entry zone around level 5¬Ω.
---
Came here to say the same thing.  Watching asmongold stream SFK, he's just running into packs of five mobs (one being a boss) and nobody in his group's health seems to drop at all.  There is something very wrong, I don't care what anyone says about blizzard's internal server.
---
Retail isn't too far gone.
---
&gt;Sadly, blizz decided to kill the game by focusing the people that shouldn't be playing it in the first place,
---
Which is still a big part of the player base, if you want a game that caters to the pure hardcore 24/7 grinders you have Wildstar and we all know what happenned to Wildstar.
---
no but why would u report bugs if you have no fucking clue what a bug is and what not
---

I would imagine they're looking for more perspectives than just existing fans
---
This is why I love this team. They aren't just making the game. Classic is running through their veins and in their hearts. 
---
The ability to overcome years of doubt thinking it could not be done, by weeks of labor to prove it could.
---
Thank you Blizz, and thank you Omar.
---
My experience is that you don't have to make anyone do anything. If you are in the type of guild where someone is dedicated enough to make the huge time invest (Which Scarab Lord is) then there will also be people that's gonna help out. Especially if there is a dedicated guild on the opposing faction you have a rivalry with.
---
The sense of community in Vanilla guilds are on another level compared to modern WoW.
---
Difficulty isn't equal to time spent. You know this.
---
Do you seriously have any idea on the scope of implementing a modern codebase and teaching it to learn functions on 15 year old software?
---
Ffs, this got me bad. I feel bad for laughing.
---
Have you extensively tested these things, or are you just making assumptions ? 'Cuz after leveling 4 different warriors to test this stuff I found both of those statements to just be common misconceptions.
---
They say they don't want handouts but you know for a fact they will leech their community dry of gold and items.
---
dread it run from it classic still arrives
---
Yet Esfand did send that cloak to Asmon and here is the reaction on stream. [https://clips.twitch.tv/LongHandsomeCamelWoofer](https://clips.twitch.tv/LongHandsomeCamelWoofer)
---
OFC esfand act like innocent baby jesus, "this is 10-19 twink cloak" "we gonna give to someone why gonna play low lvl bg's". When in fact stats are almost bis even at 30 cap. You will always remain "big streamers" bitch boy in my eyes. And stop wasting everyones time with your scammy shit posting.
---
I find it ironic you're calling the sub toxic for calling out ninja looting? I'd see a community that normalized ninja looting as toxic.   
---
Is toxic just a buzzword for things people dont like?

Yup. I sent this video to my nay Sayer buddies

I am glad I will be playing on a german server and there aren't that many big german wow streamers afaik.

One guy, *out of only less than a handful left from Vanilla's release in 2004*.
---
Your safest bet for a mature and friendly experience is rolling up on an rp server. Hopefully rp-pvp ends up happening.
---
That could also be from private servers where people had dynamic respawn and since blizzard can't acknowledge them without being somewhat forced to take them down they only reference BFA
---
We made a prank video about deleting the scepter bc our server was getting so ridiculous...

Lmao the hate boner this reddit has for streamers playing beta. We get it you dont have beta and you are baby raging. He's never played vanilla like many people and hes a streamer with connections ofc he will get in to the beta.
---
I've got to agree. There is a lot of hate to streamers, to retail players, to 'people who never played vanilla', but i'd argue it comes from a minority of loud people rather than the subreddit as a whole. 
---
If you can pass over the negativity then stay and join the hype-train as there's plenty of positivity here too. If you'd prefer not to see it at all, that's pretty understandable, and these 3 months will probably pass quicker without the constantly rising anticipation.
---
The game itself will be much less toxic than this sub indicates by the way. Nobody wants to group with an arsehole. And, trolling was an art-form in vanilla, the best artists were respected for it.
---
If it helps the community playing beta is everything people hoped it would be.

I .. don't understand why you used that quote. What are the facts? That I don't play video games? Didn't expect gaming communities to be rainbows and unicorns - doesn't mean as a paying member of the community and active involvement stops me from allowing to say my thoughts on it.
---
me too
---
I don't think you should worry about money in vanilla as with time you will get enough, and lets be real here, 95% of people here have no idea how things like goldfarming and other stuff will work there...  
---
And you can do like that chick that wanted a epic mount for a mount back in the day
---
A person who knows nothing of the original game, that's what. I think someone was working on a video that has all the clips of people not knowing a thing about vanilla and reporting stupid things as "bugs". lol
---
That last sentence makes it less funny.
---
You‚Äôre a retard too so what‚Äôs one retard replaced with another
---
tons of good ideas once I figured out what a few of the latter were, thanks!
---
If he was serious hes at least reporting bugs so taking what a beta means seriously.  Why do you have a problem with that?  Because omg he didn't know that's how it was.  We don't know what we don't know.
---
That's just wrong. I am sure he's lying, but I never said I'm absolutely 100% positive he did this with malicious intent. Actually quite the opposite. I literally said "I tend to believe" which is very far away from "I absolutely sure". But very well. Carry on downvoting me for not believing everything somebody says on the internet. Live in your dream world where nobody ever dares to lie especially if might be a smart business decision.
---
Exactly. Beta isn't a privilege reserved for those who would most enjoy or most deserve it. It's a beta test realm.
---
They should just add "Large Stature" or something as a racial to Taurens just so people have an in-game reminder of it, seeing as it is a hidden racial that is now confirmed to be intended.
---
Eh, only reason I'm replying to every comment is so that they all get a reply and know it doesn't harm me with their circle jerking. I'm not in the negatives yet on thread upvotes, so there is people out there with common sense.
---
Melting, softie quite the vocabulary explains alot.
---
As a casual browser of the sub-reddit, I don't find it very toxic at all. In fact, I find it quite friendly and welcoming, overall.
---
I'd the say the pleasantness to toxicity ratio is very healthy, unless one is specifically looking for things to highlight negative behavior, (ie. focusing on a big point of contention like streamers and ignoring all of the very positive attributes of the sub).
---
Good luck in the game, fellow adult.
---
When the game releases it will have a system that will basically create multiple instances of the game on one server. Once one layer's population reaches a certain point a new layer is created. It's to help with overcrowding during the initial release.
---
I hope they dont count me as a BFA player when im only subbing to play for classic.
---
Love you too buddy &lt;3
---
No, I mean that I've been apart of it long enough to be exposed to extremely toxic communities - waaaaay more toxic than video game communities. Especially as someone who's held a spot that maintains a community.
---
Using it for a twink is a good reason, if this wasn't a beta. I'm not saying it wasn't a scum move because ninja looting is. But anyone can agree that if you group with Asmon this is guaranteed to happen.
---
The guy has been exactly the same from the very start. He is very much not a meathead. 
---
He actually offered a pretty cool atmosphere and outlook on things. Compared to all the other popular personalities who‚Äôd be considered toxic and ragers in this day.
---
Eh people blowing this way our of proportion.
---
Back in the day he made a video switching to an offhand infight that damaged yourself so you got out of saps, sheeps etc.   
---
Did he really think he could switch other gear aswell? He must have  noticed ...
---
Here's a clue: "I'm under 20..."
---
OP probably has a degree in gender studies and spends his/her spare time lobbying to have pictures and statues of George Washington taken down because slavery or something.
---
i'm saying that most of the people who can will join the server that asmon is on, even those not in that region. that's how big a pull they are. even if 1/20th the players join thats still enough to overrun a population and move the server to that streamer's will.
---
&gt; t's kinda just a nice racial bonus
---
Depends a lot on class. It'll make kiting around your deadzone as a hunter or kiting around Earthbind as a shaman significantly tougher. 
---
I like the mechanic existing though.
---
&gt;unneeded training like unnecessary skills or professions to not have it by 50.
---
I blame maxing out Thorium Brotherhood, Mithril Order, and Sword specialization of Weaponsmithing specialization.
---
"This sub is toxic because it calls out ninja-looting and trolling"  
---
Wut?
---
then leave.
---
Do you have an install guide you can point me to? I am getting crashes on startup.
---
Hi, /u/m_kamalo
---
Oh, thats why.
---
Bingo.  This is the main reason right here.  
---
It is also due to the fact that it seems like the majority of people who got a beta invite actually played on the same account during classic.  So when people who played during classic don't get an invite and see people who are "retail babies" playing and reporting bugs that are definitely not bugs, they get upset.  
---
Rightfully so imo.  I understand Blizz wants those guys playing the beta for marketing purposes but it can feel like a slap in the face to the people that have been playing since '04.  I'm not upset thou.  You can basically play a private server for the same type of experience.
---
How was playing priest back then?
---
Dude, you've become a puddle.
---
*I hope you know I've just been messing around.*
---
Didn't say it was toxic to call it out. Said to hate on the streamer for doing so is toxic to do so, especially with those crying out streamer entitlement. You really think a thread about a streamer is going to get them cut from content too? These people are going to be accepted into any guild most the time.
---
The point of Classic is to recreate Vanilla. There shouldn't be any tools implemented on Classic that weren't around during that time. Classic is a great opportunity to showcase how far WoW has progressed as a game. 
---
Adding anything new would cheapen that experience and reinforce the idea many people have that Blizzard just caves to those who scream every time something is hard, takes time, or isn't viewed as fair simply because they don't want to put in any real amount of effort. 
---
Being a new player and getting lost was part of what made Vanilla so great. The newness of it all, the lack of hand holding, and the sense of accomplishment you got when you finally overcame something is what made Vanilla great. 
---
Was Vanilla perfect? Absolutely not. Was it frustrating at times? Hell yeah. Did it provide a fun and rewarding experience if you put in the necessary time? It most certainly did.
---
Vanilla was a completely different era of gaming. What is acceptable and expected today is vastly different to what was found back then. To try and impose current gaming standards, views, or ideas would completely destroy the Classic experience.
---
:0
---
I'm totally down for BC and WOTLK, but I'll stop when Cata comes out. That's a near 6 year content cycle, sign me up
---
The Original Poster is "gate keeper"
---
Imagine caring about what other people enjoy lol this sub getting annoyingly toxic
---
"what?"
---
First off its beta ....second i played in vanilla and private servers get alot wrong im confident in blizzards ability to recreate there own game
---
We'll see. Good shout also.
---
It's mostly people being salty of not getting the beta access.
---
In death a member of Project Classic has a name. His name is Omar Gonzalez.
---
It's a world of warcraft forum we are all messing around.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/wowclassic
---
See: "How do I Play World of Warcraft Classic?".
---
(No.)
---
thank u, next
---
The goblin AH in BB makes a living with thir auction cut on them
---
I bring up age because you weaponized it in your post.
---
See what I mean by you need to slap some more years on? You lack the presence of mind to know how your own "point" has been used against you.
---
Drop the high horse bullshit.
---
This sub is sadly going to be at least 50% of Classic WoW. I‚Äôll be sticking to guild and friends only to group. 
---
People think socializing went away in WoW because of expansions or something dumb. It went away because of people like them.
---
Because they got subscription obviously, their knowledge of vanilla must be superior to us
---
You're right in all three points. Glad that you have this type of mind-set, as it's something that I like to see and something I agree with. Glad someone like you commented, thanks.
---
If bitching = telling people to share positive stories about Vanilla, or share construction criticism about BFA then fine I‚Äôm bitching.
---
I just don‚Äôt understand how bitching about Retail in a classic subreddit makes sense and makes you happy.
---
C'mon man. A rope, chair and ceiling fan is not the answer you're looking for.
---
 That ceiling fan clearly wont support your weight, you're gonna need to find a load bearing cross beam or a sturdy tree to have any chance at all.
---
Lol thanks for clarifying that, I'm sure it was a legit question
---
Are you sure it wasn't written ironically or was the fella serious? Because to me this totally sounds like that do you know who I am rant.
---
Does that honestly cross your threshold for hateful?
---
I dunno, using Cannibalize on a gnome corpse is too dear to me.
---
I really want to play a priest but gnomes are just so tempting
---
Yes, idk what hes talking about lol
---
Reddit is toxic for the most part.
---
That's so odd because he was there in vanilla. Lol
---
I have a launch day CE account. No invite.  100% feelsbadman.
---
rather they release new servers for TBC, new content to vanilla is just retarded idea when theres like 1 original developer in the whole team
---
Esfand is (as far as I know) got popular thanks to vanilla private servers.
---
I'd love the cut content to come back, would be amazing.
---
Just don't scale new raids into classic, that would just be bad. Do something original instead.
---
What are you even talking about? Do you think that WoW was a game made in a vacuum? Blizzard had a community page and forums to help players with tools address the need for information. 
---
Go look at the wayback machine for warcraft and see how they tried to communicate with players. 
---
I'm not saying they need to make in game tools to help pander to new players. I'm saying they are gathering data, even from idiots like in the video. All data is useful information. There's a string of people trying to read between the lines about what I wrote.
---
Fuck off, Alex!
---
I don't quite get this point and I'm not sure if I want to.
---
I just want to raid. So I'll be playing on PVE. If I ever decide I want to do any PVP, I can just queue a BG or two.
---
I also don't like being bothered when I'm trying to level/gather.
---
This is the problem with most games these days, just kids not getting there own way/ generally negative people. 
---
I‚Äôm really excited by what I‚Äôve seen so far, really looking forward to seeing ubrs and lbrs.
---
:( Damn redditors.
---
Good morning Azeroth
---
yeah you are not wrong. Paladin was also a good healer though with his fast heal. 
---
How expensive/hard was it again to change your specs at lvl 60? Because I guess for raiding vs pvp you need to change your specs
---
There's no saying a team would have solved the problem any faster.
---
You're welcome.
---
Mob spawn rate seems to be pretty low. Moderately populated quest areas (like Hogger's camp) will have 5-10 people at it and every single gnoll is dead. You'll wait several minutes before one respawns, if you even have a chance to tag it. 
---
It makes Riverpaw Gnoll Bounty incredibly hard to complete especially considering that the drop rate on the armbands are very low. 
---
I can't imagine how difficult it would be with the launch of the game and more people in the area.
---
Stupid idea is stupid
---
Don‚Äôt prove OP‚Äôs point dude.
---
It's a bug you mongoloid.
---
Okay fair but then how are you ‚Äúsure he‚Äôs lying‚Äù!in the first place when he could just be mistaken due to placebo, I asked this last time and you didn‚Äôt answer. 
---
And there‚Äôs really no need to be haughty about believing him, I believe him because who the fuck would spend enough time to get to level 18 if they didn‚Äôt genuinely enjoy this game. 
---
The idea that people can be wrong without necessarily lying is not a novel concept and there‚Äôs not a ton of evidence to support the idea that he‚Äôs doing a sponsorship or is jumping on the hype train other than the fact that there is indeed a hype train at all.
---
Is this bait? 
---
How can it be rose colored nostalgia glasses if he‚Äôs actually playing it and experiencing it?
---
Normally that term is for the people who have fond memories that don‚Äôt align with reality. But when it‚Äôs a real-time experience, it doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
---
&gt; World PvP on a zone's border will be a mess with people phasing in and out
---
Wasn't this a thing in Vanilla though, i do remember this happening at some spots in Vanilla during wpvp also at some arbitrary zone borders. 
---
Maybe it was a pserver thing though, not 100% sure, let me see if i can find a movie showing this.
---
Youre probably too young to know him.
---
I don't pay attention to the streamers at all, just this sub - so I don't think anything about the streamers or what they will do. 
---
I'd expect there will be 2 types of guilds in classic WoW - those that are streamer friendly and those that aren't. Same goes for guilds that are 'troll' and 'ninja loot' friendly and those that aren't.
---
But seriously, LOL again at defending people ninja-looting and trolling and then calling others 'toxic' for not liking people like that and not wanting to be associated with them. /r/selfawarewolves shit right there
---
Will you be bound to a single layer or will it change alot?
---
Streamer culture is lots of tongue in cheek stuff like that. Don¬¥t make a fool out of yourself and get upset.
---
Well then it's even more scary, to agree that level scaling would be a good solution for classic is crazy.
---
Fortunately Reddit is just a small portion of the whole Classic community.
---
Maybe so you have the chance to say 'First bug submitted bois' in Quins accent because that shit's funny and he's an entertainment streamer.
---
Except for various aspects of the game there weren't. World 1st onyxia strats were kept topsecret by the various attempting guilds, because leaking strats could potentially make them lose their chance of killing her first.
---
The jealousy is at an 11 in here for sure. Salt-filled
---
Yes it does.  6 int at level 20 is pretty much 1% crit.  As a frost mage that gets 100% damage bonus from crits.  This will increase the dps he deals.
---
Except they get up to 14k armor, defense rating, and 40% dodge.
---
You completely didn't get the point but that's okay, you linked a sub-reddit. Your point was made.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to rape all these retail players and hear the lamentations of their women.
---
So many scrubs
---
they have more polygons and thats it, some people prefer old school graphics and some people prefer modern ones, unless the graphics are literally badly made, its just about preferences
---
incredible memory tricks!
---
I mean, they are going to get lots of dumb bug reports that aren‚Äôt actually bugs. This is just one more. I‚Äôm sure Blizz just ignores obvious dumb reports. 
---
Should he purposefully submit bad bug reports, no. Should anyone lose sleep over this? No.
---
Someone earlier today were talking about a streamer with a name finishing by 'y' that seems really interesting, was testing the game and its mechanics. Not rush to be 'first lol' like 15 years after the game went out.
---
As much as i disagree with the salty vets in here acting entitled about beta, Blizzard have said the point of the beta is just to test fidelity. They arent looking to change gameplay or anything based on feedback, so its not a normal beta in that regard (although obviously plenty of bugs dont require knowledge of vanilla to realize they are bugs)
---
Yuck.
---
Tutorial pages still exist don't they?
---
The debuff limit is going to be 16.
---
are you a streamer?
---
Yeah last sentence loses its zing. The image is funnier if you imagine it's the kid.
---
Yup, this is all just a misdirected, misguided attempt at coping with not being able to play. It is genuinely sad to see so many of these people that would be so happy if they were ingame right now.
---
based retard kiwi
---
Yeah they didn't literally enslave orcs.
---
" The Tauren character model has a larger attack range than other humanoid models; the feral form models do not benefit from this as the feral form is no longer a Tauren. Simply put: when you shapeshift to a smaller form (feral), you will need to get closer in order to attack ‚Äì this is not a bug. " - Blue Post Tharfor. 10 years ago.
---
This will help avoid elite NPCs that kill me when botting. Thanks! üéâ
---
The stat for that item is "2 Copper" ;)
---
I agree. OP should be banned from streaming classic wow as it would ruin my classic experience
---
I think so far it is only elite mobs that seem to be undertuned.  Maybe my entire childhood is a lie and everyone here is remembering incorrectly, but level 24 dungeon elites are critting for 73 damage on tanks with 1200 hp.  It just can't be right.
---
That's why they're doing layering. They have already confirmed mob spawn rates to be accurate in their "not a bug" blue post.
---
I agree with you honestly. 
---
It seems some people are so exhibiting gate-keeper syndrome here and it‚Äôs utterly ridiculous. 
---
Vanilla was amazing and I do feel somewhat lucky I was alive at the time to play it, but that doesn‚Äôt make anyone better than anyone else for playing it... it‚Äôs that cliquey mentality that just highlights that maybe some of those people exhibiting that behaviour haven‚Äôt really achieved much in life, and their most note-worthy achievement thus far stems from being alive and happening upon vanilla wow and playing it when it was available. 
---
I‚Äôll be downvoted to oblivion, but they know who they are...
---
You can actually set your own mangos server and test there everything you want to test (that is soloable). I've done that and run all kinds of builds to check how things work. It won't be 100% accurate but pretty close to that but here's my suggestion: don't burn yourself out with grinding in your own server or some other popular server before classic releases. It's only a few more months waiting
---
They enslave the orc because they were committing genocide on large scale. Lol.
---
Actually the amount of gold needed to respec is proportional to the number of respecs u already did. Most of the time as a priest you had to lvl in shadow spec and then once you reached the 60 ding, you could continue as a shadow priest for pvp or respec in discipline/holy in order to start farming T0. If it was the first time you actually respec, it would be free, then the second time it would be 10po (I guess but once again not sure since I played it like 15 years ago) up to 100 po. So be careful to the specialization you choose at the very beginning and don‚Äôt make any useless choices in your template :)
---
Thanks I didnt know that
---
Damn, got a degree under the age of 20. Don't even know why I'm spending my time on a game when I should be out there leading the ways for gender studies! All seriousness, I am a student but not in gender studies. Doing comp security and it's good, you should check it out if you ever wanna re-visit education.
---
Of course Blizz is going to prioritize streamers. Those few people can reach a massive audience and generate huge amounts of hype.
---
At the end of the day this is all about Blizz making money. The best and quickest way to get the word out about Classic and draw in subs is to have streamers play. 
---
Some random guy playing the beta for a few hours a week isn't going to generate anything for Blizzard.
---
Thanks for that. Next question.
---
I have so far confirmed that Joana's alliance guide is wrong (as it was written for pservers). The values are off and thus, you can skip quests for a faster route. What makes you think yours will survive classic when the speedrunner himself can't guarantee his?
---
BC was objectively a better version of vanilla, it had what vanilla had but most specs where pretty viable and gameplay got better. Wotlk on the other hand was the start of the decline with the LFG shit
---
Asmongold streaming SFK... Jesus dungeons are so bad as in retail.
---
Very fucked up, ez threat, low dmg, aoeing everything.
---
He's tanking with thunder clap, rend and revenge against a mage and not losing threat. Not even using sunder armor.
---
JESUS, I PREFER TO LOSE KARMA THEN TO SEE THIS SHIT GOES LIVE.
---
using a modern framework*
---
&gt;nochanges
---
Into the trash the opinion goes.
---
Classic wow is still a casual mmo to me. Go play EverQuest or daoc and come back and tell me classic wow is hard.
---
3x AV Mark quest turn-in, if I don't remember it wrong.
---
I get it kid. The point is you're special and you and your streamer friends should be able to do anything you want without rep consequences. If OTHER people act shitty, they are toxic.
---
People are better at the game.
---
We have known people will faceroll content the entire time.
---
No it's not fair, this sub is definitely pretty toxic lmfao, that guy is out of touch.
---
Iirc you needed a wow sub for wow beta. Maybe that was jus the PTR though...
---
I kinda doubt we will see a return to the 5+ million subscriber base. I hope I'm wrong.
---
Only I'm allowed to have opinions, snowflake!
---
haha nah. I don't watch any streamers. I do like watching youtube clips of Brian Kibler playing Hearthstone, though. So I do kind of get the appeal. He's just a good guy (super chill and laughs when he loses) and explains his plays well.
---
I just understand the difference between really talented people (and how much work goes into real youtube content) and the low-effort mostly-talentless streamers.
---
I actually REALLY like gatekeepers when it comes to content. Not a huge fan of the low-quality UGC that is popular these days.
---
The fundamental premise of most RPGs is that armor has stats. 
---
It is kind of dumb that the boots don't even have a single point of armor, and one could easily understand confusion on that point: the item literally says you are just as protected as being barefoot. 
---
Blizzard knows how things should work, if they look at it and decide "Nah, starting gear doesn't have armor." Okay, I'd rather a dozen false negatives I can categorically rule out than someone not report an actual bug for fear of ridicule. 
---
Your elitism is not nearly as interesting as you think it is.
---
While I get the beta "ruining" the excitement for leveling 1-30 for the "first" time, making become more of a chore for launch. Growing to like a character that's going to be deleted.
---
However I'm really enjoying my time so far. My Hunter is lvl 11 just got my pet last night. There are people everywhere. There are only two servers atm a pvp, and pve, and there both packed especially in the starter zones, barrens, etc.
---
You're not very well versed in orc lore are you, they should probably have noticed a difference when their blood craze ended
---
EHHH OHHHH
---
*you can feel that one extra cast!
---
Fixed it :)
---
Huehueheueheueheu
---
You can't make this shit up, rofl...
---
Sure, but there might be an opportunity to make them more accurate for small updates or things they might have missed.
---
i dont think esfand or asmongold would do this
---
I would love for Blizz act like this is a multiverse and start all over this time around and just continue to pump out new content for classic, add TBC and WOTLK and never let deathwing destroy the world. Only allow flying in the Outlands or just remove it completely. Just keep progressing in the game and learn from Cataclysm and never touch classes like Paladin by removing mana and putting that bullshit holy points. This is just my opinion and would love to see how the community would be when classic is fully release and I‚Äôm sure it will be more popular then BfA and they will release TBC.
---
Not policing language, just pointing out that just because you were pre-pubescent when Vanilla was out, doesn't mean that you still need to act that way when playing Classic.  You can use what you've learned these past 15 years to make Classic BETTER than Vanilla.  (I know, who am I kidding?)
---
Google would've answered this for you. How many times does this question have to be answered here or on the wow forums?
---
BC and Wrath were amazing for PvE content. PvP not as much. But arena itself isn‚Äôt bad, I think flying mounts did ruin world PvP.
---
I feel like the majority of the hate has come from content creators just flat out reporting bugs that aren't bugs or the Tips "ninja loot" situation.
---
"Opinions" is the absolutely last thing classic needs.
---
Cool
---
Unpopular opinion. He's right. It doesn't even have an armor class (cloth, leather, ect) and no armor value.
---
EHH OHHH
---
I was just letting him have his opinion, dw.
---
I disagree. They could very well remove and change a lot of stuff, but they seem scared. I honestly thing they are putting the lifeboats in the water to maintain the safe sub numbers, instead of doing what they should be doing, improving the game. They are aware of gearing issues, lfr, ect because they bring it up but its like they are scared to change it because they might lose the lfr community or something.
---
Other than flying most of you list seems solid.
---
:)
---
We're all goin' to war, boys!
---
imo pvp was also way better in vanilla before arena. sure it wasn't without problems and balanced but it was a blast. nothing like partying up with a friend and forcing world pvp at high-level dungeon/raid entrances on a friday night or having multiple hour long fight for an outdoor raid boss.
---
then there were daily/weekly [roaming pvp nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv7PeO6RpjU) for organized group pvp which were hands down the best thing ever.
---
someone once said that blizzard's initial plan was to add capturable things in wow to make it more in like with DAoC. if they went with this in TBC instead of arena it would have been fucking amazing.
---
blizzard should have taken some hints from shadowbane/daoc on how to implement world pvp instead of the instanced arena garbage that they added.
---
Ok.
---
yeah, like /u/warpbeast said, I believe what they hotfixed was how high reckoning could stack and sitting was changed later, sadly since it was a hotfix I can't find any patch notes and the reckoning wowwiki page was hardly kept up to date, I found this however
---
http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm
---
"Isn't this "Reckoning Bomb" an exploit?
---
Several months ago Reckoning recieved a bug hotfix of its own. This hotfix put a hard cap of 4 on the number of charges capable of being stored. So, one can safely assume that the developers know exactly what is going on, and have chosen to allow it. "
---
Interestingly, it also contained some info on sitting down to trigger reckoning and it probably applied to talents that proc similarly, like enrage
---
"Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?
---
Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit. However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting. "
---
And this was all written in 1.10, pretty neat piece of wow history
---
And besides I want to hear what you have to say, looking through your post history you seem like a decent guy with knowledge on the game
---
I watched content videos from all of the big guys until about last week when one of these threads had a link to a streamer who screamed into the mic until he was given an item that he lost a roll on. (I think it was Soda?) and then I clicked through some recommended videos about those big streamers being douche bags and I saw a different side of things. There are some great content creators that are totally down to earth, but a lot of the big names really don‚Äôt strike me as nice people, and I get some strong narcissistic vibes when watching their streams. Just my opinion. I will try hard to avoid a server with those people because having a big stream-viewer segment of the population could really ruin my enjoyment of the game.
---
maybe he was wrong there, but you have to understand what he is trying to say that is: you feel stronger when you change your gear to better pieces. And that is totally true
---
It's not disingenuous. I'm sure there are people out there who are making that argument completely in good faith.
---
Overall I agree with your analysis besides that line.
---
Its fine. Blizzard is releasing servers on August 13 to choose names on, so we have two weeks before the release to find and determine all of the streamer servers and which ones to avoid.
---
Thanks! I'm definitely looking forward to whatever comes next! Good luck to you as you work towards your goals :)
---
Soooo is this streamer you?
---
That's a very elegant solution for something I want to see be better.
---
But hopefully we can trust blizzard to take the good from classic and not the bad. Preach said on allcraft recently classic has worse gameplay but in a better game, and i think i definitely fall into his category of hoping that somewhere blizzard will in time find a way between the entitled retail players and the no changes crowd to synthesise the two games. IMO they should change retail, as it exists to be the best version of WoW whereas classic exists to cater to the specific audience that just wants vanilla as it was
---
Yeah, he‚Äôs a self described piece of shit, scumbag, and ninja looter. His stream is entertaining but I wouldn‚Äôt play with him or trust him an inch.
---
Who is Jesse Cox?
---
I love the idea.
---
If you go to the website and click on transfer servers or faction change it should show you what characters are associated with each account, so you know which license to renew, or you could just ask them on live chat :)
---
I can understand characters because of design style and abilities.
---
But so you feel that way about newer zones as well? I find it hard that someone could dislike them, as the zone design (look wise, anyhow) and music is one thing most normally agree on being spectacular, no matter how bad a expansion ends up.
---
so happy we got the old models and animations. its just not classic wow without them.
---
I have no reason to lie. I haven't worked in software development in many years but I worked in developing apps using an old IBM platform called Xpages, not that it would give any credence to my opinion. You don't need to know anything about development to call out blizzard anymore than you need to be a pilot to call out Boeing or whatever.
---
I'm not saying it was super easy, I'm just saying that they insinuated it was almost impossible or very difficult, which it clearly wasn't. At least not in the context of high end game development.
---
Everquest and Camelot are still casual MMOs to me. Go slay a real dragon and come back and tell me they're hard.
---
I figured. Damn.
---
Way more rare + having 40 raiders to feed so yeah
---
I just saw your stream video of you baiting that player off the boat and subbed lol. 
---
Looking forward to more of your stuff!
---
Part of that is the scaling of gear, but you are comparing a whole game to a partial expansion. Obviously there is less to do.
---
Can't wait to see people litteraly ganking non stop streamers to stop them from completing the quests. Sadly the population on streamers servers probably won't be 50/50 since all the fanboys will want to be on their fav streamer side.
---
At least with the first wave of invites, users were sent an email that arrived several hours after the demo appeared in their launcher. Not sure if all the emails are delayed after every beta invite wave, but people are getting emails informing them of beta access.
---
I understand the worry, but if they do this, they had better know that they'll be costing themselves a ton of subscriptions as people that want classic the most will likely leave once these things start being implemented
---
&gt;I'm just saying that they insinuated it was almost impossible or very difficult
---
It's definitely unprecedented. Take that as you will.
---
No. I'd like the servers to be named after things in the (vanilla) Warcraft universe. Names of characters, zones and things like that.
---
She says while staring at your junk. -.-
---
you want me to believe OMAR was a stoolie cause sosa said so?
---
this subreddit is turning into shit. jesus christ
---
Are you serious?
---
Jesse Cox deez nuts
---
Obligatory Thanks post to Omar
---
Oh i would enjoy it alot, the way they play modern wow wont carry over so i think it would be very entertaining to watch them rage and get confused when dying to 2+ mobs
---
I STILL had my original WoW box and all the CDs up until like last year.. Now I kind of wish I wouldn't have tossed them.
---
Good question. I personally believe it won‚Äôt be and will be release like 1 month later.
---
What does TipsOut exactly do except being a noob?   
---
He always invites knowledgeable people like Monkeynews and I rarely see tipsout personally boasting that he's pro tier player.
---
therefore I dont see why all the hate is called for.
---
Usually when people say ‚Äúit‚Äôs pretty easy to see how miserable so and so is‚Äù that‚Äôs usually a sign of their own misery because truly happy positive people don‚Äôt talk like that.
---
Delete this !
---
There's no phase 0, so yeah.
---
Your the best &lt;3
---
You mention physical wow copy, but forgot about all of the manuals, guides, and atlases that have been posted the past year.
---
Also, I loved the Rule 7 mention.
---
Dark Age of Camelot was my first ever MMO!
---
Pally is by far the most efficient healer and you can outscale priests in the lategame depending on the situation.
---
Ignore his bitter boomer ass...
---
I remember this being an issue in burning crusade  where taurens sucked in arena because you could hit them through the pillars in the nagrand arena then blizzard finally fixed it few weeks after the launch of arena
---
They can't ruin the game. They have literally no power. Many of them will even see the light and be converts.
---
i think its a minecraft thing
---
Ty
---
Yikes, guy
---
Client =\= graphics. How hard is this to understand? Lol
---
Missing the monthly thank you Nostalrius post which never has any mentions about the real heroes behind WoW emulation
---
So, are you saying Asmongold is like Moses? Let his people go (in to AQ) or suffer plagues?
---
Ur the only one spinning anything. You are clearly using wordplay to sway the conversation. Not only is it a bad argument technique, but it‚Äôs also invalid. ‚Äú*x is y because I say so*‚Äù means nothing. I‚Äôm sorry for whatever happened to you today but take it out on someone else. And grow up while you‚Äôre at it
---
4 rimmies, 3 reach arounds, 2 unexpected glory holes, and a partridge in a pear tree

https://classic.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=175887&amp;region=us
---
The challenge is still there. Naxx has many difficult bosses but I‚Äôm not going to say it‚Äôs harder than mythic raiding. The big challenge in late aq and naxx is preparation. Each raid night requires 4-8 hours of farming consumables to complete naxx.
---
It's ridiculous to be honest, i know most are used to pserver values at this point but this just is just too easy. Need blizzard to address this next week to know if it's actually right or not.
---
First of all, Ogrim ended guldan corruption during first war. He still continue his war against human after that. He was the one that start the second war. 
---
Second of all, what you said is stupid. They still commit genocide on large scale. Is it their fault that they put the orc who literally committed crime against their people scot free? I guess all is forgiven when you commit large scale genocide.
---
lol i fuckin love ziqo, guy is so funny
---
God damn you're a loser

Priest leveling is efficient and somewhat fast. They have the best toolkit for healers in the game. You will always be wanted for group content. Raids usually had ~8 (it's a 40 man keep in mind)
---
So you are in fact policing his/her language.
---
Actually OP can mean one of 2 things:
---
What you said.
---
or
---
That when OSRS first came out, it got a lot of hype at the start but got stale fast and until Jagex started making new content for the old game and listening to the community.
---
Snowflakes is overused
---
I've leveled 2 warriors, testing lots of stuff both times.
---
Fury is not better than Arms, without sit-crit Enrage. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
They do. It's listed under the "not a bug" post Blizz made on the forums
---
Hi, /u/Faltrizzz
---
The character animation reset and mobs through walls with fear were both in classic. 
---
You‚Äôd be in a raid, fear mobs through a wall, they‚Äôd aggro a giant pack and then hang up to come find you. Delightful. Sheep does the same thing albeit much more slowly :)
---
Its always been like this. It hasn't taken a new direction at all.
---
Hahahaha. 10/10
---
&gt; WoW has progressed as a game.
---
Degressed.
---
Ftfy
---
People really are stupid.
---
This whole "give all the streamers a beta key thing" was a bad idea.
---
Unless that's something they enjoy. I could not give a single shit about quiraji mount, but they'll bring lots of free HKs with them.   You'll likely see big streamers choosing the same servers but opposing factions, so we'll get nice big battles in the world. 
---
I see benefits from that.
---
It was streamed quite a bit. Many from our guild at least - and a lot of roamers in what would be phase 2 in Classic. Lots of raid streams too.
---
Plenty of twitch bans too.
---
Gunning for a specific legendary isn't easy by nature of the way legendaries work. Your "easiest" way to ensure you get one would be too become a guild's main tank so you get thunderfury.
---
People in this sub are such hypocrites, if a streamer is rushing to lvl 30 he gets blamed for not reporting bugs. Now when a streamer IS trying to report bugs he gets called out for being a idiot because he is wrong? I have played vanilla back in the day but I sure didn¬¥t remember some items not having stats. Sometimes people are wrong, stop acting like its the end of the world when someone doesn¬¥t remember every single part of vanilla WoW after 15 years
---
Nice :) Proud of you :) Great job :)
---
‚ÄúThe things you can do are just uhh better qol things‚Äù sums up retail pretty well.
---
Phase 1 is launch phase with MC and Ony available.
---
You think they would actually remove flying mounts? Lfr? Class niches? Mate, it will never happen. The sun will rise tomorrow, and retail is a lost cause.
---
That major corporation is bound by a whole different suite of rules and regulations than a bunch of pirates setting up a private server. 
---
Not only does Blizzard have an actual professional reputation to maintain, but it is also constrained by concerns regarding legal liability.  
---
That, among many other reasons, is why they cannot simply stand up an old server and call it a day.
---
HahahaüòÖü§£ü§£ DAE LMAO FROM that? LUL üòùüëç my sides ARE IN ORBIT üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£

the haircuts are what makes this lol, +1
---
Dude is 49 years old. Give him a break.
---
I got a ring in there last night!
---
&gt; If you think gaming communities are nothing but rainbows and unicorns then you're deluded, sorry.
---
Good thing he didn't imply or say that. So uh. Good empty statement.
---
Please tell me what products you work on so I can know what to avoid.
---
If they ever introduce new Classic content it would heavily mess with the flow of players to the other forms of content, so I hope they simply do tBC servers that aren't connected to the Classic servers and leave Classic as what it should be: a preservation project.
---
It has no armor.
---
The classes have character though. Every class feels like it has an identity. And people really bond with that. The creators of original wow were heavy into class fantasy with balance and gameplay "rotations" coming second.
---
You should play the wc3 campaign! It sets up classic perfectly.
---
If you're trying to say this sub is toxic, pls don't compare it to the osrs sub, they're just as bad if not worse loool
---
Also, the internet isn't your safe space lad
---
Very nicely done, but shouldn't bloodlust be in berserker stance?
---
Yeah, it's quite incredible how toxic this place is. It's frightening almost.
---
Awk
---
Agreed
---
As soon as he gives the dev a break from false reports
---
TIL: It's toxic to complain about a person ninja looting on STREAM.
---
Ninja looting is bad, and its worse if you ninja loot with hundreds or thousands of viewers because suddenly there's a chance that some of those viewers think its cool to ninja loot.
---
You really think people stop playing at 60 as soon as their streamer stops playing the game? After such time investment It's hard to imagine.
---
just run the old client 4HEad
---
How many realms will there be?  If it's few, there might be no avoiding them, there might be a popular one on every realm.  At the same time, I think that the number of realms should be kept low.
---
It was a joke, they weren't being serious.
---
&gt; Anyone ever told you that you're a remarkable intelligent young man? You really are. Really really are. 
---
lmao, you don't see the irony in this, do you?  Stop being so obnoxious.
---
Actually even if you deleted them - on the battle net page you can recover every toon ever created with items
---
No one remembers wow beeing this easy.
---
Staysafe could turn incloth in darnassus like 2 hours ago.
---
Not an option in NA unfortunately.
---
Didn't compare it to the sub. 
---
Never said it was.
---
Agreed. I myself would prefer to have focus macros, because they make pvp just way smoother, but I don't think it'll be good for the gameplay, so glad they removed it.
---
Most of the PoE community don‚Äôt like him.  He was majorly (I believe) a D3 streamers for a long time, then dabbled into WoW for a decent time. And then moved to PoE semi recently.
---
His ‚Äúbrand‚Äù is exactly what‚Äôs shown in the clip. For whatever reason, people find it funny or enjoyable. The very few times I‚Äôve seen him not on stream, the guy isn‚Äôt a complete idiot, but just because of how he grows his brand I can‚Äôt like the guy, and avoid him as his chat is exactly what you‚Äôd expect.
---
its not intended that you keep your combo points though. the mouseover part is fine but the fact that you can blind and kick people without losing combo points on your main target is an insane buff to rogues and obviously isnt supposed to be there.
---
A content creator from that generation who got famous making Cataclysm beta vids, along with Totalbiscuit and the Yogscast and the like.
---
Belt, Leather Belt?
---
I played a warrior and bought every skill and I still had a mount both slow and fast.. You just have to save and sell any blues you get I dont get 60s that could not make money
---
Reddit is full of angry people, they just like to circlejerk their hate with others. They aren't the majority of people you will encounter in vanilla. They're just salty right now.
---
How is world pvp a grind? That is my main hobby in retail vanilla and will be again in classic.
---
You might want to venture into braincels or T\_D or MGTOW to see what actual hatefulness looks like. 
---
This sub is just another echochamber circlejerk, but not exactly hateful.
---
"you get a piece with like 6 intellect on it and you actually can FEEL your spells hitting harder"
---
no you cant you absolute scrub, apart from minimal crit chance scaling, int doesnt provide spelldamage in vanilla.
---
i like his thoughts on it. and than calling someone out at the end made it a perfect clip
---
Damnit, now I want to create a warrior in Classic. Played a warrior tank vanilla and BC, it was glorious and brutal, I did not want to go back to that with classic.
---
But hearing Preach, it all comes back, how it was, how I remember it, the good, the bad, the ugly. (and not how many streamers/youtubers pretended it was)
---
And god damnit, it was hard but I loved it.
---
Levelling took me forever, but it was satisifying. I gathered some pieces of tier 0, pvp gear and bought stockade pauldrons and was ready to go tanking in MC. No epic mount until 2 years in or smth.
---
You sir are a shitty person.... it took you X ammount of words to say nothing even tho guys above you answered my question with 2 letters... the only thing you had achieved is to show me that u r sorry little person who doesnt even value his own time... dont say nothing if you have nothing to say
---
Ain't even the fact that they complained about it. It's the fact that someone made a thread about it and everyone blindly hated on it because 1) it was a streamer and 2) it's still a game mechanic, the amount of hate isn't warranted. A dislike sure, but the hate? Fuck no. Also - go read the threads again. Esfand cleared it up w/ proof and now no one is to be seen because they can't blindly hate - as it didn't happen! :)
---
It was subjectively better. Imo TBC was the beginning of the end already and set the trend for all the xpacs that would follow.
---
Flying Mounts destroying world PvP and player interaction
---
Old world is obsolete
---
Ugly af zones with way too aggressive color schemes
---
Mundane daily quest grinds.
---
TBC was better in terms of gameplay sure, but I still vastly prefer Vanilla over TBC. So please refrain from using "objectively" better when it's really just your opinion.
---
Lots of helpful content to help settle on a class. Nostalgic content. Beta highlights of familiar zones. This is a bit of a shit post. Downvote the content you don't like. Instead of reading streamer drama, learn about the game.
---
As a competitive pvp player, bfa has shat on any semblance of competitive integrity the game ever had. The first pvp tournament in bfa had teams practicing for months, only to show up and realize there was a pve trinke that they effectively couldn't play without. That meant all their practice, their comps and strats were out the window. WoW likes to pretend to be a competitive esport but does none of the effort necessary for it to be so.
---
My thinking on it was that if their plan was to release them batched with everything that wasn't named (BRD, BRS, Sunken Temple &amp; the likes), wouldn't they say that rather than isolate them in their own phase? It's inconclusive in a way.
---
Who?
---
This is satire, right?
---
Why would Blizzard let retards into the beta that will CREATE MORE WORK for blizzard!?
---
Love when blind people attack lol. I never see them removing flying ya clown.
---
And cool you hate bfa, good for you. Go troll someone else if your argument is "i HaTe It, MuSt Be DeAd!!!"
---
So his opinion means nothing and he won‚Äôt get past bwl.
---
Welcome to the World of Warcraft :). It was fairly routine for someone to get caught ninjaing and be so ostracized they had to server xfer and change their name. 
---
Also often if some new 60 showed up that was geared people would do some digging to find out where they came from and what the story was. This was also pretty easy due to the realm forums being so active and plenty of guilds knowing each other. 
---
This is a retelling of something that happened back on Eredar that was fairly infamous in its time. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tapatalk.com/groups/seksoniclegion/viewtopic.php%3ft=30026&amp;amp=1
---
This subreddit literally needs to be burnt to the ground and rebuilt.
---
The amount of petty, infantile pitchforking and circle jerking every day is insane.
---
Private servers are hacks that more or less behave. But they're a mangle of bugs that barely balance each other out.
---
A real company cant expect a solution like that to work or deploy it to paying customers.
---
&gt; The classes have character though. 
---
Right, but is "you got character tho" going to be a driving factor to a player that gets to press one button for most of their leveling experience? 
---
Players in retail WoW are upset that they don't have ***enough*** buttons to press. 
---
&gt; The creators of original wow were heavy into class fantasy with balance and gameplay "rotations" coming second.
---
Highly doubtful that was the case. It's more like they tried something, balanced it as best they could for gameplay "rotations" and general "balance" with the goal to put out fires as they come up, and scrap ideas that were not working.
---
Yeah it's like a wall here. I can accept what majority wants. I know that they won't re-balance anything. 
---
The thing is, I wrote one possible solution that might revive dead spec and people just spit hate without any reasoning. I don't even want to play Balance Druid but when I know that something may be improved without changing the core game-mechanics, I will stand for it. It would be changed in an upcoming patches anyway, the only reason ot was kept the same was TBC.
---
Like moonwalking it's been removed/fixed in the modern engine so I doubt we'll see in Classic unless they deliberately recreate it.
---
That‚Äôs hilarious. Thankfully no arena in classic
---
Exactly this. Twitch culture and way ppl behave on twitch disgust me. Giant circlejerk of wannabe famous ppl with over inflated ego, who put up close to zero actual content.  
---
The best streams are usually the relatively small streamers who haven't whored out completely yet.  
---
I don't know if any of you familiar with Grubby (followgrubby) a wc3 player.  
---
His streams are informative, he has giant knowledge and most importantly not just game knowledge, but he actually knows about stuff happening in life and not a total barbarian in other areas. While he is still amongst the best players, he is extremely humble, which makes you notice and appreciate his greatness even more. Never seen him rage over anything and he is a really nice human being, not just fake nice like most of these streamers.  
---
Please point me to anyone in this wow streaming community who is comparable to this and worth watching.
---
There is no way esfand forgot. Don‚Äôt kid yourself.
---
How can you spoiler a 15 yo videogame? Good idea posting this tho.
---
Go back to your safe space. We had to watch as our favorite game got ground into the dirt by Blizzard in the name of making it safe and accessible for all forms of retards. We finally got it back and the only people being allowed to play early are the same retards that got us BFA.
---
Nope. He's from the West Coast, Im from Iowa. Heard about him streaming during another stream last night.
---
You have to fight for a homeland once you get stuck somewhere. You're assuming orcs slaughtered humans for fun after the corruption left. They didn't need them for fel magic anymore, they needed a home. You expect them to all fall over dead? I mean nightelves hate the orcs because of gul dan, and the warsong clan chopping their trees down, let's all ignore the massive pitlord skulking in the woods.
---
if you're referring to my post from yesterday, asmon wasn't the one who died in that duel.
---
r/creepyasterisks
---
Been doing that and you're right about the down-voting. My post wasn't neccesarily about the streamer drama, more about the general state. But it's ok.
---
pointless? obviously you don't know about the meme.
---
&gt; Moderately populated quest areas (like Hogger's camp) will have 5-10 people at it and every single gnoll is dead. 
---
Read my post man. 5-10 people is ***not*** a lot of people. 
---
Unless you're suggesting what I am seeing on beta will be less populated at launch.
---
The thing with wow, if you didn't play classic or at least burning crusade retail version, you just won't get why people like the grind and the game.
---
It does get anoying as an alliance lock after a while in my opinion. I played alliance lock until Wotlk and in classic lots of horde will play undead. If you PvP a lot you will encounter the racial all the time. It will not always be a dealbreaker but it sure is annoying in my opinion.
---
well it is literally the same game as those 15 years ago. I've no doubt they done all sorts of extremely fancy tinkering, but its not wow 2.
---
Really?
---
why you so butthurt? If you knew the meme, you'd know.. obviously others know about it if i'm not the only one posting in the last 10 minutes.
---
Fucking anoying voice.
---
yes it does, if you can't see it, the problem lies somewhere else.
---
I have 3 weeks vacation time and my work has a flexible call out system. Provided I don‚Äôt call off from now until release I should be able to get quite a bit of gaming time in.
---
Guess we've had conflicting results then. It's not exactly surprising considering factors like play style etc. I'd still encourage people to give dual-wield fury a try since it sure surprised me at how much it broke my misconceptions.
---
Pure leveling synergy:paly&gt;druid&gt;priest&gt;shaman.
---
For general PvP shaman is super aggressive. If you want the option to blow people up play shaman. Priest has a great defensive kit, but they also have a fear ability, and that overlap is not a good thing.
---
i feel like its going to be atleast 500k pserver release was around 50k+ if i remember right so yeah not a ton but not a little in blizzard standards
---
Very well made! Bookmarked.
---
Pretty sure he raided heavily in vanilla
---
I can‚Äôt bring myself to throw them away
---
Alliance biased. Lame
---
its one fear break every 2 minutes, if you feel like that invalidates your class then you probably shouldn't play it, realistically it hurts in 1v1 and doesn't matter at all in group pvp
---
IQ down 50 points... why do I internetz...?
---
I'm not attacking you so much as stating something you dislike me for. You are the one being rude m8.
---
Lmfao üòÇ
---
Oh, arena tournament? That server sponsored by Blizzard themselves for Blizzcon? That's not much of an argument. I remember an AT at Blizzcon during WoD which still had MoP PvP.
---
Wrath was all about blowing people up... It's a known fact that it had that problem...

Shadowmourne Pally's existed, dunno why you would say that. Holy might have been better for arena, but it wasn't like Ret was nonexistent.
---
I don't think this is fully correct. But ok.
---
Im not sure what u are on about mate you must be trippin ... ive been in this sub for over a year and i dont think i have a more enjoyable and TAME subreddit that i go to.
---
Welcome to the Vanilla WoW community! Luckily in game it's a lot better, but the reddits for Classic and pservers before that have always been a hot bed of cancer.
---
I dont get it
---
Let's see if a steamer can win the hat tomorrow
---
OP thinks the average reader of this subreddit is a neckbeard and is trying so hard to not be "one of those weirdo classic wow guys".  
---
Btw, you're not as smart as you think you are.
---
&gt;  I‚Äôm under 20 
---
Who asked?  lmao
---
&gt; But fuck me. The toxicity in this reddit and the blind hatred. People flaming streamers for no reason at all. A post ‚Äòexposing‚Äô a streamer for ninja looting? Yes it‚Äôs frowned upon and it‚Äôd be bad server rep but fuck me - you‚Äôre acting like he shouldn‚Äôt be in beta solely cos he ninja looted. It happens. Why is everyone so salty over this and nitpicking anything streamers do? Swearing to never play the same realm, never interact, calling them dying channels because they said they enjoy vanilla etc.   
---
&gt; Hope a lot of the self acclaimed adults here (since you all played vanilla apparently) show their age and mature up a bit and just look forward to the game rather than hating on people blindly because it doesn‚Äôt fit their picture perfect world where everyone is fair and candy nice to each other online on a game with elements that allow for some ‚Äòtrolling‚Äô. Jesus. 
---
Part of me thinks this is somone larping as a zoomer.  But it's more likely that you're just some kid who's trying to sound smart.
---
Look guys, a \[Classic\] virgin. He isn't salty enough yet. We should check in on him in a year to see how seasoned he gets.
---
When you have an outfitter slot to unequip MH, OH and bow before wiping saving you some gold each raidgroup wipe.
---
Or armor class.
---
Way to miss the point. 
---
People are posting these because all of the nay-sayers out there are getting there hands on this and realizing this is how it should be. Some die hard defenders of modern wow are changing their minds. This is amazing for both games. Stop hating on content creators just for the sake of it.
---
He is though...there is armor.
---
I only want my beta key given to me by the physical slapping of the developer‚Äôs dick onto their keyboard during reasonable office hours on a mild Tuesday morning in Irvine.
---
Swifty is generally oblivious to everything it‚Äôs painful
---
I don't think it will be a big issue. If there are four layers of 3k people and you join a group to avoid a gank in like STV, more than likely you will just be ganked there too. It's just a temporary thing to begin with. Most wont be 60 when layering is gone.
---
jesus whats wrong with you guys, relax if it's not bugged they don't change anything, you guys get your asses puckered for no reason.
---
Everything in vanilla sucks but somehow everything is more meaningful and fulfilling. Itemization and class design are abysmal but the choices you make feel so much more impactful than retail. Players actually build a reputation on their servers. Being a dick has consequences.
---
I'm so hyped the more I see of Classic. I can't even look at BFA.
---
And to me that kind of difficultly just doesn‚Äôt appeal to me, I‚Äôd rather be tested on performance.
---
Can we please not do Asmongold content every day since the beta started?
---
Omar I owe you my life &lt;3
---
Not world pvp per say, you're nitpicking a bit here. You're missing the broader point.
---
Warrior:   
---
Arcanite Reaper: 800g
---
Lionheart Helm: 350-500g
---
Stronghold Gauntlets: 300-450g
---
Devilsaur: anywhere from 200-600g
---
T1 bracers: 200g
---
Edgemasters: 900-1200g
---
getting carried to Satyr bow: 15g
---
Free Action Potion: 1g-1,5g a pop
---
A raid night worth of consumes anywhere from 30g to 600g depending on raid and progression of content. AQ40 C'thun progression will suck you dry on protection potions alone.
---
How do mythic raids compare with a fight like 4 Horsemen?  Honestly asking because 4 horsemen is very unforgiving and complicated.  
---
I think the Vanilla raids were as hard at the time than Mythic raids are now.  Now that everyone has theorycrafted specs and stats,  now that everyone has had 15 years to practice the mechanics - sure the Vanilla raids are easier.  In Era though I think it is a more even battle.
---
Lol go watch the Death of a Game video on YouTube for Wildstar. It being too hardcore was not why that game failed...
---
fucking great , im stuck subbed to a game i dont even play just to test it
---
Hi, /u/KhAiMeLioN
---
PvE. I played both PvE and PvP in Vanilla. World PvP can be enjoyable, however I have way less free time nowadays.
---
I want to spend the few hours I have to play everyday doing exactly what I want to do.
---
Most of these streamers live on the west coast at least.
---
Just thought I'd give a shoutout to a fellow Classic WoW players that's streaming. I'd watched Tipsoutbaby, Staysafetv and others and there are just too many people in chat and too much extra going on for my liking. Just thought others might appreciate a super chill stream like me.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIVTT4fgPQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIVTT4fgPQI)
---
Yeah... That's what I thought to. I remember there was server drama when a rogue rang the gong like a day ahead of schedule. All the other guild gong bangers got pissed.
---
Sup y'all. Writer/fan excited and hopeful for beta like everyone else. Shares my feeling and memories and I can't wait to play!!
---
If they release TBC i hope they'll do something about the 2.3 patch which is for me the beggining of everything..
---
 Examples :
---
* The amount of [experience](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Experience) needed to gain a level has been decreased between levels 20 and 60. In addition, the amount of experience granted by [quests](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest) has been increased between levels 30 and 60.
---
* Level 1-60 dungeon quests have had their experience and faction rewards increased.
---
* Many elite creatures and quests in the level 1-60 experience have been changed to accommodate solo play.
---
*  Vendor Discounts: All vendors with an associate faction now give discounts at all levels above [neutral](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Neutral) 
---
* All Commanders and Lieutenants have left Alterac Valley in search for other battle opportunities.
---
*  The Horde and Alliance now have a limited number of reinforcements available in the battle for Alterac Valley. 
---
* The Requirement for [Heroic](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_mode) Keys has been lowered to [honored](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honored).
---
* Raid attunement remove
---
Etc...

---
Holy Fuck if you bruhs cant read this post properly, you're gonna have a really bad time in classic questing. How many more people are gonna misread this? Lmao
---
It seems like players on the beta aren't allowed to make a mistake or don't know about how certain things were different in vanilla without a mob of angry neckbeards unleasing their wrath upon them.
---
Ultimately I think its great we're getting best of both worlds.
---
I know a ton of people will point to BFA and saying, because BFA sucks, that means Modern WoW sucks, when expansions like MoP and Legion show what Modern WoW looks like when it works.
---
React isnt a language wtf
---
You may want to read into the full history of LFG. It was not just implemented and accepted, nor was version 1 remotely the same as version 99. I don't know if you just forgot that or if you never played, and i don't care. The reason to be hyped for classic is not nostalgia, its because its a good game - as opposed to a mobile slot machine port.
---
All them drakedog fans out there.
---
I get it, streamers do dumb stuff sometimes. However, they neither recieve keys to do 200IQ stuff, nor because they are exceptional players, nor to betatest. They recieve it to promote the game and these keys are "well spent" in terms of long terms Classic success, better than if this key was given to an average player.
---
Oh man, it must suck being american
---
Not saying it's THE reason as there are several components to why a game fails but catering to a small playerbase and failing to entice new players due to said catering is part of it.
---
Huh, i had a somewhat different experience growing up. You see, i started realizing that disney movies are actually a piss poor source of morale integrity. Like, their fucked up. So are you m8.
---
You're a very interesting person. Never once said I was smarter than a single person in the sub-reddit and would never imply I'm ever smarter than someone on the internet, as I have no idea how smart they are.
---
The point of the age was to show that I am a younger audience that is looking to get into Classic. I'm not the 30+ year old that was playing it 15 years ago. I wasn't just showing my age for the sake of showing it. 
---
Trying to sound smart? Yes. I wrote a post about the state of a sub-reddit to sound smart to people that don't matter to me and I won't probably engage in more than a few conversations on the sub-reddit with. You really got me, mate.
---
Because now there is a lot of hype surrounding it. And I mean this without the bad assumption of hes just doing it cuz he wants the money etc.
---
Sometimes you are against something and you refuse to even try it out because you feel the other version is superior. That can be a meal, a show, a game or whatever and slowly you also make that a part of your identity to just not like that one thing and be camp A and not camp B.
---
Im sure he knows about private servers, but now that he's seen the hype and decided to try it out and happened to like it. The hype about it and getting the exclusive opportunity to stream the beta probably pushed him towards it.
---
Venruki is usually nice and I agree that the gear example was a bit weird, as well as describing the talent points, but he's trying to put into the words that elusive feel of getting stronger, even if its actually not being stronger and just placebo.
---
You hear this argument a lot even from "legit vanilla players" like Crendor trying to explain that weird satisfaction of putting a talent point into +1% Parry feeling great even though it doesn't really do much.  
---
We know it's kinda minute but it still feels good, and I think that's what Venruki was trying to describe.  
---
It's because upgrades are more scarce, and levels are slower (thus the points are too), they feel better when you get them.
---
Sorry what was the point of this thread? lol
---
Automating things? That never happens!

This isn't an amazing feat.... blizzard is a multimillion dollar company. They make speak in this " we did it guys " attitude when private servers have had classic servers up for 5+ years, albeit buggy, and not in the modern client. Who the hell cares. The data shouldn't be that fucking hard to find considering some nerds somewhere made their own servers solo.
---
&gt; Now I kind of wish I wouldn't have tossed them
---
*How could you?*
---
We‚Äôre talking about the man who quoted himself in his own PvP video.
---
there is nothing I hate more then people eating directly into their mics smacking their lips and tongue, its sounds fucking disgusting
---
Lol, you are a spicy one, aren't you?
---
Why wait for Joanna or anyone else, yoym, since you claim this as being the truth, which is could be. You must have already double checked everything you claim to be wrong. Why not just post your reference original 1.12.1 video's that you used to compare to the beta which will show that the beta is wrong. 
---
Or did you not actually check anything against original 1.12.1 footage and you just go off "hearsay".
---
You know they have an in house reference 1.12 client that they use to cross reference everything on? They have the actual numbers for everything available to them. Not some made up bullshit.
---
I tried to explain why they weren't just "using the old client like nos" and "1 server in a basement" around a year ago to someone. I have since tried very hard to stay away from dev stuff. It's funny though if you don't get involved.
---
I lost it at "this canker warlock"
---
You too!
---
How do your combat numbers look? Are they huge and overscaled?
---
It's not called "Armor *Class*" in WoW. It's just armor.
---
Agreed. The FotM'ing rif-raff has been quite active here of late.
---
It's not just reddit. The hate and negativity and outright arrogance from pro vanilla players has spread from Pservers, wow forums and reddit. It's ridiculous and extremely immature behavior that does nothing but cause malcontent.
---
If they play on a pvp server you can be sure that a big part of their community is gonna play on the other faction just to fuck with them. Being a big streamer is a double edged sword.
---
It pretty much is exclusively for that group though. The vast vast majority of people who didn't play it are going to leave and I'd bet most of them are the tourist twitch kids throwing their parents money at streamers taking advantage of them. As soon as the next shiny popular thing comes along they'll be gone and the people who will stay, the OG vanilla players who havr wanted this back for a decade or more, are threatened by those kids because of what they did to retail.
---
YoU tHiNk U dO bUt u DoNt!1!one!!1
---
Alright, I went and played them. Classic wow is hard. What now?
---
I'd argue it's not used enough. People on here seem so fragile they are about to break by just looking at them.
---
Makes one wonder how they manage to cope with the struggles of every day life.
---
Paying a monthly sub is the requirement for beta access. Paying customer vs whiny internet troll who shits on the companies product day after day... jeeeeeez I cant believe you didnt get beta access.
---
omg fucking boomers im unsubbing
---
Will be farming Shadowfang and Assassin's Blade shortly after dinging 60 in preparation for BG's
---
LMAO. Can't wait to waste the valuable studying time and then wonder where it went wrong the day before an exam!  Ya, I feel I might go warrior too - plate wins me over just as much. Might do an alt for farming too now that you mentioned it. Looking great.
---
Hope you get it! What do are you going to play/test?
---
That's why, on principle, even if I wont ever get far enough to actually need it, I hide my characters on warcraftlogs and fflogs.  If you wanna assume I'm bad, go ahead, I don't care! I don't need you! I'll find someone else who doesn't care!
---
Do you have a link by chance?
---
Its a pretty funny blatant hypocracy of especially Asmong. He rages about welfare loot in retail but will gladly let his lemmings funnel him everything.
---
AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
People in the sub are the nerdiest of the nerds. Half of them never seen a titty in their life. What do you expect? These are the guys that were here when the internet was in the bloom. These are the trolls living in their mom's basement.
---
Yet vanilla is probably better for those people, there's always something meaningful to work towards and even if you go at a slow pace, you're still rewarded.  
---
  In comparison to bfa where the "work" is doing the same thing over and over hoping this time you get lucky to get a mount drop, that's the usual thing casual player do these days. 
---
  I never said the game should completely cater to 24/7 grinders, I said the game shouldn't be COMPLETELY cathered towards the other side of the spectrum, don't twist my words.  
---
  This results in a game that's not fun for the first crowd and it's only momentarily fun for the second crowd, as is happening with bfa. 
---
  And they can say a million things, like they have before, it doesn't matters until they've actually implemented them and more importantly, KEEP THEM. 
---
  8.2 is bringing back resistances and other nifty things so it's an improvement, but the game philosophy and systems between classic and retail are still galaxies apart.
---
Yup, if they play on a pvp server you can be sure that a big part of their community is gonna play on the other faction just to fuck with them. Being a big streamer is a double edged sword.
---
Eh. I remember the Overwatch alpha/beta and the streamer hate there too. Was lucky enough to get into Overwatch w/ the first wave and would usually show proof so the people claiming it was just streamers would stop their crying.
---
One of us. One of us.
---
You certainly implied it. Also, Death of a Game takes in lots of sources before compiling them into a single video.
---
Did he have a 100% success rate or did he just get crit normally there?
---
This is another way to attract views, initially saying game is blow then saying they were mistaken. Since many supporters were against the old argument they feel empowered that they were p\[proven right and just to confirm people will click on the video.
---
Clicky clicky bait, I have already seen couple of similar videos.
---
Then play bfa, each one caters to different people.
---
Use your vote then and don‚Äôt complain in comments
---
Maybe less so if you investet a lot of time into the game. But it will be a significant change in server Population if a big Streamer starts or stops playing
---
Why do people make these stupid posts
---
And just in case someone is unaware of the reference: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bIVTT4fgPQI

At this time, I think you should purchase me an alcoholic beverage and engage in diminutive conversation with me in hopes of establishing a rapport.

Does somebody know why I dont have any region button? (:[https://imgur.com/a/PuKWMXK](https://imgur.com/a/PuKWMXK)
---
That‚Äôs a good idea I‚Äôll definitely check it out. I was planning on leveling a few classes to ~20ish just to have a decision ready by classic release. I‚Äôm stuck between mage, warlock, or shaman.
---
I think many of them comes from Pservers, keep that in mind. I played back in vanilla, so did all my friends. None of them is toxic or salty.
---
Most people in this subreddit are not toxic or salty =)
---
Uh oh, this guys a retard!
---
Which was 100% foreseeable for anyone who has a social IQ higher than 20. Imagine thinking about the dynamics of the current scenario and *not* having the foresight to envision things playing out *exactly* the way they are at this very moment. You'd either have to not understand passionate gaming communities at all, in which case you should probably be working elsewhere, or you have just zero ability to understand basic human emotion.
---
&gt; Why is everyone so salty over this?
---
Jealousy
---
Also a lot of these people just stopped playing back then and now recover their accounts with Blizz
---
im new to wow subreddits (quit wow in 2009, played on nostalrius, gonna play classic).
---
is 95% of people here just completely autistic?
---
Read my post man. Blizzard confirmed it's right regardless of what I said. So doesn't matter the specifics.
---
amazing video
---
99% of the time it goes to the GL who is usually the main tank. Anything else would be foolish for raiding
---
Based on nothing because he has no evidence of anything. It just "feels" wrong. He keeps talking as if blizzard doesn't have a 1.12 reference client they are using to get all these values right in the first place.

you take that back right now
---
That's not true, twitch will do it whenever they realize wow is now 2 games. Happened with dota auto chess a few months ago.
---
im prepared to host insane amounts of pug mc later on just to reserve bindings, propably gonna get them at some point but who knows. everything is possible
---
There will probably be people who will join the server who don't watch Asmon... But they'll probably be outnumbered 5 to 1 *at least*
---
i also did subbed just for a chance getting invite , no luck till now hope next days with stress test etc will get invited! gl to u too.
---
Literally Classic.
---
That just means it happened to more people
---
Bad wording on my part then.
---
Afaik it was never fixed in TBC. A friend of mine who played Tauren says he was hitting people through pillars all through the expansion.
---
REEEEEE
---
He either has no clue about the game or simply did a troll report / acting dumb to please his audience.
---
I will be playing on a Normal server.
---
Just imagine playing on a server where you keep getting disconnected for 2 minutes.  That's world pvp most of the time.
---
There was some streaming, but IMO most of the people watching were the people from the server, it wasn't like random people watched random streamers play on nost. And any streamer who saw success usually ended up getting banned for streaming private servers. 
---
I truly think that we simply haven't seen what classic with modern streaming culture is going to look like. Imo I think were testing that in the beta almost as much. We're seeing 90k viewer streamers are getting ganked by randoms but also be defended and assisted by their viewers, whereas in the past the most popular streamer was like hundreds of views.
---
Except they commit a war crime so that is why they are held accountable for their crime. What you said is ridiculous. What do you expect them to do? Go scott free? The first solution was genocide but terenas spare them and choose internment camp.
---
Also teranas even hold the Orc on trial so don't get me with that bullshit.
---
I probably used the wrong word for it tbh. It was a spur of the moment comment and I should have used a word that fits it more.
---
Are you jellies
---
and giving it to well geared MT makes a pretty good morale boost to stay in guild and raid, even when tank doesnt need anything from said raids. its easier to find new dps than well geared loyal tank
---
Great addition! Code boggles my mind as is, and knowing the tiniest thing can break it is just nuts. Like eyes of the beast, it's likely these old quests aren't entirely worth their time to fix, given everything they're doing (or supposedly NOT doing, according to many people) in current content. So long as they aren't so broken that they're unable to be completed, it's not going to be priority. Were it to interfere with the completion of Loremaster or something, that would be another thing entirely.
---
You mean the internment camp where babies were killed and slaves were forced to fight as gladiators to the death for amusement?
---
Didn't he say that he would not accept any donations of gold or items until at least when he gets his epic mount?
---
Nah I‚Äôll play both, I‚Äôll just buy gold to raid in classic.
---
&lt;gasp&gt;
---
Which is why you should be hopeful that the success of classic can bring back some of that philosophy while trying to balance the more grindy systems into workable ones (AND REMOVE THE FUCKING RNG ITS NOT DIABLO FFS, i'm still mad at that)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
Not like they can stop people from sending them gold and items through the mail though, even if they ask people to not do that.  
---
But they can just not pick up the mail... but that'll possibly cause other issues for them.
---
Oh? lel
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM)
---
This would be the way to go if you want TF and are not a tank.
---
I agree that the wider classic community seems to be increasingly hostile. When the release date was announced I came to the forums expecting excitement and people freaking out but instead it was full of people complaining that it was too late in the year etc. 
---
I think that the problem is that people seem to feel that classic wow is THEIRS and theirs alone. That they're the only one that "truly knows classic" (like their memory of 15 years ago is going to be even a fraction of accurate). People are angry they aren't in beta, they're angry that new players to vanilla are having fun, they're angry that it isn't all about them. 
---
It's egotism and it's gross.
---
Ninja looters shouldn‚Äôt be in beta.
---
How does that make sense? Twitch isn't owned by Activision Blizzard. They decide how they want to sort their content themselves, and if they want to divide classic and retail WoW into separate categories they can do so at their own discretion.
---
Nice, I have secured my account to my new battlenet, but I was under the impression if the other person had the secret password they could recover no matter what. Maybe this has changed, I never had to submit formal ID. That would be great, I'll try once again to recover characters.
---
 If you come for the Lich King, you best ~~not miss~~  bring +6% hit gear.
---
Reck-bomb was done with a player critting the paladin, not npcs
---
To be fair, for a lot of classic you could switch trinkets out in combat.
---
Thank you Mr. Omar.
---
It's about a lot more than that. It's not just about some gear and a rotation. Warrior leveling in vanilla was about movement, ranged pulling, resetting half a pack of mobs, and breaking them down into manageable sections. There's a reason why everyone else as well as myself are saying most people won't actually hit 60 without a leveling partner.
---
&gt;People flaming streamers for no reason at all.
---
Let's just casually ignore all the posts explaining said hatred.
---
I do wish for more of an upbeat attitude in the top voted posts, but I can also understand the frustration. There isn't much to discuss, people ask the same things over and over again and the prospect of this continuing for another 3 months is grueling for some. People hyped themselves up that they would be playing Classic in July. 
---
Posts in new are generally a lot more welcoming though. That's also the where real discussion takes place.
---
Don't see it anywhere on here.

---
So back to my original post. 
---
Some areas in the game have incredibly low spawn rates with only a couple of people in the immediate area. Regardless of whether "Dude, a bluepost totally said this already" I am ***watching*** it happen ***right now*** lol.
---
I mean it's much more than just letting, it's also earning. Does that brogue contribute a lot of consumables to the raid and Guild? Do they contribute gold? Are they an upstanding guild member and do they actively take a leadership role. And their personal relationships with Guild leaders.
---
There is an awful lot to consider,
---
Damage font should not scale with distance. It never did until LEGION. This is literally a UI change from an expansion only a couple years ago. I do NOT want to aimed shot a guy for 1800 damage only to have it be size 4 font for ants.
---
The very same.
---
Aye i miss the days when the notion that a polished game with a focus on gameplay was more important than hype trains and corporate manipulation. Just look at all these asshats being like ''my favorite online stupid person needed to get in because thats more important than a game getting tested in a beta''. Everyone should have a chance at the game, and newcomers are certainly allowed to do stupid mistakes, but its not just plainly okey and forgiven when they do. Fking tell em when they fuck up, and as it is, with no special snowflake privilege sauce.
---
Well welcome to classic. Most people are gonna be surprised how easy the game is. What made it hard was that it was a first of its kind game with people playing on 5 fps.
---
Wow it's like I climbed into a time machine and went back 15 years.  He hasn't aged one day!!!!

i uploaded it for him, if he decides to upload it himself later i'll take mine down (all credit goes to him ofcourse.)
---
No, the guy has a point. I'm pretty sure Blizz is much more concerned about generating hype right now than actually tryharding to fix bugs. It's still a business and having 200k people watch WoW and the Classic Beta will give the game even more exposure beyond just the WoW scene that already knows it's happening.  
---
When we get to an open beta stage or atleast a much more populated closed beta Blizz will probably concentrate on fixing bugs and testing stuff out.
---
Reporting a streamer ninjaing loot toxic? Lol
---
In the manifesto I mention that you'll have tons of "oh crap" moments during your journey to 60 because quests that are generally considered great (think pirate quests in tanaris) might be very difficult or even impossible to complete in a live playsetting. If you've minmaxed your route to be mathematically perfect, but ~5% of the quests can't be completed you'll miss critical breakpoints and the guide sucks for general use. Then again, not mentioning the quests at all in your guide is just weird.
---
I've mapped out almost everything I consider to be efficient sources of experience and don't allow myself any rested experience specifically so users can skip content they don't like or can't do without missing breakpoints. I've played on tons of private servers and know first hand what the penalties for playing on a PVP server is, and avoid contested zones like STV until you're so overleveled that you can just go in, destroy everything, and get out.
---
Questing to 60 involves a spider web of 800-900 unique quests which only an algorithm can figure out the most efficient way to complete. But like I mentioned earlier, that route is useless in a live playsetting since it more than likely can't be executed in a way it's meant to. Speedrunning has never and will never be a concern of mine and merely made the guide so more friends of mine would reach 60 in a reasonable amount of time and get to enjoy the game I love.
---
From what I've seen it happens when you load in and you can move between them by joining a group with someone on another layer. I personally haven't read into any of the specifics though.
---
Damn I remembered him being a not total retard back in the day
---
What? Lol
---
Lol. No. Just trying to weigh my options.
---
I was there
---
What year is it?!
---
Bro it‚Äôs the internet what do you expect?
---
Don't worry I can do more videos
---
Do you live under a rock?
---
Systems outside of the game have always been used to communicate, Vent/TS/Mumble but also clients like XFire to contact "offline" people.
---
Nowadays everyone uses Discord, limiting Battle.net won't do shit.
---
Everyone I spoke to ingame on the first night of beta was a streamer, media or a day 1 sub with an active sub. Until like 8pm on the first full day 5/16, everyone I asked was an 04/05 original sub. 
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean there weren‚Äôt others who weren‚Äôt, but I‚Äôd say first 24 hours, the majority had played real Vanilla.
---
That's just disgusting. Cancerous treamers who don't know jack get access while real fans don't...
---
Quests that become autotracked are supposed to disappear if you stop progressing. They will stay tracked if you explicitly track them.
---
This might be a dumb question but does the tauren hit box have any effect on like tauren shaman totems?
---
People forget that when WoW was released it was literally considered a casual MMO.
---
Just because games have gotten considerably easier since then doesn't change that.
---
This is supposed to be an example of bad things about classic, but honestly this just sounds so much better than retail right now.
---
No, that's just a demonstrably wrong opinion.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=43
---
probability dropped 99%
---
Watching this actually made me feel sick. Doesn't help that I played in vanilla and don't have beta access and people like this do.
---
Literally what I came to say lol
---
The sub isn't always this bad, everyone is just mad and jealous about the beta
---

---
You probably mean AVR, which indeed was quite crazy.
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info16249-AVR.html
---
My bad, didn't proofread the first paragraph properly.
---
&gt; How do mythic raids compare with a fight like 4 Horsemen? Honestly asking because 4 horsemen is very unforgiving and complicated.
---
Not even comparable. Just look up abilities of some bosses in the last 2-3 expansions. 
---
4Horsemen is not really complicated/difficult if you're being honest and that was one of the hardest fights in all of Classic. All you had to do was have groups rotate around while one group was always resetting debuffs. 
---
I haven't played the last 2 expansions but i have up to WoD and your average easy raidboss has more mechanics than any boss in classic.
---
This one is a bug, they saw this and commented. I‚Äôm at work or if kink
---
&gt; LOL Guess going through the ‚Äûbug reports‚Äú until finding an actual report will be super fun and efficient for the devs.
---
If there are any vet blizz employees, it'll be just like the old ticket days. Tons of shit tickets that just cluttered space, with a few legit tickets.
---
Do you have any proof of this? I have never heard of this or seen it. Not saying im perfect, but I'd like evidence
---
[I'll refer to an earlier answer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq3mjb/vanilla_questing_20_released_feedback_wanted/eo1cbum/)
---
One quick lookup in an old item database would've shown that this is how that item has been since forever.
---
getting extra damage without any benefit? lol
---
Regen is probably one of those things that's programmed into the client/server logic rather than being database data. They could convert the database (mostly) automatically, but everything else they have to basically port over by hand.
---
If it's important to you, it's important to me. I'm sure it will get a release
---
hmmm i feel like its still going to fast
---
I've tried to gather...is this Vanilla Swifty??
---
Zzz. Come back to me when you play Dark Souls Randomizer Soul Level 1 perma death.
---
That shouldn‚Äôt be even mentioned in your post, ninja looting is fucked and was a big thing in vanilla/bc/wotlk. Servers would know or get notified about it and that person would never get pugged with again. Now it‚Äôs even easier these days to see who the scum bags are
---
&gt; Trying to sound smart? Yes. I wrote a post about the state of a sub-reddit 
---
lol one thread calling out streamers for not rolling on a chest
---
&gt; They polished a 1.12 build and served it to you.
---
Factually incorrect.
---
Not a dumb question. Yes, Tauren receive benefits from Shaman totems at increased range than other races.
---
gnomelock for life
---
I'd recommend it if you're going to raid and also want to PvP or tank. Def worth.
---
I'm almost sure he is trolling. This is a good way to get views because people want to watch "that guy" who doesn't understand vanilla.
---
You are a ray of sunshine aren't you.
---
Me and my wife were actually looking at all the horde haircuts this morning between BFA and classic and most are the same, other than the detail.
---
Way better than asmon.  Pretty sure skorch carried esfran and asmon
---
So what if he is wrong, at least he is reporting what he thinks is a bug, as beta testers should
---
Nah, this isn't tinfoil hat territory.
---
Whilst there are many people who are only coming back to WoW to play Classic, there will also be a significant number who still play the retail game and share time between the two - myself included.  I've got a guild in retail that I enjoy raiding with and will continue to do so.  I'm looking forward to sinking myself into Classic when it comes out at a time when we're not exploring a new zone and raid.
---
It would be hugely counterproductive for Blizzard, and bad for those fans of both versions, to introduce a major content update for retail at the same time as launching Classic.  It's far better IMO for Classic to release during the downtime between 8.2 and 8.3, and August fits that timescale just right.  No point in having two games competing for the same playerbase.  Imagine Classic launching in the middle of a world first race!
---
Also, the beta is not even half of the content.  Levels 30-60 take more time and more zones and more quests than 1-30, and that's not even considering raids, dungeons and battlegrounds.  I'd rather they release in August with everything right, than releasing a buggy mess in June that puts people off the whole project.
---
If Classic goes well, we may get a rebuilt TBC.  That's my endgame :)
---
Whoa I thought it just sucked metaphorical dick, guess I was wrong.
---
Thank you!
---
The Primary goal of the beta is to test and iterate. Hype is a great feature. 
---
But yesterday while I was on, there were more than 5 instances of total lag outs. 5-10 seconds of fuck all happening in game, then it rubber bands back. So what I‚Äôm saying, is it is definitely a real beta
---
Get over it dude, I don't have to appeal to you.
---
If ya know, ya know. Roll Tide.
---
My understanding is that all phase 1 content will be open on launch day. I remember them even stating MC, Ony would be available for the first lockout period, but don't have a source, so take that with a grain of salt.
---
Damn people have had more fun in the four days in classic beta than the entirety of BFA
---
Well I imagine they cope just fine, but hope to let loose and have a reasonable chill time online and unwind. 
---
However you have assholes who take out their hard day in real life on people on the internet, because they don‚Äôt have healthy stress management and coping skills.
---
&gt;there is armor
---
[Hmm](https://i.imgur.com/myf1uja.png)

They could remove all in a new expansion, only in the new territory
---
This podcast is top notch. Yeah, some of the guests are better than others, but it‚Äôs a great way to get some vanilla facts. I‚Äôve listened to every episode, he‚Äôs now over 100.
---
Vanilla players have always been toxic. Put them all in a subreddit with people who pretended to play vanilla (yet just as obnoxious) and you are bound d to have one hell of a toxic community
---
Nah that‚Äôs just what your cynical self is thinking.
---
HOLY SHIT, DEAN???
---
&gt; What's with the private server hate on this sub since it blew up? You guys are mad that people continued to play their favourite game of all time when it wasn't available officially?
---
It's probably a reaction to private server players acting like Classic isn't "needed" because private servers already exist and are so accurate. I know it is in my case; I spent years playing on private servers until I started noticing all the little details that were blatantly broken about them and just couldn't do it anymore.
---
Not working as intended, it will definitely be patched.
---
Oof
---
These guys are ACTORS are you really so stupid to believe them playing dumb...?
---
My post was indicating the blind hate to the streamers for ninja looting without ever looking into it. Now a lot of people have this fresh new idea that Esfand and Asmongold are toxic ninja looters - when it was literally proven 2 hours ago that they didn't. Feel free to go read his comment on the topic. 
---
My point is also that end of the day, it's a game mechanic. Disliking it is fine but to out-right shit on people and call them the worst of the worst because of it? That's a bit sad and far. Lmao.
---
It allows you sit for crit reactive procs. This is huge for pally and warrior.
---
Great. I raided all the way up into naxx in vanilla as priest main. As a priest I always felt I was needed in raids and dungeons. I love healing because I truly believe a good or great healer can carry an otherwise bad group. If the tank and dps can‚Äôt figure shit out, you can still heal the fuck out of them and make it work. The thing is though you probably won‚Äôt get much recognition. The tank gets all the glory... but you get to secretly know who sucks and who doesn‚Äôt (if you‚Äôre good enough to the know difference I guess). Priests were always chill players too. Healers in general I guess, but specifically priests. Everyone else is drama-ing over whatever loot and healers are like ‚Äúnah dude you need that more, take it.‚Äù I‚Äôm still friends with priests I played with and met in game raising in 2004-2007. Good dudes.
---
lol wasn't regarding the one post lol
---
let's see his opinion after a month or 3...
---
Doesn't getting there involve a lot of grinding stuff? I think if anything someone like Asmongold and Sodapoppin would be the first to get all that stuff together (like Qiraij fragments and rep) because they have their peers grinding them for them.
---
To be completely honest I wouldnt be surprised if someone like Asmongold pulled a stunt and rang the gong secretly himself because it's all drama to him and he already admitted that he likes to be a dick and ninjad in his older days.
---
I'd would say realistically nothing will come, as nothing did 15yrs ago.
---
Hypothetically, for sake of argument, if it was a success and remained healthy in both subs and daily/weekly/monthly player count.... they might consider tbc. But I 99% doubt it.
---
Can I just say that I played osrs for many years, and 90% of the playerbase, if not more, from my experience have played it before, there are very few of any who are new to the game.
---
He‚Äôs an arena player why would he?
---
You‚Äôre so black pilled dude. 95% of the supposed BM I see from streamers is acting, and is hilarious. The small bits of genuine BM are so rare I‚Äôll even forgive them that. Azmongold isn‚Äôt real, it‚Äôs a persona. I‚Äôve heard him voice one opinion with extreme confidence for 5 minutes straight, accidentally miss-speak saying the opposite of that opinion, then completely switch to the miss-spoken opinion being legitimate, saying anyone who agreed with him 6 minutes ago was a blathering idiot. 
---
‚ÄúAzmongold is always 100% correct and you‚Äôre pretty dumb for not realising that‚Äù &lt;‚Äî funny part of a bombastic persona.
---
&gt; From what I've heard, you can afk level in retail also. The only difference is you pull 20 mobs instead of 1. I heard a story of a guy who was doing a "keep this NPC alive and kill the mob" event. Doorbell rang and he came back 10 min later and his NPC was still alive and doing fine.
---
In retail it 100% depends on what is happening and who is doing what. Mobs scale with level, so you're always fighting something that is "on your level". Whether or not you have heirlooms is important to factor in too. 
---
Heirlooms are designed to make the leveling process easy for you because you have 120 levels to knock out and no one wants to make that journey. 
---
Without heirlooms, things can get really dicey and you can't do what you're suggesting. 
---
You certainly can't keep doing that once your heirlooms are no longer useful and you're in current content. 
---
Point being, in that situation it is a game made easier to get you through a part of the game that is ***no longer current content***. Also the fact that anecdotes are not very useful for discussion. 
---
In Classic WoW, this ***is the content***. 
---
&gt; I'm not saying Paladin leveling is fun, but you picked the worst class for your example. Most other classes have a bigger toolkit.
---
I am well aware, but you have to look at the whole picture. I am also directly responding to OP when he said,
---
&gt; Looking forward to more players realizing how amazing old school WoW is.
---
Except for paladins, apparently. 
---
&gt; I also never used a quest add on and never will.
---
I think you miss the point. The reason Blizzard added QoL changes to the game overtime, was because players pretty much made it a requirement. 
---
Questhelper became one of the most downloaded addons in the game. So much so that not having it meant you were not playing "optimally". 
---
Saying you won't use it because of principle is not really a compelling argument.
---
Although in this case, perhaps it is better for Blizzard to offer the bare minimal of QoL, and allow users to pick and choose what they want to be fixed for convenience sake.
---
no, it doesnt proc on real game this is bug which is on some shitty private servers :)
---
F
---
be a real man and play male undead this time kiddo
---
Why do people bother with Swifty any more?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjMRzrCOo2w&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=42
---
working as intended
---
Isn't the game currently bigger than it ever was?
---
Yeah, Authenticity is definitely the name of the game, and as a Warrior main, it's definitely something I'll benefit from, but I am unsure if being able to pull 4 packs of elites to dent healer's mana reserves is what most of the purists who believe in Vanilla's difficulty, or people fooled(apparently) into believing it was difficult, are not going to be disillusioned.
---
Right right
---
&gt; I'm afraid that me playing classic again will kill the nostalgia i have.
---
Im saying this to my friend all the time that wants to play classic because of nostalgia: 
---
If you play classic just because of the nostalgia you will probably be disappointed. You can't really re-live the same feelings again that you had back then but you can enjoy the game for what it is. A better mmo.
---
That problem is present in the discord too. From the same people as on the show, usually.
---
I like everything else though.
---
it's not supposed to be sequential, all of the quotes are obviously separate experiences lmao. he's talking about scholo, dinging 60, and mining for a first mount, it's clearly not supposed to be some linear sequence of quotes
---
I want to like this guy but after watching him ninja a sentry cloak from a hunter yesterday I‚Äôm done watching his stream.
---
Thanks dude.  
---
Shame quality does go down a fair bit after converting to webm, would be sweet with a HQ one
---
LFR And Flying? That will never be removed. However, they would probably be able to change some of the other stuff without much backlash.  Honestly though I don't see them changing up the pacing and hand holding...which are big gripes of mine as well.
---
People don't like unfairness.  Especially when it's a system that looks, on the surface, like it would be fair.  Like when celebrities get slap on the wrist sentences for crimes.  It's the same reason the only kind of people who like p2w games are the people who can afford to buy the advantage.  
---
You ever lose a job or promotion to someone who is less qualified but coincidentally is the boss's nephew, or whose dad went to college with the boss, or who the boss is secretly boning?
---
You ever wait in line for something, watch VIPs skip the line and get right in, then be told they're full/sold out?
---
People play online games because they know that real life is seldom fair.  That meritocracy is a lie.  That qualified, smart, and talented will almost always lose to unqualified, dumb as a stump, untalented, \*but\* born wealthy.  Streamers are getting beta access, not because they're more qualified, or even as qualified, as other people, but because they're streamers.  So people hate them.  It's the same reason everyone who got turned down for a college that a celebrity was just revealed to have bought their kid into now hates that celebrity.  Sure, they might not have gotten in.  But their unfair advantage decreased their chances.
---
The lower level dungeons can be done fast with smaller pulls less than 4 mobs.  They tend to use less spells and simpler spells and didn't hit hard as there's no plate. The higher level dungeons like BRD where you would pull 6-7 at a time are where the danger is.  Mobs of higher levels will take out clothes very quick and will use abilities like fear.
---
if its new content it better fucking not have higher stats
---
haahahaha that shit is funny
---
I hope not TBC and WoTLK were good and fixed a lot of issues, but they also brought in the foundation of all the terrible stuff that destroyed retail (Dungeon finder, Flying, etc). If this does well I would honestly rather they just fork development and continue down a different path to see what happens.
---
In reality, they will probably just release the expansions because it's a lazy things to do an easy money.
---
The issue I have is that Blizzard seems to be whitelisting all the streamers with beta access while those of us that played during Vanilla can't get in. Me and my spouse even subbed again, since apparently you have to be subbed to be considered. I know that can't let everyone in at once, fine. But let it be truly random. You may say, "If they let some streamers in and not others it won't be fair because they make a living off streaming." So what, life isn't fair. Yeah, yeah, it's also not fair I don't have beta access, but at least I wouldn't make unfounded bug reports like these streamers do on things they have no clue about like boss damage and items with no stats.
---
I mean to each their own, miss me with that ninja shit all day. I try to stay away from streamers getting first dibs on beta stuff like this, I didn‚Äôt watch it outside of their pvp battle at gurubashi, other than that I‚Äôm just refreshing my launcher
---
The true classic experience is servers full of people with no idea what is going on, claiming Smite always drops the hammer if you can kill him before phase three.
---
Yeah blaming it on the private server community seems reasonable and very mature, atleast your comment really comes off that way.
---
"My friends and me all played Vanilla and were cool, so everyone who played it back in the day is alright and it must be the private server people that are evil."
---
Seriously, it's these kind of comments that create all the friction that's going on here. Even if you didn't mean anything bad by it.
---
Yea, you won't be able to say any stuff like that in-game either
---
I wonder how many total invites went out and how many were streamers. I bet it‚Äôs less than 10% of the total invites and will become less as more invites go out.
---
You're overestimating how big the servers are. If the cap is 2000 yea bigger streamers will completely eclipse the rest of players with their fan base
---
Restore an old backup of the servers and clients.
---
Pull down the source code for the old release and rebuild it. (And yeah I realize THAT would be an utter bitch to do).
---
But that would be for vanilla. They don‚Äôt want us to have *vanilla*.  ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù was much more work I‚Äôm sure.
---
You've seen the worst, prepare for the best.
---
I wish I had more than one upvote to give. 
---
I do think it will be better than before. Yes, original was toxic as hell too but everyone was so much younger and dumber back then. At least this time some of us will have experience and I want to believe that not everybody will be an asshole
---
Sorry, but can't help a laugh.
---
Just noticed the dad is also shirtless. That belly button
---
What‚Äôs the best way to do this? Hopeful someone comes up with a list prior to launch...
---
Nothing yikes about that. Yikes Esfand is more like.
---
Upvoted for being an actual interesting topic
---
I have one
---
Who cares...?
---
This sub hates on retail wow and retail players 24/7, yet get outraged when a very small minority of retail players hate on classic.
---
Look at my clip. It is very real in classic too, just with a different timing
---
dont think he asked about that
---
Hmm, that's quite interesting, cause I've seen other mobs around that level on the beta doing correct damage, so I wonder why this one isn't.
---
What did you do man? üòÇ
---
I mean, if you enjoy healing you really can't go wrong.
---
FeelsOkayMan
---
becuase then your stream gets circulated everywhere and drives traffic through the roof
---
Asmongold knows fuck about Vanilla he started playing like 1 month before tbc dropped if I recall it right.
---
The starter dungeons where always rather easy, normally one sheep is enough which you see people do on streamers, sometimes a saping a 2nd mob but normally one sheep/sap is enough, the strain is on the healer on some bosses who just clapp the tank.
---
what a disgusting downie-looking ass lmao and you try to gate keep this by age, my sides
---
Nah you‚Äôre just assuming things. Ven is a really nice guy.
---
The whole point of a beta is to invite a large range of players for a greater range of feedback. You can't just invite vanilla experts.
---
It's possible to just not post... anything. Pictures of a desk with a computer, pictures of one of the least rare game boxes in existence, the story of how your big brother did this trivial thing once, that's all the definition of oversharing.
---
I marked it spoilers in case of new people and even old timers who might not want to know, just yet.   :P
---
The real question is why were you posting on the official forums? That's a dark place.
---
Im not so sure it will be
---
[You could switch armor until patch 1.1](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.1.0). He mentions afterwards that he remembered swapping out trinkets in combat which seems to be true. I can't find what patch the eventually removed that feature but I assume it was sometime in vanilla.
---
Lol yeah I can agree with that. Doesn‚Äôt bother me necessarily but I can see how it can bother other people.

---
All that is true, but level appropriate elites hitting a tank that has 1200 health for ~45 damage is insignificant to the point of making CC useless.
---
Unless you are way overleveled I doubt pulling 4 PACKS of elites rewards anything but death.
---
I saw that comment.
---
Quiet down retard
---
While it might be cool to see the game get more content later on, I think I‚Äôm in the BC and then Wrath servers opening up, maybe blizz could start season like in diablo so classic would feel new every time and you would get like a special mount for that character if you completed all the raids in the season or maybe something else, just spit balling of corse =) anyways I look forward to playing classic again with friends it will be a nice break from retail =)
---
Better to be safe than sorry.
---
It‚Äôs gonna depend server to server. If pserver players are out numbered and they will be its likely the prices will differ.
---
You‚Äôll wish you hadn‚Äôt looked 50 when you turn 30 bud.
---
That should be easy enough to figure out. The sound will be the same on private servers.
---
I think u all forgot the beautiful Tradechat:
---
/2 Www.chinafarmer.xom selling gold for cheap cheap dollas.
---
Probably? More like definitely yes it's personal bias.
---
Patch 1.1 release date: 7 November 2004
---
WoW release date: 23 November 2004
---
Legit point.
---
Actual evidence right there.
---
Upvoted!
---
Yeah... this is occurring in the beta not a pserver.
---
It's is gonna vary a lot from server to server. The items that are cheap and in a low demand on *A server who shall not be named* will be more expensive and the expensive items that are on a high demand will be slightly more expensive. That's my guess at least. Also if you name pservers on this reddit you'll get banned.
---
This looks fucking amazing, gonna give it a go on a *redacted* after I've had dinner, just to try it out.
---
However if you don't mind, I have a suggestion, which unfortunately, will probably involve a decent amount of work, however given the routes are written in json I'd be happy to help contribute... aaanyway it would be really cool if, class quests were added, at least those you get to do for "free" (i.e. you run right by all the objectives as part of the guide) and/or are important, such as hunter pet, warrior defensive stance, warlock imp/warlock etc.
---
Thanks for the reply! Follow up question, are party members able to receive the effects of a Tauren shaman totems further away then say an Orc or troll sham?
---
\-50 dkp
---
Bet you won‚Äôt post a pic of yourself but yet you have the nerve to talk shit about someone else you ugly looking bitch.
---
&gt; But fuck me. The toxicity in this reddit and the blind hatred. People flaming streamers for no reason at all. A post ‚Äòexposing‚Äô a streamer for ninja looting? Yes it‚Äôs frowned upon and it‚Äôd be bad server rep but fuck me - you‚Äôre acting like he shouldn‚Äôt be in beta solely cos he ninja looted. It happens. Why is everyone so salty over this and nitpicking anything streamers do? Swearing to never play the same realm, never interact, calling them dying channels because they said they enjoy vanilla etc.
---
&gt;Embrace a community that can grow, not a community that existed.
---
This. This right here.
---
I think what he is actually trying to say is the game tries to hard to cater to those who don't enjoy features that made MMORPGs and WoW so popular in the first place. 
---
Its not a hardcore vs casual thing, Vanilla was able to cater to both those groups just fine...TBC as well. It wasn't until Wrath we start to see features brought in that appealed to players that were not necessarily the core MMO genre fans.
---
Why wouldn't it?
---
We should make a video for you titled ‚Äúhow to do a google search.
---
49 people who won't all be on the same server, who won't all even play the game, and who all won't even hit max level or get to a point where they can meaningfully contribute in some form.
---
Its blizzards job to decide what is important enough to fix, not you.  All we can do is report everything.
---
Them making a list of everything that is reported and assigning value to them doesn't take any time compared to actually fixing them, so reporting everything and letting them decide is the best course of action.
---
But I guess you already knew that, cause you can't not, right?

Only a matter of time before someone else reports it, assuming Esfand hasn't.
---
I will gank every single one of you wannabe mods making these insufferable meta posts. 
---
Then you‚Äôll report me for in-game toxicity üòÇ
---
Jesus
---
It's very unlikely there are many (or any) bugs related to mob damage/armor/health/stat etc. values because they use the actual database values from 1.12. One thing I've seen mentioned is starting zone mobs dealing "too little" damage, but they really are supposed to only hit for 1-2 (on some private servers they instead hit for like 5-9 or something).
---
This is really really interesting. And it seems like you're correct.
---
oh lol didnt know
---
Ya tipsout did a 20 person raid to kill cyclonian for WW axe (level 40 elite) and it did 120ish damage against the level 30 warrior.
---
Mob damage, especially elites, seems to be nerfed somehow in beta
---
But I think getting a reality check on your nostalgia/memories is a huge part of this whole project. Seeing what parts of Classic WoW will hold up in 2019 and which parts won't is not only very interesting but could even inform further development of modern WoW (or maybe a rebooted WoW) as well as the genre as a whole.
---
People were rightfully pissed about the famous "You think you do but you don't" quote and I think the only fair thing to do (for all parties involved) is to create an authentic experience. Some people will think it's too easy, some people will think it's too hard, some people will be disillusioned and realize it was nostalgia all along and some people will find rekindled love. For me that's the whole point.
---
from 0 viewers up to asmongold viewers (60k+) every guy (1-5 exceptions) started streaming because they got a beta key? thats funny was the wow section on twitch always \~1000 viewers before beta since they all started streaming wow cause of beta invite ?
---
Good luck!
---
Holy shit you can get banned for saying *that*?
---
What did they do then?
---
Fookin noob
---
Rofl yeah. I've even noticed pserver chats are starting to turn into twitch chat. It's crazy how big twitch has gotten
---
I did the same, hope it works.
---
I'm not a wannabe mod and it seems you took my post out of content but thanks. Feel free to gank bud it's part of the game.
---
I love how he talks about the vanilla experience, reading quests, having an adventure... Then says "lvl 21: practicing my aoe grind" 
---
That's the problem, you will realise soon enough that aoe grind in classic will be the most boring thing ever. and you'd wish you just stick to questing and having a good time. 
---
Unless you aoe grind yourself to 60 and love it, but i doubt it.
---
pants optional
---
You can always experience dungeons and quests on an alt though. Rushing to 60 and then farming gold is way more effective than farming gold while leveling slow, same goes for professions imo.
---
Leveling is a chore to a lot of people and they want to get through it as fast as possible. The very vast majority of WoW players always played and always will play WoW for their endgame content.
---
Was highlighting a current example with the 'a post' sentence. Later expand onto all the other streamer stuff with 'anything streamers do', showing that it doesn't just happen in this one post.
---
This one is pretty good if you're considering alliance https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/
---
Well theres this window where you can pre create your character to reserve the name.
---
Good luck.
---
&gt; The grind to 60 is half the fun
---
No it's not.
---
&gt; How do mythic raids compare with a fight like 4 Horsemen? Honestly asking because 4 horsemen is very unforgiving and complicated. 
---
Watch this kill video of [Kil'Jaeden mythic in the Tomb of Sargeras (Tier 20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8it5rki5I10).
---
Almost every mechanic in there kills the raid if you fuck up only in the slightest. 
---
Armageddon (the meteors) have to be soaked. If one goes off, it is a wipe.
---
The rupturing singularities (the purple/black orbs at the edges and the middle of the boss room) push you very far. So much, that there were certain timings together with armageddons where you could barely manage to get into safe range. Also, standing slightly off would either push you outside of the arena or too far inwards, which would mean you'd most certainly die to the following singularity.
---
Focused Dreadflame (the targeted laser people have to stand in a line for) causes every player hit to also send out a small aoe around them. If you stand too close to others you will die.
---
The DPS adds have to be DPSd down one at a time and when they die, the player they come from will spawn those erupting orbs that go over the arena. Sleep on moving properly and you will die.
---
The obilisks in P3 straight out one shot. By the end there are like 8 or 9 of them there, all doing damage in a straight line south-north-west-east. By the end there are only one or two safe spots that have to be marked. If the people marking them fuck up you will wipe.
---
Next we got KJ himself. 
---
Fel Claws: deals a ridiculous amount of damage. If you don't pay serious, serious attention you won't be able to survive this. You can see HP numbers being in the millions. A single fel claw at 5 stacks of the debuff can oneshot the tanks, even with bear druids having such a huge buffer of HP.
---
Then you got the tank add. It has to be killed after a certain amount of time to coutneract the singularity that spawns in the midddle. If the add is killed it leaves a ridiculously heavy ticking dot on the tank it was bound to that, when dispelled, pulls all the raid members to the tank.
---
There are also healer adds that have to be healed and which will kill the raid if they aren't, since the healing received reduces the damage done by the AoE.
---
The fight is full of damage and skill checks. Method had 650 wipes on it, which only got topped recently by Uu'nat with 730ish. Even my "casual" top 500 guild, two days a week, needed 296 wipes. 
---
The main difference to Vanilla raiding is that the personal skill required went up dramatically. Vanilla raids are a logistical challenge, since you need 40 or more people for later raids, most notably Naxx of course. You can see on plenty of private server videos, that the fight against the horsemen is not that difficult for the individual players. The biggest "skill check" are the tanks and their gear.
---
And now that we are getting those back officially, it is fair to compare them when asking yourself what you actually want from the game, which is why I wrote the second paragraph of my post like that.
---
Who the fook is dis guy
---
calling andy milonakis a streamer. lol
---
They can't just recompile and release old code, running on old architecture, and *not" expect to get owned immediately and then promptly sued out of existence. 
---
 This idea that you can just spin up legacy code and run it is absolutely insane, and downright dangerous even if it can, in theory, work.
---
You'll never recapture the magic, but the game is still great without it.  I played a pserver last year and had a fucking great time and I'm RL friends with guildies and stuff now.
---
Everything that was great about wow is still there, all you'll miss is that feeling of being a noob and discovering new stuff
---
Hey man please don't get turned off of this subreddit for these guys. You're gonna love it and you shouldn't let turds turn you off to the experience. Let's make this shit dope when Classic drops and turn it around.
---
You do realize his group was level 25+ and the mobs were 19
---
[AHHH!](https://youtu.be/r-YprpQuqRs)

The numbers seem to low imo. We will see if they get changed
---
I left the discord recently for this reason. I also liked everything else about the show!
---
I‚Äôm surprised you haven‚Äôt been downvoted to oblivion. August 26th, last day we have to be on the sub!
---
GOMEREGAN SECESSION NOW! Classic is our chance to do it right my gnomies!
---
lololol well played!
---
yea why him and not me...
---
It's all about internet culture. Streamers are big and will be big for atleast quite a few more years until it dies down. This is why I'm vouching for a 'no-stream' option when choosing realms. You know that if a big streamer rolls on your server basically all infamy will go away and everything will circle around the streamer.
---
This might be what some people want. But it's not for me for sure.
---
Fucking. Hate. This. Cancer.
---
You know, we have a documented history of how vanilla / classic / TLP server goes. many MMO tried this...
---
Everquest , for example, release a new one every year or so now. Crazy high population in the first month, dwindle to the same handfull of player after 3 month, racing for the same achievement they'Ve achieved 5 times already...
---
2 years later, people have to box multiple toons because there's not enough player available to do content...
---
Ain't planning too, don't worry. Just thought I'd say my general thoughts on the state of the sub-reddit. Thanks, you too. Gonna be great! :)
---
Pretty sure blizzard's touted 'reference 1.12' version is actually 2.0 when instances were nerfed prebc so people could level a 60 easy before the expansion.
---
Why are you so angry over such a small thing?
---
Wow that was terrifying. Thankyou so much  for sharing.
---
Classic runs on the modern client/server architecture. They ported the old 1.12 database, maps, graphics assets etc. to it, but much of the actual game logic (anything that requires any complicated scripting or is programmed into the client or server) had to be reimplemented. For example combo points, removing "rating" stats, spell batching, that kind of thing. They also had to basically rewrite the UI.
---
I mean there is an ability called hamstring, and humans posses the ability to estimate the passage of time in their heads.
---
Burn it!!!
---
Furbolg nut, yeahno.
---
new content would be nice. but they can't add another tier level.
---
Its not going to live up to the hype, and it's definitely not going to satisfy most people. This version is all about chasing the dragon, or the law of diminishing returns
---
&gt;Armor can't be swapped out while in combat. Other equipment such as weapons and **accessories can still be swapped out**.
---
Which is what I was referring to. He specifically notes later on that he remembers swapping out trinkets. I assume that was patched later on but I can't find which patch it was.
---
I tend to agree but have found myself watching streamers on the beta to try and pick up some tips and tricks and because well, i cant play the game yet since its not out and im not going to resub for a chance at beta.
---
Use our LFG sticky posts please.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm likely going human as that‚Äôs what I played in vanilla.
---

---
Im sorry that I offended you, but I'm perfectly fine with women playing wow. Im talking about thots, yknow boobie streamers.
---
&gt; There is something very wrong, I don't care what anyone says about blizzard's internal server.
---
What do you mean "you don't care"?
---
Yeah, unfortunately that's just how it is now. I said something similar here a few times. On a large server, you eventually started to recognize some of the people who were really good at a certain aspect of the game, or they were known for something. Felt a bit more of a social aspect when you started to recognize even the opposite alliance rogue that ganked you for the 30th time
---
1.	You asked.
---
2.	I‚Äôm not sure if ‚Äúowned‚Äù is meant in the hacking sense here or what.
---
3.	sued out of existence for what and by who?
---
4.	Ever heard of a release branch or porting fixes? 
---
You are tiresome and I am done here. It‚Äôs all an irrelevant thought exercise anyway because there‚Äôs no way they give us something that fun before they ripped the best lua APIs out.
---
Upvoted.
---
I really really really hope kiting will be a thing like it was in vanilla.
---
So yes, PLEASE check this for us! &lt;3

There is also the fact that streamers automatically give video evidence of bugs occurring. Streamers can report a bug and no matter how vague of a description they give blizz can just review the persons stream to see exactly what happened in regards to said reported bug. They don't even have to make bug reports at all, blizz can just tune in to streams and watch for bugs without any input at all from the streamer. It's actually a smart move to use the people who record and broadcast their playtime for finding and verifying bugs.
---
Hush, you sewer rat.
---
25 armor is a fuckton at that level but the difference shouldn't be *that* big, Joana is also "slightly twinking" in his testings, so maybe he's wearing better gear? I dunno.
---
It‚Äôs really hard to heal mobs to death.
---
Healers get gear to heal people in pass pve content better. Dps get gear and they dps better in raids, kill mobs quicker in the world, kill players quicker in PvP.
---
Well that wasn‚Äôt a very nice thing to say.
---
But isnt the point reporting things you Think is a bug, for then to let blizzard figure out if it is or isnt?
---
Mobs still need a buff, multiple people are saying so(me included).
---
male ud was too mainstream for my 18 year old me :D
---
To be honest, the main point I bring this discussion up is to get some sort of confirmation from Blizzard, because I have not heard much from them regarding this topic, as if they want to keep lid on it to let people decide for themselves and devolve into asinine arguments about Nostalgia/Faulty Memories/People got Better etc.
---
Nowhere did Blizzard state that "the math is correct, and those values you see in Beta are same as they were in Vanilla". And this being Beta, it should be discussed as potential critical error in whatever witchcraft they used to bring Vanilla to modern client/servers.
---
Seems very ineffiecient at level 15-26. Why the hell are we going all the way to teldrassil?
---
He gain few armor from drood buff but you are right thoses damages are so low
---
Was he not over level for SFK? He was 25 and I thought that was a lower level dungeon. I could be wrong though.

Vanilla and TBC didn't do so well on that front (especially BC with the crazy attunements) admittedly they were better and even more alt friendly (except maybe TBC) than BFA or Legion is/was.

---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more, the mods need to crack down on witch hunting. It‚Äôs getting out of hand.
---
It's very worth it. Some bosses take up to 5 (8 in extreme cases) tanks.
---
But don't think you'll be DPSing much until like AQ40/naxx
---
Almost everyond in this thread is proving your point lmao
---
Jesse and TotalBiscuit both got famous in Vanilla with WoWRadio and BluPlz.
---
depends when you started playing... I started playing a year after vanilla launch and most players were high level and economy was already good. I could sell copper ore for a good amount of money. Its much easier to make gold if you come later than start on a fresh realm.
---
Having 100g at 40 is very difficult, you have to be very lucky on drops and play the AH a lot.
---
Interesting.  I only have vanilla experience from private servers but cyclonian destroyed me and I was closer to lvl 40 as well.
---
Even if you end up on a server with a streamer, I'm sure blizz will have x-fers available at some point. Obviously that is not ideal, but it's better than rerolling. People make it sound like the streamers will be able to blockade 5-mans or raids. Honestly, it's a bit overdramatic.
---
Popular streamer on your server, but don't want to run content with them? Ok...then join a guild, and run with your guildmates. And for the record, I'm not a fan of streamers. They're entertainers first and players second. Personally, I'm looking forward to joining a solid guild, and running shit tons of endgame content.
---
Your time on the server, is what you make of it, and is defined by your choices. Not theirs.
---
Awesome! I feel once with Vanilla in high school and I'm 31 now. I'm getting butterflies for it cause there will be a very enthusiastic community to play with. Keep me in my pleighboi I'll friend ya.
---
i agree. only surprise retail has is titanforging (no thx).
---
I dont think flying mounts destroyed wpvp to the extent people say they did. Players still fly to high traffic areas to get things done. Elemental plateau, ogri‚Äôla, instance entrances, etc. They definitely affected wpvp but these places are still comparable to BRM in terms of being centers of wpvp activity (quel‚Äôdanis probably even more volatile).
---
Imo what really killed wpvp is never having to leave town because dungeon finder started existing.
---
The old world being obsolete is an issue ill agree. Zones being ugly is subjective- I loved most of BCs art style. Dailies I agree are an issue.
---
Vanilla BGs are utter cancer imo (due to getting constantly steamrolled by premades while soloing, and the flipside being just as lame). I enjoyed arenas way more as an instanced form of pvp.
---
lmao imagine being mad at a known ninja, ninja looting a blue on a ptr
---
The problem with social media is you get the vast majority of your traffic from a vocal minority of users. 
---
WoW started going down the sewer when they started getting feedback on the forums from the ~20% of vocal users on the forum. They didn't stop to think the other 80% were too busy playing the game and loving it to come bitch on the forums.
---
&gt; The server will decide who is deserving  
---
Not when the streamer audience is 100s or thousands of people. They can turn in thousands of cloth in a couple of minutes at 3am while their streamer is at the gate or something.
---
yeah, not sure what to do about that :(
---
I think these guys are looking at it all wrong. Have the kids play with you.

---
Leveled 1-6 as undead. Couple things I noticed in the starting zone:
---
\-Scarlet mobs aggro range seems a little short. Some of the mobs didn't attack me when I was only about 10-yards away.
---
\-Scarlet mobs didn't tether properly, Meven K. (the messenger) ran right by a couple other mobs to attack  me and the other mobs did not follow.
---
I see you decided the best solution was to make the problem worse by posting this.
---
I find this very hard to believe that they re-wrote most of the game logic. This game is massive. By 'taught' they most definitely meant they implemented a way for the new modern server architecture to interpret old protocols sent by the 1.12.1 client. There would be absolutely no reason to re-build a 1.12.1 client from scratch. I can see them taking the bulk of code from a 1.12.1 build and integrating it with a modern client though and then adapting the servers to work with the modified protocols though.
---
That is intended.
---
As I said, its more important on Nef than it is on Ony.And its only really good on ony when the foght goes south. Like you lose a portion of ppl to deep breath, or many whelps. Yes, magmadar is easy to immune every fear. Idk how that is relevant at all. You're hand waving about nefarian. Class calls nake the fight random and not just a dps check
---
Part of me absolutely agrees with that statement. The game has become more and more casual friendly and straight dumbed down. Personally I'm not a fan of that fact, but on some level I can understand why Blizzard has done so over the years. As a business their first priority is to make money and remain profitable. 
---
But there is also this part of me that is really disappointed in the game's direction over the past several years/expansions. I'm not a hardcore player by any stretch of the imagination, yet I managed to get through many grinds during Vanilla and experienced mythic raiding here and there. 
---
I personally believe a vast majority of gamers are spoiled due to receiving rewards/loot/whatever when they spent little time or effort to obtain whatever it is. 
---
Obviously people should recieve rewards for doing/accomplishing something, but when the rewards on are par with things people who actually spend time and effort to earn that is where I have an issue.
---
You literally did though.
---
Most people ive talked with about it (all of us play retail btw) are generally of the mindset that we are going to try it out casually. What most classic players dont seem to understand is that retail players dont really care about classic. What makes retail great and something classic can never compete with is that retail isnt time consuming, you can play 3h 2 night a week and get shit done. 3h in vanilla endgame is nothing.
---
I like to compare classic wow to vanilla minecraft, there arent that much there but the things that are is usually meaningful and can be done a billion different way. In retail and modded minecraft you consume the content really fast and then you are done. 
---
I dont care which is better as a retail player, all I know is im gonna enjoy the crap out of classic, and when i dont have the time anymore i might go back to retail, maybe not though. Its not a big deal what i play tbh, as long as I enjoy it and got the time nessessary.
---
&gt; Later expand onto all the other streamer stuff with 'anything streamers do', showing that it doesn't just happen in this one post. 
---
Feel free to show me some examples (sorry I don't live and breath twitch drama like most zoomers).
---
Aoe grinding is a great option for your 3rd character. Or your second late at night. Or your first if you can break ahead of the pack by more than a 3 hour lead from the ‚Äúpeloton‚Äù.
---
Some of the streamer bashing is warranted, but it‚Äôs also incredibly petty when you do it out of envy, because they‚Äôre playing and you‚Äôre not. However, as far as things like layering, is it wrong to voice concern? With loot trading, a big chunk of the community was loud about it, and as a result, Blizzard made a quality compromise. That‚Äôs where I am with layering at the moment, as much as people will tell me I‚Äôm stuck in the past for thinking that.
---
I think it should only be able to be done in major cities, not anywhere in the world, that's for sure. Inns are a bit too close to certain gathering hotspots so I'd say all major cities should work.    
---
Great suggestion
---
On a technicality, the graphics are better in retail, better textures and detail etc. But, for a few reasons, they're worse. I have a shitey laptop, so as a result of the updated textures and crazy details, I can't even run retail very well. Private servers from vanilla to mop the games run smoothly and therefore looks better. I get that this isn't the case for people with good machines. But also I don't really like the feel of the updated graphics that came in legion. To me, vanilla just looks better.
---
Well there's private server bugs that allow cyclonian to be spawned between levels 40-43 as an elite which can make an absolutely massive difference.  In vanilla he was ALWAYS level 40
---
They‚Äôve already said classic servers for other expansions will happen if the demand exists.
---

---
People ask these class questions all the time and give zero or a single piece of information to base the answer off of.
---
Warrior is worth going if that‚Äôs the class you enjoy playing, end of story. The level 1-60 experience can last anywhere from 120 to 240++ hours of in game play time. 
---
If the ONLY thing you are asking is if a warrior does good damage at level 60 with near pre-raid best in slot, then yes it does compared to other classes with similar gear.
---
&gt; To me this all comes down to loyalty to the guild.
---
I completely agree, but I will say, any rogue who would accept a Thunderfury (before the tanks anyway) doesn't have the guilds best interest in mind.
---
Yeah, retail shouldn't become classic, in vis versa. Just let them be different and play the one you wanna play .
---
That ninja looting thread was just hilariously bad. It really was a textbook example of trying to stir up some drama for no reason. Looking through those peoples comment history just shows how unhappy they are with everyone and everything around them. Sometimes the devil is right between your ears folks :)
---
Some very good evidence to back this up. Hope the Classic team takes a look at this.
---
But that's the opposite of what you said in your op. And as I said: I have no idea if the numbers on beta are correct. You stated in your op that you wanted to talk about difficulty (in terms of damage numbers) regardless of whether or not they are correct.
---
But yeah, I think everyone is interested in whether or not the numbers are correct and I'm pretty confident that Blizzard is looking into it. (and contrary to popular belief on here there are in fact people testing this stuff and trying to compare it to original vanilla footage - but of course in the end only Blizzard will be able to test it with their 1.12 server files)
---
Couldn't agree more. this is beyond circlejerk
---
&gt;As I don't expect to have a lot of high end gear (probably mostly dungeon blues, etc.)
---
This guy isn't looking to raid much.
---
As for your answer, I'm not sure what you're trying to say. If he raided as a DPS warrior, why wouldn't he be DPS'ing until AQ and Naxx?
---
But it locks you, preventing you from helping your guild do MC runs for bindings.
---
At the end of the day it doesn't matter - Unless they severely outgear the content - druids are only viable main tanks on very small amount of bosses.
---
I have a screenshot of Mosh'Ogg Warmonger elite mob hitting for 72 at level 60 on a arms warrior. So 120 at 30 does not seem that off
---
I'm looking at playing a horde druid. Stealth runs where my jam in vanilla and I look forward to doing them again (probably resto) As for server, I'll probably just roll on whatever the most popular server is as the game is more fun with lots of people
---
When I started WoW back in the day I joined a RP server. Someone whispered me speaking a language that I didn't understand. I replied with "what?" and got told to "learn Elvish or get the fuck off a roleplay server" üòÇ
---
I was playing a Dwarf..
---
The amusing thing about the toxicity here is that I thought vanilla was all about its community. I wonder if there's too much of a crossover between here and r/wowservers. Oh well, at least the ingame community will be pleasant.
---
They have not made an official response to this idea, yes. But Blizzard's communication with classic community so far has not earned them this insidious mastermind that's all about easy money(as it may be called for retail).
---
Not only are the mobs harder but I think that what made classic great was that the devs focused on making the interactions and your time in the world feel truly like a world, and less like min maxing mechanics and achievements.

&gt; People are just now experiencing a real MMORPG in 2019.
---
Bingo!
---
I"m not even going to bother to read this.  lol
---
I've been here for a year or so and haven't really seen any real toxicity in form of flames or anything like that.  
---
The only notable thing is that there is a sort of tribalism and bit of elitism going on.   
---
You have Team Private Server whos played Vanilla for years on private realms and acquired lots of knowledge that way  
---
Then you have Team OG Vanilla who pride themselves for having played Vanilla back in the days and usually will try to  play down the achievements and knowledge of the former team.  
---
Then there's the Anti-Stream attitude that both of the camps can have.  
---
That being said, it's usually just hinted and I've never seen anyone really insult anyone of the other "Team" before. Just a lot of natural friction stemming from the fact that the one side will say   
---
"Your 15yo memory is wrong and I have practiced vanilla for years now", and the other saying "Private servers are way off reality and actual vanilla is much harder so all your experience is invalid" which tends to rub the other side the wrong way.
---
I don't even want to get into the Anti-Stream thing. I can get behind disliking all that "Fakeness" and Exaggeration that some of the big streamers display in order to entertain their audience, but sometimes I feel people are a bit TOO suspicious of anybody that has a twitch account.
---
But is this sub toxic? Hell no. It's usually just a bunch of memes about memories that we share. If you want to see what toxicity looks like go and play League or any game based on the source engine online
---
She got it at a yaaawd sale
---
What's with all the subreddit hate lately.
---
Honestly the people bitching the loudest seem to be those complaining about complainers.  It's ridiculous.
---
Culture, counter-culture and the wheel keeps spinning.
---
How dense are you? Blizzard have ALREADY CONFIRMED that the mob respawn rates are not a bug. You're linking the wrong blue post.
---
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/
---
The following is a list of commonly-reported gameplay in WoW Classic that is not actually a bug, and is working as we expect it to:
---
Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth.
---
Remember, this is what you wanted!
---
Willing to bet it's armor.  Chances are he has like 1 more item and the druid buff makes all the difference.
---
Compared the games - not the sub reddits. Was on about the player count and their registration/first experience dates.
---
Go get some air you sewer rat.
---
\&gt; complain about toxic community  
---
\&gt; laughs at suicide
---
I think it is during the week (wed/thu)
---
Blizzard massively tuned down the frequency of weather effects because BITD most people play WoW on potato computers
---
Race change and faction change came out during WOTLK. Server transfers were available late in Vanilla.
---
Be a healer then. Level a Druid, underrepresented roles at all levels are those who can tank and or heal. Druids can do both well till 60. 
---
Level as feral, tanking your way to 60. Then resto for groups and raids at max level. In the hands of the worlds best players resto may underperform relative to a priest. But they use different gear, so can gear concurrent to priests, and at all other skill levels, player ability will trump class limits. So if your best player is a Druid, it‚Äôs possible your top healer is a Druid.
---
Have you actually been reading content here recently?
---
It has done a complete heelturn to the point where a meta discussion needs to happen.
---
The nut reserve
---
It is literally in the video you brainlord
---
Which is fair, but i guess most of the launch playerbase will be made of old WoW players, which are familiar with the mecanics and ressources avaible.
---
It's anyone's bet at this point, but i think we'll have a much more "mature" playerbase on classic, where everyone knows more or less what he's doing. 
---
What do you think about it ?
---
Because he's actually trying to contribute and an item with 0 stats, while correct, is fairly odd.
---
The first video is level 5 player attacked by a level 7 tiger.  
---
The second video is level 8 player attacked by a level 7 tiger.  
---
Due to wow combat systems, the first case allows Crushing Blows and the second case allows Glancing Blows.  
---
Since people are too fucking stupid to Beta Test with their combat log up, we cannot be sure.
---
In this case the first video show 5,5,6,6 as a pretty reasonable attack series.  If they happened to all be crushing blows, (1.5x) they would rather be around 3.5 dmg (or 3-4 or something).  
---
Now, in the second video, we can see when he fights a level 8 mob at level 8, that it does 3-4 damage on hit.
---
And if we take 3-4 damage, and reduce to 0.75, as per a glance with no weapon skill, we get 2-3 damage per hit.
---
TLDR: FUCKING TEST WITH SHIT THAT SHOWS YOU WHAT HAPPENED, STOP PLAYING IT LEVEL AND MAKE MONEY OF GUIDES/VIEWERS
---
Main problem with most large models is you can't do WSG jumps as easily
---
For example Dwaf female &gt; male for that reason
---
The jumps are easier, and some are impossible as a male
---
Yeah it's pretty painful. Cool post, cool story, really ignorant fans who think they know better...
---
&gt;Vanilla would never have a player phase in our out of existance in any other case than logging out (in which case your character would obviously logged out of the entire game.)
---
This is, but layering isn't.
---
&gt;  A post ‚Äòexposing‚Äô a streamer for ninja looting? 
---
This made me laugh out loud reading it.  A ninja looter? In Classic? OMGWTFSTFU! /s
---
Seriously though, ninjas were a part of Vanilla and the threat of some rando in your pug being a ninja was a big part of what drove community engagement - guilds built reputations based on the behavior of their members which drove guilds to hold their members accountable and in turn led to it being easier for members of well-behaved guilds to get into runs because people had some assurance they would behave ethically.  Reporting someone to an officer of their guild for bad behavior was actually a significant threat in some of these situations.
---
TLDR: I agree that it is toxic, and it amuses me a bit because some of the stuff that people are complaining about is actually the exact stuff that gives me hope for a better Classic experience and community.
---
What harm was done?
---
Don't worry if it's currently not the same, it will be noticed and fixed by Blizzard.
---
It's obvious they're committed to replicating bugs and features from classic.
---
Monday afternoon and only west coast
---
I think we're in a weird place right now and no one really knows what to do. We have a streamed CLOSED beta for a game that has a hardcore community. You have streamers that are playing the game without bug testing in mind, but as an afterthought for something unexpected.
---
It's just a bad formula. If you're a streamer, you have people expecting you to perform. One of the goals of WoW is not to die, but sometimes, you die. It's hard not to have a reaction where you try to divert why you died (or did anything else poorly / mistakenly), and being in a beta test, the easiest excuse to use is, "bugged". Replace this scenario with trying to beat a boss that does something unexpected (hits hard), trying to change gear in combat, or any of the number of things that have popped up here recently. The knee-jerk reaction is to call it a bug, regardless of your experience with Vanilla WoW, but the people have DO have experience in Vanilla WoW will be very quick to point out that it is not a bug, but in fact something that is just different from retail, or that the player is simply doing something poorly or incorrect.
---
There are right ways to call that out, either being straightforward or humorous, and there are wrong ways to call it out, by either trolling or demeaning. The nature of the situation we've been handed, which is inexperienced beta testers playing a known game that are in front of thousands of viewers that have played that game, is just weird, and this is what you get.
---
All that being said, I'm still in the camp of publicly shaming anyone who has a platform and uses it to promote toxic behavior. If thousands of people are watching you be a terrible player in your playgroup, even if they are your friends, I'm all for calling it what it is and letting everyone know about it. That's not toxic, those players are.
---
&gt;I want to be able to lie to people in game
---
The community will police that.  The servers will know who you are and you‚Äôll get away with it once.  Enjoy.
---
You don‚Äôt have to resub
---
The strafing one is really annoying, it makes combat look really goofy when you try strafing and hitting a mob.
---
oh man i forgot bout those dudes
---
I only recently started watching him, didn‚Äôt know about his dark ninja past...
---
Mostly based on testing from 2008 that should apply to Vanilla. The Tauren hitbox wasn't changed between the base game and BC.
---
WoW streamer numbers are always spiky, with several hundred thousand viewers during world first races, and the dropping down hard after that.
---
Currently there isn't anything of significance to stream in BFA right now. WF races are long over, regular pvp/pve doesn't draw a large audience. Classic should be getting most of the attention, as its 'different', and for the vast majority - inaccessible.
---
And someone getting a classic key is definitely going to be more motivated to stream. Always a good idea to use any advantage you get.
---
Obligatory "LOL beta virgin is right!" I'm sorry.
---
Probably expressed myself poorly on this yeah, but it's about verifying whether what we see on streams is correct or not, and depending on that, whether it ought to be adjusted. Don't want this issue to be shelved due to negligence just to get into Sunken Temple and be one shot by everything 3 months from now on(if there really is something wrong with values), nor by extrapolation, be able to pull half a ring worth of mobs and be fine.
---
Semi-casual guilds aren't going to get the mount for anybody. There were only a couple per server, some just one.
---
Or just take it for what it is.
---
I agree. The toxicity has really been amped up these last few weeks. I started lurking here many months ago and it was not always this way. What changed? Tips used to be someone to make jokes at, these days you'd think he broke into Blizzards headquarters and smashed up the servers. The gatekeeping is just pitiful. It's honestly the worst thing about what this sub has become. I still come here everyday, but damn. It's an old ass video game. Fuck off with the elitism.
---
The clip not play for anyone else?
---
Do you honestly believe blizzard made such a system so they could go through reports one by one?
---
There's a 100k people in this sub. Those comments are the minority of the sub. Don't let a minority of people turn you away from a great game. Just don't read those posts. Plenty of good content on this sub, but with 100k people, you're bound to see some dicks.
---
His reply is obviously sarcastic and making fun that he has no meaning in this world other than ripping into streamers and talks about a fictional suicide - one that wouldn't really happen just because somebody couldn't flame streamers. Laughing at comedic deaths in action-comedy movies is the same thing in this sense. Is that wrong?
---
No, I'm afraid the Tauren Shaman totems are the exact same as a totem from another race.
---
I think we're watching players with solid coordination.  
---
Watched Asmongold Thursday and he played Deadmines very carefully. He called out CC targets for the mage.  
---
Back in the day, I would agree, content seemed more difficult. Elites were pretty tough. Idk if that was because I was under geared, less efficient, less game experience within group. They do a good job of minimizing mistakes.
---
It's fine, they quit few weeks or days after launch taking all the people with them, I don't expect them to make it to 60, let alone do end game dungeons
---
World record is 2 weeks to hit 60 on classic, they will take at least 4 to 8 weeks the way they play.
---
Besides if your a streamer you can't play same game for long period of time, it means death to your streaming career, you play hype and new releases.
---
But yeah first 2 weeks will be pure cancer at launch.
---
Two cosmetics things that really turn me off and break my vanilla imersiveness.
---
   \-Torso not turning while strafing. Whole character turns, this is bfa style and not vanilla.
---
   \-No moonwalking.
---
 self "acclaimed" adults
---
It depends on the amount of warriors available. But generally speaking warriors are tanks, because they're the only class that can tank raids (Except for the fringe druid or pally OT). Sure OP might get lucky and get to raid as DPS, but probably not.
---
But as I said, it depends on how many warriors are available on that realm.
---

---
I don't know what to tell you, buddy. Anyone who's followed the development will tell you the same thing: Classic is forked from the 7.3.5 client (or thereabouts). The impracticality of updating the old 1.12 codebase is the primary reason it took them this long to release Classic in the first place.
---
You are correct! My mistake, I thought the 26th was a Sunday.
---
BINGO!
---
He‚Äôs been playing since classic....
---
All good casters. If you ever feel like healing or meleeing then go for shaman. It's blast to level and try all kinds of things. If you want easy leveling experience then go for warlock with pets. Mage is always powerful and useful but you have lots of downtime. You can farm efficiently and that's what you'll do while lebeling and after reaching 60.
---
When I start hearing people use a term that's \[color\] pill it's usually a good indication not to talk to them. I'm not sure what black pilled means, but redpilled is a term associated with the incels here on reddit. Most people would probably won't to avoid that association. 
---
Not saying you're wrong or it means anything bad/stupid, but it's immediately what's gonna come to mind with most redditors.
---
You can turn off error speech.
---
I keep thinking this is not gonna happen but then i see more clips like these showing streamers having absolutely no clue what theyre reporting as bugs. Its often even that bad they dont stop to think for a second if this could just be how Classic is, nope better file a report before researching.
---
Go play ur dead MMO . Andy is awesome
---
And actually providing evidence for a change.
---
Imagine being this mad cus u don't got a beta
---
Test it with NPCs to see if it works.
---
A streamer with 500 people farming rep for them to get the battle tank is going to leave the possibility of ZERO other people getting one on that realm.
---
Holy shit that's in vanilla? wow I can't forget how dissapointed I was when I saw that in legion. It so bad.
---
Its little things like this that make vanilla. can someone with beta access please report?
---
Wasn't this posted on here before?

To be honest, there are a lot of fun discussions and threads on this reddit. Yeah there is hatred on streamers, but to call out this whole reddit as solely toxic is actually inmature. Just don‚Äôt click on these posts and you‚Äôll have a decent time on here. I can understand the hatred on streamers because they can ruin the experience for other people on the server by creating unfair and weird situations. I would never ventilate this frustration on internet though but to each their own I giess, that‚Äôs the beauty of an open forum.

"so, um, like, if I get 15 more subs in the next hour I will, like, take off my chest piece and dance on the mailbox in Ironforge"
---
It's going to happen.
---
You are not ready for barrens chat
---
Get a ranged weapon so you can pull single mobs.  You'll also ranged pull in dungeons if it's not an aoe pull.
---
The post you're responding to actually proves your point.
---
gotcha, yea I mean he used to do videos on how to ninja people and shit
---
I did an auction house shuffle with rune cloth. Bought everything on th AH, made heavy rc bandages, and turned those in to get the reward kits. Turn around and sell the blue items. Made enough to get exalted with Darnassus (as a gnome) and buy a swift stormsaber. By the time I was done the price of rune cloth had gone up 10x lol.
---
Nah private servers are filled with warriors rogue and mages. They stay good for the entire vanilla. and stay on top dps for all that time Locks start weak untill AQ, while hunters start strong but stays the same at aq. Locks will be good dps in naxx with the gear they get, but yeah that's 2 years from now.
---
This vanilla will be mostly pvp, cause of the knowledge ppl have about pve, it will be cleared in no time.
---
For example, Seeing Shroud gonna main a shaman is the best thing us Horde can hope for. I predict alot of new players going shaman.
---
Genuinely sounds like you only enjoy raid logging in BFA. You‚Äôll quit classic by level 30 guaranteed. You don‚Äôt like mmorpg ‚Äòs. You‚Äôd genuinely like it if they just made a raiding simulator game. Classic isn‚Äôt for you my friend and most people are not in the same category as you. Just look at the sub trends.
---
I'm not quite understanding the hate for anyone reporting what they think might be bugs, streamer or not. The game is 15 years old, many people never played or haven't played since then. This bandwagon hating on people not knowing every in and out of the game is frankly dissapointing to me.
---
If you really think reports like this slows development or clogs the pipeline of bug fixing, then idk what to say.
---
I'm 100% with you on that. But I think the fact that the recent "NOT A BUG List" bluepost didn't mention damage numbers (even though many people have reported them as wrong) is a good indication that they simply don't know yet.
---
The irony is that this small group of asshats will turn off all the people from playing classic, ultimately killing the game.
---
There is nothing too wrong with Swifty, people just have to realise that just because you made a good pvp video in classic with cool tricks in it, you are not some sort of vanilla wow GOD. Swifty doesn't know too much about classic wow when it comes to the details, very very many random unknown people have much more knowledge than he does. The same goes for much of the streamers and content creators. Blizzard just gives beta to people who have viewers, thats it. If they gave it to the most qualified people then you wouldn't see anyone streaming it because they wouldnt have access.
---
The mage saying that he needs to pop potion if he pulls 2 mobs... GIT GUD!
---
I'll be drinking soylent while I camp your corpse and /train
---
#dealwithitsunglassesface.jpg
---
Not to call Asmong a shit player, because he isn't, but coordination means nothing when you go into SFK and pull entire courtyard and be fine. Dungeon Elites hitting for less than 5% of tank's health pool "seem" awfully wrong.
---
Yea the month of sub you get in the box would come in handy.
---
I dont get why people get so angry at this post. The values could be off, and anyone responding that they are not have no fucking clue what they are talking about.   
---
Just because blizzard says "Private servers are off, we have all the info and we do everything exactly as its supposed to be" doesnt mean its true. Just saying that values on a "Global wow scale" are all saved is an easy way to dismiss people that shit on the game for being numerically wrong. I remember a few years ago when the excuse for not making classic servers was the fact that all the data was gone and they had no way to get it back.
---
Yeah I dont know who this tips guy is, but I highly doubt hes "ma boi"
---
Aside from the platform changes, one of the biggest things this build did was to nuke class quests from the standard route. They're too low value and entirely subjective whether you want to complete them immediately or not (think succubus questline for warlocks). As a compromise I've tried to visit a capital city every 10 levels so it's somewhat convenient for those who want to do class quests immediately. If you pay attention, both factions routes line up very well for warrior quests specifically *for some reason*..
---
It was suggested that I could make a subsection for class quests alone, but it might not be worth the effort if most of them are simple 3-4 parters with instructions like "go here". Databases already present these decently well and you can weave them in yourself by checking what zones the guide is visiting next.
---
i litterally just said to someone on here "we going home" lol
---
Accurate post +1
---
Ah, I see.
---
Funny how the tables turned from pservers being undertuned to it seeming like the opposite now. Just watching the dungeon streams it looked like mobs from Deadmines and WC were generally not as deadly as I recall it being in retail/how it is on pservers (excluding Verdant the Everliving). Hopefully you're right and some more digging shows more discrepancies and this possibly being a bug, otherwise the game truly was a lot easier than pservers emulated.
---
My man I actually played vanilla...
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to classic because world PVP will actually be fun to do outside of raids.
---
Maan hearthstone is so dead
---
^^^^^^(MtG:A is lit AF thooo)
---
Actually, not at all. You can‚Äôt fix a problem until it is identified.
---
Armor values at such a low level can in fact make a noticeable difference. As long as you can‚Äôt verify the amount of armor in both instances, you can‚Äôt really compare. 
---
There‚Äôs also a chance of the mobs being tuned sometime during the patch cycle. 
---
What we do know for a fact is that starting areas are severely undertuned in the beta compared to private sever standard. This came as a shock to many who believed it would be the opposite. This might be a clue that starting areas and mobs are weaker for some reason in the beta than they should be.
---
After the starting zones, the biggest difference is drop rates of quest items, which is much lower in the beta, this is in turn believed to be correct. Most other values are almost identical compared to the popular private server builds.
---
The Nut
---
AFAIK, there are no paladin trainers on Teldrassil, or in Darkshore/Ashenvale. I may be a bit biased here but as someone who also played a Nelf (Hunter ((I was 9, stereotypical huntard all the way))) and doing the wetlands run to get to Stormwind as a level 12 was one of the more memorable experiences, and you‚Äôll be doing that backwards so I consider that a plus. You‚Äôll definitely be inconveniencing yourself but if you want to do it, I recommend going for it. It may be a pain but if you enjoy it it‚Äôs worthwhile.
---
Jesus man. Its a video game not a hearing on genocide. Essentially all he said was that he noticed getting stronger by getting a stronger piece of gear. Chill out and go outside.
---
Is she wearing the exact same armor as before as well?
---
Thank you, I was having trouble finding that. Appreciate it.
---
That's not how it works. 
---
You don't say "this is wrong" &amp; when someone questions it, suddenly they're the ones that have to prove it.
---
In fact, that's the exact opposite of how it works.
---
If I can remember correctly there are only paladin trainers in SW and IF and the surrounding areas.
---
I‚Äôve read that escape artist is a great pick for pvp, is the stealth detection better suited?
---
&gt; How dense are you? Blizzard have ALREADY CONFIRMED that the mob respawn rates are not a bug. You're linking the wrong blue post.
---
Well fuck me for linking the wrong post that was put up a day ago that none-the-less talks about the exact same topic lol. 
---
Point still stands. The respawn rates for certain mobs are way to slow and should prrrrrrrobably be addressed. 
---
&gt; Remember, this is what you wanted!
---
I never said that. There are things in the game that can be improved upon or added to make it more streamlined if required. Making mobs spawn a little bit faster in certain areas isn't a stretch or "gamebreaking". Hell, most people probably wouldn't notice the difference. 
---
They've already done that with the graphics options as one example.
---
It's kind of poetic, really.
---
It had to do with spell batching on a sit-stand or sit-move, not a sit. 
---
A sit cnanot trigger a proc but can trigger a crit.
---
If you moved or stood up as soon as that crit hit you (via a sit-stand-sit-stand macro), the game would detect the crit, but also detect the standing state amd reward you the procs as they were in the same batch.
---
How are Tauren druid forms affected by this?
---
Duel on the campfire to the left of the scholo entrance, the loser will take fire dmg and die. You ghost walk through the door, rez, open door for party.
---
There is more to WOTLK than the easy Naxx and the big mistake in 3.3 called LFG. There is Ulduar mate. That is all the expansion needs. Just that.
---
I'd help Petiteheals
---
It's really hard to tell because the video is very blurry, but I'm pretty sure the first video is a level 8 player as well.  He has concussive shot trained in his spellbook and a few moments later hits level 9.
---
3 months to go, with increasing number of people bring this up, I'm almost certain Blizzard will be forced to make *some kind* of statement.
---
Awesome video
---
I‚Äôd like to see stuff like this reinserted, with Easter eggs to the original devs or something. Put a monument to them out there, Kinda like the smiley face under kara.
---
This thread has already devolved into mindless hate, honestly this community makes me ashamed to even be a part of it. Grow up.
---
ITT a lot of salty streamer fanboys.
---
Female undead are way cooler imo. Their critical strike they do a fucking front flip. Beating up bosses and players you style on them extra hard.
---
Well I mean it's been reported as a bug so presumably it will go away in the next patch or two the beta sees. I don't know if there's anything to discuss here.
---
Wow he's doing content he's overleveled for and finding it easy.  Shocker.
---
/r/livestreamfail
---
Do it with a human warrior
---
So exactly how hard was Classic to make? Did they have to back engineering? I‚Äôm not technically sound so if someone could compare its hardness to something else.
---
Well, seems like you've thought about it and decided against it, that's good enough for me.
---
Thanks for all the effort you are/have been putting into this, the project looks amazing as is.
---
Starter dungeons are not difficult.
---
Yeah, my friends and I are definitely avoiding any streamer realm. Nothing good comes from them.
---
He was focused on racing Asmongold the same way they had been all day. They're getting themselves in bad habits.
---
More Asmongold please
---
Why you gotta argue the facts of this though? Can't you just appreciate the humor of this?
---
Jesus Christ stop riding these streamers jocks for just a second and realize you don't have to post everything they do.
---
That should probably be addressed. There's no logical reason to keep it that way other than, "but that's how it was." 
---
Otherwise there's absolutely no reason to do that particular quest (Riverpaw Gnoll Bounty). You're better off just killing Hogger, and then grinding somewhere or just skipping it entirely.
---
Fear ward &gt; your racial
---
People are so self centered lol
---
And yea having a paladin/priest combo spam cleanse on all your cc is gonna be a lot more annoying than not having your racial.
---
Trust me unless you're going to just spam curses I will shit all over you as an hpala in a BG. Just insta cleansing everything you do.
---
Shamans on the other hand will find it much more difficult to deal with you from a support perspective. And that leaves all the cleansing to the priest who are also the primary healers. 
---
Gnome lock is bis. Lock is much weaker on horde due to how easy it is for paladin to cleanse. 
---
Orc &gt; UD. 25% stun resist is vastly better (easily the most broken racial in the game from pvp perspective). Everyone has stuns (grenades) and many class kits have them. Fear is rarer and has more counters. (resto pot, reflectors, magic resist, cleanse)
---
&gt; Why would I watch someone play a video game I want to play when I could just play it?
---
For entertainment? You could apply this logic to any sort of game on TV. Why watch a baseball or basketball game when you can go outside and do it yourself? It's not like most of us don't need the exercise anyway. Yet millions of people plop down in front of the TV to watch adult men who make millions of dollars throw around pieces of leather for 10 hours every Sunday from September to February. 
---
The appeal is part entertainment and part community involvment. Good streamers can be very entertaining and downright hilarious at times. I've laughed harder at Twitch than most TV shows I have watched in a long time. Communities have their own inside jokes and memes. It's not like watching a "Let's Play" on Youtube with no commentary.
---
Maybe someone with beta access can watch the entire speed run and see exactly what items he gets, and try to replicate it.  But I'm not sure it would make that big of a difference.
---
Sure, but some of the private server meta will bleed into Classic, which means you likely see a lot more of world buff gathering (DM:T specifically) and like 8 fury warriors in a raid, so getting a spot in a raid as DPS might turn out to be easier this time around.
---
Before hitting deadmines he used some stamina buff items, so maybe that's why the margin seemed low. idk if that's normal prep before an instance, in addition to other available buffs. I'm not the most knowledgeable player but I've got a little bit of experience playing vanilla.
---
Nobody made their own servers solo. That is a fantasy. The world of warcraft emulation is the result of hundreds of developers working for over 10 years on opensource emulators.
---
I recovered my account from blizzard, had no idea what server my day 1 alt was on, this was the reply. Whoa!
---
Not to THAT extent, but the destruction of wPvP was still there, and you will still mount up inbetween pulls on high traffic areas which also reduces the timewindow you have to gank someone.
---
The good thing about vanilla BGs is that you can still join the other queue in case your game is filled with an enemy premade. Sure, if you premade yourself it's still a steamroll but games between random players are still a thing.
---
Arenas are cool and I enjoyed them myself but I didn't like that the best gear was gated behind rating, that is, your arena rating. This invalidated the incentive to run BGs.  
---
Well I guess BGs vs Arena are a gray area. If you get the gear over BGs like in Vanilla, you'll get the premades running BGs and ruining a fraction of the games. (Depends on how good the premade really is though)  
---
Acquire all the gear over Arena and rating, you're splitting the PvP community and BGs will be much less populated and also less competetive. 
---
I always enjoyed the random aspect of BGs and wPvP more than the more regulated Arenas. Especially nowadays Arena feels more broken down and usually follows the tactic of forcing Cooldowns, ccing one member of the enemy team and nuking the target. It get's dull because it's missing the volatile aspect of the BGs, as well as being smaller in size so there's less going on.  
---
 They're still fun but I wouldn't want them in Vanilla, and if we get BC, yeah having Arena is a cool thing but then I'd have to deal with having less wPvP and all the things mentioned earlier. 
---
Some zones in BC were okay, but still I think the only real BIG thing where BC is way ahead of Vanilla is gameplay. That being said, PvP in Vanilla still has quite the dynamic to it due to Alchemy and Engineering.
---
Haters gonna say it's shopped.
---
If you hadn't been actively subscribed, for a while, my guess is you lost your place in line.  Even if you played during vanilla, I imagine they are going to be more interested in rewarding those that had continued to give them money over those that stopped giving them money
---
I miss old school realm forums. Just going on there and trash talking the other faction, getting the bants back two-fold, going back online and search and destroying my enemies. Ah the good old days, like rolling Alliance priest and going with my two rogue buddies to cowtown to MC people off the cliffs. Or getting on my Horde rogue, going to Ironforge and trapbombing the AH to break low level flagged players.
---
Blizzard got me last night with Season 17 for D3
---
No lie in middle school I had a kid in my class whose parents made him grind WoW for them. He also always smelled of cigarettes and looking back might‚Äôve had Fetal Alcohol syndrome. Was actually a really sad situation.
---
Asmonjoke...
---
This isn't about difficulty but damage values being wonky, not even the most fanatical vanilla purist would pretend any pre-40 dungeons to be difficult.
---
Ah you are correct there on the Conc shot, crazy how the blur makes the 8 look more like a 5 haha.
---
Old school Runescape
---
Shut up
---
No.
---
Gnome is the better pick for PvP.
---
I think it's blizzard realizing there's a market for something and providing it, nothing more, nothing less.
---
Not to even mention over geared for as well.
---
Ok, I have a theory, I think maybe Blizzard might've normalised the damage in a later patch and since the tiger has a really fast attack speed, it does lower damage.
---
dude you're obnoxious
---
You forgot "why is X streamer in the beta and not Y, X is really dumb and has negative IQ, literally worse than Stalin!".
---
I haven't played private servers, but I did play vanilla. So while my memory might be a bit hazy, it's also not being clouded by private server experiences. To me, it looks like the mobs aren't particularly dangerous. The regular quest mobs seem fine and match up with what I remember, but I don't remember people being able to pull 6 elites in SFK (while also not using defensive abilities like shield block) and not really break a sweat. You could argue that players are better now, but 6 mobs? Especially the ones that silence in SFK? I remember wiping on that room if you pulled more than 3 at a time.
---
You da real MVP
---
Horde #1
---
Yes, 1.9 I believe.
---
First of all babies were not kill. Thrall was literally raised by it. Second of all they were gladiator. They dont die. Blackmoore need them to live. That about it. Again it is ok for orc to commit genocide as long they find their home but alliance cant exact retribution after they wreck stormwind and literally commit genocide?.
---
This is the most plausible explanation I've seen thus far.
---
You don't have to be overleveled to find vanilla 5-mans easy though. There are almost no mechanics you have to be aware of. The hardest part is finding 5 people and getting to the dungeon. I love vanilla but why do people find it necessary to overstate how difficult things are?
---
There must be equivalent useful items out there that horde can't get
---
Thats just not true. At least not for everyone calling them out.
---
For example, my only YouTube sub was a 1-month sub to Esfand when he had like 200 viewers.
---
Just because I dont dickride streamers and call out bullshit where I see it doesnt mean I have ‚Äùhate hard-on‚Äù towards streamers.
---
People are going to be surprised when they realize that playing the same game 15 years later with a PC that doesn't run like a potato, does indeed make the game easier
---
Real original with the name there guy ü§£
---
~25% of the people who played vanilla are dead so this is very true.
---
Look at dem mules
---
Beyond my 100 days or more played in Vanilla? Nope. 
---
But it‚Äôs pretty common knowledge. No trinket swaps in combat, and shared trinket cds came about when talisman and zhc were both in the game, at that point mages would pop both, with Pom pyro and delete people. They would then swap today a reflector and PvP trinket, and swap those out when on cd. All while in combat. 
---
It was even possible for a bit of the bg era. 
---
You‚Äôd have to look at patch notes or early PvP videos.
---
Here we have it, the screech of a cornered and sad man. He lashes out in protest, knowing he is caught.
---
You need to realise that he isn't doing this video for you or anyone on this sub but for the people that follow him on youtube. 
---
Someone posted it on this sub because he thought it was a good video. 
---
You and others posting "lol who? i dont give a shit why should i care" makes you look stupid.
---
I'm not overstating the difficulty.  I made no comment on how difficult BFD is.  
---
He's saying it's easy.  Some of the mobs at the start of the dungeon are *grey* to him.  It's not representative of a typical group, is the point.
---
It is a massive adaptation effort, in the simplest software engineering terms. They either need to directly convert old concepts into new concepts or design an adaptation layer between old and new that marries the two together.
---
I've been saying this since 2014/2015 when I first played on a classic server during WoD.
---
And I used Silverpine Forest as my example, just the way the zone is designed gives you multiple opportunities to reach out to other players to group up and quest, Fenris Isle, the Dalaran Mage area, the area just below SFK and then getting quests to run SFK itself later on.
---
I made friends in that zone, who eventually made it out to  the Barrens and guess what, I was still questing and running in to those same players and grouping up for elite quests there and to run Wailing Caverns.
---
Classic WoW was designed with the purpose of bringing players together.
---
If you design a game where grouping up is a simple as pushing a button, then there is no need to design the game to push players to engage with each other.
---
Don't forget also opening the servers early (requiring a subscription) to "save" a name before launch. Another way to try to milk cash from players not interested in retail.
---
I've said MUCH worse on live in the last 12 years and have never received so much as a warning
---

I think black pill is for mgtow/incel. Red pill is a strategy towards females not incel but red pill can be. a politics thing also.

Some damage numbers I found real quick, bearing in mind most of them are crits though.
---
Esfand is such a genuine guy, he needs to distance himself from Asmon now that his channels growing organically.
---
You need to realise that he isn't doing this video for you or anyone on this sub but for the people that follow him on youtube.
---
Someone posted it on this sub because he thought it was a good video.
---
Oh. lol. I don't even really know what that incel thing is. (don't think it exists my country as a thing) I'll google it and maybe stop using.
---
He did and it works on npcs too. There are other clips of that too.
---
Nobody cares.
---
Streamer bullying is an epidemic.
---
We must donate 500 bits to any streamer of our choice to help combat this behavior.
---
*My, you're a tall one!*
---
It wont explain it. Damage reduction from armor is capped at 75%.
---
If the damage in Vanilla was 5, and the Beta damage is 1, then the difference is too large to be explained by 25 armor.
---

---
It 2-3 damage difference but at this level it could make a huge difference
---
Yes. It has always been. Really sad to see actually. Ever since Classic announced people have done nothing but bitch that Blizzard will fuck it up. Which is really sad. Blizzard have really shown dedication to make classic authentic and have shown that they are willing to listen to the playerbase, but that apparently isn't enough for this community.
---
(side note: I'm not talking about giving feedback and pointing out when things don't work, like when people played the demo and listed all the inconsistencies. That's constructive. A lot of the "discussion" that happens here is not constructive at all.)
---
armor is % based. He's the same lvl here. 1 armor or even 20 wouldn't make 50% difference.
---
More often than not, greed is essential to good business practice. Yay capitalism.
---
No beta club here. But that's because I'll be damned if I resub just to get a beta invite. 
---
Not ever gonna be salty about that though.
---
Maybe a lot of people don't realize you need to be subbed for a chance at beta invite.
---
I‚Äôm not talking from the start, but after bwl++
---
Lol I posted about guilds for momas and papas, I have my own square! I feel special &lt;3
---
I don't disagree with that, but perhaps for other reasons.  People have been super hard on each other lately.
---
Good post. Don't let the toxicity of /r/wowservers be the face of classic
---
The fact that people are genuinely so happy that the game is busted is so sad, to me. It‚Äôs bizarre that people think broken balancing and awful bugs are what ‚Äúmade‚Äù classic. Rather than the actual, intended systems which people fell in love with. 
---
What can you do, though. Nostalgia is nostalgia. Not allowed to play a large portion of specs because...uhh...it wouldn‚Äôt be nostalgic to actually make the game more diverse and fun for people. 
---
I hope people realize how petty they‚Äôre being, and why Classic will suffer from the same thing Old School Runescape did before it was actively fixed by the devs.
---

To name a few. This isn't something new.
---
The lower level you are, the easier it is for you to outlevel content for no good reason. On the alliance you can shoot up in levels really quickly by going from elwynn straight to westfall, and from westfall to redridge, and redridge to duskwood but that's about where you screw yourself and a giant portion of the playerbase quits. If you systematically clear appropariate content, you'll never run out of quests and will be dealing almost exclusively with green monsters which is something all classes and specs can do.

I think if they‚Äôd built a brand new engine and built a new Warcraft based on the best aspects of Vanilla and TBC they‚Äôd have a winner of a game.
---
This is blatant pandering. Also, he is wrong several times throughout the video. As a mage, he says he is dead if he pulls 3 mobs. If that is true, he must be trying to melee them down. He claims he can feel his spells hitting harder now that he has shoulders with 6 int on them. That would mean he can really feel the teeny tiny crit bonus from the int.  
---
I'm glad he's enjoying the game, but he is just regurgitating what has been said in other videos.
---
Only thing worse than complainers is complaining of complainers.

PvE because I can't be bothered to walk back to my corpse for 15 min just to die again and repeat.
---
I don't got time for that bullshit, if I want pvp I Q for BG, I loved AV.
---
Considering armor is capped at 75% damage reduction then no, it would not explain it.
---
Fair enough
---
Yeah, I think that's possible. But I really hope you're wrong. :)
---
At which point many guilds will still be doing MC for bindings, but of course, if your guild doesn't, yea this is the way to go about it.
---
My mistake then it seems. :)
---
It's already confirmed that you can get a beta invite without having an active subscription, just make sure to check your email if you're a really old player since that seem to be doing it.
---
Their entire living is based on handouts.
---
You're sort of right. It is common for max lvls to roam around and gank but they never typically camp you. If they do happen to camp you there's ALWAYS something to do. It use to give me am excuse to go fishing or explore another zone that I may have blown through. If you haven't experienced a PVP server before you will not regret it friend. It is a blast as frustrating as it may be at times. The close encounters you have with the opposing factions at low levels are some of the most memorable times I had. Either way im sure you'll have a great time but thats just my two cents! Gl man have fun!
---
They definitely could, but (i dont have the numbers, its just my guess) i think most people that play BFA today play it because they really like the instant gratification (no hate, if you like that type of game, enjoy it). So changing that back to being more grindy for way less rewards will most likely lose you a LOT of current players, and its not certain you will get the people that like the more hardcore games to come back.  
---
Not saying i wouldnt like BFA to be more like Vanill/BC/WLK, but i get why Blizz wont go down that path.
---
This is probably closest to correct
---
Why? Blizzard gets money, we get a good game win/win.
---
No, you can't play it.
---
No problem, thanks for showing interest!

Look at 16

Pretty terrible adivce for someone wanting to play a paladin.

Because I like to hope that the peoiple at the helm care about more than just money. :)
---
Most streamers are uninteresting, millennial danguses. ITT, a literal teenager is lecturing adults because they reminded him of stupid it is to sit around watching other people play video games for hours on end.

Ah yes the age old argument complaining about complainers complaining about complainers.
---
You are an intellectual, and clearly far above this petty squabble.
---
The fact his fans think I‚Äôm ‚Äújelly‚Äù is mind boggling. Everything about that dude is repulsive. And now that the subreddit has doubled in size in a few months, it‚Äôs being taken over by streamer content and their cultish fans. Think it‚Äôs about time to unsub
---
It would be good if beta testers also had access to that original 1.12 client that Blizzard use for reference. Quality of bug reporting would increase drastically.
---
I'm with you, that's why i started this thread on the wow forums wanting streaming free servers.  [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/streamer-free-servers/176476](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/streamer-free-servers/176476)
---
I can't believe the number of people over there shilling for the streamers who think it's horrible there might be servers they can't play on.
---
Dropped ur pants
---
Jesus Christ the toxicity surrounding this is stupidly high
---
The Private server meta is just that. Blizzard has already stated that World buffs will be on a set cooldown. THat being said, maybe you're right. The meta might bleed over and maybe we will have 8+ warriors in a raid, honestly I'm not sure.
---
If you‚Äôre that much of a delicate flower then you shouldn‚Äôt be on the Internet. This thread isn‚Äôt that bad, relax.
---
Even if this is a joke, it made me really angry lol.
---
Fair enough!
---
Nice the 1000th post like this. Here is to 1000 more my friends!
---
Someone should make a color-coded chart. ü§®
---
I think the low level adjustments came before that.
---
You don't appeal to anybody because you have no idea what you're talking about
---
Aight
---
I care.... no. You're right. I don't. ;P
---
Not in classic, but I had [this one](https://imgur.com/l1no4Jl) happen to a friend once.
---
I thought you were *"simply wondering if this seems too easy for you regardless of "how it was"."* Now it's suddenly about the damage values being bugged?
---
They straight ported the actual 1.12 database. At this point I have no doubt mob damage is PRECISELY what it should be, and the same goes for all basic mob stats like armor and health. If there are bugs related to this to be found somewhere, it will be in mitigation formulae (unlikely) or mob spell behaviour/damage (equally unlikely since the overwhelming majority of spells are non-scripted and purely database-based).
---
Given the way they have (or claim to have) technically done this, the chance of anything database-related such as mob damage being bugged really is just zilch. If dungeon elites in the beta hit like wet noodles, then that's simply how it was in the actual 1.12 game.
---
As for your actual question in the OP, ignoring the fact that I think it's best to have everything exactly as it was, I don't think it's a problem even if it's too easy. The leveling dungeons really never were all that hard. They had some tricky parts, but mostly they were, as people call it, tank and spank when it comes to the mechanics.
---
No moonwalking hit me right in the soul :'(   
---
I love that shit! They need to artificially bring it back somehow. Ill make sure of it!!
---
Yeah, that's why I specified DM:T since we can expect the head buffs to be on a pretty long CD (thank god).
---
But yeah, it's going to be interesting to see the theorycrafting done with the real numbers.
---
&gt; This is further evidenced by Joana being in Aspect of the Monkey, which adds a large amount of dodge. In the wow combat system, Dodge will push off regular White Hits. I can get a picture for you that shows +1 mob level is around 25% glancing blow chance. However, if you are dodging 14% of all attacks, parrying 5%, and the mob is missing 5%, then really 1/3 attacks will glance.
---
Mobs don't (shouldn't) glance.
---
That's a nice theory you have there, buddy. Do you have a single fact to back it up?
---
nochanges
---
Poor streamers, they make money sitting on their butt playing WoW, they have such a difficult life.
---
The reason for the hatred is that streamers think they're better than anyone else. And that complaint is legit. Even Esfand oversteps sometimes and puts his own needs before that of the people he's playing with. Asmongold is blatant about it, he doesn't give a fuck about anything or anyone and will take whatever he wants.
---
It‚Äôs not like they only uave streamers in the beta. Streamers are for publicity. When asmond does Deadmines with 100k viewers, that‚Äôs absolutely great publicity and it‚Äôs completely free for Blizzard. It just makes sense to include these streamers, no matter what their stance about Classic has been before or how good they are in the game.
---
Yah! When we were all 13!
---
"Instead of whining about it on Twitter, I'm going to just go get good." Honestly I like this guy already.
---
Dude it's hilarious... the day they announced layering, like every weeb here was sperging so prematurely about how layering ruins the game. Now like 3 days later, a comment about layering gets 300 downvotes. Amazing
---
And this is why you invite these people to the beta
---
You got to wait 3 minths
---
I bought my first epic mount with the money I got from TBC quests lmao.
---
Your MT is never "iffy", it's such a coveted role that it's taken by the guild leader/guild leaders friends.
---
Damn! He is being a smartass but I'm not sure it's directed at you. My initial reaction was he was saying that it's kind weird how, from a design perspective, they can throw all these directions at a player and it ends up resulting in a lack of direction. Just commenting on how it's funny how that works out with humans since we're not robots and all. Or maybe he was calling you a dumbass, or both, I don't know.
---
It would be nice if beta testers also had access to that original 1.12 client that Blizzard use for reference. Quality of bug reporting would increase drastically.
---
Johanna?
---
I created a priest on a private server and forgot how little there was to do and press. Not even mentioning I couldn't get into groups as shadow unless they were guild groups. Even Disc wasn't really wanted, outside of one or two to give power infusion to other classes. 
---
Priest leveling is: mind blast, SW: Pain, mind flay, mind flay, wand until dead. I got to 60 spending over half of my leveling experience AFK while I wand auto attacked. 
---
I am going to play classic for the nostalgia, to see old Duskwood and STV and do some world PVP as a resto druid that just can't die, just to annoy people. But, that's it. 
---
I mostly hope we can get the talent trees and options back. A massive set of three trees that we can pick and choose from.
---
Streamers are all derivative and will be chasing whatever game gets them views. 
---
This game did just fine without them back in ‚Äò04.
---
6/5
---
Can a mob 2 levels higher than you even deal crushing blows? I thought it was only mobs that are 3 levels higher than you.
---
If it's a crushing blow I think the tiger would deal baseline of 4 damage, crushing blow being 6 damage and the 5,5,6,6 being a result of rounding.
---
Both clips seem to use the same kind of armor by the looks of it, so the only difference can be glancing blows, armor acquired by Motw and gained by agility bonus because of a higher lvl.
---
I think it's a combination of glancing blows and rounding issues due to armor and that we're dealing with very small numbers overall.  
---
Going from 5 to 4 is actually a huge deal when it comes to the percentages, but if we got to mobs that deal 2 digits worth of damage I'm sure we could see that the values are actually correct, seeing how most people say that only the starting area mobs appear to be weaker.
---
agreed
---
Inb4 someone was a lead designer for original vanilla and didn‚Äôt get in the Beta.
---
I don't know what this is but I'm frightened

[Read this.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/444185019003568139/579021097266315265/unknown.png)
---
Thats the dumbest thing i've ever heard
---
Aside from just this video, simply watching any stream will show you that the mobs seem much easier. 
---
I just leveled to 10 on a Vanilla PS and 2 mobs almost always meant death or a close call.
---
I donno what server I'll be on but if you need help, Scarhoof the tauren warrior will answer your call!
---
Thanks catdany
---
Og wow players participated in the mess that Retail is now. What is this lie you tell yourself that some 12 year olds ruined wow. When most of the changes were slowly added in over the last decade most of us loved it. Now it's too much and the game sucks. Dont pretend vanilla players just stood by and watched helplessly lol.
---
His personality is ok but he has too many "whoops I wasn't paying attention" moments that cause the rest of the group to stand around waiting for him 4 zones away.
---
This thread isn't about streamers, lol. It was only one part of it. But ok, you're allowed to think that.
---
Thank you for fighting the fight. I'm not subbed at the moment so sadly I can't give my support in the classic forums. But keep in mind you have a lot of people on your side.
---
[Sure?](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/444185019003568139/579021097266315265/unknown.png) Read the second bullet point.
---
I guess Blizzard will adress this next week, they will either fix this or tell us that everything works just fine.
---
NICE! I thought I was an altoholic, being on seven different realms.
---
You know you aren't "passed over" right? An algorithm chooses. The algorithm doesn't know how upset you'll be to get passed up. And 1) there are limited spots and 2) they don't want JUST old school players. You've gotten unlucky. So have A LOT of people exactly like you. Hang in there, you'll get your invite as they ramp up. And if not, August is SOON.
---
As for steamers, that's the marketing department. And they marketing department cannot hit their KPIs by inviting you...
---
I can't hear you over the sound of my Orc punting gnomes off a cliff.
---
You have more faith in Blizzard to not cave in the whining that I do then.
---
You're right about SFK.
---
Nothing to do with defending streamers. Didn't understand the unrational dislike and hate, but ok.
---
At the end of the day its about business, streamers give them good marketing.
---
Eh, quality will only be as good as much as people care for it, which is not very many. Especially since vast majority of people would not know what is a bug or feature.
---
Bro, WoW had 1.5 *million* players in its first quarterly report. You're not that special for being a Vanilla beta tester. Who's to say they haven't been *heavily* selecting for extremely old players who were around at release or even beta, and you simply aren't one of them because it's still a one in a million statistic?
---
Get over yourself.
---
As a QA tester myself this is some good template
---
Cool, thanks. 
---
Not really the point though. And on the topic, kind of silly.
---
This pretty much confirms that Tauren are definitely worse for Hunters. The most crucial mechanics for Hunters come at how you deal with close range, not with long range
---
I think he knows what he‚Äôs doing as is trying to be funny.  Which is, arguably, worse.
---
Yeah, I don't get it.  I'm happy for those people who were able to follow their passion for gaming and make a career out of it.  Truly, good for them!
---
They took on certain risks in choosing that career path, so enjoying the perks that come along with it (like beta access) are fair game IMO.  Hating on them reeks of envy, in my eyes.
---
I suspect that the values are accurate, because they imported the code for damage calculations from the original version, and the data values from the old database were imported exactly. Math is math, there are other factors at play that are going to explain the discrepancy from a video and current gameplay.
---
They've already said in a blue post of commonly reported bugs that the values are correct.
---
Dont make me send you to the retirement home old man
---
I‚Äôd argue they didn‚Äôt really get *famous* till cats but I won‚Äôt dispute the work they did back then. TB mainly gained his audience from his work shoutcasting SC however iirc
---
I think there were some /run commands that did not change your target.
---
That's fair, but are you able to suggest what any of those other factors might be that lead to the discrepancy?
---
You forgot "I reactivated my old account"
---
You actually should have gotten in. You should soon if you have an active sub on that account
---
Regardless either the horde or alliance would have more shaman or pally over the other classes in that case since there would be an influx in population on either side. It was just if ideally if classes were split evenly down the middle. Chillax a bit and don‚Äôt be over analytical over something that isn‚Äôt going to be directly divided in half.
---
"omg I work and can only play 3 hours a week"
---
The thing that annoys me about this sentiment is that it's not like they can't complete the game. It just takes a bit longer. That's still 144 hours out of the year.
---
Sure they can't hit 60 in a month. But they can enjoy it in there own way. 3 hours a week is a decent amount of time. lol
---
Joana clips should be the only clips allowed on this sub.
---
I‚Äôm really out of the loop with all this streaming lark but sick of these lot already!
---
The release date is bad. That's just a fact. It is really far off, and it burned the community cause it was hyped to be earlier in the summer. Then watch any of the main streamers and listen to them gloat, and be shitty about being better than everyone. That's why.
---
Played 15 years ago, WOW COOL. Now show us your subs/playtime from the past 5 years.
---
SC helped, surely, but BluePlz and WoWRadio were way bigger (for the time) then people give them credit for.  This was an era before YouTube and Twitch and they were still household names in a large portion of the community.
---
Kinda busy atm. I'll open the door for 50g, 10ea from your party. I can be there in 10 min.
---
Yeah, except in the dog's case it's a developed survival mechanism and actually justifiable.  This is a video game, and the rage comes across as petulant.
---
New guild name idea: OG Fan Club
---
You don't have to be subbed to post on the classic forums, I'm not subbed atm either.
---
It's all about marketing. And you still have a chance to get invited. Not all beta invites has gone out yet (Not if they intend to stress test anyways)
---
Auction House.
---
Lol I hope it's a joke.  If not blizzard has the wrong people in the beta.  As I understand it you need an active sub to get in beta, I think maybe those with an active sub should be excluded unless the account was crated prior to TBC
---
He most likely meant 4 actual elites. Not packs.
---
That shirt though, lol, when times get rough!
---
Why especially a Druid or shaman? Planning on playing shaman so I‚Äôm curious what u mean by this
---
Well, currently the beta flagging has been heavily favored for very early accounts and almost only US players so if you fit both of those categories you have better than average chance of getting in.  
---
There's at least 2 waves per day going out based on past post by people who have gotten in, I wouldn't be surprised if it was 3 waves per day at about 8 hour intervals, maybe give or take some.  
---
I've pretty much given up on the beta unless they suddenly decide to start pushing out EU heavy waves.
---
Just like the Alliance to avoid a fight. ;)
---
Am I the only one who despises gnomes? 
---
I also happen to have most of my characters undead for full disclosure.
---
Man, if only this were true. You'd be my best friend &lt;3
---
Yeah I'm sure. There are people that have confirmed on Twitter that they got in randomly, most likely because their accounts are super old and Blizzard said that those accounts + "influencers" would get priority at first.
---
Except for walljumping. The devs have already stated that their modern infrastructure takes precedent there, and therefore there won't be any vertical walljumping capability.
---
Oh, I thought you had to be. I'll comment right away then.
---
Great find.  Same level in both videos, clear damage difference.
---
Fucking annoying comment.
---
&gt;you had to use the in game functionality to achieve your objectives
---
Nah, I texted brian, doug, and AIM'd Cassie and Tanya. We then did 5 mans.
---
Do you remember people trying to get in as well back then? I forgot but were not they giving keys and there was a crazy black market of it.    
---
Do you remember thinking of the others who waited to get in but never got a key while you were playing.
---
Salt.
---
I'm confused. Would you rather him just not report anything or report things he thinks might be a bug so it gets checked and cleared? Do you know how these things work?
---
My point was that had it been anyone Reddit doesn't like, it would've been plastered all over the subreddit.
---
Priest, because warlock has shadow curses, and priest has shadow spells, so it's good combo.
---
Gearing in BFA is the worst. All the amazing items are in mythic raiding, or mythic dungeons. You can't craft your way out of a paperbag in that fucking expac. 
---
It blows my mind that in vanilla crafting is really useful through every level. And that amazing items drop from just normal dungeon runs with your pals. You really feel a huge boost running WC and getting your first blue item. Never had that experience in BFA.
---
I believe this was (but dont quote me on this) intended to work for players.   
---
(Like if you sit, and a PLAYER hits you in a duel/bg/ world pvp, it will 100% crit AND proc effects).  
---
But Blizzard has said (and i believe them) that sitting and getting crit by MOBS should not proc the effects, so if that is still going on it needs a fix.
---
They will be the people talking trash in general and trade chat non stop.
---
Eh it's more so people hating on others who play retail I'd say. Like I get it retail isn't in a good place, but people are going to be turned off when they see "go back to retail" and other toxic shit over and over again for asking a simple question.
---
WoW has always been full of elitists though so it doesn't surprise me. More often than not you're going to have to figure something out for yourself and if you have the audacity to ask you'll probably be flamed and you're always going to hear about how someone else has done something before you.
---
I personally started in Cata and have wanted to be able to play Classic since a few weeks after I started. After I found out there was an "old" Azeroth I have always longed to see it. Personally these fucks wont chase me off or make me not play but I can see how it will turn a lot of people off.
---
and people act like AIM and shit weren't a thing. Fuck, I got so many pings from AIM "Hey, are you on, we need a healer"
---
Yeah Ven is a part of the minority of genuine nice guy streamers. People are so quick to group all streamers into the same bucket. These are different people entirely with different attitudes and behavior. Ven is a solid dude.
---
The weird thing is that there's clearly room for way more testers even from the beginning. The world is fucking empty, there's like 100 people online or something. Don't know why Blizzard are being so stingy.

Hahaha thats so disgusting
---
It's concerning that any damage values could be wrong. Players shouldn't be responsible for making sure the game is authentic. It should be handled professionally with no room for error
---
the person responsible for making classic less authentic than private servers?
---
AFAIK dmg was normalized in patch 1.9 so the changes should already be there in the original video. In that case the videoes provided above supports the notion that the dmg numbers in classic are off.
---
I reckon something like: buffs spells, armor of the gear Joana's wearing, possible changes to damage via normalization in the patches between when the video was taken and 1.12.
---
Ya I thought they removed the friends list in WOD.
---
Mate  you can say all of that while being civil. Just because we are treating a game from 2004 that doesn't mean you need to talk like you did in 2004.
---
Classic WAS harder but it's because players were awful, a lot of people were going into mmos for the first time, you can emulate the game but you can't suddendly get rid of 15 years of playerbase knowdledge. In league of legends there were pro player in season 2 which seemed absolutely insane that the average player in gold can do easily now, games simply get easier over time.
---
Anything can be profitable
---
/r/wow isnt even about wow anymore. Last time I looked at it most of the upvoted content was half naked female night elves/blood elves and draeni.
---
can I rent one of your friends? mine doesn't play :(
---
They are prioritizing accounts like yours, almost all of the "normal" invites are going out to early vanilla accounts. If you're resubbed and opted-in you should have a good chance of getting in.
---
Longshlongsilver...what a name!
---
I don't think so
---
Looks like a bullet hell game, lol
---
Yass bring it.
---
Perplexity showed this on his stream on day 1 :)
---
Kungen isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player with such an ability and movement in WoW? Kungen puts the game on another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Method breaks records. Exorsus breaks records. Kungen breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.
---
Make sure to keep HD Graphics off
---
Like i said, it might be a pserver only thing as i can't remember 100% as its a long time ago, but this shows what i meant https://youtu.be/TsVMRZTn8jM?t=84
---
Well it looks like you haven't been playing attention to comment sentiment and culture on here recently.
---
I'll hold off on commenting on that.. Mess... further up in your post.
---
That's just complaining about complaining.  
---
On top of that, there is already a thread like this on the frontpage, and we get one of these metatalks about twice every week.
---
You seriously did have your stream bridage. Lol [https://clips.twitch.tv/EmpathicEncouragingEmuTTours](https://clips.twitch.tv/EmpathicEncouragingEmuTTours) 
---
Both of you did  [https://clips.twitch.tv/PeppyEmpathicMeatloafDendiFace](https://clips.twitch.tv/PeppyEmpathicMeatloafDendiFace) 
---
You guys are total  lyingscum.
---
Hopefully you reported it and didn't just complain on reddit.
---
The private servers have no actual data to work from an have been guessing at values for years.  Blizzard KNOWS those same values.  The servers they‚Äôre building aren‚Äôt wrong; your memory is...  because its falsified.
---
This is great, someone should compare this to the tips vod
---
Now that's just a mouthful.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say heavily. My account is flagged 11-23-04, played the beta and subbed and still no invite.
---
Yeah like others said, this might be spirit.  
---
As for the reason to buy food, it adds on top of your regular regen, so if he was at 1 hp he would need like 36 seconds to get to full, but with food it would be closer to 25 ish.  
---
Saving close to 10 seconds between every one to two mobs is quite a lot considering the amount of time you spend regenerating health.
---
As some of the streamers levellign warriors have said they find it much easier compared to pservers. So much for the reeeetailers being salty saying pserver people have been playing on easy mode all this time. smh.
---
I think you are taking streamer culture and twitch way too seriously. Yes alot of younger people get baited into this, but its not difference of someone fanning over a celeberity during any generation. It wasnt any different 50 years ago, celeberities now have more ways to monetize their fans directly.
---
I'm not much of a fan of watching twitch, but let people have their fun. Yes its mostly disingenuous personalties who are streaming, but what do you expect? Some holier-than-thou people who don't want to milk the audience? Lets get real and see that twitch streaming for the top streamers is very easy money and a very lucrative career for those who play games all day.
---
No need to go "those darn kids and their celeberties controlling them".
---
I think some of it is people who actually played vanilla are watching streamers who didn't play vanilla report things in vanilla as bugs...
---
Asking retailers to play classic just because they are wow players is like going to the dentist for foot pain just because they're a doctor.
---
Legacy fighter? Wow
---
The point is: that is how it as in Vanilla. It may be "wrong", but a lot of things were "wrong" in Vanilla. If someone's going to go testing shit on Beta, and they think something isn't correct, they should do a quick bit of cursory research prior to wasting the developers time reporting things that aren't a bug.
---
Dude stfu I‚Äôm sick of these posts criticizing the WoW classic community. Ffs the game hasn‚Äôt even come out yet. Did it ever occur to you and all the other losers making posts like this they y‚Äôall are part of the problem?
---
There is a reason why some Vanilla Private Servers do thrive if they retain Blizzlike Status. Its because its a fucking good game.
---
 Layering bug, it should only happen on logout/logoff or party invite from another layer
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/InventiveSlipperyBaguetteKAPOW](https://clips.twitch.tv/InventiveSlipperyBaguetteKAPOW)
---
I find the same, I enjoy watching Esfand's stream more just because he's such a positive guy.
---
no, because you're wasting the developers' time if you're wrong
---
Weird, I remember getting my mount super easy at 40 on my hunter. I kinda cheesed it though. There was a chest that spawned early in SM GY that I could cheese my way to. Dropped lvl 26-29 blues occasionally, and I made a good amount of gold that way.
---
I don't remember tbh. I know my friends and I applied ASAP we had heard about it very early as news spread among the EQ community. We had got in early and didn't consider it a big deal back then (we were settled in EQ, weren't sure if we were leaving at the time, ofc we did...)
---
Yep. Unfortunately this community has kind of always been that. Wish this subreddit would be more like OSRS, just posting memes and being silly, not pissed off all the time.
---
God forbid a meta discussion can exist. But no, lets label it as more complaining, that will do the trick. If there wasn't a demand for this discussion, it wouldn't be commented on. If a thread is to die, it will die.
---
By 1.12 pretty much every mob was chained to their spawning zone. Kazzak got chained to Blasted Lands many patches before the one we‚Äôll be playing, so no, I highly doubt it.
---
&gt;What made it hard was that it was a first of its kind game with people playing on 5 fps.
---
Yes.. the fps made the game hard. KKKKKKKKKKKKKK
---
I'm amazed that nobody has tried this. New MMOs are always trying to clone the version of WoW that was available then and that's why they failed. 
---
Blizzard won't make a new MMO as long as WoW is still alive, but by releasing Classic they are essentially tapping into this huge market without making a direct competitor. Pretty smart move and I honestly believe Ion Hazzikostas when he said they've always wanted to do it, but just didn't know how.
---
I mean look around this reddit, 90% of the people who claim they got in were 04-05 players.
---
BUT... if I'm like 50 meters from Hogger
---
and someone says "LF1M Hogger, he should spawn any minute"
---
I shouldn't have to run 5 minutes to an inn, opt into another layer, then run back, while those potential friends are sitting around NOT killing hogger.
---
I don't think "layer hopping" will be a thing - based on my experience with load balancing tech and what the devs have mentioned. It just won't be an issue.
---
50 meters is 54.68 yards
---
Legend.
---
any private server if you pull 6 you're dead.
---
Not all heroes wear capes. Thank you Omar
---
They were so embarrassed for riding his jock that they deleted their account!
---
Kazzak was chained to Blasted Lands long before 1.12.
---
Today i spent my day cleaning up files on the computer, updating and removing dust on my accountpage, downloading the retail client and making builds on a classic talent calculator.

Literally 2 min after this clip he complained because it was hard keeping aggro on a couple mobs then continued to say how easy vanilla wow is. Literally zero self awareness.
---
At the end he tries to summarize and justify his feeling a bit, at about 11:20 -
---
I just love it, alright?  I'm having fun!  Maybe I'll get hired but it doesn't seem like it so far!
---
You can just feel his excitement.  Welcome home lads.
---
Yes, adressing the behaviour of others is super toxic. Dude, it's not my fault that these people behave this way xD
---
No, I'm showing favouritism, big difference :P
---
I don't know a single Vanilla player that just "stood by". I and _many_ others repeatedly made long forum posts in the old forums that the direction the changes they were making were bad for the game and now look where we are. Blizzard didn't care then, and they don't care now. 
---
They have stayed in lock-step with whatever money-making scheme was current starting with the store items, dumbing down the game so new players who hadn't worked for anything could instantly join and get epics. Then came group finder, sharding, crz because they made such bad choices they drove away their huge audience one expansion at a time. 
---
None of the Vanilla players I know "loved" removing talents or pruning all of the abilities and downranking. Blizzard just kept ignoring their die-hard fans because chasing the dollar meant more to them than making a good game. Even in BC _everyone_ complained that raid sizes got cut in half and even though BC had _great_ raids it was not nearly as epic. Then attunements started getting removed and it was just a FFA on making it easier and easier.
---
Its not just Blizzard though! It's industry-wide. Lots of games are getting remade to make a new buck off an old concept because developers these days can't come up with anything fresh that isn't riddled with microtransactions.
---
Ah yes, but remember the qualifier that I was a bit of an idiot.  I spent too much on ammo, pet food, and AH greens.
---
Vanilla is not a hard game. If you think Hardware didn‚Äôt contribute to the difficulty of the game you probably haven‚Äôt played or probably had a high end pc back in the days..

Did the same, used a token 2 days ago, still nothing so far, however I am a 2007 account so my chances are probably 0.
---
This is actually a terrific point.
---
Archeage started doing progression servers only a couple years after it launched (and subsequently burned due to horrible business decisions) in the US.
---
You're a very special individual. I'm looking for something better.
---
This isn't a community, this is a bunch of children throwing a hissyfit. Much like you are now.
---
"Blizzard realized there were all these players out there still playing vanilla"? No, they didn't realize. A former wow team lead had to LITERALLY print 200,000+ signatures. He took those printed signatures to blizzard. He also explained that top viewed twitch streamers agreed to stream legacy wow if servers were released.
---
So a person tells you "There is a minimum 200k player base and thosands of twitch viewers for your game whenever you release it". From there is just business 101.
---
"Unusual"? runescape did this in 2013 when it released Old School Runescape (a copy of the 2007 version of runescape). And I'm sure there are other games that have done this.
---
"15 years of successful and unsuccessful MMO"? the only reason we get to play classic is because retail never died. It never stopped being successful.
---
The fact that this comment is flagged as controversial is hilarious.
---
There is no way they intentionally tuned down the entire game for the beta.
---
Depends on the speed of War Efforts. Since there're little to no reason to speed it now, I predict way more AQ bugs in Classic. On private servers there're dozens.
---
Nobody thinks of the future, they just think of "now".
---
Do you have an example of hate against new players? I doubt anyone really cares about that.
---
Well then your opinion of fun isn‚Äôt the same as mine, which is okay. Thanks for sharing, highly valued your input...
---
"I dont like what you said, GROW UP" Get over yourself. You don't speak for anyone but yourself.
---
Everyone uses discord now, so it makes no diffrance
---
I didn't even think about that. Great point to bring up.
---
So? Most guilds didn‚Äôt require attendance for loot runs. They were mostly used for alts and trial members. If your guild has MC on farm to the point where they‚Äôre only running it for specific items and has no intention of letting you roll on a piece of gear you want, locking yourself out in a raid you pug together is fine.
---
Might be because they are wrong? Maybe? Idk.   
---
I just recall one of the reasons we couldnt have classic was because they didnt have the data, now when the outcry was large enough they suddenly have all the data they need :P
---
Probably caused by the lack of new skeletons and animations, but still having that (retail) feature of your characters head facing towards the object / NPC that you are currently targeting, which then results in this bug.
---
I‚Äôm only just now finding out that some people don‚Äôt wear much, if any, clothes at home.
---
That seems to bizarre to me.
---
But values such as health/mana regen were wrong in the demo and they were supposedly using the same data as back then so i don't think it's a straight forward as that.
---
&gt; This sort of buddy buddy relationship with devs that 'gamers' seem to have is so creepy. I don't play a lot of games anymore and only recently got into a few gaming communities, and people talk about devs as if they're their friends. Thanking them for stuff, posting threads about how they're appreciated and so on. Fucking weird.
---
REEE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HUMAN EMOTIONS ARE
---
I never said anything close to that, but hey, you can have your own interpretation.
---
I simply told you that you have a personal problem and that i'm sure you have the ability to deal with it maturely. 
---
I did not tell you to grow up, or that I didn't like what you said.
---
I like how you're putting your faith in the guys who lost almost every version of **their own game**
---
This is an interesting idea and could be possible that they detuned damage across the board for beta to get better feedback on mechanics and the like.  But if they did that they should mention it.
---
&gt;"15 years of successful and unsuccessful MMO"? the only reason we get to play classic is because retail never died. It never stopped being successful.
---
What I meant was some things they have done have been well received, and some have not. :)
---
Imo rogues should ninja the bindings somehow and then use vanish and sit around in sw or org for 1 hour to receive the insults. Then you should transfer to a new realm with a name change and do it again. A true rogue should be this way. They should pay the iron price to wield a thunderfury.
---
I hope not. I never liked that guy or most Europoors for that matter.
---
I was wondering the same. I'm myself not gonna resub just for a small chance of beta access. 
---
I'll enjoy the streams and then start all fresh in August!
---
I honestly see both sides. I want Classic to have a balance between the elitist pricks and the "Vanilla virgins". I think people need to hop off streamers dicks when they don't know what they're doing because that's where a lot of the fun lies. When you're exploring without any clue  but on the other hand it's annoying seeing some streamer report all these "bugs" that in fact, it's not a bug at all. Asmongold said last night that the point of the beta is for advertisement and not "bug fixes" which is fucking retarded logic. If anything it's a combination of both. Classic can be the most hyped game of 2019 but if its riddled with bugs, nobody's going to play it and the streamers will leave, say the game is shit and blame Blizzard. I'm honestly happy with the variety of people in the beta. You have your influencers and your private server/vanilla group. I'm honestly so happy Joana got into the beta. If anyone deserves it the most, its him.
---
This is why. 
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/RoughLachrymoseYogurtCeilingCat](https://clips.twitch.tv/RoughLachrymoseYogurtCeilingCat)
---
Also, they need quality beta testers like this.

And also this

[https://clips.twitch.tv/HungryHeadstrongConsoleOMGScoots](https://clips.twitch.tv/HungryHeadstrongConsoleOMGScoots)
---
Joana's speed run was recorded in 1.12. Basically the same patch as we're playing on Classic beta.
---
In my guild, people were mostly multiboxing the carapaces on their own (but it's way easier on private servers), with only some help from the guidies. 
---
And Arcanites for TFs were loaned.
---
Didn't know 1.5 million players still had an active subscription
---
The dumbest type of comment I have ever seen come from this community. 
---
Nochanges makes no sense and isn't even an argument itself. 
---
Nochanges, except for all of the changes already added to Classic anyway. 
---
Nochanges, but you're getting layering which will help make launch a smoother run without fucking up servers or questing areas. Something that will absolutely help and be of low impact. 
---
Nochanges, but you're getting a better graphical controls for your game. For example, foliage moves when you walk past them like it did in WoD. 
---
Some endgame items received several stat changes throughout Vanilla. Blizzard has decided to just make them start at their final iteration rather than change as they introduce their planned content roll out.
---
By this logic, I guess the game is already ruined for you because there's been a fuck ton of changes to the game.
---
There is absolutely no reason to not change things like spawn rates on quest mobs in a highly populated area like Elywn Forest.
---
It obviously was very difficult, because Blizzard didn't think it was even possible to implement classic in the way they wanted until they made a breakthrough. If you actually knew anything about game development you wouldn't call that easy. To use your own words, you're simply lying.
---
Wow that‚Äôs axing
---
But we don't know the % difference between his current run and his original run on 1.9?
---
No, not meant that way at all. I have played plenty on Pservers myself.
---
I meant that there is not necessary "all grown up", as many of them can be young and coming from Pservers, but still has experience in "vanilla content".
---
No offense, but if you weren't out to take offense, you would have most likely read that hostile intent into what I wrote.
---
This was known to not work in patch 1.12 back in 2006.
---
Using the BlueTracker from the Wayback machine you can read a Blue-posted Reckoning guide from back in 2006.
---
[Here's the link.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061206141810/http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm)
---
Here's the relevant section:
---
&gt; ‚ÄúCan I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?‚Äù
---
&gt; ‚Äú**Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit.** However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting.‚Äù
---
yeah, i know :D
---
Well I guess you can always stay on your private servers if you're not happy about Classic.
---
Not sure I follow. Bugs are created as a result of porting 1.12 data into the live retail client, that's the whole reason for this beta. How is it working in some instances an indication that it's not a bug?
---
Yeah. When I got into the BfA beta, I didn't receive the email until almost a week afterwards. I discovered I was in by checking the accounts listing on the launcher.
---
Watch him play dark souls, he has IQ 1.... LUL
---
Well, If You had access to both old and new clients, you could level in both versions in parallel and compare everything as You level.
---
&gt; Edit: I looked at Tipsout's stream, it looks like the damage numbers are the same.
---
This really just boils down to a lot of things people being used to private server numbers and think if Classic is off, *it* must be off.
---
While the thread is about tiger damage, a lot of other things are being presented, but it appears most of it is correct.
---
The only thing I can think of for Joana's case here is that they loaded the wrong mob values. Durotar Tigers in Joana's vid have a slower swing timer than the ones in Beta, and the faster attack speed from them *would* result in a lower damage dealt (as attack damage is correlative to attack speed). Should be reported and I am sure they'd fix it going forward.
---
Turn back! You'll just get shit on by this community. I already made a post about how it seemed like numbers were off and maybe they were either guessing or deliberately tweaking numbers and got swarmed by "it's based on their database; the numbers are right" posts...
---
Hah try 1 per server
---
Joana also has the benefit of his fully recorded vanilla speed run that he can use as a reference.
---
You can't let the negativity bring you down. People are toxic in every online community. Unfortunately it's something you have to get used to. We live in the age of 'up in arms'. People use the internet to voice their dissatisfaction because they can and people will listen. 
---
I don't think for a second that any single forum represents the community as a whole. There are plenty of positive players out there who are super excited for release and don't get critical over every little thing. It's just that people are more inclined to voice dissatisfaction rather than satisfaction.
---
That makes sense. Just appeared a bit inconclusive as I hadn't read much into it so that clears it up.
---
&gt;jokes need to stop or the community will be toxic

I love how theres people in discords slaving away to find this proof, and THEY bring him the proof, and somehow its all of Esfands hard work to find this. lol
---
He's not enjoyable to watch like this. He will talk about this game for ages then when beta comes out he's saying it's a joke, it's shit, i'm so good, it's super easy. He will talk about how BfA is shit because people get baby'd and have free gold and he's literally taking gold off people in the beta. Sometimes he can be really enjoyable to watch, but McConnell has to constantly give him that reality check to bring him back down to earth.
---
It's the legion engine. A lot of minor things like that are unlikely to change.
---
What are you trying to communicate?
---
[Don't you remember how the Paladin one-shot Kazzak?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xhgvouRprw) He had a friend duel him while using /sit to gain an insane amount of Reck charges, and then ran over to the World Boss to kill him.
---
This. Exactly this.
---
You're right. I have nothing to contribute talking with you. You've somehow managed to rattle off a completely irrelevant topic and baslessly ramble onto a tangent about some garbage about recognizing exactly what was in 1.12.
---
Criticism and toxicity are completely different. I need you to follow me here.
---
I'm not complaining about complainers. I'm addressing that there is an inherent toxicity issue in this community.
---
What's worse? Honestly asking.
---
Not sure what you're on about haven't seen much salt. I know there are some people but I've seen humour posts and a general excitement for the game. 
---
Maybe you're just seeing what you want to see.
---
That entitlement coming in hot. You haven‚Äôt gotten picked yet, relax. Not everyone will be for the beta (that‚Äôs life, I‚Äôve been playing since 2004 and haven‚Äôt made a single beta in WoW). You seriously aren‚Äôt missing much that you won‚Äôt get to experience in 3 months.
---
You can't say for sure that something You're experiencing is how it's supposed to be until You get into that original 1.12  client that Blizz use for reference.
---
I think you guys are taking the comments of a few low lifes and generalizing for Vanilla players and this subreddit as a whole. I promise you it's not that bad, we're a friendly bunch. Just ignore the blowhards like you would anywhere else.
---
Yeah I've noticed the same. It wasn't so toxic before the release date announcement. Since then there's been a LOT of streamer bashing and Retail vs Classic talk
---
Have you heard about inconsistencies between database experience values and Classic ones?
---
Have you actually read through that guide? Tons of errors.
---
I destroy everyone as ud spriest brug
---
I have characters on 4 of those servers!
---
It‚Äôs their IP.... who is suing them?
---
I can‚Äôt wait to grief the shit out of all you retail scrubs.
---
Why is that tauren in mage gear? xD  
---
Engi teleporter side effect or something?
---
This post is so dumb. Why does this offend you so much that you post it on reddit.
---
But I haven't played since 3.4
---
I have a suspicion they are using Wrath of the Lich King values. I could be wrong, but it does seem like every mob is not hitting as hard as it should be and I'm sure you could find more evidence through old videos.
---
The orangeish one was literally liquified gummy bears flavor.
---
Sometimes when you alt tab out of the game and back in the textures fucked up like this. Imagine someone peeled the skin off one character and picked a random one to put it back on. The top right one (Undead mage) got my own night elf hunters textures over it.
---
&gt; This idea that you can just spin up legacy code and run it is absolutely insane, and downright dangerous even if it can, in theory, work.
---
As a software engineer, I'm *really* curious what expertise you're basing this statement on. Especially the "downright dangerous" part.
---
Yeah it's pretty brutal on this subreddit right now.  But I'll eat any amount of toxicity if that's what it takes to get classic wow done right.   Been waiting too long for this game to be quiet when stuff seems off.
---
There's no way it launched with close to that or had that many beta players. It was 200,000 or so on launch. Who knows about beta, but maybe 1/20th that? I still remember how awful launch day was. So many wanted refunds. Game was unplayable. Couldn't get out of starting zone. But there were only a handful of servers with ~1,500-2,000 or something player cap.
---
You have to ensure the footage you compare to is 1.12 Vanilla.  Any other time and the numbers could be off anyway.
---
okey
---
So a video explaining all of the things he likes about classic wow means he is anti-classic now? I really don't understand this subreddit at all.
---
https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html
---
I read the back cover of a few World of Warcraft books at Barnes &amp; Nobles 18 years ago. How dare they preclude from   
---
the beta testing!
---
Yea, I don't remember numbers and what not but sure remember numberous wipes that happened when you pulled two packs without any cc. Damage really seems off.
---
Classic wouldn‚Äôt be the same without him.
---
He should be permabanned from everything WoW
---
They hated /u/Dessiato because he told them the truth.
---
Or maybe I'm just not into the idea that billion dollar companies give a shot about anything other than making money. And they'll say anything they can to make more since that's literally their job.
---
1.12 comes with some significant nerfs to dungeons, that went live over some of the patches that have lead to 1.12
---
Go on steam and buy Mordhau - great game keeping my mind off of Classic, Just trying to get consistently better and better.
---
as preach said last night "People have started to notice that the people streaming classic are all streamers" 
---
people should just look around on the streams, most of them are not streamers, yes the streamers are much more likely to have gotten beta then most but thats the way it works. I like Ferrari's a car youtuber is more likely to get to drive one, I like F1 but an F1 youtuber is more likely to get a free ticket
---
:thinking:
---
Asmongold is going PvP, and is only going to swap to PvE if the ganking and stream sniping becomes unbewrave
---
Except most streamers will roll on Pve servers
---
Grow up and stop getting triggered by old farts.
---
They're salty because they didn't get invited to the beta.
---
&gt;Basically the same patch as we're playing on Classic beta
---
doesn't damage normalization only affect instant attacks from abilities anyways?
---
BC minus Epic Flying would probably be pretty good.  I think people forget how much influence Arenas had on the entire pve scene though.
---
Totally agree. That‚Äôs really when the term welfare epics emerged. Naxx was a joke as the first raid, the heroic and normal split of raids happened that trivialized raids and content in general
---
I think he said he‚Äôs been playing since the original vanilla open beta as well.
---
I don't think Mark Kern is in a position to judge anyone else for killing their game as every game he touched has died.
---
Asmon plays up his ego to get viewers. It sparks outrage, which in turn gets more viewers which incentives his behaviour.
---
Yeah, I totally agree that most people here are a friendly bunch.
---
Distill it down and inject that Asmongold directly into my veins please
---
I agree fully. I feel like gearing is garbage mostly from the shear amount of difficulty levels. In current bfa you go from 355 to 415 in dungeons to mythic raid. That is absolutely insane because people skip entire aspects of the game.  If they removed some of the "fluff" (lfr/heroic dungeons) and squished the total ilvls needed it would make gearing feel much better to most people. Also by not completely negating a whoe tier ever season would male the flow much smoother.
---
Great work! I'll probably use this when Classic releases.
---
What are the default routes based on?
---
They did, and it was patch 2.0.3, not vanilla, so that's not what's happening here
---
Reading through his twitter, it seems he has some serious health issues. Anyone know what's up?
---
Or:

---
His name is venruki. It's in the title of the post.
---
If you‚Äôre a caster on the Alliance and play Human, you‚Äôre an idiot. Female gnomes with pigtails is BiS for PvE, PvP, and the most important: Looks.
---
broken/unviable specs, pvp was unbalanced (not saying not fun but unbalanced), non existent boss mechanics (just auto attack and win), the overrall grind could be overwhelming at times and not much else to do aside from said grinding and the pve/pvp which uses the ressources you've just grinded.
---
I've been seeing the toxicity too. People need to chill. Good post, can't agree more. Get some sun and enjoy the summer too. üåû

I think the angry comes from people who have given up on WoW get to play the beta while some people who have played for a while do not get to.
---
If your a random person you have to have a active subscription to even be considered to be in the beta. I want to play the beta really bad but I don‚Äôt want to subscribe because I don‚Äôt feel WoW is very fun at the moment so if I don‚Äôt get in the beta it‚Äôs a waste of money.
---
It wasn't in original vanilla so it should be removed 
---
/#nochanges
---
If you want fancy new shit like this then play retail
---
You're absolutely right, the attack speeds do seem to be different.  Maybe we've stumbled upon something else here.
---
"Listen here noobs....."
---
You're way overreacting. It's just streamers getting called out on their bullshit. It's going to be happening a whole lot more when WoW Classic comes out and they ninja shit on stream because they think only they are entitled to it.
---
You still haven't figured it out? He's loud and obnoxious to gain your attention. And you just *made a post* *about him* on reddit. Some people are so easily manipulated it's hilarious.
---
Perplexity has been great
---
Walking around naked is awesome.
---
hes not wrong, a large portion of the playerbase is very bad and theres nothing wrong with that. most of the people in the beta right now are people that play wow for 10+ hours a day and have been playing for over a decade so of course theyre going to be better then newer and less experienced players.
---
Yeah lots not make it harder if people are saying it‚Äôs easy.
---
He‚Äôs in quest greens and ripping on an elite and trash at the same time and they are barely putting a dent in him. Yeah let‚Äôs not make it harder
---
Persuasiveness 100
---
The whole point of the beta is to get feedback as to where things aren't working correctly so they can check the reference client.
---
But they didn't? They've never claimed they lost the source for WoW or whatever, and the hardest part to recover for Classic was apparently the old art assets.
---
Yeah, people on the internet have a tendency to do that, generalized, lump people together, issue proclamations based on the words Community or fandom, such as toxic and whatever other dumb things, when they really fall to individual people who are this way.
---
Likewise, generalized call out posts made instead of specifically replying to each thread.
---
What's with people constantly attacking my knowledge as if it fucking matters. If people want to have a dick measuring contest about who has the most game development knowledge then they're welcome to post their credentials. I assume everyone is a senior game developer by the way they're talking, Christ.
---
Yes and after his chat reminded him that it was only weapons and trinkets. He acknowledged it and moved on. The bug report will just be ignored if wrong. Can't blame a guy who played years ago and hasn't played any private server to jog his memory. Also there was a patch in the beginning where you could although I think he just got confused. People are quick to hate.
---
Looking through all the patches from 1.10 to 2.0 I don't see anything, documented or in the "undocumented changes" section of various wikis, about reducing or normalizing mob damage outside of specific mobs.
---
&gt; I mostly hope we can get the talent trees and options back. A massive set of three trees that we can pick and choose from.
---
You're getting talent trees for sure, but you might be mis-remembering the options available to you. In most cases you're never going to stray from certain builds, you're never going to skip certain talents, and you'll likely get a handful of talents that could go either way. 
---
It's the illusion of choice. 
---
Aside from speccing between pvp and pve content, there's really not much in the way of choosing what you want. Or at least, not options that will have a large enough impact for you to notice. 
---
You can even see for yourself. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#b
---
Discovers? So many people realized this within minutes of the beta coming up. Saying Joana discovered it is like saying Columbus discovered the Americas.
---
All Im saying is that just because blizzard employees couldnt pull it off on the reference client the other day, doesnt necessarily mean it wasnt possible back then with extreamly precise timing. 
---
I could be 1000% wrong. No doubt. But I think there might be something more to this.
---
How does one kill that which has no life?
---
The problem is a lot of us Vanilla players never leveled during the 1.12 patch we had a few 60s by then, so these reduced damage numbers could be correct ? 
---
I would rather they increase the difficulty however.
---
It's possible. I think streamer drama needs to stay in /r/livestreamfail
---
It takes 5 seconds. If you're right it gets fixed, if you're wrong they move on.
---
You're just salty because you think you're more worthy than other people to be in the beta.
---
Honestly from watching clips yesterday, this dudes a bot. 0 reason for him to lose to Sodas druid or Sony's warrior with the scenarios he chose for the ganks, legitimately is a terrible player
---
It's nice to get your addons and settings done..
---
So you're whining about the internet and teh incentives at play here?
---
Yea no one maeks threads about how theyr'e hpapy with this or that
---
Welcome to humanity. We're much more likely to emote if we're not happy.....I see your point
---
Welcome to the internet? Surprise people are much more motivated to leave negative comments than positive ones.
---
People still have to choose to reach out and make friends
---
Stfu up with your bitching. Leave if you‚Äôre so upset
---
Numbers look fine to me. I frequently remember AT LEVEL soloing bosses with my brother as a rogue/druid combo to farm money for our 40 mounts. So we did runs of SM and other things where we stealthed to bosses and only pulled what we had to, but we 2 manned most stuff.
---
It really isn't as hard as people remember.

It is just a bunch of little things adding up. People where horrible back then, even some of hte best players then would be seen as awful and horrible players now. We know much more about gear things such as Warriors in vanilla would have never used a staff that gave int + spirit but you damn better believe they do now, etc.
---
Blizzard has the right numbers. That was just the game. I tanked in Vanilla too and with a coordinated group you could easily troll lower level dungeons. Hell even higher level ones, I frequently remember over pulling in BRD and stuff and being fine with a small amount of coordination.
---
I regret nothing.
---
I was thinking that as well, Deadmines seemed to be correct and WC also seemed to be correct but SFK/BFD damage seems to be very low.
---
Unless blizzard done goofed.
---
Your a nice person
---
That's every single title tho, no way you should harp on 4 and 5 just cuz they're buggy, might as well hate all of em. I absolutely love Morrowind and such but in terms of being buggy, Morrowind is definetly up there with them. Every single game bethesda has released has been like that.
---
&gt; especially a druid or shaman.
---
Hey now! I had money for mount at 44 as an enhancement Shaman.
---
The guy in the 3rd clip is just trolling g right?
---
Years and years ago around the WotLK-Cataclysm era Swifty pulled some of his old vanilla retail buddies together and talked about the old vanilla days on his youtube channel. They had a bunch of screenshots from Swifty's POV as well as his friends' POV doing battlegrounds and random stuff together.
---
How would someone who supposedly bought the account even know who the previous owner's old friends were? I mean, not just having them on your friend list or whatever but actually knowing stuff about them. And wouldn't someone who you've spent hundreds of hours socializing with, probably on ventrilo, be able to tell if you were pretending to be someone else?
---
You think people should research every minute problem they have to make sure its intended behavior?
---
I've been playing since vanilla too man, MANY of us aren't getting accepted, it's not just you. Don't worry about it, it's best for the game that streamers get access along with some vets and random players, if you care about the games success then you will understand why this is the best thing for the game.
---
I don't know if people are trolling, or if it's just different in other areas. 
---
On the two characters I have played in beta (paladin / druid), both of them will get down to 50-60% health on any given pull. 
---
Are you guys suggesting that it needs to be more damage than that? Should I be resting after every pull?
---
You‚Äôre* my point has been proven.
---
Or (if ure EU) just request your GDPR-data abd you will see eeeverything lol
---
No offense meant, just commenting that Ghost Wolf helps ease the sting of mountlessness.
---
Bipolar
---
Not sure, but the video description states it was 1.9.2
---
That is not the case at all lol
---
They will obviously not update the assets for Classic, not sure why is even up for debate.
---
They have already updated **a lot** of the assets in the modern game, over the years (including all the playable races models, most of the NPC models and a lot of various animals/pets/critters were also uprezzed, lots of textures have been increased, textures in the main cities were replaced with hi-res textures etc  - but obviously they will not use them in Classic.
---
The shadows, ambient occlusion, new grass etc really make the game look really different of how it looked originally, that's what I say. You can compare screenshots from vanilla with screenshots of the same zone of Classic and they won't look the same at all due to these modern graphical features.
---
But it‚Äôs just so easy right???!
---
Lol, anytime someone posts Mark Kern's opinion during the Firefall days I'm always reminded of [that fucking bus,](https://removeddit.com/r/Games/comments/1tuf3c/this_is_why_mark_kern_was_removed_as_ceo_by_red_5/) haha.
---
Yikes thought this wasn't supposed to be in the game, looks like some  miscommunication going on.
---
It won't be as painful as explaining to your friends you're playing Alliance.
---
No he never played classic.
---
Boomkins rise up
---
And to think, it took the community to cause an uproar for him to get an invite...
---
Pathetic blizzard
---
Even in Blackfathom Deeps right now, Asmongold is only being hit for 29-33 damage by the Elites and only 14 damage when he blocks... So if he was using Shield Block it would be even easier. It just doesn't feel right? They have the HP of elites but the damage of regular mobs.
---
amazing ron jeremy simply amazing
---
The guy refers to himself as a literal god every other sentence. It's an act lol
---
 It's still on of the few guides available for alliance and it barrows most of it from Joana's
---
This is the kind of analysis I'm happy to see, a direct comparison with the original game and not private servers.
---
While I can agree no one should tell you how to play. To the people defending rushing to hogger, I swear to God if you get to 10 in 2 weeks do all the endgame and start bitching and whinging about lack of content or "let's get a westfall phase now". I'll fucking scream. It's these fuck twats that drive blizzard to do "play the patch" strategy.
---
When it comes to items, definitely. When it comes to other things, a quick google search isn't going to kill you. Then again, the point remains that maybe people with more experience and knowledge about Vanilla should be let in to test more than completely clueless streamers.
---
Lol SFK y'all people must be joking about way too easy the hell doesn't start until level 60 for UBRS LBRS scholo, strath
---
Heh, consensus. This is going to be a wild ride.
---
Wtf is this crazy talk.. my classic guild used to run 3 raid nights.. You can get plenty done in three hours. Quit spouting false information
---
Thanks for your insight! It really helps
---
I was kind of just playing the devil's advocate, but I do see the point of the 'no-changes' argument. Stat and balance changes are one thing, but changing fundamental game mechanics like spawn rates is going to rustle some jimmies because that's effectively making it a different game.
---
I don't really care one way or the other.
---
Stereotyping is based in reality, and the reality is that a lot of streamers are over-the-top, click-baity, insufferable people who I'd rather not watch. I'm sure they are absolutely lovely people in real life, but the second they get in front of that camera, their faux "personality" comes out. I get it, they want to stand out, but so do the other 102910932 Twitch snowflakes and eventually they all get fairly similar.
---
Same here about ~2007 feels bad cus I had an older account that I lost the info to. heres to hoping
---
Exactly, no one at blizz is going to see this "joke" report. (well unless they watch the stream ofc)
---
I'm willing to bet this system only forwards bugged objects to Q&amp;A if it's reported by multiple people.
---
&gt;Or is something else amiss here
---
There's been some pretty big bugs so far. They'll get fixed, sure, but don't forget - if there can be big bugs then there can be little bugs.
---
 L k
---
 Smüò§
---
Exactly like that post from earlier today saying that they felt blizz was doing it wrong because it did not feel like private servers.
---
There's proof in another post of Joana getting hit for over twice as much in his old video as the current beta, against the same mob/level. I wouldn't be surprised if something is overall wonky with mob damage calculations right now. Agree it should stay either way but I'm slightly curious myself to see how this pans out.
---
He‚Äôs probably not wrong. People who‚Äôs lives revolve around playing and streaming a game to the public are probably better on average than the general population.
---
Well then he knows all about killing games I guess, lol
---
I hope people continue to make comparisons like this throughout the beta. Classic mobs are supposed to hit hard, which is why CC was required in dungeons. I'm just not seeing that so far.
---
Correct if I‚Äôm wrong but it would work both ways yeah? Enemies would also have an easier time hitting you?
---
Man, going back and realizing when stuff actually came out is blowing my mind. I was pretty sure the other capital AHs didn't come out until like Wotlk/BC but they came out in 1.9. 
---
I totally forgot they redid the stats on a bunch of the tier gear.
---
and don't forget, a lot of spells were useless gold sinks.
---
imagine thinking blizzard cares about anything you spergs type here
---
is he 14?
---
People wonder why there‚Äôs growing dislike for streamers
---
Because they offer a valuable perspective.
---
People who started post-cataclysm will not be familiar with how things were. They might not know exactly what stats were on each item, but they'll try things that we won't even consider. Probably pulling way too many mobs and dying, but someone needs to test the mob swarming behaviour, and graveyard respawn locations. 
---
It also helps Blizzard estimate the number of retail players likely to stick around, which is really important when it comes to server health. Suppose half the retail players like this who try the classic beta struggle to get past 20 and give up. That's really useful info to know when it comes to deciding server caps.
---
Layering can only do so much. If Blizz get the numbers wrong and is way more popular initially than expected, but 90% of the retail players leave never to return, you might end up with a bunch of low pop servers. If it's the opposite and they all love it and stick around, then Layering is likely be there for longer and when recombined the server might still be crowded.
---
Surgery for bipolar?
---
You realize none of that happened overnight right? They were small changes all the way until cata where the serious changes happened and most people quit. I was super happy all the way through WotLK and only quit once MoP was released.
---
freeze me pls
---
Oh shit there it is. Props to you and /u/Air_chandler, and Joana, for finding a concrete, 1-1 comparison.
---
i dont care
---
But SW was like that until cata. Which was 2010 if I remember correctly??
---
That was a known issue if I recall, the formulas hadn't been brought over yet from the old code. The data is nothing without the math to operate on that data.
---
I would love to see actual numbers on this. Because most guildies and friends stop playing once their character is "maxed out" except for raid. Its like they grind hella hard for BIS from dungeons, get the trinkets and weapons they need then become raid loggers.
---
So by making the process spread out and more time invesment they would play more then current. But that might just be an exception than a rule.
---
It's been so diminishing that it has maintained a healthy population of black market servers since BC came out.
---
" I‚Äôm under 20 and haven‚Äôt ever played vanilla except a few weeks on a private server during the WoD content drought."
---
Absolutely! I don't allow myself any rested experience, don't include class quests and only add a minimal amount of monster experience from group content and go beyond level 60 in order to make up for any potential difference.
---
Imagine being so far stuck up your own ass that you have to hate on someone that is actively making a community and bringing hype around a game you enjoy, you dont have to love or watch him, just stop hating.
---
Themechanic doesn't care about the cloak.  He streams under Themechanic98.
---
Hes entertaining though
---
So, a dead game for a niche of a couple thousands of player ? I see, thanks.
---
It's like taking a 15 year old engine from a car and trying to mash it in to it's brand new version.  Like yeah it's probably going to work and run just not without a lot of tinkering with shit.
---
Three types of people watch streams:
---
1. People without access to the content.
---
2. Children (most streamers openly admit that their target audience is below 15). Easy to influence, easy money.
---
3. People who don't have friends, or friends that don't share their hobby. Streamers offer the illusion that they are your buddy, that you are part of a group, that you belong. Also the reason why point 2. is working so well.
---
They are like cam-girls, just for a different audience.
---
We used to run Deadmines at 15-17 if memory serves, it was quite comical to see their run.
---
I don't think so. They didn't have autoloot in Joana's run and it exists in 1.12
---
You‚Äôve already hit on the reasons as to why it‚Äôs being ‚Äúpackaged‚Äù with Retail WoW, and why it isn‚Äôt being sold for 29.99.
---
They want you to have access to Retail WoW, in the hopes that if Classic gets old for you, or you‚Äôre bored at that time, that you swing on over to ole BFA and buy 600 tokens and store mounts and other shit.
---
Classic will be releasing 3-4 months before the next expansion announcement. Should that announcement look like more of the same BFA bullshit, I don‚Äôt care what they do to retail anymore, I‚Äôm not playing it again.
---
He is probably 10x better than you at wow.
---
Are people really under the impression that WoW Classic instances are hard?
---
ikr this own subreddit if filled with them
---
That and he does play it up for the sake of entertainment. People clipping and getting outraged by him are proof enough that it works too. 
---
It's not really controversial for him to say he's good at the game, either, when compared to the majority of players he is. He got cutting edge regularly before he decided to quit mythic raiding and he's gotten pretty high rating in arena. Is he raiding with Method or going to arena invitationals? No, yet he's regularly achieved in content that only a tiny segment of the population do.
---
I'm not saying low level dungeons are challenging, it's that you shouldn't be able to pull more than 3-4 elite mobs around your level and not expect to wipe without CC.
---
I probably had every one of them.  It has been so long.
---
/Thread ?
---
" I‚Äôm under 20 and haven‚Äôt ever played vanilla except a few weeks on a private server during the WoD content drought."   
---
stop crying and let the men talk
---
Stereotyping is easier than thinking critically to filter and decide who you believe deserves criticism and those who are actually genuine. People are taking the easy option... Group them all and criticize as a herd... This is a pretty toxic and bad way to act towards people,
---
Lol mine does. We are a prudish family. My mother‚Äôs side though is all shirtless Mexicans. I don‚Äôt think I ever saw my great grandfather with a shirt on, and I still remember his cries of Spanish vulgarity as he fried eggs and bacon every morning shirtless.
---
Yeah it looks like that to me too.
---
yeah i have a hard time not arguing with people that say all new games suck. theyre just plain wrong and it irks me
---
What is QOL?
---
Blizzard is now woke.....this is how it works now.
---
I am still friends with people i met back then in Classic WoW  
---
Some people i played with back then married each other and got kids.
---
Community and playing with each other was a huge thing  back then and you got into talking,questing,farming etc
---
It was a time friendships and socializing were a huge part of the game.
---
Something that is gone completely today especially because of matchmaking tools.  
---
Even though mechanics in Dungeons in Vanilla aren't that special either you still felt something doing them while working towards a goal.
---
People working together,putting each other on the friendlists so they can run another time again with each other or later form raidgroups.
---
Its not the LFD/LFR Garbage they introduced and sadly never got rid of again.  
---
As Venruki said  
---
If people say something at all its "Ogogogogogog" and after 5 minutes you are done with the Dungeon,have your fat epics/loot and your dopamine rush.
---
Its not one thing that made Classic great
---
Its many things combined that made it great while most of it got replaced for things that don't feel right.
---
There is a reason most people thinking later addons or BFA is great and hate classic are those that found it annoying to search for dungeon or PvP groups if they wanted to get somewhere.
---
The accesibility to certain content ruined the game because they went the wrong path with it.
---
It would be so great if they simply would introduce an alternate timeline and continue with new content for people that want the Classic Spirit to continue on the Classic Severs down the road.
---
They can have baby-emo WoW where no one has to talk or play with each other for BiS Gear and a real WoW for those that like to achieve something as a community next to each other.
---
Fucking solid comment.
---
Top world raid guild used like 8 warriors on vanilla wow retail in AQ, I remember watching it
---
i look forward to devouring your flesh
---
People who say "i played classic I know better than you" make me laugh
---
I only got the barrens in real vanilla, never subbed, quit and gave to my brothers
---
I know exponentially more than people who cleared naxx at the time tho. Because they played through a patch progression before anyone knew how to MMO.
---
The game does not play out the same when you start at 1.12 and everyone knows what they're doing.
---
Orcs and taurens function the same when getting kited
---
Maybe they want beta testers to hurry up and test some later stuff.
---
Hahahahaha dude that‚Äôs a good one. Holy shit I‚Äôm literally rolling on the floor right now. Bro omg. No one has ever made that joke before. Omg dude. You must have so many friends and girls that talk to you because you‚Äôre hilarious. Do you have anymore jokes? You mind PMing me and letting me in on your secret on how you‚Äôve become so funny? You should honestly go on tour or write a book about how to be a comedic fucking genius. Dumb fuck.
---
Cool. Have fun!  Re subscribed my release day account yesterday, we shall see!
---
Because it will trigger Reddit and bring in viewers.
---
rrrrRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Alot goes into routing in vanilla and it wouldn't feel right to copy someone elses work. It's my take on reaching max level that's been revised a multitude of times based on user feedback.
---
Firefall was so ahead of its time when they were attempting it.  It was fun to go in and play but it literally went nowhere.
---
This is one of the top posts right now, it is being talked about. There's no conspiracy. It also makes sense that when people who this sub doesn't like make mistakes that it'll be talked about more.
---
Every single accusation you've made I've never once heard aside from in your post. What kind of intricate shit post is this?
---
Orcs have 25% resistance to stuns best for pvp Tauren is best for pve due to their stam boost
---
Sure, if you are going to raid log thats fine. Not many guilds like that though.
---
Yeah you better delete your comments BOY ü§£ü§£ fuckin idiot
---
That is dedication to the bit
---
&gt;This is supposed to be an example of bad things about classic
---
Its not though.
---
cry me a river :) deal with it ! it is profitable for them to invite streamers and other sorts of content creators, this is free advertisment for their product !
---
Thats from the beta right? Blizzard has said the beta still has some phasing issues (i havent delved too deep into it so i cant really tell you much more) but it shouldnt be a problem for release atleast.  
---
Personally i hope they fix it before i get my hands on (if at all) access to the beta :P
---
On both video they are outleveling the dungeons, no ? Is it good to compare damage on this ?
---
You only have 1 account. If you got in the beta or added another WoW account and/or the PTR, you'd see the dropdown.
---
Bring the strippers and booze!!!
---
with first time i mean wow in general, theres plenty of streamers who are "influencers" but they never ever played wow outside of the big hypes (bfa release for viewers etc) now struggling to get past starting zone...
---
Shows 2011 for me, but my account is from Beta, so...
---
they will try to get on the same server, if he can crash current retail wow servers by having people try and join him do you not think the same will happen with classic?
---
An absolute tool
---
Do you guys not know how to zoom in? It's fine for me.
---
Couldn't agree more. That being said, he definitely turns up the stupid because his viewers are looking for that type of entertainment. Quin is actually pretty down to earth dude when there isn't a bunch of autistic spamming in his chat.
---
You offer them far less than a streamer does, so why would they get you in over a streamer
---
Meathead fits you so perfectly
---
Happened in 1.9x
---
EU SAFE EZ
---
Maybe, but compared to 5+ axes and the stun resist it's really nothing imo
---
Have you never had a place that was just yours?  On a hot summer day being able to walk around naked is amazing :P.  Remember we are born nudists :D.
---
Now they fucking will be.
---
Yes but warriors get a taunt üòâ
---
Totally agree. Reactions seem to be both extreme and polarized on this subreddit. People attack each other, boast/threaten based on their past Vanilla experience, and flip out over every design decision they don't agree with. The level of hyperbole and doom saying that occurs is insane.
---
I can understand why this might happen when debating an important topic, but let's face it... 95% of this Classic WoW news is conjecture. We're an audience that's starving for information (or a game to play!!), but there really isn't anything for us to sink our teeth into. Almost everything has been said about this game and we can only infer so much from Blizzard's occasional blue post.
---
As a result it seems like people have dived headfirst into meming, blindly supporting/attacking content creators, treating anyone that doesn't support Classic as inferior scum, or fighting about Classic's hypothetical systems that we won't understand until more players are involved in the beta.
---
People really need to chill and recognize that its okay for other's to have different opinions. We're all different people with unique perspectives and priorities so its obvious that we won't always agree. You don't like a content creator? Okay, then don't watch their videos. Disagree with Blizz's direction? Let's discuss it like adults and recognize that we don't have all of the information. Like memes? Then meme! Don't like memes? Maybe we need a filter.
---
Just be more civil. Everyone isn't your enemy and every discussion isn't a fight. If you love Classic for the gaming community it supports then start by fostering that community here.
---
No this is from a pserver (see the date on the movie).
---
Just from counting seconds in my head the attack speed seems to be the same, in both sets of videos.
---
Yes which is before the video so irrelevant
---
I would be fun to see some streams from old nihilum and death and taxes members when its released and hear the old stories.
---
RP-PvP preferably
---
I think my Druid still has this in the bank on live.
---
Is there something about normalization in vanilla patch notes?
---
I feel classic is the gateway to things like this. If classic gets the numbers/subs up a ton to show that people like this kind of harder MMO again, they might pull the trigger on it. 
---
It might be years down the road, but if classic is successful, I feel we will see TBC/Wrath getting rolled out. 
---
That being said, if Blizzard does want the both ends approach, they easily could keep leaving current WoW as it is and just keep some vanilla/tbc/wrath servers rolling out to keep the other players happy.
---
üòé
---
"This was a good start, but there were issues with how the developers used to handle updates to the database data. Unlike the source code, for which Blizzard had archives for multiple branches of the game that could be worked on and developed as separate pieces, early database data was overwritten with each commensurate update. Thankfully, that problem was fixed very quickly after launch, and when we looked, we found data going back to version 1.12‚Äîand even earlier."
---
The one thing that isn't really talked about is your average player in classic was utter trash unlike private servers. Private servers had to guess on alot of their numbers and remembered classic mobs hitting hard and dungeons being hard but what was forgotten was it was remembered that way because people were bad and didnt have the resources like today.
---
Jesus dude.. Grow a pair. 99.99999% of the  shit asmon does is low key making fun of himself and not to be taken seriously. Some people are so clueless and sensitive
---
The fact this has evidence makes it the sort of thing that should be submitted so blizzard can check their internal builds and see if it matches.  It's better than just random opinion "This mob doesn't hit as hard as I remember" since there's video evidence that the mob hit harder, which means it's easier to replicate in a controlled environment.
---
It might be a bug or it might be something that changed between 1.9.2 and 1.12, but this gives Blizzard legit information to investigate.
---
&gt;you‚Äôre acting like he shouldn‚Äôt be in beta solely cos he ninja looted. It happens.
---
It's not an open beta and he was hand selected to be in it. It's no an unreasonable punishment for being a toxic ninja looter. 
---
The people pointing out ninja looters aren't the ones being "toxic"
---
I gave my original account to my cousin because he didn‚Äôt couldn‚Äôt buy the game at the time and kept the one I had in TBC/end of vanilla. He got a beta invite.. I got wrecked
---
Hmm looks fishy gonna need a screenshot of you killing a mob in-game
---
One of my most memorable experiences from vanilla was when my husband and I were trying to find our way to Crossroads and a friendly player offered to guide us there... and then seeing Barrens for the first time. There were zebras and giraffes!
---
We paid it forward by helping night elf players get to Eastern Kingdom from Kalimdor. The wetlands were treacherous back then.
---
I should hope people behave better, as they did back then, without cross server tech.
---
Blizzard is a business. Their primary focus is to make money. As we've seen with private servers over the years there is clearly an interest in Classic Wow. Blizzard is simply making a business decision.
---
I've seen posts where people say "Classic will kill retail" or something equally as ridiculous. That will never happen. Blizzard will only "kill" retail when it's no longer profitable.
---
Classic and retail cater to two different audiences at the end of the day. Sure there will be a surge of people trying Classic for a few hours or weeks, but we all know Classic isn't for everyone. Once the hype dies down I'd be interested in seeing how many people either switch over fully to Classic or play it more than retail.
---
I can go to the top 6 streamers of any game and they're all very interchangeable.
---
It's okay that someone doesn't like your favorite streamer. Really, it's okay.
---
he was trolling
---
I didn't see the clip you're talking about, but as someone who's played since patch 1.10, ninja looting is a HUGE no-no.
---
Some streamers spout so many lies and bullshit each minute, I don't understand why *you* don't understand some of the dislike they get.
---
They tried to make it extend a bit via titanforging and socket procs, but i dont think it does the trick.  
---
I myself played till i was "maxed out" and started raidlogging. I do a weekly m+ for my cache but apart from that its nothing really attracting me to play more.   
---
I think you have a good point in spreading out the process somehow, but i have no idea how to implement that into the current system without pissing most the playerbase off with a huge overhaul. Blizzard tried the sneaky socket/titanforge system which had massive backlash.
---
real vanilla wasnt that easy, i guess blizzard doesnt have all the data and fucked up somehow, even private servers are looking better right now
---
Quality of life
---
If you have an alt you can bring, or for other reasons wouldn't be able to be there anyway, then sure, I have no problem with it.
---
But if you're screwing over your guild so *you* can have a one in fifty(?) shot at getting an item, then that's pretty damn selfish.
---
Take a look at the private server sub. Despite having almost 50k subs and ~500 actively browsing it as of writing this comment, most of the posts there are in the single digits in terms of upvotes, save for a few exceptions, and the rest is usually downvoted to hell. Rarely you will find posts there with 100+ upvotes.
---
You can find the same negativity in the comments there.
---
A lot of people that visit that sub and participate in the negativity/toxicity over there also came over here and those bring that toxicity with them. It's not that all people from the private server community are the problem, but there is a huge part of them that definitely are.
---
It **is** a forum on reddit about Blizzard game, after all.
---
You'd be naive to expect anything else.
---
Blizzard should enforce streamers have their public streaming toons on certain servers. 
---
Quarantine the cancer.
---
Esfand has his combat log up and hes streaming on twitch. Might be able to snag more evidence from there. Hes doing BFD so plenty of elites to get numbers from.
---
This is just the age we live in now. People feel like they're entitled to everyone being nice to them on the internet and every little bit of negativity at someone is branded as "toxic behaviour".
---
Grow some fucking skin.
---
This is why i want to stream myself.
---
I just want to play the game and bring people together.
---
A lot of these guys seem to get too big for themselves and cant handle it.
---
Don't let your fantasy ruin reality.
---
I'd rather a faithful 1:1 replication, no matter how easy or hard it may be.
---
We'll worry about potential changes in a few years.
---
Absolutely not, on ely we had a 20 min battle with the ghost wolves cos we kept chain pulling.  Tbh we did epically well to survive it
---
Warrior regen is huge in Classic. If that‚Äôs how it will be warrior will be one day of the fastest and easiest levellers.
---
Maybe ND dungeons were just overtuned, but from the dungeon runs I've watched so far they look incredibly easy. I'm looking at this from a healer pov, the damage output from mobs just seems so low.
---
Lol are you ok buddy? You‚Äôre irrationally mad about a video game. Next you‚Äôll be posting about how girl gamers are ruining the industry
---
I think the patch notes might be inaccurate/incomplete?  There definitely was trinket swapping but it didn't last for long
---
Same here inwas rolling around on my welfare mount well into Hellfire Peninsula
---
He literally never uses sunder armor
---
I remember grinding Dark Whelplings and skinning them/mining in the Badlands for a level or two. I was able to get my mount by 42 that way. But man was it a monotonous week!
---
It's uncommon, but not quite unprecedented. Most of the modern-day RPG ports have had to do this kind of weird massive-scaling data transformation at some point.
---
&gt; ive been watching him since D3. Quin doesnt know anything
---
Gets rank 1 S1 and S2, knows nothing. Honestly if people reading this can't see that simple comment illegitimises the rest of your PoE borderline hyperbole, I don't know anymore.
---
Also what do you mean their first quarterly report? WoW came out in November (Q4.) Do you mean next years first quarterly? Care to link your source? The official reports I see do not list sub numbers https://investor.activision.com/financial-information/quarterly-results
---
One of the best and most known Mages in the world.
---
There‚Äôs probably a million factors unaccounted for, but I decided to look up an old SFK run for comparison and the 2nd boss was hitting the tank for as much as 90 non crit and hitting Asmon for no more than 50 non crit. Now like I said, there‚Äôs a million other potential factors but I thought it was interesting nonetheless.
---
It's Zoomer and Doomer, you guys.

---
Sorry let me rephrase that. I don't care if I appeal to anyone
---
Just got my old vanilla account back.
---
Cant remember what server my characters were on lmao. Trying to find them now.
---
There's no reason to think that the consumables I'm talking about will be in the global with other spells. There's posts from back in 2005 talking about how to use them. It's how I got the idea in the first place
---
Play a warrior
---
He does apparently have MotW in that video, but I'm not sure if 25 armor is enough to make that big of a difference. Would have to see his total armor to say for sure.
---
If we assume there's a bug here, then it could go either way depending on whether it affects all mobs or just these mobs in particular. Someone in that thread seems to have suggested the pet attack speed normalization to be the cause, but I thought that happened after 1.12.
---
If it applies to all mobs, something related to armor calculations would be my guess, but it could be anything and it's really hard to say without having access to the beta myself. Could be something as simple as base armor being wrong, or it could be something with the actual damage calculation itself.
---
year 1 BC (before classic)
---
Am I a boomer for getting annoyed at the word "Toxic"?
---
Exactly... they are saying that anyone who reports it as it not working are wrong, because it indeed should not be working
---
dude relax lmao it's world of warcraft
---
lol you must have a stroke when you go to the review section of any product/place
---
hahaha
---
dumbest thing i've heard all day
---
"so much negativity here what is the problem"?  Hahahah
---
What exactly has the streamers done? They litterally just livestreaming playing a game, and people get upset?
---
Not sure what are you on about. If a streamer acts like a douche the community reacts accordingly and it should.
---
Be sure to bug report it. Include these evidence links as well.
---
You just missed streamer ranting haha
---
People just don‚Äôt trust blizzards ability to test these things. Things like saying you can cast frost bolts at someone facing directly away from them 5 yards away is ridiculous. It‚Äôs seems that either they‚Äôve fked their reference client somehow or they just are incompetent at testing.
---
Yes people have.
---
Welcome to reddit
---
It wasn‚Äôt even that. Joana said on his stream he knows a guy who works at blizzard and he got him an invite.
---
I'll give you an A for effort
---
And much value was gained huh, truly made an impact :)
---
I would if I had beta
---
Wrong, play what you want bud.
---
ignorance is bliss. best of luck.
---
Rather than ass mon gold and staybugged
---
They cant even be bothered to report bugs.
---
And then you got tits out reporting getting one shot cuz hes trash
---
I started in 2006 and dont have beta
---
Why do these threads keep popping up lol
---
I didn‚Äôt like the Verdan doing to much damage cause he wrecked face.
---
That looks like a separate issue. If you read on his twitter more you can see he's pretty open about things. The reason why past 8 years he started streaming for a couple of months then suddenly stopped again for half a year is different things related to being bipolar.
---
can you read the post
---
You can be guaranteed that Asmond will be getting the scarab on whatever server he's on. Not that I'm mad about that. It's just what's going to happen.
---
Hi, /u/cutefluffycat624
---
Depending what they want more.
---
The class or the experience of being a human in ashenvale
---
You make s compelling argument
---
Let's start celebrating then =)
---
It's gonna be so awesome to play this game again. A good Blizzard product! Tbh, I want to time travel. 27th of August seems so far away!
---
the part where we want to earn what we have rather than complain it wasnt just handed to us, and cry that someone who has been playing longer has more things than we do.
---
Really? People who wear a lot of cloths at home seems bizarre to me lol. Of course I‚Äôm usually just in my boxers and socks, unless someone is over, then basketball shorts will do lol
---
I‚Äôm so bummed.
---
I‚Äôve been playing WoW since Vanilla off and on and I haven‚Äôt gotten a beta invite. 
---
Kills me to see retards stream the game with beta invites because they can afford to stream and not work.
---
Yes salty.
---
thanks its my first week here
---
Not with a level cap of 30
---
Downvoted because you dont understand basic math. This sub in a nutshell.
---
that is such a small detail i wouldn't have noticed it until many hours in. not something i'd be looking for to insure accuracy, that's for sure.
---
Light to you!  Troll priest is what I‚Äôm rolling never doubted it!
---
Unpopular opinion, yes!
---
Gnome warrior with the big pink bushy beard and vertically swept hair.
---
Holy shit this is relatable... I have no children, but my father made me learn to ski before I was allowed to learn to snowboard. I had to learn to play the piano before I was allowed to learn the guitar. etc, etc.
---
In his defense, he did learn to snowboard with me after teaching me to snow ski. I do have great memories of those times too.
---
Every time I‚Äôm naked in my home all that goes through my mind is images of me grabbing my junk and screaming like a bitch while an axe-wielding maniac charges at me from a closet, murdering me, and my family then subsequently finding me in that state and having that image forever branded on their psyches.
---
Well yeah obviously depending on the skill of the group that can play a part + other factors, but large regular trash pulls that they're doing right now is not right..
---
Yes. And what do you see happening to Classic in 3-4 years?
---
He's been playing retail wow since classic.
---
as in, he's been playing modern wow with all it's new features and content.
---
he hasn't been playing classic wow for any extended amount of time , other than 14 years ago when we didn't knew any better.
---
Beta hasn't been out for a week, people are still in the nostalgia phase, reliving old moment and yes, having a ton of fun doing so...
---
But that doesn't mean they'll still have the same opinion 3 month later when they are clearing MC for the Xth time or after spending a month doing WSG/AB non-stop while grinding for that rank 14... aka, the replayability once the nostalgia/freshness wears off.
---
This isn't really a new thing either. many games have done vanilla/classic/ TLP server, like everquest. The trend is pretty clear : tons of interest at release, half the population gone after a month.
---
Iv been muted several times and still received the bfa beta
---
I don't think it's been done quite like this. I could be wrong, but this is a case of having a modern codebase learn to run an older game. Traditionally this was seen as impossible.
---
Right. He didn‚Äôt get an invite the first wave. Pathetic
---
People spend weeks telling him, "Hey this works you should try it!" and he just says, "no that doesnt work" took 3 or 4 days of telling him it works for him to finally decide that he thinks it works, and now its like it was his idea from that get go
---
Nobody who made any of the threads you were talking about we'll see this.
---
This is why Gaben won't make hl3
---
It's really odd. Our are collective memories failing us and this is a Berenstain/Berenstein situation where we all remember classic being harder than it was? As we've all seen from the TipsOut two-shot vid with Verdan, the damage of some bosses definitely seems right so is it a problem with trash or were private servers overtuned? Watching Asmongold do BFD and the incoming damage definitely seems on the low side, but I haven't played Vanilla WoW since 2006 so I have absolutely no conscious memory of damage values. 
---
I trust Blizzard's internal numbers since WoW Classic has been retrofitted with a 1.12.1 database, and I definitely think private servers were overtuned because a lot of the numbers had to be patched together from videos and the WoW beastiary. I also trust MonkeyNews because he's had so much experience with vanilla private servers, and he said that his warrior has been dealing a lot more damage compared to his warriors on private servers so there definitely seems to be a difference in armor values as well. 
---
We might know a little better if a) Blizzard raises the level cap and b) beta players attempt higher level dungeons (like SM right now with level 30s). If a group of level 30s can do SM Arms or even Library, then yeah something might be wrong.
---
Yes but it will do even better today with them.
---
This sub is crazy toxic. Seeing the posts about any other topic on here over the last week, it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that these same people are all crying and making threads saying ‚ÄúoMg why GiVe strEamErs bEta BuT not mE I DeServE it‚Äù
---
I started in 2004 and I am not in. These threads are stupid
---
He would only need 50% damage reduction in one clip and 0% in the other for this to explain it.
---
Nice :) Proud of you :) Good job :)
---
It basically functions as a button that turns your run off, sound your character and moved back a tiny bit. I had rebound it a long time ago, but honestly I may find a bind for it somewhere again
---
That's also true. We were usually underlevelled in DM I think.
---
A better experience even, the classic beta is more bugged than private servers.
---
The paladin in 2nd video im sure is level 32 ?
---
False. PVE tank troll is bis because zerking threat generation. Orc is best for dps.
---
Found out about him today. Subbed too he‚Äôs great
---
A video from 2015 drood tank getting hit by 70-80 dmg, asmongold taking 30-40 dmg. I said 2015, after WoW changed a lot!
---
Come on guys, stop trying to make BfA better bashing on Vanilla. This is getting ridiculous, what you gonna do? remove all youtube videos.
---
Btw, Asmongold is so full of shit...
---
Good healers makes that possible.
---
It should really be lvl 17-22 given van cleef is like level 24
---
I missed so so much from this game by playing with sounds off and my own music
---
That's a very narrow fetish.
---
100% sure they would at least have given a heads up since it would avoid a ton of bug reports about mobs hitting like nerf darts
---
No. Low level dungeons were always a breeze as long as you didn't pull extra groups, the tank built sufficient threat, the healer did their jobs, and dps reapplied CC when needed. 
---
Some instances or pulls were harder than others, but that is why you planned ahead and brought classes with the necessary utility to handle said pulls.
---
I'll admit I haven't watched any streams yet and honestly I'm not too interested in seeing how the low level stuff is balanced. Once people are 60 and gearing up then I'll see how the difficult is being handled. 
---
A lo of people seem to forget that low level/leveling in general wasn't difficult or hard, it just took time.
---
If this is intended it will change a lot for hunter cause there was a reason to choose determined pets over other in vanilla.
---
I always found this sub to be very toxic towards new people who don‚Äôt accept classic as the holy grail of gaming, and just want to try it. But there are nice people as well ;)
---
He actually is in the top .1% of people who actually played vanilla beta. So to say he‚Äôs not special isn‚Äôt true.
---
OP is a statistical outlier and should be given a beta invite.
---
retuning the game for a build is a change that itself could bring bugs. i work in QA for video games and this would be a very dumb idea, especially if they told no one, because then testers would waste their time on all of this and any bugs the retuning could cause.
---
I mean yeah, but that is never ever going to happen. We just have to hope blizzard actually tests stuff properly. Some video of their reference client might help.
---
Yes and many players were objecting to those changes and Blizzard just didn't care.
---
There are actually dozens of us.
---
Sick bro
---
Because I want to play and I'm a big baby
---
Thank god with the beta there is actual new content related to classic and we dont have to listen to the private server bitches complain. Im out, boys.
---
I thought I was going insane, well played
---
McConnell is best
---
its annoying that having played on a private server makes some people just complitely ignore the whole argument
---
The 8.2 PTR is live right now and doesn‚Äôt require a subscription.
---
The attack speed is the same (or at least as close to the same as we can tell counting hits in a video.) Make sure you count the actual damages instances on his portrait, not the swing animations. The animations are slow but the damage swings seem properly timed.
---
There's too much fan art for my liking, but /r/wow is still a better sub to discuss classic wow than this shit hole.
---
Oh really! Any idea which one?  
---
It shouldnt be that way, in the original vanilla wow there were no phasing of any kind. If a player existed on your server he would always be visible if you were close enough. In that particular clip both sides should have been able to see eachother waaaaay earlier.
---
Jeez man, for you to jump to that conclusion really shows how you think. Im not a champion for any big streamer, in fact I think its the small ones that are genuine good people that get backlash they dont deserve because people like yourself group and generalize their criticism unjustly.
---
Lol this Guy is totally delusional.. ‚ÄùWow was fun and amazing until a swarm of 12 year old kids and twitch streamers just came out of nowhere and ruined everything‚Äù
---
Did you actually read my post?
---
[No, this is Patrick](https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyanh1Fpaw1qbhzi6o2_500.gif)
---
An example of why you shouldnt judge before trying out something.
---
If by chanse someone here from later expansions don't know who Kungen is, It's a Swedish Vanilla and TBC Warrior Tank and GM of Nihilum with several first's. He came back for a little while to heavily promote vanilla during the critical times before going offline again.
---
Once you get crit healing gear on your paladin they'll be unparalleled tank healers because you can just spam flash heal without running oom through Illumination talent.

RECOUNT
---
I found this list last night:
---
[https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/)
---
It's odd to me since it seems like CC was a big part of vanilla from what i recall, especially sheep and sap. If mobs did so little damage I'm surprised that that was even a thing.
---
what an idiot
---
What are Blizzard supposed to do if in fact the numbers are perfectly fine and players are forgetting vanilla's actual damage value, or misjudging the values based on faulty data from private servers? That's on the players, not Blizzard. 
---
The numbers might be wrong, but we the players have little evidence to suggest either way.
---
No thanks munchkin
---
One bad thing about pally and warlock mounts is that they can be counterspelled.
---
Maybe you/others sure heard more or just discovered the private servers during WoD, when you lost interest in the official game - but that doesn't automatically means that it's during WoD that the private servers were more popular. I was playing in different private servers between 2004 and 2006 (and so were many of my irl friends), so that was before I even stepped into the original Vanilla - private servers were insanely popular from vanilla up to today, in each expansion, regardless of how that year's wow xpac was perceived as good or bad. On the contrary, I actually believe the private servers were starting to decline in terms of popularity as the time passed, this meaning that they were more popular back in 2005 than they were in WoD.
---
There were literally hundreds (more than 1000 probably) of private servers in 2005 (that was significantly more than the number of official realms) - there were many websites that were keeping lists of the private servers; I remember there was a romanian website that had more than 30 romanian private servers - that was insanely huge as a number, for a country that has no official support of the game - currently there's less private servers and they're even split between different expansions (there's vanilla private servers, TBC private servers, WotLK private servers and so on and also there are custom things like "max player level 255", "20x faster XP rate" etc).
---
Same rules govern the private servers today as they ruled in 2004: they're free, playing there means you're ok with the idea that your chars will be deleted at some point (that's certain, it's just unknown when) and the game is often bugged/some things don't work as they should. People play it mostly because it's free or different than the current live wow. I'm certain that if someone would release a good private server for BfA, a ton of ppl will play there, just because it's free.
---
I don‚Äôt care for streamers if they truly get people farming stuff for them and waiting on them hand-and-foot.
---
If a streamer is:
---
1. Kind (not a troll)
---
2. Knowledgeable or Entertaining
---
3. And not exploitative of the community
---
Then I have no issue.  Just be a good human being and I can‚Äôt complain.
---
Stay safe summons people into SM cath in the alpha while asking his chat "I can't remember if it was like this in vanilla".  What kind of vanilla lock player doesn't know they have to go outside the instance to summon in vanilla...
---
Wow this guy is such an egotistical attention whore. I gotta watch his stream just to see how bad it is and hope he fails. That‚Äôll show him
---
I'm jealous, enjoy!
---
that is absurd. grow up.
---
The thing is yes it is a beta and they want to test the game but its 2019... companies use beta test as an advertisment for their product so they gonna invite the famous twitch streamers knowing that lot of them dont give a fuck about testing the game. Sadly the time when a beta is an actual beta is far in the past now for most big comanies.
---
hoard\*  
---
Easy slip to make on this sub-Reddit, I get that.   \~\_\^
---
Tl;dr If your wishes doesn't match mine and you haven't been invited it's because you're toxic.
---
And what about this? They clearly knew the limitations of the system they were using and took regular backups instead of relying on version control like for the source code. Version controlling a database is not trivial, so it's understandable that they didn't have it set up from the get go.
---
I don't think any of the mountain dews "dew" that except for maybe the diet ones.
---
He‚Äôs not though. I was watching a Druid stream yesterday as feral. He consistently pulled 3 mobs and almost died each pull. He used all his abilities, bear form, head, kiting, potions, ect but still was lingering between 3%-10% hp before he killed the mobs. Those mobs were on average 5-6 levels lower than the streamer. A mage will get rocked if he pulls 3 mobs and doesn‚Äôt play it right with sheep and roots. Mages are ridiculously squishy so if it‚Äôs 3 casters he likely will be in trouble.
---
Blizz is never going to reference private servers, even if that statement applies to them as well
---
Literally only butt hurt for content purposes lol. I'm stuck about talking to my 15-20 viewers about classic but not able to test anything with them.
---
The beta is just more work guys. If you play and dont report bugs your not doing it right. I know I will get downvotes and salt for this but I am perfectly fine with waiting for release. Besides that grind is a burn out, I dont really want to do it just to get wiped characters. 
---
That said I really appreciate the brave souls who ate doing good work and making this version better for the rest of us.
---
It was not a feature.
---
Well.. There was no streaming in vanilla and blizzard should not allow streaming in classic wow because of that. but that's just my opinion.
---
They've already confirmed it's a bug. Not sure if they also confirmed it has nothing to do with layering.
---
Check the forums, everyone after the streamer wave has been people who have played with day one accounts etc.
---
Certainly with BFA beta I got an email like a week after I noticed I had beta in the launcher.
---
Every big poll I‚Äôve seen over the last 6 months has had shaman top 3 for horde.
---
Nobody will be hitting 60 and gearing up, that‚Äôs not in beta. 
---
I never said dungeons were very difficult, but I certainly don‚Äôt remember them being faceroll content
---
Spell damage*
---
lol how is that an argument? cant i critique a basketball player for playing poorly because im not better than him?
---
To be fair, there are actually reasons for people to avoid playing on a streamer realm and we are free to avoid them if we want.
---
I was watching Asmon stream that deadmines run and it just felt like the damage the elites were doing to him was so very very low. I have no proof, but there seems to be something going on with damage values.
---
Levelling: Great   
---
Raiding: Great, healer mainly; chance of being the dedicated Shadow Priest.
---
PvP: Great. As all three specs.
---
Priest were definitely one of the more finished classes.
---
Everyone knows it‚Äôs too easy right now; but blizzard isn‚Äôt going to fix it.
---
Hope they do fix it, though.
---
I wonder how mob/boss position's will be affected. For example firemaw positions might be either way easier or impossibly hard for a tauren tank.
---
i realised when the elites are grey ^^
---
Were you watching Asmongold twitch while he was doing SFK an hours ago or so? I'm just asking because what you described is pretty much what was happening on his Stream, they were pulling tons of yellow mobs at the same time in SFK, he wasn't using shield block, people weren't CC'ing anything and it seems super easy. His HP even without heals was barely moving. It was super odd.
---
Or private servers got damage values horrendously wrong, or the playerbase has broadly forgotten damage values from a game none of us have played in fourteen years? 
---
I'm not saying the damage values *aren't* incorrect on some level, but that we (the players) have next to no evidence to confirm the values either way. Blizzard has far better data than us, including an actual 1.12.1 database. If the numbers are wrong, they'll let us know.
---
I haven‚Äôt read anything about people bitching about new players but I would personally welcome them! I was there for vanilla but I‚Äôd love a good sense of community again. I will probably start a fun guild and help lots of newbies there.
---
&gt;NPCs which offer multiple quests may inconsistently display them as a dot or a ‚Äú!‚Äù on the available quests list. They were inconsistent in 1.12, and we‚Äôve reproduced the exact inconsistency they had back then.
---
Lol amazing
---
Really depends on the market.  
---
The best way to make real good money i guess would be to make long-term investments.  
---
Get shit people will need down the line early by buying the herbs/resist gear/different school of absorb magic potions/whatever for cheap, when they are not as commonly used, and reselling when shit releases.  
---
Example; Untill AQ, hoard nature resist gear and make nature protection potions. When AQ releases make profit.   
---
Im not sure this is always effective though, so spend your gold and time wisely! Do more research :D
---
It used to be really nice when it was smaller, like around 15k, at 30k it started to change a little and then it was all downhill from there imo
---
He‚Äôs 20
---
I'm asking you to not interact with the negative there is plenty positive discussion to take part in. ü§î
---
i mean, back then top raiding guilds used their position in the community to get people to farm the war effort mats for them, is that really any different?
---
that's the power of boomers.
---
While there is definitely some weirdly tuned and coded shit on pservers, it seems like the general public here wants to pretend that pservers are easymode funservers just to discredit anyone who has played them.
---
But they do
---
Not sure what this means. At the end of the day the entire game can be cleared without anyone having TF, tank or otherwise. Therefore, if the guilds manages to get one, it should go to the person most dedicated to said guild, no?
---
classic patch is based on 7.3.5 tho isn't it? Or something like it so maybe something with that (since 2.0 is technically included there) or something? Idk
---
I think this might be true, theres certain animals in Vanilla that are stupid OP, like a wolf that does shadow damage and I think a cat that attacks super fast in the barrens? Can't provide source as WoWhead and such are blocked at work. I think blizz fixed that as that stuff was sort of OP.
---
Okay, so you didn't read my post.
---
The problem is the negative is seeping into every aspect of the community. Which is what I mean by "essentially asking me not to participate."
---
Hi, /u/Rgsolver
---
I don't give a shit about Nost, they didn't create the game. Unpopular opinion? Sure. But I'm a blizzard fan, not a nost fan.
---
I 100% agree.
---
I can‚Äôt understand people who are like ‚ÄùVanilla was an amazing experience when i played it as a kid, i dont want kids who are that age now to play it and experience the same thing though.‚Äù
---
YES YES YES
---
Why has it become meta to use thumbnails like that. I get that fortnite people use it to appeal to children but classic wow????
---
This isn't my idea I came across it in another post, but it would be to follow the life cycle of Vanilla, BC, and Wrath. Doing a server wipe, then starting at Vanilla again. 
---
As that covers almost 6 years who knows if there would be enough sustained interest to make that financially viable or if that is even something Blizzard would consider doing.
---
I remember yoinking it once on my rogue alt when I was trying to reroll before BC.
---
"around your level" they were 25 pulling level 19s
---
Glad it's a bit easier though, less frustration. I'm all for the **NO CHANGES** when it comes to the lore etc, but I think we can all agree that it would feel awesome to just pwn these mobs/dungeons/raids rather than feeling like a weakling. We're playing through this story as th√© hero/legend; not as peons. If I wanted a difficult game, I'd play Dark Souls (and hint: I would never even try that game).
---
edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger :)
---
This sub needs proper moderation. I swear at this point most of the posts about streamers / content creators is a pure witch hunting.
---
I subscribed here because I love the game, I love reading about it and I truly want others to enjoy it the same way I did 14 years ago. But fuck me why do I have to get through 10-15 posts from bitter shitheads to read something actually informative?
---
And the beta invites, oh gosh. People who didn't get invited behave like they were not invited to an actual game release. Chill the fuck out, you are acting like little kids who didn't get their candy. You didn't get invite ? Too bad . Is this a reason to hate on specific person who was lucky to get an invite ? No it is not
---
Same here, hoping I don't randomly run into Unge or Gronkh.
---
As someone who mained a hunter in Vanilla from day one I can say for a fact you either didn't play or are just a troll because one of Hunters worst fears was a rogue especially one with engineering. All they need to do is deadzone you which is really easy to do with crippling poison and the amount of stuns/incapacitates they have. Not to mention one with engineering can make you Frost trap yourself which is them just toying with you at that point.
---
That's what drives me nuts about a lot of bug reports. A single declarative sentence often doesn't tell you the bug. There should be at least two parts to every bug report: what you saw, and what you expected to see. Here, obviously, the expectation was both unstated and incorrect.
---
Thanks for the thorough reply! I guess when I was talking about mobility I meant in combat. Like mages have blink, warriors and druids charge, hunters slow and kite, etc.
---
I dont hate the guy, but its ridicilous how they arent letting in more people for actual beta testing, like why take in any1 who hasnt played vanilla (or tbc) ? how will they help? many are there just to play vanilla not to beta test.
---
Take some vacation time bro
---
They lost it, they lost SC, they lost this too. Anything you heard to the contrary is PR.  I have no idea why you or anyone on this sub is so stoked to trust a company with a recent track record like ATVI.
---
Monday 26th 11pm for UK too
---
Some live the life
---
probably because 99 percent of this thread is just salty neckbeards mad they didn't get in but he did. But's streamed thousands of hours of wow, got rank 1 mythic parses and streamed mythic progression. Why wouldn't blizzard want someone like this in their closed beta? No one on this sub has any self awareness apparently.
---
The mob damage in bfd is similiar to the levels of bfa mobs. The turtles specifically are hitting asmon for 14 damage. I remember those mobs killing the group with ease. Idk where blizzard got their values, but it's definitely not right.
---
Guys I don‚Äôt play gnome but someone PLEASE take advantage of this great name I thought of - Gnomechomsky
---
Glad im on EU servers.
---
I agree with both arguments and I think we‚Äôre actually on the same page. This started with me simply saying to stop whining because at the end of the day Blizzard isn‚Äôt just going to grant Beta to everyone who ‚Äúdeserves it.‚Äù  Yes I agree it would be dope to have OGs playing right now but there‚Äôs nothing you can do. 
---
Also, I agree with dude below saying it happened (slowly) being the key term. This is true through WotLK in my opinion. Added flying mounts, few bits and pieces of heirlooms, but regardless the content was still there and most people I know who loved classic and bc - also enjoyed wotlk. I personally believe Cata-Now is when the game actually sacrificed its soul for micro-transactions and it actually became unplayable. Not only did they cater to casuals and water everything down but the content just simply wasn‚Äôt enticing. The world wasn‚Äôt even fun to be in. 
---
I would‚Äôve voiced my opinion more about the direction the game was moving back then but I‚Äôm 23 now and started playing at the end of classic when I was what, 9? A lot of us who started as kids back then just played.. was still better than a lot of the other crap that was coming out. Who‚Äôs to say we would‚Äôve even curved the direction the game went in having voiced our opinions more anyhow :p
---
Gnoll lives matter!
---
I played on a US server back in vanilla and it as always referred to as DM, I‚Äôm not sure why those other servers called it VC.
---
It's my fucking house

Here is an example of mobs that do the same damage.

The void is lvl 10 in both clips and joana is lvl 11. Interesting.
---
I mostly don't care cause I'm on EU
---
Why do you give a shit? You aren't being forced to watch them. It's also not inherent that because they didn't exist back in "your day" that they don't have a place in the modern landscape. If you don't like streamers, don't watch them. I know I don't.
---
Ikr, at this point this sub just believes what i wants to believe.
---
I thought the same thing considering the multi pulls that normally were a death sentence.
---
Then I watched as Vancleef turned him into swiss cheese like normal.
---
It makes me wonder if elite mobs have correct values and normal mobs don't.
---
Influencers ;)
---
Wow Ethan great moves
---
Unarmored?
---
Not in BFD they're pulling packs of lvl 24's right now.
---
&gt;Stay safe summons people into SM cath in the alpha while asking his chat "I can't remember if it was like this in vanilla".  What kind of vanilla lock player doesn't know they have to go outside the instance to summon in vanilla...
---
This isn't a community. It's a toxic hellhole.
---
I'm guessing it happened to still be there when they ported it over to the modern client and they saw no reason to fix it.
---
Strawmanning the idea that criticism of streamers is always unjustified is just dismissive and lame.
---
There's nothing wrong with feeling that streamers are sometimes going to make the classic experience worse with their influence.
---
DrDisrespect would cry in front of a 13yo kid talking about his feeling. he is acting when he's the tough guy.
---
Asmon would laugh at the same kid and delete some loot he just got. He's not acting.
---
I'm looking forward to trying my best to be a force for good (for my own faction). One of the most exciting things about Classic for me is that I'm going to be constantly playing with the same group of people. Interpersonal relations matter a lot, being well known for both good and negative actions is a big deal.
---
Good thing you can go watch Joana's videos it it shows mobs only doing 2-3 damage per hit. But why use facts huh? Your 13 year old memory is 100% correct.
---
Oh it is. I'm not saying that the toxicity on this sub is justified, I'm just saying they aren't shitting on everyone who happens to stream. The hate seems to be targeted at people who may not be the "best" beta testers. Like for example Tip (who's only played on private servers since classic was announced) vs Joana, who's been a classic speedrunner since classic. 
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
That's not what a circle jerk is lol.
---
He's just 1/5 Classic streamers that are actually entertaining. Everyone else either never talks or is flat out boring.
---
Many of the people who loved the older versions of wow subscribed to it for years.  They have spent hundreds, if not thousands on the game.  Classic is being released again primarily for them to return again and enjoy.  To not even consider these players for invites to the beta because they do not like the current game is insulting to them and rightly so.
---
an overwhelming number of people believe layering was implemented to \*improve\* the player experience
---
I want to stab my eyes out talking to some of them
---
What a fucking tool.
---
Haven't seen one of these posts lately so I thought I'd get one going.
---
Personally, I am looking forward to running through Uldaman again. One of my favorite instances ever with an amazing feel to it.
---
A close second is Maraudon.
---
I was in the Beta for Vanilla release, TBC, Wrath, Cataclysm, Alpha/Beta for MoP and WoD, Legion beta, BfA Alpha/Beta. I do my due diligence to bug report things descriptively. I have prior experience doing QA for AAA games, am a programmer myself, and contributor to open source (diligently report bugs I encounter in my software to relevant bug trackers, pull request code changes, etc).
---
None of which I've ever wanted to play in more than Classic beta :(
---
I have to admit that when Nostalrius announced that they would shut down the servers and started to talk about how they should find a way to make the project happen legally, i had absolutely no faith in that. I was really frustrated that they would give up the project so easily and working with the assholes at blizzard after the "you think you do but you don't" was just impossible. 
---
Well they made the impossible happen and dam i so happy i was wrong!
---
saw staysafe reporting some bugs but I guess that goes against streamer hate, continue on
---
People have replied in this sub and pulled up old vanilla videos - the numbers aren't high enough.
---
Forgot to add in the part where his class fantasy has no place in Vanilla so he needs to level a different toon
---
The creature respawn thing is definitely private server players used to dynamic respawns reporting it, but they don't mention that for obvious reasons.
---
Hey man, this is crazy interesting information. Do you have anywhere I can learn more on the dwarf female vs male jumps?
---
I'm just amused when I see people get mad at comments like this while saying the same shit about retail.
---
&gt; ...how are they not the Warrior masterrace?
---
Pfft, implying they ever weren't.
---
B I G B O Y E S represent
---
Because all you kiddies who didn‚Äôt play back then think they know everything there is know about classic because you played a private sever. When we were fucking bitchs and trolls while you were still shitting your pants, basically your ‚ÄúWOW generation‚Äù thinks it‚Äôs more badass than really is and are gonna QQ so much in classic because it‚Äôs way harder than retail or private.
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/18695100881
---
Armor at that point in the game has a much smaller impact than you think.
---
A hunter at that level is unlikely to be outside of the 100-200 armor range, with 100 being \~10% damage reduction and 200 being \~18%.
---
Even if he was somehow decked out at 300 armor, it would be nowhere near enough to consistently reduce the damage by such a huge amount.
---
Drama is definitely the wrong word. Maybe if someone can point to a post that explains the sharding and server issues that people are worried about.
---
yes, those guilds earned their place within the dynamic of the server. those guids are not 1 person with thousands of followers.

This actually made me laugh out loud for about 15 seconds.

DWARF PRIEST HAS FEAR WARD DWARF PRIEST IS ALWAYS BETTER

God why do people put music like that in their videos. Just use the game music.
---
The streamer biz is all about how people are upset that streamers get access to beta first basically. While I don't agree that this should be the case, I can see why, it's huge for marketing, and absence makes the heart grow fonder and all that shiz.
---
People (Including me) are also upset that streamers will be rolling on seemingly random servers and destroy the economy and feel of that particular server. It will be really hard to choose a server where there is no streamers.
---
Some problems that you often encounter while playing on the same server as a streamer is as follows:
---
\*Increased queue times both in Battlegrounds and log in queues.
---
\*Economy collapse due to the fact that people farm gold, boes and more just to get on the good side of the streamer.
---
\*Streamer communities brigading on people who they thought 'wronged' their precious streamer.
---
\*Extreme faction imbalance.
---
\*No room for infamous and famous 'normal' people, only the streamer will matter.
---
That's some points I can think of on the top of my head. But there's probably tons more.
---
I hope that this helps you out!
---
We're all boomers now.

what a blast to the past
---
i remember my first character was a tauren and i remember those kodos were such a goal to be able to kill
---
cheers
---
Most likely explanation is that they dont have the actual vanilla values. For years Blizzard claimed, as a prime reason against Classic servers, that they DO NOT HAVE THE DATA AND NO WAY TO RESTORE IT. Now, all of a sudden, they have all the values? I doubt it. They probably have the Wotlk values.
---
Step one: Stun hunter (hunter uses wrath)
---
Step two: Vanish/sprint away and wait for wrath to end
---
Step three: Kill hunter
---
Believe me I mained a hunter all through Vanilla and rogue were the bane of my existence. I remember constantly looking up ways to stand a chance against a good rogue but ultimately it was just that having a chance. Most fights a good rogue beats a good hunter.
---
Toxicity and gaming go hand in hand. Look at league of legends and how well it went for them trying to purge the game of "toxic" players. Google riot Lyte.

He had a pain in the cervical (neck) and got a surgery. He got depressed probably because he lost his light with WoW. I know that he broke up with his at the time girlfriend because of this downward spiral
---
Yikes. Don‚Äôt do that. If someone upsets you just ignore them. Consider being nicer to people.
---
You don't need to "rest" at lower levels, you can just use your hp regen while running to the next, or heal up and regen mana during the fight.
---
\*Will only last for a month or two.
---
well that answers the question.
---
This seems to just be the WoW "community" in general. This game have never had a very good community but damn it's gotten worse. And honestly, some of the worst in this community is what I like to call the "vanilla puritans".
---
I don't even know why they want it. I'm hyped as hell for classic and there is no way in hell I'm playing the beta. I wanna log in day one with absolutely no burnout from levelling.
---
Outside of the level 6 zones on a warrior. Yes. That's why food/bandages were so essential in vanilla for a warrior. Classes with a heal not as much.
---
the reason theyre going with layering instead of sharding is because layering will allow every server to have a healthy population after the hype dies down and people start to stop playing. it has nothing to do with having low competition for mobs or anything like that. layering just allows them to overpopulate realms so that two months after launch youre not left with only a few hundred people on your server and it becomes dead, because that was a big concern for people to not want to end up on a dead server after people quit. it also helps lower login queues on launch.
---
This is getting out of hand
---
Hey retard,
---
did you see this: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq5rxj/can_someone_explain_this_discrepancy_in_mob/?
---
seems the data is fucked after all.
---
=)
---
Par for the course for Blizzard, they love to release games on Mon/Tues
---
Wow just wow.... I wonder how many bug reports they get are legit? Like 1 out of 10? They should have made it where they only give out beta invites to accounts that were active in vanilla.
---
Original wow client has so many disadvantages it's truly impossible to be used:
---
1.  old code, noone can check million lines of codes to see if they need to be updated or not
---
2. they're having dozens of programmers that made tens of thousand of code changes over these 15 years to the **live** client that it's absolutely impossibe to re-add those tens of thousand changes back to the original client just for WoW Classic
---
3. together with #2, they changed several thousand bugs over the time, they can't release the original client with so many bugs to the players (this is quite obvious)
---
4. also together with #2 and #3 there were dozens of exploits known and fixed by Blizz since vanilla, so they could never release that client so ppl would be able to exploit so easy
---
5. the old client was written for the server architecture that Blizzard was running in 2004 - these days they use a competely different, cloud infrastructure, the old client would not be able to communicate at all with Blizzard's cloud (and obviously they would not go back to revive their old, very dated hardware server infrastructure)
---
6. old client has no support for modern OS, for modern CPUs, for modern GPUs, doesn't have support for high display resolutions, no 64 bit, also it was using DirectX 9, that thing is very outdated
---
7. old client does not know how to communicate to the current Blizzard authentication servers, also doesn't know how to communicate with the [battle.net](https://battle.net) desktop app
---
There's way, way more reasons - Blizz talked about more of them at last year's Blizzcon or in the interviews they've done these days to the press about WoW Classic.
---
Damn, rough.
---
Private servers are definitely overtuned. It'd be silly to suggest otherwise when Blizzard has a working 1.12.1 database and the numbers on private servers were based on old videos and the WoW bestiary. The question is whether the values on the beta are undertuned, and to what degree. The problem is we the players don't have access to the data Blizzard has, and can only rely on old videos and equally old memories.
---
its all online anyway...everybody has this option
---
Congrats, you let others influence you. They tell you they're influencing you, and you STILL fall for it.

Hi, /u/boba_jawn

But you are also more likely to be caught in AoE effects all the time.

Tauren will 100% be team play warriors while orcs will be better all around in 1v1 situations without support.
---
Monkeynews kites pretty much every fight against other melees, because of his superior 3.8 weapon against faster enemy swings.
---
Looking into it you might be right.  It's a massive difference.
---
It‚Äôs a ten man tho so only 5g :)
---
Calm down, it's just people who are annoyed about not getting beta access.
---
Have to admit it's quite annoying to not have access while you see streamers running around not looking for bugs and not reporting shit when they do find them.
---
I found this: https://youtu.be/PW_7UBK2_bY?t=390 so even in wrath of the lich king, these tigers were still hitting 6-7s, so even if there made changes in 1.12, they would've shown up here.
---
Yes, I have.
---
Attention Reddit. This is fake.  
---
The bottom right corner is supposed to say quit and on yours is blank. You gotta do better than that to pull the wool over my eyes buddy.... you have clearly just edited a private server screenshot to say classic.
---
any EU server is pretty safe. most EU streamers audience aint big enough to be an issue. the 50k+ viewer streamers are NA.
---
Yea idk why people are flaming Quinn for this. 
---
This likely is a actual bug. Fairly certain all starting items have at least 1 armor for normal slots. I would have reported this also. I‚Äôve found around 4-5 Bugs I‚Äôve submitted so far in beta. Nothing game breaking tho.
---
This assumes streamers report bugs, the evidence of this is low.
---
Speechcragt
---
This.  I can‚Äôt remember a time from launch to today where my guildies and I haven‚Äôt been on Vent, Teamspeak, Discord, or whatever voice chat we had at the time while at our PC even when we‚Äôre not in WoW.
---
Millions of people played during vanilla wow. Millions of people are not going to be invited into the beta.
---
Well that‚Äôs good. I guess I still cringe because all this time they‚Äôve had these negative thoughts about classic and even classic fans even they they‚Äôd never tried it until now... They relied on their 15+ year old memories of 2004 that much? Strange to me
---
Wow sub has the same hate towards Pservers
---
And thanks to pservers Classic is a reality
---
Yes, but 50% damage reduction is not possible to get as a Hunter at that level. You would need a Shield to even get close.
---
0% is also extremely unlikely as he'd have to be wearing no gear at all. Just admit the Beta is off already instead of coming up with a hundred different excuses as to why the damage is 3x as high in the original Video.
---
I'm still waiting on Leena Dunham and Amy Schumer to move to Canada after the 2016 election, but people are really bad at keeping their word.
---
Layering is just a horrible idea. It isnt the authentic classic experience.. and will feel different in the exact ways you noted. Mostly the economic impact of layers. Fairly disappointing
---
theres plenty of people who arent streamers in the beta, you just dont hear about them because theyre not a public figure
---
" Good Job, Dumbass!" - McConell
---
They kinda were with pocket heals, although I suspect Orc's stun resist is still better.
---
So?  This affects you in no way
---
Well a lot of streamers want to play on the same server, so hopefully it wont happen that much
---
There is no quitting WoW
---
How much of classic did Asmon really actually play? I only played 1.8 onwards, but at least I don't act like I know every little damn detail about the game. I never ran BFD even once, and I barely know certain dungeons such as Stockades (played Horde on PvP). But at least I don't act like my opinion on something in Vanilla is absolute truth and then proceed to mess up something that a lot of Vanilla players know about.
---
I love Esfand's response to people saying that Asmond should've been kicked for that. The answer is a resounding no. You don't kick people for honest mistakes like that in Vanilla because it's just plain rude. If they keep not listening to directions, sure you can consider it. But you should at least do like 3 corpse runs before considering. Plus, having no LFG and having to go to the city to find people and then get summoned back is a huge pain in the ass.
---
I mean if you didn't want to do this why did you pipe up with a "Sorry but warrior + healer is the best" Like if you don't care just shut up. Lol
---
I hope my 2 bug reports are supplemental to the tuning of this game. Also I'm not going past 15 :)
---
Ill just get 5 days off work. I still have to take care of my newborn but she will be more stable in a couple of months.
---
My wife is ok with me sperging out for a while as long as I don't expect her to do everything
---
I dont hate streamers
---
Hahaha I liked doing 2 at a time for sure
---
If you want to, you should roll tank.
---
Okay, but where did I or anyone else bring up Private Servers?
---
It's more of a case of turning an older game into a modern one. Games like the Final Fantasy 5/6 ports on Steam seemingly took the old game and transplanted it onto a modern engine too, along with some terribly done work to make it "HD".
---
Interesting find.  Can't tell what level that orc is, but interesting to see he has a shield too, so it's unlikely that armour is the relevant factor here.
---
Would be cool to have a graph of exp more kill based on level and average quest exp worth for the brackets.
---
we dont have "true nights" on beta, so it looks like no.
---
Wow, this is how you make a grown man cry.
---
Clearly you‚Äôve been away for a while. Don‚Äôt get your hopes up.
---
ok ? and your point beeing ?
---
If that happens then it's not vanilla you idiot.
---
Good thing he didn't have shield block on his bars
---
Why not, but or not hes at least participating in the beta and providing feedback. Asmon today mentioned he hasn't submitted any bugs and has just been playing.
---
Yeah this seems more like a bug than anything else. From what I've seen, some mobs are fine, others are not.
---
Watch any of the streamer videos, they're always hitting for 1
---
Why would there be little to no reason to open the AQ gates as soon as possible?
---
The signets were good farming, especially for reputation. Even if you never turned in a signet in some effort to slow progress so more scepters could be made, you're not going to stop the economy that followed from War Effort.
---
The first server had the gates open in 19 days. I'm excluding ALL of the time running around for various steps, but it's safe to say that adds significant time.
---
1. Kill Broodlord (1 day, assuming you have him on farm)
---
2. Collect fragments (at 10 secs per mob, this is 1000-1200 carapaces per hour, or ~30 hours of straight farming, assuming 9 hours for sleep and food, that's 2 days)
---
3. Farm dragonkin at the 4 portals, the first 3 fragments had less than 1% drop rate. Ashenvale and Feralas took about 1 hour each, Hinterlands took upwards of 10 hours, and the final fragment took a full raid team. So let's call it another day, but that's generous.
---
4. Another 40 man encounter, but let's lump this in with the previous day.
---
5. Complete BWL in 5 hours (1 day, assuming you have him on farm).
---
6. Complete Molten Core (and hope the goggles drop, 1 day)
---
7. 10-man encounter + a bit of farming.
---
8. 5-man encounter.
---
9. 15-man encounter
---
10. 5-man farming at a 4% drop rate.
---
11. More farming at 6% drop rate. (let's add all the above into 1 day, but again, that's generous).
---
12. Kill Onyxia.
---
13. Kill Broodlord again (let's assume 1 day for an Ony+BWL clear)
---
14. Clear MC again.
---
15. Another 20+ man raid encounter (let's assume 1 day for MC+Maws kill). Important to note that if another player accidentally loots the pages, you have to wait a week.
---
That's 8 days, most of which need to be raid nights. The fastest guild did it in 7 (Macabre on Mannoroth).
---
Assuming players are going to be as hardcore as they once were (and there's no reason to suggest otherwise), your guild will have ~20 days to fit in ~8 days of hardcore farming and raiding. I seriously doubt Blizzard is going to wait 5 months between MC and BWL launches and 6 months in between BWL and AQ launches, but let's assume they do.
---
Onyxia was first killed 69 days after launch. It'll take at least ~20 clears to outfit everyone with an Onyxia Scale Cloak, so that's 5 months. The first Nefarian kill was 77 days after launch (~8 months after first release), so that lines up just about perfectly, giving you 3 months (or 12 clears) to get Nefarian on farm.
---
To have a reasonable chance at banging the gong, your guild needs to have been raiding as soon as possible. At first glance, there wasn't a single guild across all realms that rang the gong that wasn't doing this.
---
Ringing the gong is not for casual guilds.
---
Good highlight. ‚ÄúJust kill them‚Äù he says.
---
I like pie
---
He did - this sub is just delusional with their streamer hate
---
Thank you! This will help explain why it's easy to level early.
---
The real answer is they want people from different back grounds, experiences, and expectations to provide feedback. They know the qualifications of your account and when you started playing, and they can correlate that with the type of bugs you submit.
---
How old are you?
---
Yeah but the problems lie deeper. Flasks are mandatory for raiding and anchor weed was rare as hell. Blizzard intended to reduce he banked gold of players that made huge amounts in previous expansions. As a player that started in Bfa and did not have the luxury of banked gold you literally had to grind absurd hours to get the needed equipment for raiding. And it did not feel rewarding unlike vanilla. Problems with bfa are emersion and a lot more. But not the amount of gold needed to repair/for anchor weed.
---
No, I just don't know what to tell someone who's simply so utterly wrong about something that I and most everyone else on this sub know for a fact.
---
I understand I'm making a blanket generalization here and probably sound like an ass but Twitch really is a cesspool and Fahrenheit 451 was right
---
AWESOME! Gonna use this to level up my Gnomie.

I think Dunkey in this video puts the opposite perspective into nice and eloquent words

Mouseover cast is fine. Being able to keep combo points is the real issue.

no one is stupid enough to think he is serious. but "lol its a persona" aint an excuse for everything.
---
just made an alt xmog vanilla gear and took a screenshot
---
This is dumb. Sure, cata made almost everything easier, but it isn't definitive proof. Better reasoning would be getting a video of someone actually running vanilla SFK and comparing the damage to the numbers in the beta.
---
Omar God!
---
Even if current retail sits at 2-4 million, which I think is an extremely low estimate, Classic launches with 2-4 million subs.  This makes it the biggest MMO out there, tied with retail, and that lets them claim they have the two biggest.
---
The internet was different in 2006
---
Who the fuck is that fat kid?
---
I agree. Classic/Vanilla excels at questing, immersion, and world interaction with other players of both alliances. To skip past all this is crazy imo. Once you hit 60, unless you're seriously raiding all the time, you'll be spending most of the time chatting, working on professions, showing off your gear/mounts, and farming.  Just my opinion.
---
I'm pretty sure it was on retail all the way to some WotLK, when the server lag was decreased. You can't just uncode it, but Blizzard using modern infrastructure fixes it.
---
We are talking about the beta, not the game itself. My point is that they are not being "excluded" from the game itself. They are in fact getting it entirely free as an add on. Testing during beta should be done by those with actual experience with the product. But by all means continue to be pissed off.
---
Oh shit, here we go.  Great find.
---
Can I have some money for the rune?
---
I don‚Äôt have time to watch a video right now. I am just saying OP should be nice to others.
---
At the start of the run he goes on this massive trip about how we only remember it being hard. Meanwhile hes pulling, like 8 mobs, and the group doesnt break a sweat. I'm not saying Vanilla is Mythic level hard, but that should've killed them, even if hes 25.
---
And this thread brings an interesting light on whether or not the numbers could actually be off? Im not sure why they would be though, since they have the old data.
---
Officially the global release is Tuesday but it's monday evening for us I guess. They always release on Tuesday, Evey game and expansion.
---
Mother of god.. no words.
---
I think this proves Asmo is lying about having played classic wow.
---
If memory serves I did find a little bit of info but it was related to a raid. Almost all anecdotal
---
Female alliance chars can jump in this little spot in BWL but males cannot. That's when i realized some jumps couldn't be done by males (at least on p servers and in that instance seemed to line up with vanilla)
---
Then through practice and asking other players I noticed being a dwarf seemed to make things much harder than let's say a NE female. 
---
I think both height and width matter, gnomes have the hardest time jumping corners for that reason. Sometimes you will see gnomes fail what are for other chars on p servers very easy jumps that involve jumping onto very small ledges or ramming urself into a corner and hopping up. 
---
All that is anecdotal from private servers. So it being on the legion client may subtlely change these things. The height thing always seemed weird to me in a tab targeting MMO. where height of your model doesn't matter outside the context of jumping. But that's how it worked
---
And there are ways to moph urself if u really wanna force something.
---
I woudln't worry about it too much until classic actually releases. I didn't bother, praying it will be different enough my dwarf male choice is equally viable with female
---
Haha yeah, I think pretty much the same way. To me the whole point of Classic release is to go back into the game i haven't experienced in years. Beta to me would in a way ruin the hype of the launch.
---
Yay me being unique, I guess? I'm not sure what you mean by accusations. Are you talking about my points, or the people I'm reacting to's points?
---
If you're talking about me reacting to stuff that doesn't exist, you just have to open the posts with negative votes, there's lots of "They're only doing classic to make money off of subs" people. Heck this very post brought out a few.
---
If you're talking about the points I made, I guess I don't agree with the circle jerk per default? I think that's mostly a good thing.
---
AoE effects like nova aren‚Äôt affected by the bigger model. Only targeted spells.
---
&gt; Saying that you shouldn't report a bug because you're unsure if it was intended or not, or if it was a bug at all, is just dumb, sorry.
---
"Boss fell thru the floor and didn't drop loot"
---
hmm but how do I know that's not by design? Better not submit this.
---
Actually, yes, as far as I remember you had to stop to eat / drink after every pull or every two pulls and people used heals during fights. People very rarely fought more than one mob at a time during leveling except warlocks and hunters of course.
---
Although most mobs seem to be like that on streams.
---
Quit now while you're not addicted.  Run.  Warn the others
---
If they thought it was going to be to slow/hard for modern audiences... There is a clear motive if it was done intentionally, but at this stage we cannot say that discrepancies like this are in fact intentional.
---
That'd be very nice.
---
well seeing how asmon is one of the biggest streamers in the world i think your opinion is in the minority
---
why would he lie about that? Its just been a long time for a lot of people...
---
I like pie. I like every kind of pie. I just want to eat all of them, but i can‚Äôt, can‚Äôt eat every pie.
---
&gt;I've never played this game before  
---
&gt;Hmm, that's weird - these boots have no stats  
---
&gt;I'll just google the name to verify before reporting  
---
&gt;Turns out it was intended!
---
Wow, what an enormous burden that intensive research was.
---
reddit is actually horrible for complaining. You generally get down vote really quickly which prevent you from being heard.
---
4chan is 10 times better in this aspect. Who cares if you are not being nice?
---
Being nice, telling people people that everything is ok and that you should have trust in a company that lost its soul a decades ago is what gave birth to the abortion that is current retail.
---
theres going to be so many new people all of the people who are toxic and gatekeep and whatnot will jsut be drowned out by the crazy number of new or returning players. if you wanna use this reddits sub count as a metric for how many toxic people there will be in classic, itd be around 100k, and classic will have millions of people playing, so the toxic players will be in the minority and theres a chance they actually end up gatekeeping themselves because people wont want to play with them.
---
Where is this quote from?

How is one rogue bowing out of a raid the guild has on farm screwing over the guild?

Dug out the official Brady Bestiary which is from TBC (Feb 2008) and it says damage range is 6-9

Hesistant to conclude anything other than that it would be great to know what Blizzard see on their 1.12 server.
---
He has repetitive strain injury.
---
Lol it wasn't even bad at all. Not looking forward to the PC bullshit again
---
I see, thanks. Quite interesting!
---
it's almost like you think the private server makers, who have been doing this for years, just made the numbers up rather than watching videos like this also.
---
Both videos Joana only has a spirit and stamina buff, and in both videos the levels of the NPC and player are the same. It's hard to tell since in the twitch clip Joana is kiting, but it looks like the harpies are attacking roughly at the same rate. Both are clips from Blizz classic.
---
I think this shows a clear difference in damage.
---
Here are quite a few overview/getting started resources:

---
So many people act like not KNOWING everything when it comes to classic and is a steamer should be ostracized...
---
Tired if all you kids getting butt-hurt
---
Yeah I'm agreeing here - a lot of those mobs I'm talking about are non elite
---
Generally its difficult to take like 5+ (depending on cc) especially at those lower levels
---
If you're in sw it's faster. If you're in Duskwood for example you're better of just flying
---
It's almost like blizzard has been launching games and patches every weekly reset for years. Weird.
---
No Private server in the last 4 years, even that "One Private Server that startet it all", haven't had Expose Armor stacking with Sunder Armor. The only stacking armor debuffs on private servers are the ones that people are almost 99% certain stacked in retail (since there are old wiki posts that allude to different armor reducing debuffs stacking and there being no diminishing returns on those effects). I'm talking about Curse of Recklessness (warlocks), Faerie Fire (druids) and the armor shatter effect from Annihilator (blacksmithing crafted weapon).   
---
Contrary to what's happened on The Big Private server and all of its successor servers, melee will likely be overall even stronger in Classic (this is NOT based on guesstimates or feeling, but hard math on values from abilities like Execute and Bloodthirst with and without Crusader procs).
---
Hence I called it useless, I never claimed it to be an accurate representation of time spent levelling in each bracket.
---
You only get feedback from one group of people then. This is not what testing is at all. You always want a white variety of people testing a product. It‚Äôs the over sensitive vanilla people that don‚Äôt seem to understand this.
---
faster with the tram the flight path is like 10 mins you wait for maybe 4 mins and then a 2 min ride

I think the tram is faster, but I usually take the flight so I can go do something for a few
---
Exactly.. like what? Not to mention kids are 10x sweatier than 30yr olds these days. Last time I checked kids are flooding esports and every other comp gaming scene. Kids might ruin barrens chat but they don‚Äôt ruin competitive integrity in games. If anything it‚Äôs the guy who works a 9-5 and doesn‚Äôt want to grind when he gets home so he whines about difficulty. Just my opinion
---
Explain how a beta tester reporting a non-bug has affected you (in a way other than you choosing to be upset/jealous for not being able to play the video game early)
---
They should put a statue of him in Stormwind. I can accept 1 change.
---
***Stop using the word "objectively" if you don't know what it means***
---
There is no such thing as "objectively better" or "objectively worse" *anything*. Ever. Period, end of story. Find another word.
---
Yes but to deny in a Beta that is proven to have regen issues, that there is no damage or crit problems (as Asmongold suggests not you), is completely ridiculous. 
---
I saw Asmongold tag a lvl 23 and a lvl 24 gnoll, and above their level he completely smashed them, no risk of death, Esfand didn't even need to heal him. 
---
He crit on the orange lvl 24, 2 times, a 189 and a 200 crit, and killed him effectively in three shots. In fact if you watch his stream, he crits pretty regularly and it shows that there something off with the numbers.
---
Millions of those people probably didn't log in during the 2 day window to opt in to the beta, though.
---
Brb, gonna go make 4 lv 20 toons

&gt; This is his stream persona

Oh lord I can't believe people watch these and actually volunteer their hard earned money. It blows my mind.

Was it really an angry wolf? Or was it perhaps just a mildly annoyed wolf?
---
Oh yeah and I realised I was thinking of the harpy video lower down in this thread and not the cat video anyway. Either way I don't think we can rule out the possibility that he's wearing shoddy gear in a speedrun video, just like we can't rule out the possibility that this is a bug.
---
The game is great but the fanbase is EXHAUSTING. would recommend not interacting with the community if its something you dont want to deal with. It's annoying, but it's just the way it be. And by the gods stay away from the barrens chat.
---
Enjoy dude ! Also, dwarf are the best üëåüèª
---
Exactly then we can get down to business. But blizz will never do this.
---
I honestly have no idea, but just logically thinking about it, wow is their product so they get to do what they want with it, if they wanted they could probably tell twitch to remove it from the platform altogether and there probably wouldnt be anything they could do about it. The way I see it anything wow is a registered brand, so it is their property.
---
Is the original version per enemy hit? That seems stronger than 1 chance per cast.
---
Yeah, now extend that thought process to thousands of interactions over countless hours of gameplay.
---
You can try this one as well

if you sub now you are eligible
---
I'm glad someone gets it. They said they have a working 1.12.1 database, so there's no reason to believe they couldn't just import the numbers from it. I think private servers are definitely overtuned, which has only muddled the discrepancy in values along with fuzzy memories of a (now) fourteen year old game. 
---
I've watched A LOT of beta streams, and overpulling definitely seems as deadly as it always was in Vanilla - outside of dungeons at least. The runs of Deadmines and SFK I've watched seemed trivial, but these are also low level dungeons. Dungeons don't become difficult in vanilla until Gnomeregan at the very earliest, with the difficult noticably ramping up in Uldaman. 
---
I definitely think players have overestimated the difficulty of Vanilla content, but we're also watching players level capped to 30. If Uldaman and Maraudon are also trivial then the undertuned argument gains a little bit more credibility.
---
if your argument is that because he's an arena player he's justified in his previous classic hate that just reinforces my point of what a selfish scumbag he is. are you some kind of advanced brainlet or something?
---
I just got clarification from support. You are eligible.
---
Well in that case you need to ask yourself, whilst distracted by the lovely Kodo did you perhaps accidentally step on the wolfs tail?
---
You're whining about being excluded from a closed beta. Omegalul, bud.
---
Definitely not misleading. The diagram is exactly what OP says it is.

Because losing 10% of your dps doesn't hurt?

This is a 2 day old vod for people saying he's late.

I don‚Äôt.  I would doubt if it‚Äôs below 3.5 honestly.  The game isn‚Äôt in a great place but it‚Äôs still WoW.
---
No, it's working as intended I'm afraid.

Right!? I didn‚Äôt expect to have that feeling of wonder again, but here I am!
---
48 is halfway to 60. We've found the new 92
---
&gt;and paladin won't be like that at endgame I am sure.
---
Ha.  Haha.  \*cries in Healer\*
---
aka you have no argument. cya
---
I agree with this!
---
The last boss is 26, so really everyone should be 22+. And the first half will be green because of that.
---
TBC dumpstered player interaction, pacing and monster/pvp tension with flying mounts, made PvP a competitive squad-based endeavour instead of something naturally occurring.
---
It was also the first piece of content that invalidated earlier content - the leveling zones were no longer well-designed zones with various purposes, filled with an organic mix of high levels and low levels - none of the pre-TBC materials mattered to high-level players, and there was no reason to do any end-game content released prior to TBC.
---
On top of that, it removed a large part of faction identity - with a hilariously clumsy introduction of paladins/shamans to both sides - removing the one truly defining class for each side.
---
TBC was a fun expansion, but stop pretending that your opinion is objective. There's a reason that we specifically wanted vanilla, and not vanilla+TBC.
---
First, thank you for the detailed and constructive post, I enjoyed reading it.
---
Second, I disagree. Everything, especially Ony, is going to die faster because of all the knowledge. And you don't need that many Ony cloaks, hiding from that oneshot ability behind the throne is Blizzlike.
---
First server did it in 19 days for server pride. There were servers that had AQ gates closed for months so Blizz had to fuel the War Effort server-side (N% a week after M weeks). On these servers, given all the knowledge we have, I expect dozens of AQ bugs - including maybe one in a semi-casual guild.
---
Didnt they say you can make 3 names per realm or some such? Seems like you'll have a solid couple weeks to preplan and scout your server online for streamer talk.

For someone who levels a warrior and has never done so I'm sure those people will get frustrated around lvl 20 to 30 and pick an easily accessible class. I'm not sure you understand how hard and slow and tedious it is to level a warrior in vanilla. I've done it and I've contemplated just going with something with cc or a pet or heals or something in the kit that lends to solo play. Veteran players don't even like to level warriors.
---

Be sure to read the edit.
---
First thing I went to look for myself. Although seeing as it's not a 5 man I can see it not being included.
---
The OP posted a video showing the difference in damage values of **Durotar Tigers**, and somehow we can make the assumption that **all** damage values in the beta are wrong? 
---
The OP also later edited his post saying that the damage values on the tigers seem to be correct, so go figure.
---
Says the dude calling him a scum bag for not supporting a private server.
---
I'll add a way for users to use their own key configuration next.
---
The first person to ring the gong decides the 10 hour window to get the mount for everyone else on the server.
---
So you can see if there has been an agreement on when to hit it and someone just says fuck it, it could mean a lot of ppl not getting the mount. 
---
You need to do a lot of stuff after the gong is hit like clear BWL and kill some of the World Boss dragons amongst others. 
---
Hope that clears up a bit why this matters.
---
Hilarious mate haha
---
Because the majority of traction was coming from Classic and partly TBC, and now that they got an official realm coming up, there's little to no reason to stay there. You can tell because the most upvoted threads over there are news about the official classic server coming and the potential TBC/Wrath ones.  
---
Downvoting doesn't translate to toxicity either. Usually people just downvote people they disagree with.
---
The population of private servers isn't any more or less toxic than the retail population and any other kind of reddit (excluding subs like CJs that are meant to be that way)
---
I'm just not one to go and blame a certain group of people for the state of a sub. I've seen the private server peeps shoot some negative comments towards the retail players, and I've seen the OG vanilla people do the same towards players of private servers and also retail players.
---
There's not "the one group at fault" here, because literally every group in this sub has its vocal minorities that will act toxic towards the other ones.
---
Just a guess but they probably want to play the class they just said they want to play.
---
The attitude in game is the complete opposite. Don't let this subreddit reflect anything else.
---
IIRC Farsight was great in BGs to get a closer look at situations further away. It wasn't five feet, you could scope out pretty much anything in sight.
---
Not the case, the database labels as 2+, the MINIMUM is 2 and they all hit for 1
---
to be fair iv seen lots of long comments when people ask why the streamers get hate very thoroughly covering all the criticisms. there is no smoke without fire, if a large amount of this community dislike a streamer then there must be a reason for it. Like you said, all the people with reasons to dislike them are individuals, many are genuine, don't stereotype them all as just haters.
---
You realize they cant just copy and paste the data from their 1.12 client right? That's why they're having a 3 month long beta, to get this shit sorted out.
---
Sounds great, thanks :)
---
I played some dungeons during nostalrius and they weren't particularly hard.
---
Nothing wrong in that, but if he only cares about him getting it (quest line is long and hard to complete and only have 10 hours window for it) its gonna be pretty asshole move. But lets have faith in asmon.
---
&gt; I don't believe the experience was ever that easy being able to steamroll through trash.
---
I tanked it on a warrior and I think I only remember having problems in the big room with the adds, cause I could pretty much only tank one or two mobs at a time. I didn't watch their run, but it must have been pretty damn easy. I know private server values are off, but dungeons are extremely easy there too.
---
Decided to leave it out since it was a 15 man raid and then got dropped to a 10-man later on
---
That was true for a part of SFK, asmongold was level 24 i believe and the earlier part of the dungeon was lvl 19 and the later 22. For BFD they're around the same level with most mobs in that dungeon are 24.
---
As someone who worked in the industry: that's a big fat no, dawg.
---
That's why you see these companies only make moves when the teeth become too sharp and noise a bit too loud.
---
Motivation is always the bottom line. You'll find people who care in the lower ranks but they don't make decisions, only follow them.
---
I wanna be a hero from the start! I remember when I made my first WoW character back when I was like 7. I was charging through Worgen starting zone, one shotting everything. My health never moved below 90%, no matter how many I pulled. I felt like a **GOD**, the enemies feared me from day 1, I was destined fr greatness. That's what brought me into WoW. 
---
When I tried private servers, I was instantly turned off, because the game no longer feels like the WoW we all knew and loved back in the day. So I'm glad Blizzard are reducing the damage from 5 to 1 on these tigers &amp; everything else. Don't like it? Go play private servers- knock yourself out. Don't ruin classic, thanx ‚ô•
---
sure but the problem with the internet is that with anonymity people complain more, and more harshly
---
meanwhile the people who are content are not making any noise
---
so you just get an overwhelming density of the negative, which isn't representative of how everyone on the whole feels
---
"You need more xp the higher the level you are."

Why would this ever need explaining?

I felt like everything so lighthearted before the beta came out. Lmao

Graphics isn't gameplay.......................................
---
He didnt play that much in vanilla. He came in pretty late. But esfands comment is true that you didnt kick ppl because of stupid mistakes back then. it took way to long to replace them. You only got kicked if you ninja looted.
---
I really like the rock-paper-scissor aspect of Vanilla PvP. Combat was tuned more around BGs in which there was a mix of classes. Every class had at least one class that they were super effective against, and one that they weren't very effective to at all.
---
WTF Im gay now
---
&gt;The OP posted a video showing the difference in damage values of Durotar Tigers, and somehow we can make the assumption that all damage values in the beta are wrong?
---
It's a clear example with direct evidence of a mob on doing less damage on beta than it did in vanilla. You respond with irrelevant stuff about private servers that no one has brought up.
---
&gt;‚ÄãThe OP also later edited his post saying that the damage values on the tigers seem to be correct, so go figure.
---
He edited the post to say that in another video the damage seems to be ok. So sometimes it's wrong, sometimes it's correct. That's still an issue.
---
P servers apparently had the XP values quite off
---
So hopefully that alleviates the terrible upper 40's
---
Easily the worst bit of leveling
---
Thank you so much for this! I can't wait to play and revisit if Classic's good.
---
I think it depends on the class, gear, and level of the character. 
---
On my human paladin, I couldn't pull too much and had to heal or drink every so often. Usually after every 2nd pull. At level 11 it became more difficult, but I think that is because I only have like 2 greens. With better gear I assume I'd do much better.
---
On my NE druid, fuck, I struggled just starting out. You run OOM so fast and shit your level fucks you up. I'm only level 4 on that one and it's just not fun having to drink after every two pulls. 
---
On my gnome warlock, it's fucking eeeeeeasssssyyyyyyy. Nothing hurts me and shadowbolt spam is efficient until you get immolate and corruption at level 2. Then it becomes a fucking joke. I just dot a mob once and move to the next one. It doesn't always kill it (5-10% hp left), but when you get your pet, the pet takes care of it. 
---
So I just regularly dot one mob, then another and go on to my next part of the quest completely ignoring the ones I just pulled. I rarely go below 75% hp. Mana isn't really an issue either.
---
I assume that my paladin would get better if I had better gear, but that's hard to come by early on unless you go out and buy some from the AH. 
---
The druid I couldn't care to actually continue. It was too much work. 
---
Now obviously this is low level shit and there's 50 more levels to go, but the differences between these three is staggering. I would imagine that certain classes would get a huge benefit partnering with a friend while leveling.
---
"verdan the everliving hits way too hard."
---
Phenomenal video evidence was provided, in this case.
---
I also watched his stockades run and it was noticeably easy, like literally just steamrolling all mobs, bosses and barely needed any healing (even when he lost aggro and other party members were being hit).
---
I also watched Preach's RFC run and as level 15s they were able to pull upwards of 7 elite mobs in the busier rooms and barely took any damage. That's just impossible. They were able speed through the place without any downtime for mana, health etc... So. Something is defs not working right
---

---
actually taurens have slightly longer reach compared to other people able to hit them by slightly i mean like minuscule
---
Hey, up to you my man. I frankly have better things to do than go digging through all the old interviews and Blizzcon material to convince you. You'll find out that I wasn't lying sooner or later on your own anyway.
---
Thankfully the game will be out then for good or bad and there will be no reason to hang around here.

This is important for those who wish to get into the beta. GET THIS TO THE TOP, FRIENDS!

You're choosing to be upset

Wasn't this just fucking posted?

You can tell people 20 times from entering that room till klling the boss and they will STILL do it.

not gonna lie, i had a ton of fun wall jumping into random weird places.
---
Classic WoW is going to do well regardless of what the fuck happens on Reddit.
---
I've watched streamers report at least a dozen bugs in the couple of hours I've watched the beta. The evidence suggests you're making things up as you go
---
r/whoosh
---
Tell him he's missing a very special and essential part of the vanilla WoW experience by not playing on a PvP server. No hate to people who just want to play on a PvE one, but some of my most memorable moments in vanilla wow back in 2005 were due to many random encounters with the opposing faction out in the world where it feels like it actually matters. 
---
I personally don't think PvE servers create a different experience, but rather a subtracted one of a part of the game that's just not there anymore, RP servers on the other hand is different if that's your thing. but yeah do your best I wouldn't give up PvP server just for a friend lol not that I have any kek
---
No, they started make the classes homogenous in TBC. It's one of the reasons more specs became viable then.  
---
I remember having long discussions about it with my friends and guild. We were many that saw the path that they choose to take when it came to class-balance in TBC.
---
It would just be nice to get a blue post on all these ‚Äúnumber issues‚Äù to clear some things up. I guess they are still looking into it.
---
Hahaha this is amazing. Your insult, I mean. I want to hear more things you've told people please.
---
if anyone is trying to draw information from this, here's a rule of thumb that's more useful.  
---
lvl 31 = 25% complete  
---
lvl 41 = 50% complete  
---
lvl 51 = 75% complete  
---
in terms of playtime, give or take 1 level
---
Sounds like you risk him just quitting if you do that.
---
Yup. There's no way a group would've been able to deal with such huge pulls in a dungeon.
---
Esfand is fucking awesome. The guy is so humble
---
Don't, because eventually he'll resent it after he gets frustrated from getting killed too much
---
yeah, someone made a post about if people would watch a streamer that never played vanilla before and people were like, "ugh, i would *never* watch someone who doesn't know exactly what to do".
---
Sadly not :( Since it's against the ToA and ToS to give accounts away afaik. And there are no CD-keys this time either.
---
I'm well aware of that.
---
What's your point?
---
Changing the spawn rate on this one mob, in a populated zone, to get an item that itself has a low drop rate, isn't going to break anything. ***You wouldn't even notice it if they changed it***.
---
All it will do is help people actually do the quest rather than ignore it entirely, or grind out mobs to get where they need to be.
---
You mean the big nasty elites in Hellfire Peninsula? The same zone that Honor Hold is in? You weren't kiting mobs out of their zone.
---
It would not be within TOS. Only way would be to share your account
---
Agree 100%
---
Usually you are correct. But sometimes companies look more "long term". I can hope. :)
---
Just got one in my email keep looking boys!
---
Give it dark hair and it's my first toon, Stygger the Gnome Warlock!
---
Did they lose SC? Did they admit to losing most of vanilla?  Are you nuts or just a troll?
---
Who's whining? I'm replying to a thread in a civilized manner.  I spent several minutes intelligently writing a response to have an real conversation.  Instead I get one lines responses saying lol stop whining, seriously how old are you?
---
I think it's unlikely. They might piss off their viewers a little too much, they'll want to announce the event beforehand to make sure as many people as possible watch, and if they have more steamer friends on the same server they probably wouldn't fuck each other over.
---
Replying to your comment for visiblity.  I suspect this is indeed a glancing blow or level based issue.
---
Joana Old: 9-10 dmg Level 8 Mob hitting Level 9 player  
---
Joana new: 7-8 dmg Level 8 Mob hitting level 9 player  
---
There is a 5 dmg hit in joana's new stream, which I assume is a true level based glancing blow  (5 /0.75 =~ 7)
---
I don't know, I think it's fine. I was watching do SFK and he could easily pull 4-5 mobs at a time. I remember doing the same way back in the day when leveling my warrior.
---
As I have come to find out, it depends on the class. 
---
Warlocks can just steamroll through most things their level pulling multiple mobs at once with very little down time. 
---
Druids, eh, not so much.
---
Esfand even said earlier that his health regen is off, he said it's like he's eating food. I know that's not concrete evidence but I think we can all agree something feels funny here.
---
Also, theres a couple bugs. The curses werent spawning ghosts, Arugal wasnt teleporting.
---
Lmao get over yourself, you‚Äôre not special
---
Your handle is literally Captain Douche and you want to talk about cringe. lmao.
---
Yeah, you're right on that one. I misunderstood you.
---
But I do have memories of me kiting Teremus to SW up to the release of TBC. I did it the last week after the patch.
---
It won't happen. Too many of the design aspects from Vanilla were completely altered to get casual players to subscribe. They would lose more than they gain from "fixing" retail.
---
\&gt;Remember, this was NOT replicated on PServers
---
Completely wrong, this has been in effect on every single vanilla/tbc private server.
---
He's surprised - actually very surprised and actually that much surprised he even went the effort to submit a bug report. He's obviously clueless as to how vanilla wow has been.
---
There's no real good way to transcribe that...sound he makes. It's like a super inward gasp from the depths of his throat, and he does it twice. It's truly the greatest mystery of the entire video.
---
Hey, it's gotten better/worse(depends on who you are) since they stopped women from getting naked on twitch.
---
It's based on current live client so it's based on 8.x atm, it was 7.3.5 in the demo
---
He straight up charges Wolf master Nandos, and half the time clothies are tanking mobs. And those are all level 25. Not to mention, the healer barely breaks a sweat mana wise.
---
‚ÄúNice job, dumbass.‚Äù
---
Sure pm me an account lul
---
If they start doing it do you really think it would be one mob? People would notice and point out the difference. Just because you won't notice doesn't mean others won't either. The goal is authenticity, not improvement, not changes. Authenticity.
---
You want a more convenient version of WoW that caters to things like that? BfA is over there.
---
You spelled "Butt fuck me" wrong.
---
&gt; So it seems that the tigers on the beta are doing correct damage in this case. 
---
Cool thread about nothing. Blizzard has the data dudes. Outside of bugs (which should be vanishingly rare), this is all going to be private server inaccuracy + shoddy memories on our part. Unless you have video proof from vanilla that says otherwise, assume that you are remembering wrong.
---
there was a lag where if were basically standing inside of them coming from the front it would go off but not like shred works in bfa
---
&gt; So if he was using Shield Block it would be even easier.
---
It only blocks one attack. It's only really useful for proccing revenge. 
---
On aoe fights you're probably better off using your rage on spreading out your sunders, even if you have good aggro (unlikely).
---
That's my fetish
---
Really? Huh. I thought I read somewhere that the way stacking armor debuffs worked on private servers was significantly different to retail. You're right about melee likely being stronger overall; if Monkeynews intuition is right then armor values are in fact higher on private servers, and if armor debuffs work the same then melee stacking is going to be stronger than ever. The content will be even more trivial than it already is. 
---
I find that a little disappointing. I was hoping private servers got the numbers/mechanics fundamentally wrong so the endgame meta might be shaken up a little. I guess it's a good thing so many people roll Warriors and Rogues.
---
I bought and it is fantastic!
---
uh, it's exactly representative of the subreddit because it's the content that i'm seeing.
---
My uni studies conclude august 13th! Still gotta prep for exams, but essentially a vacation when classic launches. Am so lucky. Still i would have liked an actual summer release lol
---
why does that hunter have Dreadnaught?
---
Damn, if we use grand terms like THOUSANDS and COUNTLESS it really sounds like a lot of work to google a word when you encounter a (perceived) issue, doesn't it?
---
If you genuinely want to help out submitting bug reports for a game that you know nothing about, then double-check anything that is easily verifiable, instead of firing a confused machinegun filled with blanks at the devs.
---
This isn't about Asmongold, this is about the motherfucking +4 strength +4 stam leather belt and you will show respect to this item you little shit.
---
Your team got 3 and mine got 0. sadface
---
I pray that dwarf female does not have a tangible advantage. I hate them with all my heart, but the temptation would be there.
---
Crossing my fingers that you‚Äôll get access. Do you plan to stream?
---
That's no bug lol, that's how vanilla worked, gear at low levels only had armor. Just from this thing alone you can tell that Quin never played vanilla wow, he just compares it to what he knows from the current wow.
---
Think they‚Äôll brave pvp servers? I forsee 90% going PvE to avoid stream sniping. Hope not, I‚Äôd love these epic wpvp battles.
---
Wouldn't it be level 1, level 38, level 48, and level  54? 
---
Or am I missing something?
---
There sure are a lot of people on here that think private server automatically means "TRIPLE XP, DOUBLE GOLD, AUTO LEVEL 60".
---
I could never understand why people like this who haven't touched vanilla in 15 years say stuff like that without trying it. Then they play and and say oh look I'm having fun. Yeah no shit we told you.
---
&gt; I was kind of just playing the devil's advocate,
---
Playing devil's advocate would require you to put forth an actual counter position. 
---
Saying a catch phrase isn't it. 
---
&gt; Stat and balance changes are one thing
---
You must not have the pulse on this community at all. Stat and balance changes would make people lose their shit. 
---
Seriously, go suggest that you want druids to be on par with other dps specs and you will be eviscerated by this community. 
---
&gt; changing fundamental game mechanics like spawn rates is going to rustle some jimmies because that's effectively making it a different game.
---
The most contradictory shit that I see on this forum is statements like this, and then people getting excited about the developers potentially adding ***new content*** to the game that isn't an expansion. 
---
Whereas changing spawn rates on a low spawn mob ***in a highly populated zone*** is going to change absolutely nothing except how someone levels and how much extra time they have to spend being inconvenienced. 
---
Adding new content to the game fundamentally changes it because of the gear and trinkets that come out of it. 
---
It just seems from reading all these forum posts and all these opinions, no one really knows what they fuck they are talking about or how to articulate it.
---
So it was a bug?
---
I mean, Quin is a legitimate retarded rageaholic so idk why you are surprised by this.
---
Not sure if trolling but most likely
---
The diagram is misleading, not the title.
---
tl:dr but crushing blows is based on the defense of the victim, not level.
---
Asmongold and Soda already said thryre going PvP
---
Have you never followed a launch of any modern video game ever? Lol. They are almost always on tuesdays. It is only monday afternoon due to their global release schedule.
---
imagine intentionally choosing to play a Tauren Hunter with your absolutely massive dead zone
---
Now that warrior's ultra high HP regen was confirmed to be correct,
---
rogue is  without a doubt the most difficult class to level
---
model changer addon
---
WoW math is SRS business
---
I'm sorry but no, a lot of questionned if people who never knew that would enjoy it and how time consuming it is.
---
Reporting things that are clearly not bugs. The biggest offenders are the ones who never played vanilla. Things that anyone who played vanilla for 5 mins would know isn‚Äôt a bug.
---
Jubei'thos: Launch date January 26th 2006
---
Yeaaah no.
---
The most recent edit shows that some tigers are doing the correct damage.  We still don't have an explanation for the tiger doing 1-3 damage.  Try reading next time.
---
Absolutely laughable that a guy like this get access to beta. Are you kidding me? lighting all torches? A true classic veteran like myself wouldn't even dare to make such a novice mistake as that. I bet he doesn't even know that during early development of World of Warcraft, Blackfathom Deeps was once planned to be located in northern Darkshore, in which a structure identical to Blackfathom Deeps' entrance can still be found in the Ruins of Mathystra.
---
Cannot wait when all those fucking Clows, go back to Retail.
---
summer break? lol
---
what do you think I'm about to start my residency at a hospital?
---
have none of you played MMO's before? If you think you're an expert on a patch because you played it for a few months over a decade ago as a teenager you're either some sorta savant or delusional. Probably delusional
---
from what i have seen people are having mixed experiences in the beta...but its w/e i dont remember damage values from when i was 13 playing vanilla so its w/e lol im sure they will get it right once its like we have a while yet
---
You can see Tips Level 8 vs level 7 Tiger, gets hit for 4-5 here; https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425347552?t=02h25m08s
---
funnily enough people who have played both, private servers and classic already knew that IF private servers are off, they are harder, not easier.
---
If he's clueless, then why is he trying to be smart and report bugs if he has no clue how they were back then? This obviously only makes him look dumb big time. Maybe he was trolling or something, but that still makes him look just as dumb.
---
You reiterated what I wanted to say a lot better than I could‚Äôve. My experience raiding in Vanilla was super limited but I think I prefer BC anyhow. In my opinion the game did start to get better before it got worse (post classic) and I think that‚Äôs the best way to put it. Was definitely a gradual incline that sadly led to a super drastic decline. People who argue BC didn‚Äôt have really great content and quality life changes are honestly biased. Either way, we‚Äôre about to play the better quarter of wows history (:
---
```Before patch 2.01, Battle Shout generated 55 threat for every party member that received the buff. This made it better than demoralizing shout for gathering groups of mobs for AOE. It was also used frequently in Phase 1 of the Nefarian fight in BWL.```
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Shout?oldid=435599
---
No, but if you're really looking to give them up, it might be worth contacting customer support and tell them you have multiple accounts that got flagged. They might undo it and give them back out. Shot in the dark but I would think they'd like to avoid dead invites.
---
I was referring to the first 10-15 levels where every class with a heal can get by this way.
---
But even at higher levels, druids have very little downtime. The entire time you're killing things in cat/bear, you're regening mana - so you can basically sustain by healing between pulls.
---
They didn't say it couldn't exist, they said it already existed twice over. its gotten to the point where people are complaining about complaining more than people are actually complaining.   
---
if we get 3 posts a day telling people to stop complaining, they are gona complain. their point was to go comment on one of them posts instead of adding yet another.
---
Still unclear.
---
Wrong, I know Wrath babies that have gotten in on day 1 and 2.
---
It sounds silly i know. But small details like these are so important to get that vanilla feel.
---
Its not about streamer hate. Its about hating this culture of making stupid people famous and then vigorously defending anything they do or say.
---
Not sure if serious, but he was constantly clicking his bound heroic strike for example. Also, any self respecting player would go through the keybind settings when you're making your character.
---
Quick question for yah! What year did you create the accounts that got invites: 2004, 2005, 2006+?? Thanks! =D
---
Bootleg copy. 
---
 There is no super scary snek on the top of the portal.
---
ofc we know, but extremely identical ? no, there are enough differences to make the experience different I believe.
---
Yea i was really shook watching his stockades run because his group was able to just run through the place, pulling groups of 5-6 enemies and sometimes with a boss! They also downed the first two bosses within a couple of seconds and he asmon only took a lil bit of damage.
---
Classic wasn't INSANE HARDCORE hard, but it for sure wasn't THIS easy. I mean if you took on two regular mobs in the open world you'd probably die unless you were tanky.
---
Not to mention it's just awful behavior. I can't remember the specific details, but on my old server one of the top guilds snagged it at around 5 in the morning, possibly on a work day. 
---
Let's just say they permanently ruined their reputation.
---
He's a human with sword/mace spec to hit chance. Why he should miss any hit to +2?! It worjs as intended. And a good two hand does a great damage on leveling. I remember my pala in retri and he two shoted mobs with seal of command hit to stunned target. I was able to solo elite orcs in redridge while none of other classes was capable.
---
"Just don't die."
---
- Asmongold
---
I forgot about those masks. What were they from again?
---
Great pic
---
If i did have beta access i would have reporter it. But i dont, so all i can do is complain here.
---
The gear you are wearing matters, the proficiency of it, mail, plate, cloth, leather, matter. Buffs matter, and this is 1.12.1 not 1.9.2. I'm sure its perfectly fine the way it is now.
---
omg its been a while since ive seen a legit vanilla wow starting screen damn...these private servers were way off 100% authentic
---
A lot of the people that played Vanilla don't really have time to spend months grinding for a couple of pieces. I think there is a place for classic and retail and I'm glad they are at least doing it.
---
yeah i feel like its faster then it used to be as well as mobs hitting harder, but between 12+ year old memories and private servers our memories of it might be a bit "tainted." itll be sorted out in time, whether its right or wrong
---
but your also throwing a hissy fit about people throwing hissy fits........
---
That's interesting, but also why are you spending so much energy trying to convince this streamer?  I'm assuming you're simply just not in the beta, but you should consider how many people probably reach out to him with things they want him to test/do who also know far less about vanilla mechanics than he (or you for that matter)
---
Also, I'm not really sure why there's a concern about who gets credit for stuff like this.  I don't think Blizzard recognizes stuff like that do they?
---
Pray tell, what precise things have they done that offend you so? Because the clips I normally see are things like "Look at this stupid streamer die against a mob!" or "This streamer said something about Vanilla that's only 70% correct! *HAH, MORON.*"
---
Streamers were mainly invited to build up hype and showcase the game to the general public, hence why there's specific beta-invite requirements for everyone but them.
---
It's stupid of them to falsely report bugs, of course, but it's really not the end of the world, people are just extremely jealous.
---
I just think it's funny how we're on day 4 of a 3 month beta test and people are ready to lose their shit about it. Not saying you are. But theres a lot on this sub that are about ready to get their pitchforks because this level 7 tiger hit for 3 damage instead of 5. Its just ridiculous.
---
Get 20 buddies, all of you sacrifice one name reserve to take the top 20 streamers‚Äô names?
---
haha i was gonna say this
---
Atleast someone understands me
---
It's not even this subreddit, that's just the world. Literally how majority of people in general act in the world. By no means is this something new, it's been this way for a long time. Does it suck? Yep. But that's just the way it is. Adapt to it and deal.
---
It‚Äôs you bitch
---
Post after post after post calling the community toxic is making the community more toxic.
---
He's been a streamer of various Blizz games (in the past), he's a streamer of 3k+++ viewers at any day - that means the marketing team said he's ok to have his viewers watch WoW Classic on his stream. Blizz wants to get attention to WoW classic, hence why they give beta access to most streamers. And they actually greatly succeed at this.
---
Playing on a PvE server means watching a member of the opposing faction run towards your gathering node spawn and take it while you stand around like a numpty. On a PvP server you can punish them for their impudence.
---
Of course it all matters but none of it has been sufficient to explain the tiger doing 1-3 damage.
---
as somebody who played the original (closed) beta for vanilla WoW I agree. It sucked to start all over again. I still liked it at the time becuase the beta key a friend gave me got me into the game but still all this time lost.
---
Other than certain criteria they need, one would use the most common way of deciding who gets it, frist come, first serve.
---
Classic better not be an AOE fest like WOTLK was... if it is I think I‚Äôm just gonna continue playing on private servers
---
I raided a bit classic, then TBC and quit before coming back in cata.
---
When I started again in CATA, after not playing for literally years, in my first guild I was instantly getting top 100 dps scores for rogue only  in worldoflogs. I was a decent player, was a vanilla player and still was better than the vast majority of the newer generation. I got a world #22 on 3rd raid boss of the first Cata raid all the rogues around my score were in way better gear than me, yeah I had a lucky boss I guess but I was known on my server for being one of the best pve rogues in TBC. 
---
What you are seeing in these videos is not how classic worked, it was no where near that easy. A good group of raiders on alts were not able to pull entire rooms or 9-10 elites at once and lived, what a good group was able to do was burn through instances by smart pulls and quick downtimes. But you couldn't just beat unbeatable numbers because you were good.
---
The damage is WAY, WAY too low for elite mobs. An elite mob the same level as you was not a challenge to 1v1, but it would put you sub 50% hp unless you were a warlock, mage, hunter or a rogue burning cooldowns. 
---
By the time you got to lvl 40-50, sure you could maybe kill 3 elites at once but you are talking burning cooldowns and cutting it fine. The numbers in these videos I am seeing are just way too low, it literally looks like not even 50% of what it should be.
---
Right so in your meathead way of thinking everyone that didn‚Äôt play on or support nos is a scumbag got it.
---
Play what you want. The only time class choice matters is if you want to push yourself into hardcore raiding. Memespecs are fine for casual play. Warrior is not a memespec, you can do just fine casually on one.
---
Tram is free
---
Weapon skill point only adds 0.04% hit chance.
---
Halloween event
---
I completely agree and this will be my argument I think. I hadn't quite got into as much as this, so this has this has helped me articulate it. Thank you!
---
God damn, I remember watching these videos for hours on end.
---
Nope, I despise them with a passion also.  Most of my characters are also Undead
---
I‚Äôm playing a paladin in the dwarf starting area and I haven‚Äôt really had to heal myself at all yet. I think health regen might be too fast or the damage the mobs are doing is too low. Gotta find some videos on it.
---
As soon as I saw the word "toxic" in the title I knew OP would say something like this:
---
&gt;No need to be so locked up about your history otherwise this will die quicker and all the wait and hype will be for nothing. Enjoy it and embrace a community that can grow, 
---
You forgot to tell us about our rose colored goggles OP. Anyways, we've kept the game alive just fine for 10+ years exactly the way we are, and we grew so much that Blizzard ended up having to cater to us. I happen to like the people in this community and don't appreciate obvious outsiders talking shit about people who made this game possible for you. Yes, those "toxic" stubborn assholes are the only reason you are about to play Classic, so maybe some gratitude instead of whatever this thread is meant to be.
---
My name Jeff.
---
People don't have issues with retail player joining Vanilla.
---
People have issues with Streamers (Not all of them mind you) claiming to have played hardcore in Vanilla only to fail so hard at a simple boss or the gameplay at all.
---
I don't care if you are a normal player or a streamer, do what you want... but if you claim to speak for the community while knowing jackshit about the thing you represent (nor were you asked to do it) then It's a "Toxic" move from the Streamer, not the community that speaks out about it.
---
I‚Äôm like 99% sure this guy is trolling
---
Argument from Tradition is not a valid argument, I am sorry. 
---
"That's how it's always been" is not a reason to keep something. 
---
&gt;  The goal is authenticity, not improvement, not changes. Authenticity.
---
False. The game has already undergone a bunch of improvements and changes for QoL issues. They've tweaked stats on gear and other items to be more streamlined. 
---
They've added graphical advancements and changes to the game. 
---
They've added QoL improvements for UI.
---
Guess I'll see you in BfA?
---
How about proposing changes instead of shitting on people :^ )
---
What I dont understand is if they wanted to play bad enough, there are PS where you can play right now. It's not like Classic is live and they are restricting access to a privileged few. It's a fucking beta. Who gives a shit
---
Someone made a post about a week ago that said they were looking forward to seeing all the salt from those left out of the beta. I hope he's enjoying his windfall, lol
---
I wish he would release a digital version.
---
its against TOS, but i wouldn't say no to the details of one of the accounts ;)
---
He is joking... It's dripping from his voice.
---
In the hour of our greatest need, the skies opened up.
---
Out of them rode Kungen, rode Grievous, rode Hansol, Drakedog and Kishkumen, Vurtne and Pat. Swifty, Bajeera and Soda.
---
The gods have returned.  They fight with us.
---
There are still ways you can get into weird places though. You just have to use toys and such.
---
The saving grave for this was ferals could reach crit-immune and high elemental resist for example Molten Core. However they were susceptible for crushing damage since they couldn't reach def cap.
---
Good for them! Should be interesting to see how it unfolds
---
An 8 pull in any leveling instance would be very, very hard and involve all your CC, kiting things back to the portal, and drinking mana pots. Best case you can CC 3 of them, 2 roam free and someone has to kite, while the last 3 gang up on the tank, killing him when the healer goes oom.
---
The only time you could do that kind of stuff is if you vastly outlevel the instance, or you have good raid gear (T2+) and run scholo or something.
---
no youre lonely and have no friends. also youre 12 years old starting now /s
---
They don't have to make it difficult, just make it how it was back in the day. Because currently the content is severely undertuned in the beta.
---
Makes me cringe when I see Asmongold facetanking 6 elites and barely losing HP... Worst part is how he then goes on a rant saying vanilla is too easy lmao.
---
anyone who's been a classic wow naysayer after even seeing the movement post nost shutdown doesn't make sense to me, no. there is no explanation for that other than being selfish
---
Could you please share where they confirmed this ?
---
Cuz the very idea of Blizzard trying to sell us casual-catered shit again is damn terrific.
---
holding mouse buttons and smashing QWER doesnt equal skill
---
go back to donating
---
First, let's not kid ourselves. "Good" DPS for a T2 rogue was around 500-600 DPS. Ragnaros has 529k health and the fight lasted on average about 70 seconds, but a good portion of that he was under lava, so let's call it an even minute.
---
At best, a rogue was doing 5% of the DPS. But you're not losing that, because you're replacing the body. A raid ready anybody could pull 300-400 DPS.
---
So you're really only losing 1% of your overall raid DPS by subbing out your geared rogue for literally anyone else.
---
Just trolling, someone called him out for clicking yesterday and that was his reason for it.
---
1 and a level 40 fought off 4 60s? come on dude no need to lie that much
---
Its casuals who bitch about no content, not us, there is always more for a hardcore player to do. In classic with the lacking consumable cap, we can grind ad nausium until the cows fucking come home and we would never run out of content. We know what we're doing and we know what the consequences are. Most of us will slow level an alt once we have our mains squared away anyways. Your critique is asinine.
---
...no
---
Feel free to search "tauren hitbox" on the LH subreddit
---
I know, I was being facetious but I actually really would miss moonwalking.
---
Use your accounts to test multiboxing in the beta and make a tutorial about it. I would really appreciate it. I'm looking forward to dual box warrior/priest at launch and have no real possibilites to prepare for it :(
---
Did they delete the thread? I'm not seeing it anymore on the front page.
---
Let's be real tho, everyone is jumping on the #nodamage bandwagon, you included.  Enjoy the upboats. Has anyone else found any video proof of a single enemy doing less damage so far? Or is it just this one tiger?
---
Some of us want to rush to 60 and start gearing to be ahead of the curve, start getting prebis in week 2. This is fine. 
---
Some of you want to play at your own pace and dont care about server progression. This is also fine.
---
Most of us will return and slow level an alt after we get out mains squared away.
---
&gt; One of which was so bad it was even removed from retail. 
---
Which got removed?
---
First of all, no they cant just copy and paste the old code. That's not how any of this works. 
---
Secondly, we're 4 days into a 3 month long beta, and you want everything to be perfect right now? Well if it was Jack, they would've just launched the game and made oodles of money off it.
---
Troll.
---
yeah its kind of ironic people calling him stupid. He's CLEARLY just goofing around, now if you dont like his sense of humor or you dont like people not taking classic beta serious thats one thing i guess, but hes obviously just fucking around not being serious.
---
It won't be in classic. It's a bug.
---
We're goin' back home, bros. No need to be toxic. Let's all be friends.
---
Oh without a doubt he does hit hard, but he might be hitting even harder.
---
The best source we have for this is probably [petopia](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php), and we can see that the vast majority of mobs has a swing timer of 2.0. Assuming that is the default from which they scale everything, if Verdan has an attack speed of say 2.2 he'd be hitting 10% harder. Notable, but not massively harder.
---
On the other hand, Durotar Tigers are listed as 1.3, which means they'd be doing 35% less damage in Classic.
---
Mixed feelings here.  SFK has a very special place in my heart that I am super excited for.  But I also never hit 60 in Vanilla, so all the 60 content like Strat/Scholo/UBRS/DM is going to be brand new to me!
---
The title definitely says that he discovered it.
---
Dude that's racist
---
&gt; Did they lose SC?
---
Losing the source code to a much older production that, unlike WoW, was not actively developed through all these years is a completely different matter.
---
&gt; Did they admit to losing most of vanilla?
---
&gt; Are you nuts or just a troll?
---
Why are you asking so many questions?
---
I call out bad behavior when i see it. I don't hate them and I honestly don't give those streamers any thought outside of this subreddit. 
---
&gt;Why is everyone so salty over this and nitpicking anything streamers do? Swearing to never play the same realm
---
Okay you are really young. Maybe us old farts don't want the drama that comes with a streamer rolling on a server, whats wrong about that?
---
&gt;Enjoy it and embrace a community that can grow, not w community that existed.
---
Yes i plan on doing that with the server i am joining not with random people on a subreddit though.
---
Enjoy your experience though, it is going to be a memorable game for sure for anyone joining.
---
There are a lot of people super passionate about vanilla and watching some streamers abuse it has people on a streamer witchhunt around here.
---
That said you are one of the few who imo cares as much as we do. The hunter said he wanted it, but im assuming he was to scared to push the issue because of the benefits hes receiving from playing with yal. 
---
I can see how you could of missed seeing his one line of "roll" as i miss ingame chat consistently myself.
---
That wasn't phasing though, that was just transitioning between the two different zones.
---
&gt; If a player existed on your server he would always be visible if you were close enough 
---
Yeah, that is what i tought also, however i do remember having the same kind of issues on the same spot as the movie i linked before. And i never played on the pserver this movie was made.
---
check out the harpy video
---
Nah I think he believes that asmon is doing it, but not that you could haphazardly pull 5 elites at once without cc/setup, at level. No idea if that's true or not but there are definitely some [oddities](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq5rxj/can_someone_explain_this_discrepancy_in_mob/) in the beta so I'd hold my breath for now.
---
Hilarious when the beta is shown to have different values than 2006 footage and that the reference client doesn‚Äôt mean shit if the correct values from said client aren‚Äôt also in the beta.
---
So are you saying they're not allowed to submit, what they think are bugs, because they didn't play vanilla?
---
Assuming 1% did, which is probably low, that's still 20,000 ish people atleast, anyways. thats still too many as there are only two servers.
---
Yeah I get scrupulosity can be annoying and counterproductive. I just feel like there's a chance for us to be gaslit, which is exactly what happened when those of us were against trading loot in dungeons and there was a huge group of people on this sub and abroad who said to chill and it'll be fine. Then once Blizzard changed it due to outcry everyone even the people who were okay with it were suddenly really happy with it.
---
Now imagine if the chill crowd was wrong, and we never got upset, and Blizzard didn't change anything. It'd be a mess.
---
Silence breeds complicity.
---
Yes. We definitely need more of these posts.
---
If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.
---
The whole reason they have remade the client is because they can't use the old one. The security risks and stuff like that would be way too big.
---
compare that to Towellie, who actively shit on the idea of classic servers, only to jump on the nadwagon when it started gaining steam.  he could have said 'i had a change of heart' just like Venruki, but instead he tried to act like he was always on board, and it made him look like a fool.
---
Dungeon design was worse in BC in my opinion. That's when they really doubled down on very simplistic dungeon design which simply involves going in line from one end of the dungeon to the other.
---
Sure but most of the people in the beta are busy racing to 30 so they can get geared up for level 30 gurabashi arena.
---
hey asshole try google. he has growth hormone defficiency hes like 40 something
---
Darker personally.
---
Right, but most of those have been added without the express permission of players, and Blizzard deciding that they would do that independently. If I had a choice I would rather them try to optimise/secure the old client and put that out instead of this new version because there would be greater assurance that it is in fact authentic. 
---
You throw around this 'Argument from Tradition' phrase but that's exactly what the point of this project is. Authenticity or as close as we can get. Blizzard has said themselves they want to limit gameplay changes as much as is possible to keep as true to that promise as is possible. Your desire for more convenience does not trump that design philosophy. 
---
I haven't touched wow since the start of Cata, so I don't think I will see you there whatsoever.
---
Yeah fuck us for wanting an authentic experience and raising our concerns during a beta, right?
---
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh im jelly of that set...to bad you cant take that toon over man you would be a god among men to bad you dont have benidiction equiped to show off
---
&gt; you were able to exchange trinkets in combat
---
Not that either. Swifty was probably thinking of weapons, which can be changed in combat.
---
i'm kinda butt hurt that i'm seeing some streamers that never played wow before get in the beta but yet i'v been playing wow and subbed since 2005 and got nothing.
---
It's weird fetish slang that became mainstream, losing it's original meaning by attempting to become an insult, even though it's a desirable thing in it's original context. The whole thing is backwards and weird and dumb.
---
\- Anything classified as "Magic" I believe.
---
\- "Dispel Magic", and it can't remove agony because that's a curse.
---
\- "Cleanse" and it also can't remove curses like agony.
---
If blizzard really wanted mass feedback during the beta then they shouldn‚Äôt of invited streamers
---
I knew something was off, hopefully Blizz increases the difficulty.
---
I am sad with how negative and resentful some of the classic vets seem to be it‚Äôs not helpful for themselves or anyone
---
How can you tell they are doing the correct damage?
---
What about 2-3 extra items worth of armor?
---
&gt;&gt; Socialism
---
This is indeed, not it chief.
---
Wholeheartedly agree. When I first saw Classic WoW was coming out I was so pumped. Spending time on this forum has definitely made me less excited. Seems like everyone will be min-maxing and the ‚Äúno changes‚Äù crowd is exhausting to listen to. 
---
I joined a large group of old vanilla friends on disc to raid with when classic comes out and they said ‚Äúyou should roll hunter we have no hunters in this guild‚Äù looks like one of the most popular classes in vanilla will be the least populous because it‚Äôs not BiS. 
---
Additionally the ‚Äúno changes‚Äù thing is a joke. Had Vanilla continued and not moved on to BC there would have been tweaks and QoL improvements like there are in any online game. I think the way OSRS has done it is perfect but for some reason this crown is super against that.
---
If you light all the torches, 4 waves of mobs will come at once. You need to light 1 torch one by one or else you will be overwhelmed by 4 group of mobs.
---
Each torch spawns a different group of mobs.
---
no, probably not, they would need to build a set of gear, get their bars setup, talents, skills etc. it takes a long time to ‚Äújump into wow‚Äù
---
WoW Classic is doomed. Calling it now: people will bitch more about Classic not matching their memories than about live not meeting expectations.
---
They could, but I think the point he was making that the playerbase would riot even when it was better for them. I agree they absolutely could make mobs much harder to kill and they could give niches back. Remove healing from specs that aren't healers/hybrids and prune some defensive abilities to make pvp quicker. But there would be a shitstorm like never seen.
---
Also dont forget r/wow
---
lolwat? I believe the redridge thing because of paladin class quest mace, but human racial definitely does NOT make you suddenly stop missing on stuff 2 levels above you. The 5 points still puts you at a 5 point deficit from where you would be at if you were the same level as the mob with your weapon skill at max and no weapon racial.
---
I can live for another 3 months and enjoy my summer outside without having a volatile lvl 30 char.
---
The only part that matters is in August anyways. Not gonna throw any more money at blizzard until then.
---
Yeah no what? You really think that removing all of the things that the majority of people playing retail enjoy would make them more money? I know this sub is a giant vanilla circle jerk but some of you are a bit delusional.
---
Not quite what happened, but okay.
---
Since many of you guys communicate with streamers, it would be a big help if you asked them to move their camera shots away and open the combat log while they level
---
Whatever you wanna think to make you happy bud.
---
It¬¥s kinda weird how discussion always swinged in that direction. Obviously, private servers were just guesswork, but people always assumed that they were undertuned because of that, never taking into consideration that it¬¥s just as possible that they were overtuned the entire time.
---
Should be nuts. Asmon going Ally and Soda going Horde. That's gonna be a nice juicy server full of players.
---
Time will tell.
---
Ok, that shit is funny lol.
---
Right... Even taking into account private server fuckery, it just felt so far from right.
---
I was able to get my account back after selling it in 2010. Hadnt been logged into since 2012.
---
right back at ya. don't know why you're so upset someone has a different opinion than you. also you know i picked the name meathead right? like, they let you choose your username on here, not sure if you were trying to use it like a mid2000s insult or something lmao
---
I honestly hope someone can compile a list of wehrre the popular streamers are at so I can avoid them.
---
You're good man, it's not completely worthless. There's definitely some differences in mob dmg etc, just look at the Joana comparison. It's somewhere on here.
---
&gt;There will be a significant group of players that will rush to 60 and get stuck into the endgame again.
---
Nah. Alts are pretty lucrative and there's a LOT to do at endgame. You underestimate just how much time it takes to gear out. Classic won't run out of content for the hardcore player because there is always more to grind for more rewards. Getting to level cap unlocks ezmode alts, it unlocks gold farming, it unlocks raiding, it unlocks a lot modes of play.
---
Yes this, they were able to set up a pure 1.12 client for reference
---
yeah, this witch-hunting about things being wrong is getting frankly ridiculous. i mean, the post on the front page about some random level 6 tigers doing less damage then they do on the beta is silly.
---
Rush out at level 10? You crazy? We need to rush him even sooner! Quick get 40 people right out the gate at level 1 together, HOGGER RAID!
---
Tbh, id rather they just be on the hype train and leave it at that. One guy reported level 1 quest boots for not having stats. Tips reported a named npc for doing too much damage when his gear was red. They clearly have no idea what is right and wrong in classic. They may as well report everything that doesn‚Äôt go their way at this point.
---
Yeah I can understand that, but it's a 3 month long beta. Getting mad because something is off before the first week of beta is even finished doesn't make any sense. It's like people think they're gonna launch the game in it's current state. If they do, I'll eat a make azeroth great again hat on stream. But if they're recreating old bugs, I'm pretty sure theyll make sure damage tables are correct as well. It's not like when Bethesda did 3 days of beta testing before fallout 76. They have fuckin months to change this shit.
---
Is wow classic free to play?
---
I was wondering about that. Hope I get on a even population variance between ally and horde. I don't want one to be heavily skewed in favor of the other due to a single streamer being on that server. But I think most streamers, since they are friends, will try and get on the same server
---
Right? SMH volvo, just give me a beta key already. I can do so much better.
---
The tauren hitbox bug was implemented like that on Mangos TBC 2.4.3 way back in the day, which is what all current 1.12.1 vanilla projects are based on. I do remember this being active on Nostalrius back in 2015, they must have specifically removed it.
---
Priest: [cure disease](https://vanillawowdb.com/?spell=528), [dispel magic](https://vanillawowdb.com/?spell=527)

---
Druid: [cure poison](https://vanillawowdb.com/?spell=8946), [remove curse](https://vanillawowdb.com/?spell=2782)
---
There's a start.
---
The graph shows the flat experience needed, while the person you replied to is talking about playtime required to get to a certain level. 
---
When you get to higher levels, mobs and quests also grant higher amounts of experience, so the difference between leveling speed isn't as huge as you could think from the graph.
---
Weapons you could change, don't remember about trinkets.
---
all classic required was people who knew how to play their class correctly. nothing more, nothing less. BC is where the challenge is.
---
Has his gut just resting on the back of the chair barking orders
---
Eh. I think it would end up being a net negative. 
---
Sure some people would be able to escape being ganked, maybe, with the current system. The downside is that you are going to have people on your server looking to group up for quests and it's going to be a pain in the dick and much more immersion breaking to have to go back to town to change layers.
---
Level 41 is not 50%
---
Sweet. Didn't play legion but always wanted to test the action cam.
---
Yea it fits you
---
You're probally right, but in the off chance that he isn't advice that might have a shot in getting more people in to find bugs could come in handy.
---
Streamers likely get pre-access to this or they will want some kind of verification from the person to prove they are that streamer. At least that's what I think since this whole thing is designed so their names won't get sniped.
---
Seems to me the biggest problem is on elite mobs.  
---
  Pulling 2-3 can get you killed quite easily at least from what I've seen, asmon is constantly dying because he pulled more than 2 without esfand to heal and buff him which as a warrior is a death sentence but pulling ONE elite mob should already be a challenge if not death.  
---
  Right now it seems like non elite mobs are barely beefed up normal mobs in terms of damage, resulting in trash mobs in dungeons and normal elites to be way easier to kill.  
---
  It's either that, or the armor values are fucked up.
---
Good work friend. Take my upvote!
---
a lot of the vanilla content was nerfed in patch 2.4.3 or 2.3 or something in TBC,when they made a lot of the world elites into normal mobs etc.
---
Some people have waited 15 years for this, and are very passionate about this project, and don't want to see Blizzard screw it up. We got 1 shot at this.
---
A lot of the elites were grey level he had pulled at the start, so he was 6 level higher than the elites they pulled in groups. He also dropped to 30% life at one point just tanking 3 at grey level. Unless you are talking about another point in the run.
---
I remember that they fixed it on a case by case basis. Every time someone figured out a new boss that could be kited to a city, it was chained to its zone in a future patch.
---
One thing we know for certain is that Blizzard is doing everything they can to remove the need for GM presence on servers in WoW Classic (that's why they're adding loot trading).
---
Since the bosses that were brought to cities required a GM to get involved with /kill, it's very likely none of this abuse will be allowed in Classic. I doubt the modern client that Classic is running on even allows for it at all. We're certainly not getting a Corrupted Blood incident.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Normalization
---
it explains it and has the patch notes linked
---
It's entirely possible that my recollection is wrong.
---
Superior gear and cc my dude. They were in dungeon blues at best and I had full tier 2 equivalent gear. It's why it's one of my favorite memories because we demolished them and was completely outside of the norm. My adrenaline was flying. 
---
I was being healed/dispelled by the priest. Also low levels can still hit higher levels in vanilla and don't suffer from exponential miss %.
---
I can understand if you've never beaten astranomical odds in pvp before, what with being a scrub and all
---
So what was the point of all this?
---
WWWWAAAAHHHHH! YOU'RE ALL SO TOXIC! MY FEEFEES ARE HURT! WAAAHHHH!
---
Link?
---
Ok well the biggest pserver for the last several years normalized all hitboxes and did not have the classic Tauren range which is why you're seeing so many posts about it on this subreddit
---
Quests give more exp at higher levels as well, so this chart is interesting but not directly related to play time.
---
that's ironic
---
https://i.imgur.com/zquHj.gif

I'm sorry? His critique of the "there's no-one holding a gun to people's head when they say people volunteered to work overtime" argument is right out of Das Capital. He very obviously agrees with some of the postcapitalist critiques. I'm not saying he's a socialist, he just uses that aspect of it.
---
I could not tell that, so were the others that looked through it and thinking if he was joking or was just stupid. Even if he was trolling, the end result is literally the same - he made himself look stupid - intended or not, he succeeded.
---
Ya. I'm a classic fanboy but I hate the rotations and how many specs are garbage. But at the same time, I hate  in modern-WoW so many other features even more lol.
---
Also: Just because you don't like a particular streamer doesn't mean you need to come on subreddit and try to convince everyone else to hate them too. If you don't like it, turn it off and leave it at that.
---
This whole culture that has developed around here where people go out of our way to spread as much hate as possible on somebody needs to stop.
---
excuse me?
---
You don't need 80, you need 41. And how many guilds would be willing to sell an MC clear to a PUG after they have it on farm and only need specific pieces? Pretty much all of them.
---
OK So I did a sort by age date on a youtube for sfk videos. 
---
Look at the final boss video, he is hitting an arms warrior so he isn't full tank, but still look at the damage difference.
---
The basic attacks from the boss are doing about 115 damage to Asmongold, in this video they are doing around 245.
---
11 Year old video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttCwzgjgU60
---
Asmongold :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQI3mMqUgGw&amp;t=131s     ( skip to 38:05)
---
The boss is literally doing under 50% of vanilla damage on the basic attacks. 
---
Again - these numbers are so far off it's crazy. How is Asmongold a top wow streamer when he didn't even know anything about Vanilla, he is literally  saying in his stream something along the lines of Vanilla just wasn't that hard.
---
&gt; this isn‚Äôt an accurate representation of time spent levelling in each bracket.
---
It doesn't claim to portray time at all. It's purely raw exp totals.
---
Again, as pointed out in the lower comments (read for yourself), you could exchange armor in vanilla beta and also even after the officical vanilla release you could change trinkets during combat.
---
Yea i played the original vanilla beta aswell and my fondest memory was the dissapointment when i levelled up my priest to try levitate spell (cuz omg levitation? BADASS) only to see it was litterally just you standing a small amount higher on nothing lol
---
Is it like watching those corny episodes of police crime dramas where they "hack" the bad guys computer by using two keyboards? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msX4oAXpvUE
---
Implying I dont get a better experience out of the game with an alt funded by a level 60 main? There's a time and a place for slow leveling, and your first character is not that place. This is basic MMO powergaming stuff. 
---
Alts are lucrative, you expect the hardcore players willing to level in 2 weeks NOT to have at least one alt? THere's a lot of content, yes, but we all see it. 
---
I will level a character to 60 and will have kicked off a well funded alt well before you hit level 40 with that kind of attitude. With that second alt I'll take my time, play my dungeons, and best of all, I wont have to worry about finances. At the same time, on my main I can farm out prebis and MC. 
---
Hardcore players dont run out of content in classic becuase there is always a lucrative way to increase your accounts power by investing time. Who cares if we speed level one character?
---
Has anyone been shitting on anyone but that tipsout guy? 
---
I think there has been more positivity than not. The biggest post here recently was celebrating how many viewers Asmongold had for his deadmines run.
---
So many threads like this today.
---
Without people like us, you would be playing BfA right now, grinding for 2 weeks to get a mount with yellow and red stripes instead of yellow and orange stripes.
---
We made Classic possible, and you want to walk in here and tell us the community should change in this or that way. You are probably also the type of person to say "I don't mind if Classic has transmog and LFR, QoL right guize?"
---
You should go and enjoy the non-toxic community of Retail, it's obviously better over there for people like you.
---
I saw Hogger do the rape on many Gnomes, he is a hero
---
They will almost always be gray/green, since the start of the dungeon is like 18 and the last boss is 26.
---
Wolf Master Nandos, the boss is 25, and theres like 3 elites + summons, just running around rampant, and theres like no damage going out. Also that time he almost died at the start from the 3 worgen, he was out of Line of sight of the healer for like 15 seconds.
---
now this is top tier content.
---
&gt; Funny how the tables turned from pservers being undertuned 
---
I've only ever seen people who have no idea what they are talking about claiming that. There might be certain things on private servers that are slightly undertuned, but overall they are definitely overtuned.
---
How do you stream snipe world pvp...
---
Damn, I am not ready!
---
I had another video in the OP (that I removed) of two paladins doing the early part of SFK. I didn't check that video out much, just saw that it also seemed to have around the same damage numbers, and also put it in. The paladin in the video is lvl 32, if anyone wants to see it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdcWmvxGvoY
---
Dun Murogh is my favorite zone. That will always be home
---
Don't project. There's no way in hell I would play modern wow.
---
Don't make assumptions about what I want. I want an organic experience as well.
---
What I don't want is your garbage rhetoric.
---
Holy shit. Too many children are triggered that he got a beta invite and they didn't. Chill down kids. Once you stop being irrelevant you will get an invite. Oh no! He thought it was a bug when it wasn't! LOOOOOOL what a casual!
---
God I hope there's a list of servers the streamers are on when the game comes out. Don't want to pick the wrong one and realize asmongold is on it 30 levels in.
---
I'll get pedantic here because I'm a language teacher and that's kinda my thing:
---
Saying Joanna discovered it can indeed imply he was the very first to discover it, but that does not have to be the case. It can also just narrate the fact that he discovered the bug at some point in time. Another example, for instance, could be something like this: "John discovered a cat in his barn." Was John the first to ever discover cats? Obviously not. But he did indeed discover an instance of a cat existing. So it could just be making a statement about someone finding something out.
---
Hope this helped clarify the verbiage!
---
It looks like a ton of mobs are hitting for 1/3 of their real value. How... could something like this happen? After two years of development?
---
... I wasn't giving an exact value of how far you could see lol. Maybe organized BG's it was useful, but I don't recall it changing the tide of regular bgs. It's a nice but not necessary thing, waste of gold when your leveling, don't believe it had ranks though.
---
Yeah but that was intended to be a solution to a nicheish problem of someone accidentally getting the wrong loot and not having to open GM tickets bc of it. The damage tables of mobs play a much bigger part than whether or not you can trade loot to people in a dungeon. It's like people think blizzard intentionally made the numbers lower
---
Ironically before this and throughout the entire run he was saying how easy Vanilla/Classic was/is.
---
I say, we can PVP if we want to
---
We can leave your friends behind
---
Because your friends don't PVP
---
And if they don't PVP 
---
Well they're no friends of mine
---
yup: perplexitycya !
---
He'll freely admit that he didn't play that much in classic towards the latter part of it.  Watching him level with Esfand it's pretty damn obvious he doesn't know a lot of things from back then.  Maybe it's his limited experience, maybe it's lack of memory, but most Vanilla content was essentially untouched until Cata giving plenty of time to familiarize through leveling alts and gathering achievements.  He's clearly in over his head some lol...just can't admit it due to pride/Twitch persona?
---
Yeah or cases of people swapping servers to bang it at 2am when nobodies on.
---
I'm well aware of the grinding involved lmao
---
Yes, this entire idea is off. The only thing that could have changed their damage would be "stat squish" mechanics, which have no reason to have occurred inside the same core expansion. 
---
Auto-attacks were never affected by normalization.
---
Blizzard couldn't care less about 'dead invites'. The release a batch and see how many are playing. If they want more playing they release more. It's not like they invest time into every one they send out and don't want it wasted.
---
The only thing I can think at this point, is that he had stoneskin totem effecting him earlier, maybe that got stuck on some how. Cause before that Tigers did the correct damage to him.
---
Did this on Nost. The change to alliance wasn't my proudest, but I loved the experience. With how little you visit the other faction's zones in vanilla, it's practically a whole new game and experience.
---
There's still some zones like STVietnam which share most quests...but most shared zones have ally specific and horde specific hubs each with their own custom quests &amp; objectives.
---
If Blizzard comes out and says "We've heard your concerns, but these values are all entirely 1:1 to 1.12, each one" I'll believe them. But it's a beta, and some of these numbers feel super off. Disregard private servers, it still feels wrong.
---
Dark shore is often recommended to level up and skip early westfall.  You can train when you return
---
yes there is, and I will keep saying it sorry if it bothers you
---
He did.
---
Nobody around here cares how salty you are. Stop being an asshole.
---
&gt; You throw around this 'Argument from Tradition' phrase but that's exactly what the point of this project is.
---
Just so we are on the same page, this is what that phrase means. 
---
&gt; Appeal to Tradition is a type of logical fallacy in which something is accepted as true or better because it's the "way it's always been done."
---
Logical fallacies mean that your point that you're making is a non-starter for discussion. "That's how it always has been" is not an answer to the topic. 
---
&gt; All the gear tweaks are still limited to what was in vanilla. 
---
Different stages of vanilla, meaning that certain gear will be stronger than it was at the time you could get it. That ***directly*** effects gameplay. Especially when you consider that Classic will have waves of content being released. 
---
Are you suggesting that increasing the spawn rate on gnolls for a quest at level 9 is a greater effect on gameplay than that? 
---
&gt; Blizzard has said themselves they want to limit gameplay changes as much as is possible to keep as true to that promise as is possible.
---
Obviously they have to be careful what they say and what they do, otherwise this playerbase will lose their goddamn minds. 
---
Remember when they suggested layering? This forum and others lost their goddamn minds about this fact. They used Argument from Tradition to shout down any logical responses. They didn't want to hear any reason as to why this was being implemented and how it would work. They acted like children. 
---
If I was Blizzard, I'd tell you whatever you wanted to hear so you wouldn't lose your shit. 
---
OH, btw, I know how much you absolutely hate the idea of getting new content added to the game. I really hope you don't get to 60, and then find out they're doing that. I'd hate for you to quit after all that work.
---
And Wotlk had even more spec viability without homogenity. I think it was only in Cata where they did big changes to classes where the homogenity started, although I might be misremembering and it was Mop.
---
Unless you get ganked mid way.
---
Ahh I see, don't have any recollection of that.
---
I also saw Sodapoppin solo an elite viper in WC on a druid. It looked way to easy for an elite mob in vanilla.
---
Can the professions guide aspect be used on Horde as well? Great work, wish I was going Ally again after years of pservers but returning to my Horde roots.
---
It annoys me that so many people are so sure that there's this big issue, with no proof. Memory is notoriously fallible. Do you have any idea how many people are going to (incorrectly) leave this thread thinking there's a big problem with the beta now? Do you know how stupid people are? A lot of people aren't even going to read your edits, and will spread around that it's now been \*proven\* that there is a 200% damage discrepancy. 
---
PS. It's always been Berenstain bears.
---
yeah people are shitting on asmongold for getting excited about a 4 str 4 stam leather belt
---
If you block the attack can't crit. That's a big deal.
---
/u/YorkeZimmer another good comparison to add to the post.
---
People just cant believe its an actual challenge.
---
Yep, it's people pissy about not being in the beta 99% of the time.
---
not really any grinding just 90% luck. only way you‚Äôre going to get it is to be main tank in a guild when it drops. that job alone requires extreme amounts of playtime and dedication
---
‚ÄúIt feels funny‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean anything, especially when those feelings are biased by your time spent on private servers where most of the numbers tuning is guesswork.
---
If it feels wrong by all means report it, but if Blizzard doesn‚Äôt do anything about it don‚Äôt be surprised. Blizzard has a reference client running the game exactly as it was back in the day. They would know better than any of us how the game worked back then. Feelings are irrelevant.
---
Right, and if Blizz comes out and says this IS how it was, entirely, hit chance/crit chance/damage values, and all... then I believe them, and we should find other issues to correct from the Beta. But as it stands, all of those numbers feel off.
---
Play gw2
---
This is exactly the type of content this subreddit needs a lot more of now, not endless streamer hype/hate.
---
I've also been looking at people play the beta and felt that numbers just seem way off, especially dungeon elites, but just haven't been able to put my finger on any specific examples. It all just feels "wrong".
---
Mmhmm, getting quite annoying tbh
---
Everything was useless! Weapons and wands only! No spells/abilities!
---
I wasn't trying to imply that only he had access, but he's more likely to remember things that feel off and to immediately check his video.
---
Lmao some bitch made streamer is making the entire community?
---
Druid is your answer.
---
I'm not saying it shouldn't be talked about. But there are people having full blown melt downs about this and that's what I'm calling ridiculous.
---
he is popular but no pro gamer
---
brb ordering instant pot
---
You're so delusional it hurts. You're focusing on the wrong aspects and not thinking correctly, blinded by your hate for retail which prevents any form of rationnal reasoning.

I‚Äôll answer for you - it doesn‚Äôt matter
---
The Blood Plague bug from Zul'Gurub has been brought up by the team and it would be interesting and funny to bring it back when Zul'Gurub launches in Phase 4.' -Brian Birmingham, Lead Software Engineer, and Patrick Dawson, Production Director. 
---
Research is nice.
---
Priest is certainly not underrated lol.
---
I enjoy him for what he did and continues to do (I love the leveling guides created off his routes) but man he is a terrible streamer haha. He was encountering a bug yesterday that exists in live as well, one where you can't interact with an NPC if you have the game menu open. He didn't understand what was going on and was thinking out loud. He was also asking the chat what the problem was, but never really bothered to look at what the chat said in response. We answered his questions (does this exist in retail? Do I have to log out to fix it?) but he never looked at the chat and ended up doing stuff wrong lol.
---
Great guy, just needs to work on his streaming skills (very different from vlogging or recording).
---
Yes
---
No low levels could not hit 60's.. I played Vanilla, did you? You couldn't hit a 60 til mid 50's. Why are you lying so much
---
Thanks for this. People on this sub are being really weird since the beta.
---
Thank you so much for this.
---
This thread has really vindicated my whole day of watching Asmongold rolling through SFK and BFD while hearing him spam "Maybe people didn't remember what a joke vanilla was".
---
Man these streamers really suck, I wish the mentality would change around finding bugs, stop assuming everything is correct and blizzard can't do a single thing wrong, they've proven otherwise already with the regen bullshit in the blizzcon demo.
---
I don't think this is it
---
Cool. Have fun soloing the Cyclonian at 30.
---
If aoe-grinding is ALL you do from 20-60, yeah that could be boring. But if you do dungeons, play with friends, do professions, be a part of the AH, and then sprinkle in aoe-grinding when youre out in the world solo? It's hella fun then. I love the satisfaction of having mobs lined up, ready to get plowed by some snow.
---
Regarding doing more dmg it might not be "non-vanillalike". Private servers tend to overtune mob armor because they obviously can't know the real values. Something many people have stated with for example evidence of old patchwerk kills where melee with barely any buffs does higher dmg than on private servers where people have full world buffs.
---
Tauren warriors will be a massive advantage against mages etc.
---
Show him this video https://youtu.be/YjG4UpuL84M?t=76 
---
You'll almost never get any mega world PvP encounters like this on a pve server because nobody will ever voluntarily flag themselves. Some of the clips in that video are absolutely insane and I can't wait to join a PvP guild come classic and join in on the carnage like this. It will be more than worth the frustrating times of being ganked while leveling and is something that you shouldn't rob yourself of.
---
Remember to sort by controversial if you want OPs point proven lol.
---
Just a friendly reminder stormwind is a dictatorship and Edwin did absolutely nothing wrong.
---
That's subjective. I had to watch a second time to get what he was saying.
---
May be there are few different tigers technically with different stats, just with the same name? Someone should test it.
---
God, I hate this closed beta.
---
haha I said WOOSH and REDDIT hahaha it‚Äôs realy funny because XD the woosh means that the joke went WOOSHH over your head XD XD lololol ahahaha and reddit is this really cool website LOL where i like to talk with fellow EPIC LE REDDITORS and we aAre all SUPER COOL LOL!

---
For me it is obvious now that the Beta`s numbers must be off. The regen is too high too. Similarly, from vanilla memory without any Private server memory I am confident an SFK wipe would have been immanent the way they rushed though with four people (!). Its funny people always talk how easy something was, but in reality it seems the numbers are completely off maybe even intentionally...
---
This is constructive. Thank you OP. Maybe send all the info on the forums for feedback? There are blueposts about those things.
---
And hopefully they'll realise that actually working towards a goal albeit slowly is more rewarding and engaging (or rather more motivating and less frustrating) than simply winning the lottery every now and then.
---
Absolutely not a small detail, especially on a hunter. Stutter stepping your auto-shots, this happens a lot. When strafing to the left, your character does this 100 mph backpeddle.
---
100 mph is 160.93 km/h
---
I did not mean literally everyone but it's the vast majority. Who specifically are you talking about though? I'd like to see their realm player info to help get an idea of who is getting in
---
Yeah I mean he‚Äôs definitely got more ingrained knowledge. Guess that‚Äôs what makes watching him look for bugs a lot more interesting.
---
Okay i mean if you actually PAY attention in the video... hes reporting an actual bug... That pair of boots ONLY say feet... says NOTHING about armor... If you're gonna be a fucking asshole atleast post a clip of someone doing something stupid.
---
Sometimes you just have to have played the game
---
You don't want to play modern WoW but you want to regulate our community into removing the """toxic assholes""" (strong personalities) who made it possible for you to have an alternative. Think about what you're saying.
---
&gt; reddit is this really cool website LOL where i like to talk with fellow EPIC LE REDDITORS and we aAre all SUPER COOL LOL
---
You're on Reddit, you fucking cretin.
---
Too many people comparing private servers to the beta is the problem.
---
Blizzard is using a real vanilla client and server to base everything from.
---
Right, for sure. As with any situation, especially on a classic forum, we really have to take the outliers with a grain of salt and focus on the biggest picture possible. I see plenty of ragers, but I also see *much more* concerned but sensible conversation. The ragers will just continue to rage, and thats with any community in life.
---
You need 80 to do 2 runs at the same time without a person missing costing a spot.
---
Or you're the idiots... it doesn't have an armor value.
---
Lol I‚Äôm speechless. This wasn‚Äôt permitted in vanilla man
---
Maybe try and respond to the point I'm making instead of just lashing out with something irrelevant and a petty insult mate.
---
Sadly I might have been right when I said that the community will be the downfall of this, because it'll be just as toxic as any modern game community. Today's gamers are so entitled and spoiled and need an instant gratification that any minor discomfort will bring out the worst. Today it is flaming whoever got into the beta and acting superior because they 'deserve' to be in, tomorrow it is calling out people for having subpar gear and declining group invites based on raider.io or whatever the cancer they will come up with this time.
---
Ahhh I see. Yeah I got lucky, I had friends who played too who got me into it. They basically told me not to buy anything, so I got pretty lucky only upgrading gear like every... 20-30 levels lol
---
I had an undead warrior in vanilla and I remember being able to 3 shot mobs with crits. Even on Pservers this happened. Now about the missing and such. I agree on that part. Miss miss dodge hit parry miss. That was annoying as a warrior. If a warrior has a good weapon then they can easily destroy mobs even 2 levels above them. Albeit they'll lose half their health doing it.
---
I have a feeling this will be the primary source of discrepancy when Classic is out. Most of us sucked back then - the game was new, info was scarce, we all just kind of bumbled along; now, people have so many years of experience playing and so many millions of guides/resources that we naturally eliminate a chunk of difficulty just by avoiding stupid mistakes. 
---
Plus, retail WoW has gotten so much easier that I think we look back and perceive Vanilla as being SO hard comparatively. In reality, it ranged from fair to challenging, depending on the context, but was rarely *truly* hard. 
---
Of course, there still could be bugs or number errors that make certain mobs easier than they were, but videos like you've posted are helpful in proving that that doesn't seem to be the case for many of the instances reported so far.
---
So it showing no armor on it isn't a bug? Moron
---
Yeah the catchup basically killed my joy in the game. Too much to explain in detail but that's the gist of it.
---
Really hard to describe how it makes you feel when playing. You just gotta try it.
---
This makes the streamer less annoying. I now understand your point
---
Why is he a legend?
---
Actually hes correct in the bug reporting... It doesn't show armor.
---
Its funny how people want the "vanilla experience" but still want to pretend ninja looting wasn't part of it.
---
After this, I really hope the mentality will shift from instantly calling someone a private server retard when they call something out as bugged/incorrect.
---
I noticed this too when Asmon and Esfand ran into the Badlands, aggroed a level 38 ELITE dwarf, and he lived through 2-3 HITS at level 12! He should have been murdered.
---
Unless this is a copy pasta, this is pretty pathetic.
---
I am just not a big fan of shitty behavior and entitlement, especially when these streamers have such a big reach to the younger audience that is easier influenced. 
---
The streamers making mistakes aint offendable.
---
Or you're fucking clueless that ARMOR is a stat...
---
Are you aussie? They're the only ones I've met to insult others by callilng them rats (so much so that I named my character "I am ratlord" on another game)
---
AAHHHHHH UGHHHHHHH

This guy's word is not the end all be all for premades, but generally speaking these comps are 'standard' in tryhard games. 
---
TL;DW: 
---
Mage is generally more desirable than warlock for premade bgs.
---
A lot of people here are 30+ year olds who think Classic will give them a second chance at high school/life, so yeah pretty toxic
---
Hi, /u/oldschoolnerd
---
But it is a bug... that armor stat is missing.
---
What talent changes make this much of a difference by level 20?
---
I have hundreds of days played as well lol... I found one patch note on release saying armor can no longer be switched. But weapons and accessories can. I could not find a patch they remove trinket switching. But all I asked for was proof.
---
Meanwhile Crendor's just fishin.
---
They did. 
---
They really did. Its an emulation. I worked on private servers myself. Hands on with the coding and everything.
---
Private servers arent exact. The code is wrong. Plain and simple...and nobody seems to understand that.
---
You forgot two most important:
---
1.*Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]*?
---
2.*Where is Mankrik's wife*?
---
You dumb af
---
The increase between levels in Vanilla was, I believe, a lot steeper than it's become on retail. So the perspective can be helpful
---
 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/List\_of\_magic\_effects](https://wow.gamepedia.com/List_of_magic_effects) 
---
this is accurate for classic wow, i cant remember ?
---
WTF WHAT
---
i don‚Äôt think that guys joking either
---
The dungeon starts around 18 and ends in the mid 20s. The mobs were all yellow towards the end, and they really didnt have any more difficulty with it.
---
He reported a bug. If you can't see what he reported you're the stupid one. Not him.
---
nah, he was always retarded.  
---
typical warrior. forgets that his pocket healer is what keeps him alive, not his own 'awesomeness'
---
THIS IS NOT A BETA. iT'S AN ADVERTISEMENT. 
---
Blizzard is letting people who have no idea how classic was or how it should be. All they want is free advertising from streamers.
---
Your being a jerk man, OP has proof on inconsistencies and is acting in good faith.
---
The layering issue is contentious exactly because it impacts gameplay, regardless of how logical it is. Blizzard themselves are aware of this and that's why they promised to remove it as soon as they could, exactly because it affects gameplay again. Convenient for you to forget that little aspect... The problem is that unlike the actually vanilla launch, Blizzard is expecting a massive outpouring of interest, but believe it will be short lived relative to the lifetime of the game. So that in order to avoid dead servers, they're basically going to overlap a bunch of servers and collapse them when the population settles. That is a difficult solution to a difficult problem. Changing spawn rates is not a difficult problem in this instance. Because the population caps are going to be about the same as vanilla (partly thanks to layering), the rate of spawns can be the same as vanilla, for better or for worse. Authenticity maintained as much as possible. Maybe if you hardened the fuck up about having to wait for mob spawns you'd feel a bit better about this.
---
Blizzard said themselves that also don't have a copy of the older versions of vanilla. When they patched things through they didn't have good version control and so those older versions are lost forever. A shitty situation, but they are doing the best they can by phasing things out and only having particular drops drop after they were introduced, even if the mob that dropped them was available earlier than that.
---
implementing something small I'd like to have for myself - ill put in a PR if i get it working. Nice use of hooks!
---
yeah, a bit too much gatekeeping and general just negativity if you aint with the hivemind lately. We should all be friendly and welcoming to all players to help a healthy community in classic thrive, not be a bunch of old curmudgeons trying to shit on everything and everyone that slightly annoys us, the future of the community depends on it. No one is better than anyone, lets just be friendly with eachother.   
---
Classic is gunna be amazing, its on a great track and for every big streamer just fucking around there are a bunch of people actually looking for bugs and making sure its of vanilla quality, so relaaaax everyone.
---
This is also the beta. When the refined game comes out, and we know for a fact the data is all implemented correctly, and its still this easy, you may have a point. We're getting ahead of ourselves though until we have this all fleshed out with a blue post.
---
Bunch of entitled little shits on this subreddit
---
You're a fucking idiot dude... Theres no ARMOR stat on the boots... legit just says feet... if you dont see that as a bug you're a fucking moron. ARMOR is a stat too. Whats bullshit is a bunch of dumbshits REEE'ing about something when they can't comprehend a video.
---
Strand of the ancients
---
Is this real? They didn‚Äôt patch it before TBC?
---
Didn't even read the comment lol
---
Umm no. In classic you can only swap weapons while in combat. Trinkets or gear you need to be a rogue or hunter to drop combat to change gear.
---
If a guild doesn't have a MT who's 100% "concrete", it's going to die anyway.
---
And to think you're even dumber... Armor is a stat... and that pair of boots don't have it. \*Thinking thinking thinking\*
---
People have the wrong idea about this. Vanilla nights weren't as dark as you remember them.
---
In the Vanilla beta (or maybe after release for a short while) the nights were really dark but Blizzard quickly changed that.
---
You can check how the nights look in Vanilla right now on private servers. (The lightness or darkness of night is client side, the server just tells the client what time it is.) Classic has exactly the same nights as Vanilla.
---
I wouldnt word it like that. i would say, there could be something more to the picture. Maybe the data is right, but theres an error in implementation, an oversight.
---
What do you mean catchup ?
---
PEAK HEALTH
---
What exactly does that mean? I see here two girls having fun playing the beta. What do you mean THESE people?
---
The elite mobs his up to twice as hard.
---
THANKS FOR THE WARNING
---
When raid 2 comes out they give you full raid 1 gear for free.
---
Thing of beauty :P
---
you realize everyone in the day 1 beta reported this  not 5 minutes into logging in right? Joana didn't even have his invite when this was already reported countless times. you guys are truly out of touch
---
I'll spare Hogger if he gives me my Footman Tunic and 875 XP for my mercy.
---
Okay well you're factually wrong about the hit chance in pvp and that isn't even what the anecdote is about anyways. Why are you being such a negative Nancy? Is that what you're doing with your Saturday afternoon, coming into reddit and shitting on my awesome vanilla memories when I'm trying to convince this guy pvp server is the one true path? What's even the point? 
---
Get outta here with your stupid bull shit you nerd, you little dip shit. Go be a little prick somewhere else. Also, you smell like a dog's ass hole. And I hate your face idiot
---
Could it be because he had MotW applied? Rank 1 gives 25 armor which is quite significant afaik at low level? Shouldn't reduce it from 5-8 to 2-3 though.
---
No, it has monks so that list is from at least MoP.
---
yeah this thread is a delusional circlejerk and i love joana but this is just dumb
---
the mobs in your video are literally different with different abilities, what the fuck are you even talking about? the dungeon was changed in cata completely
---
&gt;Since people are too fucking stupid to Beta Test with their combat log up
---
\-Guy who had to cross out half his post and uses a bunch of capslock
---
Nope, there isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not a debate.
---
Worgen were in Cata, not vanilla. Your starting experience is nothing like it was back in the actual day of 2004/2005. What you‚Äôre asking for is wow cata remastered not wow classic. You‚Äôre in the wrong sub homie.
---
Get over yourself
---
Sure, but they could have different ways of scaling things in cata, etc etc, plus, the dungeon was changed in cata. Too many inconsistencies to use as definitive proof IMO.
---
When did Asmon change his mind? Haven't watched his streams in a couple months but he did say he wouldn't play pvp because he would get ganked 24/7 by stream snipers? 
---
Most other streamers are going pvp though so maybe that's why he changed his mind.
---
Stop putting words in my mouth.
---
Thanks, I'm only a month or two into React but it's so incredible that I don't want to use anything else ever again. Gl!
---
Yeah it's usually the younger players who are shitting on classic. I don't really know why, I was 3 when it released and I'm hyped for it because I never experinced it. 
---
They all say it's shit, or it's just nostaliga. Hell most of the kids I hear saying this, spend all day doing pre made RPS in Ruins Of Gilneas.
---
Method also had nowhere near the competition that Nihilum had. Nihilum was the best guild in WoW when people actually gave a shit about WoW.
---
Toxic: anything i dont like labeled as such to imply that because I dont like it no one else should.
---
Agreed!
---
It's being discussed in the other thread, apparently other classes with similar armor increases are still taking more dmg than 2-3.
---
You still don't want to go and read through the comments, isn't it? 
---
" [You could switch armor until patch 1.1](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.1.0)"
---
"Armor can't be swapped out while in combat. Other equipment such as weapons and **accessories can still be swapped out**." - this was how it worked at the start of vanilla.
---
you sound out of touch
---
Please link to it or where to buy it. He sent some to backers but didn't put it up for sale.
---
Mob damage seems really really low, even when people are fighting red lvl mobs
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfslY_AvhLw
---
This guy is a POSER
---
You think we had Instant Pots back in Vanilla!? What kind of spoiled, pansy, snowflake millennial shit is this?
---
We had microwaved ice-lava hot pockets for every meal, and we LIKED IT
---
/s, instant pots are actually amazing
---
It is going go be a blast! Shameless plug if you are absorbing classic content:
---
https://youtu.be/4nC05u2F2Ys
---
I thought that too, but then noticed that he was outleveling all of those mobs. Have to imagine that accounts for something.
---
Nobody said they're exact.
---
The person I initially responded to said he appreciated authentic vanilla videos to make a comparison with. Nothing wrong with that. But looking at those same videos is exactly what private servers did to get their values as accurate as possible.
---
I understand it. Everyone's antsy and most of the people that are still very active in the sub are not in the beta (or else they would be very active on the beta) so they get a little stir crazy.
---
poor toddler getting called out on his lies and having a tantrum.  would be cute if you weren't an adult
---
Weekdays are the slowest where I work so this just means I might actually be able to request a day off. I also work mornings so I'm usually off by 5pm. I'll be able to work a full shift on Monday and still be there the second the game goes live. This release schedule could not be better for me.
---
TBC dungeon Shattered Halls can be cheesed the same way without completing the key questline.
---
Honestly I think being totally naked would be an advantage if someone broke in, you'd be able to shit in your hand and throw it at them.
---
WC seems pretty good from what i have seen but i would like the damage numbers brought up i saw many people solo'ing 2 mobs at a time without much struggle but that could be because of gear, but from what i remember at lower levels even with good gear pulling 2 mobs most of the time left you at 10% health about and three mobs was GG but for the most part i would say blizzard has done a good job at bringing classic back, but there is still work to be done
---
Monkey see monkey do. Kids watching streamers will start ninjaing too
---
You sound like a T_D poster
---
I think bears can definitely tank some raids. I don't think they will be able to tank aq40 or naxx, at least not every boss. I would be happy to be proven wrong, but keep in mind private servers are not the same thing as actual vanilla. Just because something could be some there doesn't mean it was viable in retail.
---
+1 for druid. Play kitty to save mana, only use the mana for heals. No downtimes at all.
---
He has leveled to 60 over 50 times, I don't think there's another person more qualified for beta.
---
god i wanna go home so bad im stuck here in BFA pulling my hair out
---
Brother.
---
he didn't get an invite until day 2 btw
---
Half of this is weirdly good advice in general. Drink only water, make quick nutritious meals with an instant pot, cardio routine...
---
The job quitting and sleep schedule are different issues, but we could all use more of the other stuff
---
Wait, Joana is a dude?
---
"this subredit is toxic"
---
68% upvoted. Apparently it's not THAT toxic. Guess it's just the vocal minority who give us a bad name.
---
I don't need a clickbait video to realize you;re a fucking moron.
---
it's ok i'm just a retard
---
it had a 100k viewers too.
---
Idk he's pretty good geared for his level, he also always plays with esfand and sometimes even more, so naturally the mobs will be very easy for him.
---
If they do send invite, which is sort of unlikely on the WE, and if it follows previous days, the putative time is 6pm PST/ 9pm EST/ whatever it is in EU atm (midnight?)
---
After watching his stream for the past month, I'd say you are both right.  He can be rational but he knows his chat and knows how to set them off.
---
The music in the 2nd video gave me anxiety
---
TI fucking L. Will have to test this come August... or should I say December when I‚Äôm finally leveled enough to run Scholo hahah
---
rofl what a shitshow
---
After reading the wiki on AQ, if I read it all correctly, you need to do everything before getting the quest the bang the gong. As long as you complete the questline and turn in that final quest within the 10 hours you are fine. The gong doesnt ring and the questline begins, by the time someone rings the gong most should already have some if not most of the questline already complete if your not a casual.
---
So I heard last night that blizzard reps responding to email declined an eve online streamer access to the beta citing he was to small of a streamer. I guess they did. Ot stop to think spreading across gaps to appeal to other types was a good idea.
---
Like i said asmongold says he played classic and with his Memory being as good as it is with alot of wow stuff its almost proof here that he did not play in classic everyone knows you do one torch at a time.....
---
We're missing Leeroy XD
---
You are not prepared!  For barrens chat!
---
Just another clip showcasing that mob damage seems really low.
---
It's real lol. There still might be a YouTube video up somewhere with it.
---
Are posts like this really a solution though?
---
Can‚Äôt believe people still have error speech on o.o
---
Most waves have been at like 8EST -ish. I wouldn't doubt today would be any different if they even send invites.
---
nice i re subbed just for beta good to know i have a chance to get into it
---
How much damage is he supposed to do?
---
Yes exactly. Towelliee followed the hype and whether he enjoys it now or not doesn‚Äôt matter because instead of acknowledging that he actively shit on it he tried to act like he was for classic from the start.
---
I hope they send out invites today, maybe not tho because the weekend
---
You have some excellent points my dude. I too would like to see bears tank most raids, but even on pservers it's only the top guilds that have dual wield tanks.
---
And 1.9.0 hit the servers on the 3rd of January 2006 so it certainly fits with the video description
---
It looks like mobs hit for 1/3 the damage they are supposed to, and regen rates during combat are doubled. I was a healer in classic, and warrior tanks would sometimes get pummeled, and I'd be spamming the heals and to barely keep them up. This was the case for all levels and instances, not just level 60. If anything level 60 was easier after tanks got good gear.
---
Elite dmg seems to Be off. Inside and outside Dungeons.
---
Can you prove that
---
Imagine going to twitch and watching any streamer for hours on end lol losers
---
Yeah, they redid SFK in Cata so I‚Äôm not sure how worthwhile it is to compare the two. Also, I‚Äôm pretty sure the video he posted is from the Cata beta so that adds another level of sketchiness to it.
---
Dunno. I don't want to play beta and spoil the fun and wait of release. It's like receiving naked selfies before a first date. Be patient and enjoy the real deal.
---
Our personal views about what constitutes "major change" differ somewhat. For me shadows, grass, etc. do not change the graphics enough to worth mentioning. But that's a subjective thing.
---
All in all I think we broadly agree. :)
---
I guess the point is though that there a ton of opinions on this, but hardly anyone seems to bring up factual evidence. "Something feels off" is hardly convincing. 
---
Its certainly possible that stuff is off though, however i don't know if Esfand, who from what i heard atleast has pretty little actual Vanilla experience, and a lot more pserver experience should be the "go to guy" on stuff like this. 
---
All in all we can't thrust pserver data to be correct, any movies from 1.1 to 1.11 might not be helpfull as vanilla was changes a lot going from 1.1 to 1.12.1 so anything in lets say a movie shot during 1.5 might not be correct in a 1.12.1 setting. Basicly we can only validate the beta with data collected from movies we know that are shot during 1.12.1
---
All other data could not be correct in a 1.12.1 setting.
---
Yeah I see what you mean.
---
I saw arugal teleport when venruki ran it with sonydigital and others
---
i got downvoted for commenting that i got in beta, and further downvoted when i said guild mates got in as well. people in threads say to post it you get in, then you get downvoted for confirming. 
---
i get that maybe it was because i assumed it was a f&amp;f invite, but my husband on the same list didn't get in. could be just that i had my account since early 2005.i don't know, but it's dumb that people ask, then downvote.
---
Exactly.
---
I think the issue is too many people on this subreddit never played real WoW and only know private servers so they are loyal to them and think they are the reason behind classic which is just insane to think.
---
No toys in classic
---
Private servers made tons of guesses on how shit worked. Now you can see what the private servers got wrong.
---
Nope, I spent the end of vanilla and all of TBC in Defiance
---
Name a sub for a game that isn‚Äôt toxic
---
How much damage is he suppsoed to be doing to him?
---
Can‚Äôt wait to troll retail kids by sleeping hogger as they try to kill him.
---
Look guys! A wild incel!
---
He's probably talking about xqc
---
Congratulations! Just had a colleague tell me he got in yesterday. He's a vanilla vet from EU
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=43/squires-boots is it tho.
---
thanks
---
 I always pronounced his name Jo-ana, but is it?  I just realized it could also be pronounced like Jo-nah lol
---
It was made easy on purpose for the streamers, so wow could get hyped and get viewers.
---
In some places (I'm thinking of Prince Malchezar in particular), you could nudge a boss backwards through a closed door to force them to reset.
---
Nobody knows how much he is supposed to do. On private servers rares are pretty tough so most have their bias from there.
---
Is everyone posting on this sub fucking autistic
---
Yeah for real. I was pretty surprised to hear he didn‚Äôt make the first wave of invites. Seems like he should‚Äôve been top of their list. But then again blizzard had only recently acknowledged the guy who‚Äôs been doing DBM all these years so you never know.
---
Dude.. he does it for content. The beta access is a way of peomoting the game, building hype. Asmon hit 100k viewers yday. Fucking tipsoit has 7-10k viewers. It is insane.
---
I do not think this is accurate. The video you linked he was getting Shadow Bolted for 245. Asmon was also getting Shadow Bolted for around 230. In the old video, you do not see a white hit I think.
---
52+ as mage is a breeze. Always felt slow until then
---
So many jealous basement dwellers in this thread...
---
Ambient occlusion (HBAO+) makes a big difference in any game, visually. But obviously, any of these graphics improvements are only on the player's own screen, they don't affect the gameplay in any way at all.
---
I'm gonna say it. I don't care that you broke your elbow!
---
Except the damage is wrong lmfao. Have you WATCHED people pull dungeon mobs  on stream yet?
---
This is not just a rare. It's a rare ELITE.
---
Hi, /u/iMP_Kayn
---
Firefall RIP
---
cmon bro, that's 30 year old boomer, not doomer
---
Thanks for the updates!
---
I think the main thing too about why "hard" becomes ok and even more rewarding and fun is the fact that everyone is also struggling so when you achieved something, it becomes much more special!
---
he was never an anti classic person. he just wasn't 100% on board with the idea. is isn't an all or nothing topic.
---
That 245 hit was NOT a basic attack but a void bolt. Asmongold gets hit by that at 38:20 for 259 damage.
---
about 3 times more. No crit, no crushing blow. Looks like this is bfa.
---
I played undead in vanilla wow and am pretty familiar with this side of the map. Rares in general are tough, and ones that are 8 levels higher than you shouldn't be doing the same amount of damage regular mobs are.
---
OP said he was going to run PUGs for the bindings, so no.
---
Whats Rppvp
---
That's a charitable interpretation of OP's intentions. I may be a jerk but I also may be right and the damage values are intended. What then? Blizzard's credibility is damaged, and OP takes zero responsibility (and is in fact rewarded via spurious attention and internet points). I've already seen people linking this thread gloating that there is now 'proof' that mobs in SFK do half the damage they should. Do you see what I mean? **Because of this thread** alone there is now a new portion of the community who will never believe that classic is actual vanilla. It won't matter if blizzard says they've checked the values and found them correct, they will just assume blizzard is lying. 
---
Bad thread, I don't like it.
---
PS.  Nelson Mandela died in 2013
---
ITT: bunch of retards asking for ‚Äúproof‚Äù when anyone that‚Äôs played classic already knows the damage is fucked in the beta
---
Hopefully they report it to blizzard and they check it out. It may very well be a bug, it does sound a little weird but at the same time, We can‚Äôt base classic off of memory or private servers
---
that that rare should be fucking him up
---
It will be a really fun time to experiment with people who have more open minds about that stuff. Vanilla was a very strict time so I don't think we actually got to push the limits of what was possible.
---
Not only that, but they should be near impossible to kill
---
They have to be, it's insane
---
I mean if some guy came in with hot takes on Euler's Identity or something I'd question his math knowledge.
---
source?
---
Yes and I like it.
---
Well, its Friday now, but yes. Its was Tuesday for the longest time.
---
I've been playing a private server and I honestly "forget" that i'm on one if that makes sense.
---
You can pretend super hard that you're in the beta too. Takes some mental gymnastics but it works.
---
/r/whoooosh
---
LOLOOLLOLL. You think blizzard is gonna scour through streams just to find the exact second where it occured. HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Mods need to step in.
---
You stopped playing because of the pvp was bad at 13? That's a lot of insight to have as a 13 year old
---
Funny how small piece the 1-29 is, with this pace it will take asmongold amonth of daily playtime to hit 60
---
I mean last time people were saying Regen was wrong with no proof, and it was right
---
I don't get how people can knock vanilla when they haven't tried it in 15 years
---

---
It **was** possible back in vanilla with same technique, but we don't know for sure it was still there in 1.12. There are 3 videos from vanilla 2006 showing it can be done.
---
Play on private server dont play so much you burnout but familiarize yourself with the quests youll be doing maybe just level 1-20 or 1-30  couple levels a day
---
Keep in mind: the mob is not elite &amp; Asmon is a warrior in defensive stance, with mail armor and a shield.
---
Ruthless killers?
---
I think that's a bit much for the sub reddit let's leave that to the servers
---
How is it misleading? I don't see where it says anything about whether it's Time or XP so you can't make an assumption to one or the other.   
---
With the context of the title you know it's XP.  
---
Not misleading at all
---
The level 17 healer healing the level 17 warrior in that run never went OOM either.  I was confused.
---
I'm not a fan of the streamer either, but read that comment one more time.  
---
He said that the streamer is making *a* community.  Not once in that comment did he say that he's making *the entire* community.
---
Wholesome comment here.
---
This is the guy for whom  Blizzard should have been on their knees BEGGING to be in the beta.  
---
But they have never even reached out to him personally.
---
Dumb fucks.
---
/r/woosh
---
There is a YouTube video from blizzcon where they explain they still have to reimplement plenty of formulas even though they have the database correct. There are plenty of calculations and formulas that aren't correct in the new 7.X client they are building from. 
---
We need to stop this "database is perfect" conversation because its inaccurate and is derailing perfectly reasonable bug reporting.
---
&gt;That's interesting, but also why are you spending so much energy trying to convince this streamer?
---
Not really trying to convince Esfand specifically. It's just one of the many questions we have had about Paladins for years and it's one of multiple mechanics that are really easy to confirm, and yet nobody in the Beta actually care about testing any of it, and would rather just treat the server as a place to level up and have fun over using it as an actual Beta.
---
&gt;Also, I'm not really sure why there's a concern about who gets credit for stuff like this. I don't think Blizzard recognizes stuff like that do they? 
---
Personally I dont care if I get credit for it. It's just annoying the credit go to someone who has been actively fighting us every step of the way only to do a 180 and pretend to be surprised when it actually gets confirmed.
---
Ahhh, okay. I see.
---
The items you start with have no armor, you absolute pleb.
---
Hardware does not make your spells or melee hits hit harder.
---
He uses his viewers to attack anyone who calls him out. Look at this joke of a thread that his stream brigaded.
---
Agreed. Some seem to do the exact same as regular mobs.
---
They would never revert things that they've changed to make "more efficient" or "more convenient".
---
Well, what will probably happen is he'll have have the scepter for quite a while before the server part is finished. It'll be interesting to see how many others have it by the time the gate is ready. I guess it will also depend on the feelings of the server community if they'll just let him have it or if they'll make it more of a free-for-all.
---
And for not considering private server video as evidence for a change.
---
&gt; The layering issue is contentious exactly because it impacts gameplay, regardless of how logical it is. 
---
Without it, servers would be a nightmare, especially if they expect the numbers to be high. You wouldn't be able to get anything done. Servers would end up having population problems (too many or too little) because of people spreading out on different servers. 
---
The only way for them to manage this game properly with the amount of people they expect, is to do it this way. Otherwise everyone is going to have a bad time for the first couple of weeks of launch.
---
But your argument is, "Tradition before anything else", which again, is bullshit. You'd rather sacrifice the health of the game to keep it pure. 
---
It's like you insisting on taking the beat up, raggity, shitty car to Disney World for your family trip because that's the car you always took when you were younger. Never mind the fact that it has mechanical problems and may not make the trip at all. No, what's important to you is that feeling that old car gets. That's fucking insane. 
---
&gt; Blizzard themselves are aware of this and that's why they promised to remove it as soon as they could, exactly because it affects gameplay again.
---
No, because people got pissed and ***still are*** despite it making logical sense. They're doing this, not because they care about authenticity, they just don't want to deal with the thousands of crazy, illogical and irrational players. 
---
&gt; That is a difficult solution to a difficult problem. 
---
That's an easy solution (they have the tech and at least a decade of experience with this exact issue) to an easy problem. The only thing that makes it difficult is the rabid people that see it as a problem. 
---
&gt; Maybe if you hardened the fuck up about having to wait for mob spawns you'd feel a bit better about this.
---
What I'll do, along with probably everyone else, is just skip that quest and do something else. It won't be worth my time waiting. So instead of people experiencing that part of the game, they'll just not do it. Which is weird considering you have a chance to make it something that people will do by making a simple change that won't effect anything. 
---
Which I just don't get. 
---
"Remember that quest that ***no one*** did in Vanilla because it was awful / not worth it? It's still not worth doing! I feel so good about how ***authentic*** this game feels." 
---
You're fucking crazy, dude.
---
Can I get a screenshot of this e-mail? It seems bizarre that they'd reply with that instead of just the copy/paste "invites are random" etc e-mail they have.
---
i am 39 years old and i played it in the times, and i remember it very well.
---
same shit happened with overwatch, everyone was pissed because they wanted to play beta and the streamers and friends family were in it and they weren‚Äôt. sucks to watch someone else play something you really want to get your hands on.
---
It really makes all the people commenting on this thread look really dumb. This item has no armor type and is missing armor which it should have. He 100% correctly submitted a bug and people are losing their shit.
---
Didn't they already mention from the blizzcon panel that all the database data from 1.12 could be directly transfered and it was the source code they had to engineer to work with 1.12
---
Waaaaay more people are complaining about the mob damage. I figured the regen was correct, and even I can tell the damage is 100% fucked. 
---
A level 34 rare elite barely scratching asmongold at level 25-26. Cyclonian barely doing enough damage to warrant healing against a level 30. Nobody dropping below 85% hp in dungeons unless they pull 15 mobs? Seems right
---
How many of those millions expressed interest in playing though?
---
I'm not sure if they'll be inviting people every day. I know they said after every stress test, they'll do batches of invites.
---
Blizz need to address the growing amounts of "sub-evidence". Yes, it's hard to find 2006  video evidence on a particular mob. No, they still must double- and triple- check to ensure that Classic is as hard as it's supposed to be.
---
\&gt;Implying being autistic is bad
---
10 years ago was wotlk. You sure it wasn't changed in tbc or wrath?
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/sharding-after-latest-server-restart/175660/87
---
So either something about their combat calculations is seriously messed up or the claim that they have the database from back then is a lie. Or he just deals no damage and the beta is right.
---
 No idea which of the above it is. We'll see what blizzard does.
---
Find a new friend
---
get out of internet old fart, go back to a museum or something for your age, your memory is WAY off
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain they do but I‚Äôll make another character to confirm.
---
I mean, his real name is Paul if that helps you.
---
Dam right!
---
Yea, I'm gonna play ret Paladin. Might be in my favor that my endgame goal is 5mans, but still, it's gonna be so nice to get accepted in groups despite not playing "the optimal" specc.
---
Dude.... it's a piece of starting gear. It's not supposed to have an armor value. Do some research and shave your oily neck beard before raging at the entire thread about it.
---
Yes play couple toons in private servers to 30 or something.
---
So what you're saying it that you have no proof
---
Why do you care if someone gets the Battle Tank? It's not like the average player can get it anyway so why do you care?  Sounds like you want something to be salty about because you can't get it.
---
I'd imagine they have been automatic, so there's no real reason they wouldn't be sent to invite over the weekend.
---
Lol you guys ever just consider shutting the fuck up and just playing the game? Or better yet, not playing the game?
---
If you're trying to excel and do well in a raid guild, Warrior easily requires the largest time environment. It's like playing 2 and a half characters all at the same time since you'll need a set of dps gear, a set of tank gear, and a pvp gear if you want to do that too. Prot Warrior is the most difficult to gear, and requires a lot of expensive BoEs if you're trying to max out (although it's not necessarily required). DPS Warrior has some expensive BoEs too.
---
You want to PvP as Arms, but you want to raid as Fury or Prot, so respeccing gets very expensive as well. All of this plus consumables etc means you may want to also level a farm class (Hunter).
---
If you want to just fuck off and casually tank dungeons or whatever then sure of course. You can play any class casually.
---
Your friend is right on the money, the corpse run can take 15 min per death, it's big waste of time.
---
So no source.
---
Oh shit I mixed them up.
---
HALP US RNJESUS!!!! HAAAAAAALP
---
Just avoid streamer‚Äôs servers they will announce what server they are on. Most will go PvE so that‚Äôs good for the rest of us on pvp servers.
---
I used to run up on the roof, jump down and repeat until I died.. :-P
---
A someone who played a priest I can tell you the damage is WAY OFF. I don't need to know the exact values, all I need to know is how long it took for my mana to run out from healing the warrior tank. The amount of damage they are taking is probably 1/3 of actual classic values, and the mana regen is also higher. I remember watching a warrio's health go to half right after a pull if he got 3-4 mobs, and having to spam heals just to keep them alive. On boss fights, you would almost always go OOM, yet people don't even use half their mana in a boss fight. The healers are just standing there most of the time, doing nothing.

On a PvE server,  you don't get the sense of danger when roaming around the world. It's just not the same.
---
What community is he making?
---
I think the major issue is not about gatekeeping newcomers, it's that streamers who have very little understanding/experience about Vanilla WoW are being given priority Beta access to an extremely limited-population Beta test that hinges on the players reporting issues that they should know pretty well that deviate from what is expected from Vanilla WoW. "Newcomers" have no place in that sort of environment, and can offer no useful feedback or bug reports when they don't know what's correct or not. It's not the public availability release period of Classic, where the addition of newcomers is going to play a part in the success of the game. It's a Closed Beta where only a very small collection of people are being allowed in. The people complaining about it are simply wanting to maximize the effective feedback of this Beta test to ensure that we get the most polished and accurate experience come release.
---
I had 180ish days played during vanilla, I could not tell you the damage value of a single mobs aas, yet you expect me to believe you remember the damage of a particular rare mob hidden away in a cave? Yea, I call bullshit.
---
i have a memory of you swiming in ur fathers egg while i played wow back in the days.
---
Guild hopping is mostly the concern. If you gear out an MT and then he gets TF from your mediocre guild, he may jump to a better guild that will take him because he has TF.
---
I was at the top of my game in Vanilla, but I actually did love WotLK, even more so than BC. Objectively though, I'll admit that BC was a better expansion.
---
Pick and pray
---
I might be mistaken but I'm not seeing much of a difference between those videos.  He whacks asmongold for about 115 with his staff, but his shadowbolts are doing 250ish in both videos.  The major difference I can see between those videos is the behaviour.  In the old one he teleports around more, casts fear, and almost exclusively casts shadowbolt instead of autoattacking.
---
Yup, it's 100% envy.
---
They don't have data for all versions of vanilla but they said they have everything for 1.12.1
---
https://youtu.be/Xlg6BqyaTIQ
---
Yeah Rockstar, shut the fuck up.
---
Unsubbed.
---
Well that's his main thing these days
---
yet there are other streamers out there I love to watch? I think its actually their personality, not all just some.
---
Great dude some roleplayers had their rp messed with for a bit go to a private forum if youre scared of interruption we all pay 15$ we can go and do as we please
---
RP servers lul
---
I am a pathetic loser with a thick asss wife in my 30's and I do not dislike streamers please do not stereotype all of us... thank you
---
Here is the blizzcon panel discussing wow classic code in detail https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM
---
Just having the database doesn't mean all the formulas in the 7.X client are accurate and won't misenterpret the database values.
---
LEL. The puppetmaster has revealed his true form!
---
he's a comedian that had a show on MTV.
---
Don't be discouraged if this doesn't happen immediately, though. There will be a massive influx at the start of players just trying it out, and they won't stay. We'll get there! Foster this attitude on your characters, I love it. Old players love it. Can't wait to see you on that fields of battle! May the wind be at your back.
---
All i can find in terms of video content it's doing the exact same damage as the post cata version. Knowing that most content was nerfed after cata it's a pretty safe guess it should be dealing much more as an elite in classic.
---
Edgy cata kid post number 78
---
it's okay Joe
---
normalization does'nt apply to auto attacks, and even if you refer to the normalization of hunter pet damages the untamed version didn't get affected
---
If you want to speak on behalf of Blizzard despite their express comments go right ahead, but don't expect me to read your idiotic, baseless condescenion any longer. Can't believe you actually think Blizzard is only removing layering because they're worried about backlash. You're the lunatic here.
---
I almost asked for it :')
---
My point stands. If MT leaves the guild is quite fucked. And no, not giving TF to MT is not a solution.
---
We far from home boys.
---
good to know I didn't 100% waste this sub :D
---
Jealous of having to put my face in front of a camera? lol.. Soda and Asmon are way better looking than me. I'm not a streamer hater though.
---
Nah, Asmongolds not a cancer. You, and the rest of his fandom, are the cancer.
---
classic beta is pretty much bfa with vanilla models, faceroll content what a joke
---
For real. I've been playing WoW literally for years and I have never once had the displeasure of being impacted by a streamer. At this point the circle jerk against streamers is taking away my enjoyment of the game, not the streamers.
---
Not toys though, just usables
---
Oh 100%.
---
Lots of envious people here.
---
Generic statements like this are just as annoying as the people you are talking about. No, not all of us don't like streamers because they are jealous. Some of the streamers  are fucking annoying and rude. Some aren't. Dumb blanket statements like this are just as dumb as the streamer hate.
---
Did he say he needed to turn on auto loot at the end? Don‚Äôt remember that being a vanilla feature..
---
Buddy, you're 100x more invested in this conversation than I am. I don't care about what you have to say.
---
Just wait a few lvls
---
And I said running pugs for bindings hurts your guild because it prevents you from being there to help the guild when they do runs for bindings, so yes.
---
I can't believe how many idiots are saying in the comments he got paid by Blizz or he does it for the money...
---
so it was you who sucked my daddy's balls back in the day before he met my mom? holy shit, nice to know, you sucked him dry?
---
Oh no people on the internet are toxic. Who would have thought. kek

---
Stitches is not aggressive nor is the town afraid.
---
Which rogue do you know that only contributes 1% of raid damage in a 20-30 man raid?
---
Sorry, maybe I'm a classic/vanilla newbie, but is it worth to bounce around/between the zones constantly? The traveling time would cost too much imo, compared to the earned XP if you stay relatively in one or two zones, no?
---
I see this now - but why is the bosses damage output so much lower. Look at the old video and he is throwing out 250 damage every couple of seconds.
---
Secondly, look at the son of Arugal damage done to Asmon, they are hitting him for 35 damage. That's not even 5% of his hp per hit for an elite mob almost the same level as him, it should literally be 2-3x that amount.
---
This is probably because a lot of these streamers and people who got invited previously made themselves out to be vanilla experts. Then they get into the beta and fail completely and report things that aren't broken. I can understand people getting frustrated about that.
---
Yea, these people are wack jobs man. Right now, I don't know what's gonna kill classic off first, blizzard or the community.
---
FUCKING NORMIES! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
GIVE THIS MAN A MEDAL
---
Fucking christ you guys are toxic as hell. Let him do his thing.
---
right here
---
I'd like to as well... Do you remember what the drop rates are like?
---
I loved the way he said should we do Legion pull or something before and he got so pump-up its obviously wont work there is not enough space to poly the caster and to kite the rest of the mobs \^-\^
---
logia
---
Fear ward will be dispelled and purged.
---
Finally, a good meme on this sub!
---
I don‚Äôt main one, but I have a Panda Shaman because my guild needs pandas for the Classy achievement so we can get the last bank tab
---
I'm obviously the best Vanilla Warlock.. Even though I didn't  start playing Warlock or raiding until BC.
---
His own followers are his community, and that becomes especially true if they end up following him around in game.
---
https://i.imgur.com/Hoks0hh.png
---
It's doing correct damage.
---
No me.
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone can say much about who will be the best vanilla players -now-. 
---
With that being said, given their dominance and extremely high experience on private servers and vanilla, you can count on watching Monkeynews (moo_uk on twitch, currently streaming) for top level warrior PvP and PvM gameplay and Perplexity (perplexitycya on twitch) for high high high hiiighhh end rogue PvP gameplay
---
perfect start for a work vacation :)))
---
honestly, you just described most game subreddits.
---
bringing out the ol' game box image is a certified way to farm easy karma, especially if you include a sob story title.
---
They have the 1.12 database values but sometimes the way the client/server interprets those values has changed. Check out this blizzcon explanation of the restoration. 
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM
---
They had to reimplement formulas for things like pet loyalty and pet leveling as noted in the video. It seems fair to assume some damage formulas might have small bugs and overlooked pieces as well.
---
&gt;Why would I watch someone play a video game I want to play when I could just play it?  
---
same reason you'd watch sports  
---
   
---
OT: I agree and would 100% roll on a streamer free server
---
Evidence shows it's correct
---
If you don't have work/life/family and are prepared to queue for four hours if you disconnect. Then choose a high pop server, it'll be easier after a few days. If you only have x amount of hours you can play each night, choose a low pop server.
---
yea this shit is fucked up, actiblizzard needs to get their shit together its been really frustrating watching people aggroing 5 mobs at once and nothing happening at all, warriors/rogues soloing elites like its nothing, rares hitting like pussies
---
Are you an idiot with the memory of a goldfish or are you just not reading my responses?

As I mentioned before, the 1% the difference between the geared rogue you're missing because he's off doing his PUG and literally any other pre-raid geared DPS class.

However, 3 months isn't that much. A TBC private server had launched few months ago. They had a decent-sized team that worked for half a year. Everyone was saying half a year isn't enough, and they were right. The server turned out to be so bugged that its online has fallen from 4k to like 100. 
---
Now, that's not a good example, but fixing WoW isn't really easy. I'm somewhat afraid Blizz fail and pretend it works as intended.
---
Hear hear.
---
Me
---
it's actually  
---
lvl 32 = 25% complete  
---
lvl 44 = 50% complete  
---
lvl 52 = 75% complete
---
eyyy feelsgoodman!
---
 I made a slightly less useless diagram[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq847f/diagram\_of\_the\_average\_time\_needed\_each\_lvl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq847f/diagram_of_the_average_time_needed_each_lvl/)
---
I don't hate streamers. I hate the fanboi streamer communities. They're horrible.
---
No. Get the fuck out of here with your weak ass bullshit empty blanket statement. Throwing out garbage posts saying "people are wah wah wah" is just as toxic as those who do complain about pointless shit.  Show some evidence to back up what your claiming or don't post at all. The majority of posts I've seen here are regular ass people excited to play classic wow. That's why they are here.
---
It can be done with 5.
---
I understand what you are saying, I really do but its not really accounting for the massive amount of variables. Hell, nothing could account for those variables. Thats is why I think its best to just base rare stuff like that on loyalty to the guild and guild participation etc. Difference of opinions but I am sure this will happen in many guilds once Classic releases. Will be interesting to see all the posts on the forums about it, lol
---
Just remember there is a reason why classic or vanilla was so popular.  Yes it was new, but it stands up to time.  And I think everyone will be suprised how many people come to join.  
---
I expect server crashes on launch for underestimating the potential population
---
This relies on the assumption you can find a pug.
---
From Asmongold stream:
---
Stiches is natural. Doesn't attack players, doesn't attack guards in Darkshire either. After some time he de-spawns.
---
No he's not elite, are you blind? What's wrong with you?
---
Stickies are usually on a rotation, but with the beta out I guess beta related will be up for a while. Just ask :)
---
Yeah it's one of the daily stickies, can't remember the day. Just ask them in here maybe someone can help you, then repost in the sticky if need be
---
I watched his presentation at blizzcon three times because he seemed so passionate about the classic cause. It was obvious he plays a huge part in this whole thing, to the point of without him we may not be where we are today.
---
You the man Omar.
---
LMAO your post history is hilarious, you spend all of your time on the classic sub hating on it.
---
Best of luck soldiers!
---
Actually he's in the Beastiary. https://i.imgur.com/Hoks0hh.png
---
Are you talking about the beta or speculating about in 3 months from now?
---
PvP or PvE?
---
No question is too small :) Just ask away!
---
The numbers aren‚Äôt high enough
---
You can 20 man MC in T2 gear. It was an easy raid. Any guild that has it on farm is not going to care about missing one rogue.
---
As someone who has played the beta, uhhhhhh no? I've wiped so many damn times to mobs. If you pull more than one you're fucked and need to run away.
---
great question as they need a lot of players to make a stress test or?
---
as evident by old footage from actual vanilla there are ALOT of things wrong in the classic beta.
---
Jesus were murlocs really that fast back in vanilla?
---
Streamers aren't there to report bugs. They're there to build hype and to entice the masses.
---
That said, I still find it shitty not to report bugs during a beta.
---
Yea it's a bit tongue in cheek but I can't help it. People take this sub so serious, yet apparently not serious enough to do more then complain. Your hot take on this situation included (honestly). 
---
I for one find the elitism much worse then our toxicity problem.
---
I called myself a jackass and got a 2 day suspension or whatever Lmao
---
&gt; Soda and Asmon are way better looking than me. 
---
Bro, you gotta respect yourself a little more, even if this was just a joke. You are a beautiful spawn of this universe!
---
The overblown surprised retard face he makes every 10 seconds is quite something
---
I can't claim to know what kind of numbers they had to guesstimate, but while I'm sure they did watch videos like this to get an approximation, it's still just that.  Isn't it possible they got their numbers around the same place but armor affects things slightly differently on classic, etc?
---
As always, no source, no comparable proof, no nothing.
---
Meanwhile he‚Äôs playing a warrior, in a group, and has basically been thinking his way through the past 10 levels because they‚Äôre taking it slow.   
---
Good luck with your memories. Snooze.
---
Do you really want to convince him just to see him get angry at you every time he gets ganked XD?
---
whatever prolongs the classic experience, i'm all for it.
---
Correct. The mob is just a rare, not an elite. All this video seems to be showing is that weapon skill calculations are probably not correct. Lack of glancing/crushes/crits seem to be a problem throughout beta.
---
People love to bitch on reddit. 
---
Including myself.
---
Is it here here or hear hear? Hmmmmmmm
---
Since its classic it should be around .05% off any mob in SFK. They later changed it so only bosses dropped it.
---
I farmed them both on several servers, wasnt terrible, but i have an addiction for farming useless items so idk.
---
Asmongold dungeon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQI3mMqUgGw
---
SFK retail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjb6fwRRc_8 
---
The damage as far as I can see looks just fine?
---
I thought he despawned after a certain time? Could be wrong though
---
Send me a message and I'll throw down on access.
---
I don't think you can stand to be wrong.
---
who hurt you?
---
Scamming people has never been allowed.
---
I will do the same as when I started playing Vanilla, pick the realm with the coolest name.
---
The popular streamers probably don't need to report bugs, since the devs are going to see the clips anyway.
---
You can take Bajeera and soda off plz.
---
This is not a good comparison because Moonguard was not founded initially by streamers or a bunch of streamer followers.
---
Furthermore, how many servers in Vanilla were picked by Internet communities as their hub?
---
The ancient site, SomethingAwful had their goonsquad folk swarming Mal'ganis and creating insane drama, and then a splinter group, tired of all the drama, decided to make their own guild after being labeled ‚ÄúElitist Jerks‚Äù by the community and the rest is history.
---
Streamers are cancer
---
Retail players are irritating
---
Can‚Äôt wait to play and grief all you retail scrubs and stream snipe the big guys.
---
would it be possible too add cursor map co-ords ? possible make it easier for self made custom routes. This is awesome though !
---
See: Buru
---
I‚Äôm so glad Ziqo and Xaryu are playing classic
---
Uh I cant give you a source I'm sorry. I just saw a comment here on reddit.
---
I dont watch streamers I just want to take advantage of their followers.
---
Nefaru is not an elite.
---
Is this even a elite? Iird a rare = silver dragon icon, Rare Elite is a silver dragon icon with wings.
---
But I can't gank people on reddit ??
---
Maybe you should get some air.
---
&gt;Fucking god bless ~~you~~ me
---
I definitely agree that it's highly likely that some numbers are off. We saw with the spell crit damage modifier in the demo that copy&amp;pasting the old data into a new framework can lead to unintended consequences. 
---
We are in a little bit of an awkward situation right now because everyone who plays (or watches) the beta will have his personal opinion on whether or not stuff "feels" right. This feeling can rarely be backed up with footage from vanilla and is usually based on (unreliable) 15 year old memories or (obviously unreliable) private servers comparisons. 
---
But it's the best we as the playerbase can do. The only ones that can say with certainty are blizzard developers with their 1.12 client + server files.
---
And I really hope that despite the fact that it's easy to say "oh you guys just misremember" or "you are just used to scuffed private servers" they will take these concerns seriously and spend the time and effort to make sure the numbers will turn out correct.
---
Not to be ment as a joke he looks like he is 12-14
---
I've seen a few comments like mine already, but just want to echo that currently in the beta the community has been great, everyone is helpful and the chat isn't even as bad as I would have expected. 
---
It's all forum/reddit salt.
---
The slow pace of classic lets you get into the groove in a much more natural manner than later expacs, go for it!
---
The Pie is a lie
---
So its okay to promote streamers here, who have nothing to do with the actual game, but once criticism comes, its "toxic"? You are essentially curating a forced "positive" ground where select streamers can promote their work.
---
This is why so many of us dont want this stuff on this subreddit. This should about the game, not the people who play it.
---
Well it is either that or not play together, unfortunately!
---
You're right, my bad!
---
One of these for chests please. :)
---
It is simply the class we both want to play. I have 0 desire to play a warrior.
---
Please ask questions. We need something to break up this constant barrage of whining about beta.
---
That looked very bugged.
---
Great. There isn't enough time to fix all this shit. I KNEW this would be too good to be true. Guess we really are getting BFA that looks like classic üòÇüò≠
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo4Fn7tCjnFSBATOE0lEekA
---
Funny thing is, the mob is actually doing correct damage here, in the beastiary it says 47-63, so with high armour and defensive stance, the damage seems about right.
---
So, I thought he was supposed to go around and kill all the guards (hence why they're all low level like that) if no one can kill stitches?
---
And why did he turn neutral? He should be always hostile.
---
Oh sorry everyone just a rare mob, which still does more than normal mobs FYI
---
Nice, do you have the entire book online somewhere?
---
Honestly, I dont even remember these torches lol. I subbed in 2005 to wotlk, but I was also 15 years old and really dumb. Pretty sure he would of been around 15 years old as well
---
Even if he only said it once, it was said. He wanted to roll for the cloak. To not roll and expect to give it to someone outside of that run, is ninja looting. 
---
Maybe things just happened in a way where this wasn't certain to you guys, I can understand that. But with this conversation being had, its clear what needs to be done. If not, you guys are ninjas.
---
Wanting to run a raid with a promised loot if it drops is a legitimate reason.
---
Lol the murloc part was quite funny.
---
The sub is a joke. Change my mind.
---
Okay, you want to go be autistic freely? lmaooo
---
i should be ike u
---
Oh shit i remember playing with the EU guys on Moonglade EU. Im still in the guild. https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/moonglade/greenflower
---
I swear to God, this is the 10th fucking thread today about toxicity. 
---
Did the streamer cabal get together and organize this shit?
---
as august gets closer? you have more than 3 months lol...
---
That's why I made a new pie
---
He didn't report spider that was stuck in a tree as well.
---
Nice toxicity douche.
---
With the beastiary showing damage numbers to be correct only far from private servers I guess.
---
The purpose of beta isn't only to test thing, its also a hype machine. If it was 100% testing they'd hire some people to test stuff behind closed doors.
---
The despawning seems normal, however I'm sure Stitches used to attack the guards when he arrived in Darkshire.
---
yeah i was 14 but still remember ...played private servers and retail so i have a somewhat "fresher" memory on it lol plus i was a no life elitest durring this time also lol
---
Yeah makes sense, that was just a suggestion to make a compromise as well, for your friend.
---
I literally see no difference.
---
Pshh... they aren't useless. Also.. do you think old school wall climbing will be in the game?
---
Hyperbole, asmon thread had hundreds of positive comments. Just beause you dug through hundreds of comments and saw 1 negative one, all of a sudden this entire subreddit is toxic. Nothing I hate more than annoying wanna-bee mod carebears like you.
---
How true! If only people stopped downvoting questions ...
---
I love how people just throw that in where it makes no fucking sense.
---
The only bug here is that he is neutral which I'm guessing Asmongold didn't report because he didn't know that he should be hostile.
---
Seems to be correct to me based on the mobs damage values ([https://i.imgur.com/Hoks0hh.png](https://i.imgur.com/Hoks0hh.png)) and the fact that Asmon is a well geared tank for his level.
---
True but I‚Äòd still put it in because its not a 40man either.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/Hoks0hh.png](https://i.imgur.com/Hoks0hh.png) 
---
Stealing this image from the post below - dont jump to conclusions too fast boys.. Most people in here are 'feel-crafting' stories about vanilla, that might not be true..
---
He does if he has nothing to kill if I remember. It's been so long though(I've never played on private)
---
Yes, get off my subreddit.
---
me and my wife have been together since vanilla ( 14 years old) we are now 28 and 29 and we cleared naxx together....we have already had the talk lol
---
Non elite rares (silver portrait) always did comparable damage to mobs of the same type. They did usually have additional abilities not present on similar mobs and were usually higher level, however
---
Hahaha fuck no, this is guy is my spirit animal.
---
I love u
---
It's just a buzzword for a specific group of people that means "people I don't like"
---
Looks like you've got your answer then. You know what must be done.   
---
(Seriously, don't ruin your experience because he doesn't want to experience the game)
---
If it were common loot, I'd agree, but we're talking about 2x3% drop chances.
---
Nobody gives a shit what you think, that is the first step to be a part of here. The toxicity is part of WoW, but carebears like you just make it worse.
---
I second this notion.
---
In his own words "[He's] just a guy who streams wow".
---
Its all of you fucking obnoxious fanbois that are the goddamn cancer. All you followers to these streamers are why people hate streamers. You're literally a swarm of useful idiots that no one wants to be around.
---
&gt; The server will decide who is deserving and i don't think "having a big audience" as a reason will go down well with the rest of the population on their server.
---
Agreed. It doesn't matter if you're a streamer with a group of people following you at all times. All it takes is a more tryhard group with more people, and you will not be getting Scarab Lord. [Look at what APES did to Lezonta](https://youtu.be/YjG4UpuL84M?list=LLbT2MAlLMZBco8kFl-m0e8w&amp;t=335). Even if Lezonta had 20 lackies guarding him 24/7 he would still get wiped whenever they willed it.
---
Are you talking about this post? https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq5a9a/asmon_and_esfand_get_4_strength_4_stam_leather/
---
I see one guy trying to bitch about Asmongold who is heavily downvoted. And that's just because he doesn't like Asmond, nobody is ragging on him for the belt drop because they understand the 4 Stam 4 Str meme.
---
You do know the 4 Stam 4 Str meme right?
---
The boots had no armor in Vanilla.
---
lol i remember back in the day begging my mom for hot pockets lol so i could just game and eat lol
---
There is a first time for everything I suppose \^\^
---
Just so you are aware, in that first video from joana you have linked...he doesn‚Äôt have floating combat text up for damage taken. Those yellow 5‚Äôs that are popping up are serpent sting ticks.
---
Some have, yes but they were personally invited by GMs from my understanding.
---
I am watching MonkeyNews (moO_UK) https://www.twitch.tv/moo_uk do Gnomergan and some people were saying damage was too low. 
---
He is taking like 50-60 damage from the robot meks.
---
I found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shlghS5psDo 
---
If you go to 4:36-4:42 you will see the perspective of a cloth user (mage) taking 120 damage physical hits from the meks. Since MonkeyNews is a warrior and hes taking half the damage, I think the numbers are fine and accurate.
---
You need a sub to play, not to get invited.
---
You're technically correct, but words can meaning multiple things. It's pretty clear what he meant...
---
Wait, where are these videos from?  It can't be...Asmongold got world first SFK clear.
---
Sorry, no, I have a copy on my PC (250mb), but I don't know where I got it from.
---
Content doesn't scale to your level, and zones tend to be divided into three sectors with vastly different level requirements. It's very easy to outlevel entire zones during your early game (1-30), but it will eventually make you run out of quests completely. Systematically clearing relevant content results in a very smooth leveling experience irregardless of how good your class is at it.
---
well that was a common bug back in vanilla wow, I mean the wow devs are purposely recreating bugs from back then so that means this one should stay too.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree but you shouldn‚Äôt be getting banned for that.
---
Did you even read the thread?
---
Elites seem weak, maybe a normal to elite Auto scaling calculation being off?
---
yes i know the meme
---
Douchebag. You're complaining about toxic community yet you judge this entire subreddit as children while I guess you are the "highly mature 150 iq expert". Fuck off carebear.
---
It's a tab targeting MMO, so being "the best" by any margin that matters isn't really possible outside a few specific niches or when comparing teams. Need those small differences to add up. Almost impossible not to find some one who could do almost exactly what you do with minimal practice. 
---
I will say there is only one guild who has people near the ceiling for each class playing. And that's &lt;Apes&gt;
---
And the most important bit some of them make content. 
---
Guy named "monkeynewz" has a youtube channel. He seems to post most of their content. It might be difficult to track down but i'd bet most of the other classes have at least one guy streaming as well. I know for sure of at least one other 
---
I forget what the twich name was or i'd plug it....He uses grumpy cat as an avatar, played mage but he seems to like to switch. Xaffers or something is his twitch handle
---
It's not just about the guy you're being good unless it's a duel. You wanna get a good feel for the "meta" so you can slot into a premade/wpvp. And that requires the guy you're playing with to be surrounded by good people. 
---
There are good horde players in the private scene but their faction's best guild was decimated by bans early in the newest iteration of the big server. So there is very little content out there from them atm. And I'm not convinced they were ever as good as the best alliance guild anyway.
---
Any major game, its actually insane. I got a 14 day suspension from LoL for calling a guy who told me he'd kill my entire family an idiot.
---
They've converted the data to something that the current engine can work with; it's not impossible that things go wrong in such a process. Also the current engine may just interpret things differently; more or less server ticks per second with perhaps values that are tied to those ticks; I'm just speculating here but there's no guarantee that by working off a legit 1.12.1 db they'll automatically get it right.
---
Sure go ahead link the videos so we can see it
---
Fuck off carebear.
---
Hence the post. Definitely shouldn't be standing around like a braindead zombie.
---
that's not what hyperbole means.
---
Vanilla is so mechanically easy anyway it really just comes down to who has the most time, but I'd say Monkeynews for warrior 1v1s
---
Not video proof afaik. But plenty of people have witnessed this clearly incorrect mechanic
---
A pretty fleshed out Easter egg though. Wc3 manual had a page about Chen stormstout that talked about where he came from etc.
---
This is correct but him being neutral is a bug as he is supposed to be hostile.
---
Not me.
---
Stfu
---
Right? 400 for an hour will cook a small to medium whole roaster chicken.
---
&gt;Being able to mouseover kick/blind without losing combo points on your current target was not possible at any stage in retail vanilla.
---
???
---
Am I remembering wrong? Didn't you need to build new CPs on the new target before you lost them on the target you had CPs on?
---
How do you know any one person is more 'loyal' than another? If you fear a tank guild hopping wouldn't you equally fear any other person as well for the same reasons?
---
At the end of the day, for all the reasons already listed plus more that haven't I'm sure, It should always go to a tank first. It's intended to be a tank weapon, and it actually stays very powerful for a tank into the next expansion even. This is just too much of a sacrifice to give up to be worried about every tank gquitting. It would he easier in my opinion to form a strong and healthy relationship with a tank you can trust or roll one yourself! 
---
Hope this helps
---
And so they sit out on every MC raid every week and keep PUGing.
---
What's going to be more important, having your skilled rogue in all of your progressions fights that your guild has spent the better part of a year gearing up and working together with but not having them in an MC clear you sell to PUGS because you only need 20 alts to clear it?
---
Or having your skilled geared rogue quit the guild for less toxic pastures because you thought him wanting to do something else during a time when he wasn't really needed was more important than his own goals?
---
You're very upset.
---
ok this is important, a lot of people are subbing just to get a chance to participate in the beta. specially people who played in the original vanilla
---
Providing evidence to back up your claims does help a lot yeah.
---
Should it be? What does [the Bestiary say about Nefaru?](https://i.imgur.com/Hoks0hh.png)
---
This is false, you need sub to be valid pick. GM told me this when asked, i was about to refund allready
---
Which patch introduced heirlooms again? I‚Äôd say they also had a negative effect by officially supporting the idea of ‚Äúleveling isn‚Äôt part of the game, just a useless speed bump‚Äù and helping enable the aggressive endgame funnel found in modern WoW.
---
Those of you with beta access please report this so Blizzard can check whether it's working properly or not.
---
Yup, I am going off of the damage appearing over his portrait.
---
Still incorrect. They have similar damage to mobs of the same type, but usually have extra abilities and are usually a higher level
---
It's like that on private servers, that is probably why.
---
Streamers/influencers desperately needing their ad revenue clicks will play any role.
---
Priests weren't really known for having a wide offensive toolkit. They probably have the fewest unique skills used while leveling and few ways to interact outside of combat.
---
Raiding was pretty narrow, it's true, as only one shadow priest is useful and then only when the locks have scaled up to be amazing.
---
I'll take that as a no.
---
Seems like a pretty terrible reason, but hey more power to you. 
---
No, wait I take that back. I highly encourage you to go full on Ret. We as horde players need more brave Retadins going against the grain. Use that blessing of freedom for yourself, do that 1337 auto attack damage and don't let anyone get in your way.
---
I have your back. You do you.
---
You're looking for [Simple Question Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AQuestion%2BSunday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all), or you can join us on the [ClassicWoW Discord](https://discord.gg/classicwow) and ask any question you like just there. :).
---
IIRC, it was his duel series that propelled him to stardom.
---
I think it's important that we make wow classic a mix of different "classics". I was a young kid when cata was released so for me, that's classic. You with me? :)
---
Finally somebody with a logical comment.
---
Thank you for doing the research, your kind is a rare breed as of recent.
---
If it was intended to be a tank weapon, rogue and hunter wouldn't be listed as classes on the weapon. It did help tho, I appreciate the level headed conversation.
---
Cheers
---
I remember bug that deleted your character and all progression. GM couldnt do anything about. But hey, it happened it vanilla so it should happen in classic also. Sucks to be the chosen one, but what can you do.
---
I upvoted only because you called TipsOut an idiot. Good job!
---
Guild recruitment posts go in the weekly LFG threads (linked in the sidebar).
---
Why was that funny?
---
Interesting, because someone linked a blue post yesterday saying what I just repeated.
---
Played 1 - 10 today, it's really like coming home.  Funny bugs aside, Blizz really knocked this one out of the park.  I'm absolutely overjoyed.
---
For sure, I don't think I ever leveled as alliance in duskwood for one reason or another was I just didn't know.
---
This added by the factor of people reporting ‚Äûbugs‚Äú whenever they confront something new to them.
---
Well I have always suspected that it's not true the classic community was better as people always say, people just used to be nicer in general, the game had nothing to do with it
---
It's so crazy to me how pserver nerds just got pservers running for ages but Blizzard has such big problems. I realize they wanna do it right and pserver guys probably used some tricks to get some things working but... it still amazes me that this could be such a complicated issue.
---
I guess I don‚Äôt like the idea of having a reason to rush leveling
---
I don't dispute your statement, as I don't have any evidence to the contrary, but I wonder if you have a source or anything to back up your statement of WoW being more popular in the west than in the east in the US.
---
Invites seem to be in around 2 hours IMO. Mostly when I've checked here it's been around 3pm PST when posts start occuring.
---
Do you have a link to that post? I'd like to give it a read.
---
he said "that was a good roll" meaning the item rolled well. WTF?
---
Armour values were extrapolated from screenshots of combat logs, namely execute values. So again, while this is not 100% accurate, it is significantly different to 'making them up' and dismissing private server data entirely.
---
Armour values will almost certainly be one of the most notable differences from the private server data. But as you can see, Blizzard don't seem to have figured it out perfectly either.
---
I've been taught by my parents that if i create something try to do my best. This is absolutely not the case in this occasion considering his skills and knowledge of the game, he could probably do much better. Sorry for mentioning it and hurting the fangays.  
---
It's just typical whoring, but i'm glad the fanclub has arrived to protect him.   
---
Nice to be IMMERSED in the increased spell damage coming from the intellect on the gear..............................
---
This will never get fixed. Blizzard has no interest in actually tuning the difficulty in an appropriate manner and will just brush it away with "lol memory is wrong" bullshit. If this stays, Classic is pointless. You can do Chainpull and AOE in BFA already, no need to play Classic for it.
---
Lmaoooo good one
---
Streamers are love. Streamers are life. Be gone angry incel!
---
Wherever &lt;APES&gt; play
---
Why would a rogue who doesn't care about the guild in the first place be getting any loot?
---
Yea, he should quit the guild and you can find someone who cares about somebody other than himself to replace him.
---
I legitimately can't believe you consider "don't put yourself ahead of others" a toxic attitude.
---
Are you blind?
---
Will it only be for people who have a 2004 account or are they only prioritized?
---
Cause there was a whole boss fight that required a large amount of priests to mind control enemies and use them as tanks. It's funny because you can see how it completely altered the raid makeup to make room for priests. Across all of the raids, the raid makeup is barely shifting until that point.
---
same thing at agamand mills.  aggro range is extremely short
---
No need to follow me for 9 posts because I blew you the fuck out by the way.
---
My face exactly. This is so depressing.
---
LET. ME. INNNNNNNNN
---
That's wrong, i kited Teremus/Volchan to stormwind or dmf every single week even just before TBC release, so no, leashing was way later. Only Kazzak got fixed.
---
Same reason why Overwatch become popular.
---
If it wasn't for the porn, no one would give a rats ass. Hence why blizzard created ALL the female characters that way and did that whole "tracer butt pose" controversy.  They wanted attention, and sex sells.
---
Blizzard knows what they are doing.  If people see a bunch of shit tier streamers with no idea bout the game making it look even more entertaining than it is it will give these players the idea they "hey if this guy can play, so can I".
---
Made a poll to try and better quantify the community‚Äôs perception of the decision made by Blizzard to NOT include the old school epic mounts into the game. [Here](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291717/brian-birmingham-and-patrick-dawson-from-wow-classic-on-vanilla-collector-s-edit#collector-s-edition) is a link to the article by Wowhead where the dev confirms their intention not to include them. [This](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/unarmored-mounts-megathread/173722) is a link to a forum megathread where they voice their opinions. This post is meant to complement that. Please discuss and vote.
---
I haven't watched the video so I might be off on this, but don't parries speed up the mobs swing timers? Maybe that's what's effecting the different attack speeds, and you might be on to something with the DPS theory.
---
ok but how does exp that quests and dungeons give scale in comparison?
---
I'm playing PvP on instant60 fun server with 5 man raids. Its pretty fun while waiting for real deal
---
Fuck off. A spider stuck in a tree is harmless. Blizzard can decide which bugs are malicious or not, they aren‚Äôt going to intentionally break the game because you feel like being a smartass
---
Everything about this was so stupid. Everything. Why would people do this?
---
Just play anything else
---
He has the benefit of being arguably the best at leveling through years of dedicated practice
---
That's the joke
---
rofl dude, jokes on you, i play a paladin.
---
i have all the time in the world to do anything i want
---
Was that just for the beta or when it actually launches? I don‚Äôt have anything against streamers, but the ONLY reason I would play on a realm I knew had Uber popular streamers on it would be to try and gank them over and over. You don‚Äôt have to succeed, just getting to watch yourself on stream killing them, or at least annoying the hell out of them seems kinda fun. Make a name for yourself getting a couple lucky ganks off and boom! You can start a stream and have like 25k viewers just because of that. That‚Äôs how you get a job as a streamer. Or you find like 20 rogues to follow them around and never let them respawn unless they happen to be a pally and bubble hearth lol. Yes that is childish, but tell me you wouldn‚Äôt enjoy that?
---
Multiple individuals can discover the same thing independently.
---
Please upload it somewhere.
---
Damn. Someone is heated that people called someone out for ninjaing on stream?
---
Maybe we down want people to young playing, if you excuse that you're going to be a trash addition to the community.
---
What/who am I hearing? That doesn't sound nice :( Is it the streamer himself?
---
People were much worse in classic, people have linked throughout this thread many videos showing that the damage numbers in almost all cases look correct.
---
" Particularly with Asmongold where he'll pull a mob two levels higher than him and three shot it with two crits and a normal hit. Then, when he dungeons and casts sunder armor, he never misses, generally if he ever misses its a dodge, but I specifically remember leveling a Warrior and missing so often that I would die very often. "
---
I watched asmongold do DM with esfand and he missed a ton as for crit, hit chance and damage this is all based off of the toons skill in both weapon skill and defense skill the higher this is the higher the damage crit and hit will be and you will get hit for less for the deffense skill. what you remember most likely is being a furry warrior early on because there is a 15% miss change that comes with dual weilding weapons. sorry for the typo's at work hiding reddit in back tab lol

monkeynews is pretty average, hes good when killing shitters with a pocket healer, last tournament he got 2-0'd like a pleb
---
The results you get here without it being pinned or highly upvoted will probably be pretty biased towards people that spend a lot of time on this subreddit and thus will probably also spend more time in classic wow.
---
So I'd guess this poll will be biased in favor of implementing 1.4 mounts for a limited time. I voted don't care btw.
---
There is a 32 buff limit in vanilla
---
People vastly overestimate the use of purge. It's great for taking off recently applied buffs yes but not worth much in a real fight (or maybe it will be random, unclear to me what's blizz like on 1.12)
---
Either way your fear ward will not be getting purged in a WSG. And even if it did so what you're a dwarf priest reapply it when u can lol
---
Pff, I'll see what I can do.
---
Damn thats sad
---
Wrong
---
Because its Vanilla. Theres plenty of items that Hunters can use but shouldn't.
---
Which guide is this based on btw? Did you think about collaborating with Joana or something? Sorry if it's already answered somewhere
---
No.  Joining a guild before launch only makes sense for the most hardcore of players, and even then it isn't necessary.
---
It is wayyyyy easier to make friends in the game organically and form/join guilds with them.
---
I deleted my comment because it was rude. You're still an ignorant bigot though.

dayum bro, sweet spot is 375 for 45 mins

Nice bro you got access to the classic database?

I live for posts like this, keep up the good work.
---
It has a 10 minute cooldown.
---
If you select an enemy and strafe, this bug happens. But if you select yourself and strafe, you strafe properly.
---
Upvoting you for the joke.
---
I think you're overthinking it just a little :)  
---
Your 1-60 experience will take a few weeks, so you'll have plenty of time to meet people and build relationships
---
Every little opportunity to create some drama regarding streamers.
---
My guess is their goal was to make things visible even though you played in a lit room. Which was very possible due to the nights being relatively bright.
---
Happy to help!
---
What kind of answer are you expecting from this? I hate these questions that are so mindless that pop up on this subreddit so much. Of fucking course not you don't have to join a guild before launch. You can easily find one before 60. Or after 60. You can rush with our without a guild. Do you want to commit to a guild before launch? Thats fully up to you lol. What kind of answer could you possibly expect from this.
---
Okay well what about this exact example where the damage numbers don't look correct, that we're all talking about in this thread?
---
Should add US, KR and EU beta to the list
---
Same damage as a regular mob of the same level, generally, but more abilities / health.  Also Asmongold is a warrior with defensive stance up.  The damage is roughly correct.  Source?  I played Vanilla from beta onwards.  Not good enough as a source?  That‚Äôs fine, I felt the same way about the ‚Äúsource‚Äù provided for why the damage was wrong too.  Prove me wrong.
---
And shirtless
---
I will say this, at the end of the day just play what you really want to. But if you aren't really feeling mage, I urge you to go with either the lock or sham. Mage is going to be the most played class in the game. There's a reason for that of course, it's fun and cool. But while different, locks and shaman are fund and cool too, with a smaller player base.
---
In a few levels this would be easy mode pull..
---
You are probably right. All I can hope for is an approximate representation. Either way, I thought it would suit the discussion to try and quantify it. Thanks for voting !
---
Glad I resubbed a few ago, stupid to see they aren't properly informed, like 2 GM's giving two different answers..
---
is that a reliable resource? I'm going off of this for reference https://classicdb.ch/?npc=534
---
As far as i remember you need 5% hit to not miss a boss mob, and boss mob is a +3. So as human racial is enough to not miss a +2 even with 0 hit bonuses on gear.
---
Hey mate sent you a detailed PM !
---
The beta probably brought more people to the sub also, which doesn't help
---
What's a GDKP run?
---
The Classic forums are just as bad. Every one of these people are jealous and entitled. They think they **deserve** beta and can't believe that they gave beta to people streamers. who are usually very committed to Classic and will help promote it.
---
Vanilla had such a great community. I see it now. /s

Vanilla. Veteran. Bro.

---
but pserver are supposed to be 10x easier
---
You're equating not wanting to run a raid that the guild is using for profit and alts as "not caring about the guild".
---
That *is* toxic.
---
The dungeons were so freaking easy. If I didn't really wanna play but had nothing better to do I'd queue as a healer for heroic dungeons. All I ever needed to do was cast my AoE heal every 10 or so seconds to keep everyone topped while they aoe'd down a boss with all the trash before him. It was so fucking stupid.
---
What guild/server was it?
---
29 year old guy here. I remember booting up Ocarina of Time with my brother when we were kids for the first time. The excitement of buying baldurs gate and playing it together. The fist supersmash bros. 
---
Streaming video games with your face in the corner is one of the fucking weirdest things to me. I never once thought growing up that this is what gaming culture would be or was going to become. 
---
My brother and I just loved games in general. Our first console was an NES our neighbor gave us lol. Now its like some weird bragging right to have enjoyed games before it went main stream. In reality who gives a shit. 
---
I think it‚Äôs safe to say that it‚Äôs really not just this subreddit. Gaming ‚Äúculture‚Äù in general has simply become a toxic place, that can be boiled down to, ‚Äúhere is why I‚Äôm better than you‚Äù. Whether we want to talk about ninja looting, or the fact that some streamers name is literally Tipsout. Jesus it makes me cringe so hard my face practically turns inside out. Thats the kinda stuff my brother and I thought was funny when we were *12*. 
---
I mean classic wow was a 12 years and up game when it came out. It was meant for a young audience. That doesn‚Äôt mean adults should not enjoy it. But a lot of streamers to me don‚Äôt really set a good example for young people. I would never let my kid watch these troglodytes. 
---
None of this gaming reality tv esq. garbage was around when I was a kid and playing games and everything was fine. I will never watch these streamers in a serious light. It‚Äôs honestly so silly to me that it is even taken seriously to the extent that it is. If you enjoy games just play them. 
---
I love the internet but something certainly went wrong down the line.
---
Okay, still wasn't particularly hard.
---
Should also be noted that they're doing this on purpose. They've mentioned they've 'put' some of the original bugs in the game, but these game breaking ones are not being put into the game.
---
It's not supposed to show armor. That item has no armor. There is no bug.
---
Bug report: "hey, this shows no stats." That's about as useful as a bug report that says "hey, the sky is blue." If you're forced to say "hey, this shows no stats, I expect it to say 2 Armor" or whatever, then you're forced to voice your assumptions, which themselves can be incorrect (and in voicing them, you help the bug team understand whether the bug is in the code or in your understanding).
---
[Here is the item](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=43/squires-boots), it has no armor or any other stats.
---
I agree. At first blush super dark nights sound awesome and I'm sure a few people truly enjoy them. However for the majority their charm wears off after about 5 minutes and then they just increase the brightness to the max. :) I think Blizzard realized this, that's why they changed it.
---
In my opinion even the "brighter" nights can get dark enough. I'm looking forward to them.
---
Especially playing on private servers feels incredibly pointless now.
---
I don't think you understand what "classic" means. These are the respawn rates as they were. They will not be addressed. That's the end of it.
---
That im not sure about. Even tho its patch 1.2 i think it still uses a modern build of the game engine.
---
All good thanks for the help. I can't wait for August!!
---
I really got a chuckle reading the 'not a bug' list that blizzard published based on feedback lol
---
Non streamers also have access. I've been beta testing all day and it's great to help the game grow. I bet if they showed numbers there would be a dozen or two streamers and a thousand regular people.
---
On retail you need to create an account on the region you want to play, you can switch region on the battle.net client. Mind you can't transfer characters between regions.
---
I think only EU has German servers (possibly Classic will have them too) so you'd need to play there.
---
Keep in mind the difference in time zones, Germany is GMT+1 (+2 on daylight saving periods), if yours is too different you may have serious problems finding people to play with, unless you play in very unusual times for your area.
---
Guess I'll chill untill the end of August then. CBA paying to test a 12-year old product.
---
Yeah I get that and it feels horrible when it happens to you. But the fact he was a hunter *in vanilla* made it so ripe for memeing.
---
&gt;Kids might ruin barrens chat
---
Adults will ruin chat.
---
Answers like the one you gave and the ones others ha ve, what kind of dumb question is that lol.
---
What's GDKP I keep hearing about it??
---
Good to be reminded of exactly how terrifying murlocs were in vanilla.
---
If you have a friend group that you are gonna be playing with and its a small group, I'm sure that a guild would welcome you in their ranks. I have a friend group that is around 9 people that are playing and someone within that group has another group that is also playing and were gonna make a guild together and find people after that. So just remember to have fun and group with people and look for guilds :D.
---
 I guess you can give a generous reading of that comment if you want, that's cool. I hereby shift my argument to the following: 
---
The biggest wow streamer is insufferable and his followers seem to suck complete ass as well. They blow to such a degree that they get triggered super hard by OP pointing out how much of his content is posted on this sub as of late. 
---
I submit this to all as the vanguard of a new classic wow sub that no longer has to see a man in his mid twenties who somehow looks like a current day Clint Eastwood but with even worse politics
---
Community for sure.
---
You're literally the most toxic person I have ever seen on this subreddit. Sincerely fuck off, you toxic scumbag.
---
Gold DKP, its where you buy items for gold in a run. The gold is then split up at the end of the run.
---
The classes have just as much character if not more in TBC and the balance is much better there.
---
Welcome to the internet son
---
All I can picture is Hogger running with a distressed look on his face, dropping loaves of bread and haunches of meat, making the gnoll sound.
---
That's retail. Look at classic: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=43/squires-boots
---
... by the moon and stars in the sky...
---
Don't be that dumb ass that buys game time just for a sliver of a chance at the beta. Don't reward blizzard for these shady tacticts. Beta is for testing not advertising from shitty streamers that have no interest in finding bugs.
---
Found the retail plebs. Those boots don't have armor, they're a clothing item.
---
joana is a man..
---
This is just disgusting
---
Literally the bestiary says that this should be his damage, plus asmon is a warrior in defensive stance.
---
He is also a non-elite.
---
So, yeah, you are wrong.
---
in vanilla there are 2 types of rares there are low level rare mobs that have the silver dragon and then there are rare ELITE mobs that also have the silver dragon but one will have elite under its name in the left hand corner ( as far as i can remember from 2004-2006
---
Mmm, that's some spicy pasta.
---
[This vanilla database](http://db.excalibur.ws/?npc=534) shows otherwise.
---
Seems like some of these databases are pulling from post 1.12 stats.
---
Yeah I view myself as pretty hardcore def not the 1% but I plan to get 60 within the first week. Maybe a couple days over that since the beta is showing it‚Äôs a little longer/tougher than private servers
---
Dustwind Harpy should hit for 9-14 according to Brady, so looks like he has some dmg reduction going if he was hit for less on Classic?
---
The books were based on game data provided by Blizzard.
---
Of course, it is data from around 2.3 and maybe some of it has errors, but I believe it was mainly the armor and resistance that wasnt completely accurate for 1.x.
---
Spells, abilities, etc. have been tougher to emulate.
---
Every companies number one objective is make the largest profit it can, fortunately delivering a good product and making profit are not mutually exclusive.

&gt;It's exp from mobs instead of quests and dungeons but this should be a slightly less useless diagram

---
That's why they called it a useless diagram, lol.
---
I'll be honest, it took me 3 watches of the clip to notice what was wrong. I can't believe I was THAT oblivious, considering I knew what I was looking for...
---
I love the hypocrisy.
---
I revived my vanilla warrior. He's still 60 but he's butt naked I think I got hacked and quit then bought a whole new game in bc lol.
---
The bestiary says this is the correct amount of damage plus asmon is a warrior in defensive stance with a shield on.
---
All is good, stop whining.
---
Some streamers did. Won't name my sources, but my sources are the streamers. :D
---
Aaaah, spell batching..
---
Bitch please i reported this like 2 days ago
---
Yeah, why is no one talking about the movement bugs?? It looks completly off. Mouse cursor are also f\*cking up on some players. backpedaling is way too fast too
---
Because there isn't any.
---
This is why im playing Hunter
---
imagine being you, so so sad.
---
Aka no one knows Wtf is going on and no one is going to believe anything a CSR says because there will be contradictory information from elsewhere.
---
"Classic is being released again primarily for them to return again and enjoy"
---
No it's not. Classic will be enjoyed by many other people too, not only the vanilla players. It's not your game only, it's for the whole community.

This sub: "Private servers are inaccurate because only Blizz has the data"  
---
Also this sub: "Blizz is inaccurate"

It's a beta test. Newcomers were just as useful for diagnosing the layering bug that was going around.

Except they specifically came out and...wait for it...SAID THAT REGEN IS WORKING PERFECTLY FINE RIGHT NOW.

But shouldn't it be 30% armor against enemies of level 26?
---
It's for fun.
---
Except if you have a raid with 40 gnomes, in which case gogoogogogo
---
10 minute duration
---
30 second cd, you can cover your whole raid in it if u have enough d priests.
---
There may have been a point in time that was true. But not 1.12
---
You don't remember how the game works dude....We're not playing "vanilla". It's 1.12, put those memories aside unless you're sure they're from patch 1.12
---
Maybe you're just confusing the cd with the duration. IDK
---
Either way so wrong. Fear ward is vastly better than every racial but orc stun resist in PvP. And Fear ward is pretty fucking good considering what some fo the other racials are
---
This is interesting.  My immediate assumption was that everyone had terrible computer and internet speed at the time so the game was harder. I wonder if we'll get an answer.

He started playing the game a few months before tbc.
---
3edgy5me
---
He had some really amazing achievements of world firsts in Vanilla but even more so in TBC and WotLK.
---
He's been dealing with a lot of shit though, and can only hope he gets better overtime, which he seems to be doing.
---
We won‚Äôt know till we know. There is no best atm as pservers don‚Äôt count.
---
Don‚Äôt forget these guys are actually taking quest/drops with stats that are needed most vs ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll default take the Mail armor as I‚Äôm a Warrior and that‚Äôs what I wear‚Äù.
---
None of us knew back then that a leather chest with +10 STA was better than the mail with higher AC but only +3 (example). Now everyone is more aware and gear is playing a bigger part in this.
---
Fanboyism is weiiiiiird... especially when it's for streamers
---
I mean so far Blizz seems like its doing a pretty damn good job, the community seems to get more toxic by the day.
---
Level 1 plate item? How about looking in a vanilla db.
---
Considering I was leveling in Nos a few months ago in the barrens at 2am and it was pretty dark compared to watching Joana level in the Barrens around 2am and it was basically high noon.
---
I dont need everything to be pitch black, but I want the fucking sun gone.
---
/u/nodirection723 going to ignore this post entirely and reply to everyone else saying "SO MANY PEOPLE THINK THE DAMAGE IS LOW RETARDS"
---
lol, it looks so dumb, what do I need to know, and what kind of addon is this?
---
because the levelling process is one of the main feature of vanilla, not the other expansions, not even TBC, the endgame is more interesting, you're focusing on a single aspect that can't be applied to the other xpacs due to the different nature of them.
---
They can make changes based on some old design and it will happen, you'll see, just think about the right aspects logically.
---
Upvoted. Great reference for Blizzard.
---
[I'll refer to an earlier answer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq3mjb/vanilla_questing_20_released_feedback_wanted/eo1m0t1/)
---
In addition, I did try to reach out to Joana but he never showed any interest and I get the feeling that he sees speedrunning vanilla as something larger than life and personal. There's some prominent leveling people that have reached out and are routing their own stuff for private use.
---
tbf warrior is not a solo class
---
I lived off bagel bites and pizza rolls in Vanilla. Was thinking of buying some for launch, but my god they're so bad now.

i dont get whats funny

Imagine being a streamer and just getting everything funneled to you. With their huge army of spuds.

They could face legal action if they set up easily compromised servers that leaks private customer data.

Examples?

he even said before / after the clip that someone else had probably already reported it.....

You‚Äôll only be passed over by the most hardcore guilds if at all. Normal guilds will take a ret.
---
Ugh, fuck. Thanks man.
---
I'll have no interest I'm this game if it isn't tuned at least as hard as pservers. Whether vanilla was truly like this or not.
---
The difficulty just feels right on ND. Be at the right level, pull properly, use CC, otherwise it's wipe or pop pots usually. Just feels right.

I made a super basic coordinate addon called "Corduroy" based on some old addon's code: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ja_4VgZKipLrCiev3gC26qTNbzrf-YQo 
---
Your World Map will show your cursor's current x,y location on the map as you move it around the map. I only had a little chance to test it recently and the coordinates seem right when I looked up locations online. If anyone else tries it and notices issues let me know.
---
&gt;I think some of it is people who actually played vanilla are watching streamers who didn't play vanilla report things in vanilla as bugs...
---
haha This really is legit half irritating and half amusing though.
---
Barrens chat is a right of passage. How dare you attempt to deprive first-time players of something so glorious.
---
lolmao a streamer ninja looted? This fucking twitch culture is just so absurd. Are they entertainers or your highschool crushes? Why must they get a free pass on bloody everything?
---
exact response all my old vanilla buddies gave me when i texted them a screenshot lol.  youll get it soon!
---
No they did not.
---
And also that does not work. Too many factors.
---
That is not how the coding was done.
---
Now we need to somehow show this to blizzard
---
people were complaining that the SFK mobs were doing "too little' damage to Asmongold and someone pulled up footage from someone of the same level doing the same dungeon and the mobs were doing about the same damage.
---
I know who asmongold is but I don‚Äôt follow him. No clue who the other guy is.
---
So why when he runs BFD did he pul llike 6-7 elite mobs and not break a sweat and think nothing was up lol.
---
did he fuck your mother or something
---
And also he's getting fed the best gear for every level from his guild.
---
What time did you notice you got in? Some people were under the impression that you wouldn't be able to get beta invites over the weekend. no one has confirmed or denied this yet
---
This isn't progressive or insightful. Yeah a streamer you don't like is playing a game you didn't get an invite to. Just delete your post
---
No, I'm equating not wanting to run a raid that exists to help the guild as "not caring about the guild"
---
https://i.imgflip.com/2dmk14.jpg?a432768
---
Some have very little, some have zero. Squire's Boots are in the latter category.
---
You also left out the daily RP-PVP server threads by the same people each time.
---
The [dataset](https://redd.it/7n23dn) you're using for XP required for each level is wrong. It was 290,000 XP required from 59 to 60, not 209,800.
---
[These](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:XP_To_Level) are better numbers.
---
Sodapoppin has done a lot for Classic though.
---
Whatever you think of him, whatever you disagree about, he's still a name worthy to mention in all of this.
---
The bottom line is that they have the info... either this is some value accidentally changed (not sure how) or they purposely are trying to get away with making the content easier than it was back then.
---
We will find out at the end of beta I guess.... but I suspect the game will be much less dangerous than vanilla actually was.
---
That was changed in TBC.
---
Patch 1.4.0 Combo points will no longer be removed if the target is deselected. They will only be removed if a different target is selected.

Patch 2.0.3 Combo points added to a target should not be reset until you add a combo point to a different target.

Don't try dude. Even if you provide evidence that it is just like it was in Vanilla (which I remember it being like this too) everyone just wants to pitchfork.
---
They pretend to remember Vanilla but they are just judging it by Private Servers and any information shown to go against that is wrong.
---
Anyone know actually played back then and was old enough to remember, and was a half decent player, is almost positive these numbers are legit.
---
Is that true?
---
The authentic classic experience, where everyone knew the exact ins-and-outs of the game. Yup, they've got an airtight memory
---
ITT: People thinking Joana's 2006 leveling videos are from a private server.
---
Finally, someone else who gets it.
---
I am with you there. I have many accounts between multiple bnet and I have only 1 subbed at the moment.. Not worth over $15 for this beta
---
Voted don't care as well. I'll be going for the cheaper AV mount anyway, so I couldn't care less.
---
I doubt it, even at best case scenario its probably going to cap out at like 10% chance of getting an invite so realistically I am better suited to just not worry about it. I want to help test so badly but also am selfish and want to test classes and leveling routes for my own personal gain. SMH
---
I think it would be really cool if Blizzard went the same route as OSRS when it comes to adding content.
---
They make polls in which players vote on things to be added/changed and if they get at least **75%** player approval they are added to the game. In this way, they ensure that anything changed from the original OSRS is something that the majority of players want/support.  
---
Additionally, they make new raids/content so the game is always evolving, even though the base content remains the same as it was.
---
In my mind, this will help Classic have longevity and people won't be sitting around a few years from now running the same content for the umpteenth time. They could always transition into BC, but then we'd lose Vanilla again. I'd much rather have progressive Classic servers and separate BC servers.
---
It's fun to have a group to level with before starting out, leveling is huge part of vanilla wow.   
---
You won't really reach 60 fast, unless you play to no-life for 2 weeks straight it going to take a month or few, and its as valid experience as end game is
---
Color shouldn't matter
---
The streamers themselves aren't the issue, it's the brainless mob of fucking viewers that swing from streamer's scrotum wherever they go that is the problem. I'm just hoping beyond hope that the big time streamers all wind up on the same clusterfucked server and leave the rest of us to enjoy the game.
---
yeah for sure. You'd think the mob would be hitting him for 200-400
---
Streamers have shit knowledge about classic but they get all the beat invites because Blizz wants to use the beta as an advertisement and not for testing. Am I salty? Yes. Is it really because I didn't get invited? No! I've been playing Blizz games since WC2 and I've only never been invited to Blizzards betas. I'm salty because I keep seeing no skill scrubs saying things are bugs when they are not. Were gonna have thousands of players thinking all those things are bugs and complaining about it.
---
This, my friend, is the human condition.
---
It's almost like there are over 7.000 different types of people on here at any given time.
---
i received the email notification last night but didnt notice it until this morning ugh
---
Seems close to right.
---
60 within a week is definitely top 1% of the server
---
He's 21.
---
It's hopeless, people are too desperate and want a piece of the special club enough to ignore the piece of shit marketing tactics.
---
Where's the hypocrisy?
---
I've been doing 3-5 hours of sleep for years, I want to be asleep for a quarter of my life not a third
---
That's not what a beta is and it's never been that way. Stop covering for Blizzard.
---
Would be sick man.
---
Well I get what you‚Äôre saying but I reckon you was a PvE hunter because as a PvP hunter I greatly enjoyed taking on and countering rogue using all the tricks of my class because rogues can‚Äôt dead zone you. In the case you describe you first option is to trinket and flare the predicated path of the rogue, (if this fails then running is generally the best option) I would activate aspect of the cheetah and run for the nearest confined enclosed space if one is available and flare the entrance or if one isn‚Äôt near I would just sprint in the opposite direction to the one the rogue went and after a good 200-300 yards I‚Äôd shadowmeld or mount up. 
---
Remember moving in stealth is a slow slow thing so it was usually quite easy based on the direction and angle your opponent vanished were it would be in two seconds. Also your going to be a lot faster than the rogue with aspect of the cheetah, especially since it‚Äôs just burnt there sprint, this is not to say I wasn‚Äôt ganked by rogues but they would have to know how to play.
---
Ppl in method was nice :(
---
That GM helped me get my Vanilla Account back today. Good man!
---
RPPvP or riot.
---
Those are some big claims you're making there. Please do go through the first wave streamers' VODs and find out when all of them reported this. It's only 5 minutes per streamer after all, shouldn't take too long.
---
I'll wait.
---
&gt;The toxicity is part of WoW.
---
huh?
---
Thank you.
---
WoTLK and WoD both released on a Thursday
---
Again, take a look at followgrubby. He probably earns shitloads of money through playing the game. He monetized his stream as much as possible, he literally plays request games which costs money for the viewers. He currently has 3.5k viewers with 5k viewers watching anything wc3 related.  
---
Yet he is humble, clearly aware of his own skills. Yes, it's so much harder to be a nice person and earn shitloads of easy money, but shouldn't we promote and appreciate these guys more than the stupid jerks with their attitude?
---
I don't think we should tell people that played vanilla not to comment on things that they deem off.
---
Exactly. Nobody is accounting for the fact that there is such a huge level discrepancy. The base stats are for equal levels, not for a warrior who's literally 8 levels below with half leather gear and only a BIS hands.
---
Also, he has to opt in for beta access on each account, which clearly he doesnt want lol so why would he have opted in. 98% fake
---
He is literally a streamer you dumb fuck
---
Wow, almost as if there are 96,468 subscribers on this reddit? and they have *different* opinions?
---
I've been following since you're first post, I'm a huge fan.
---
One bug I just noticed, on the shared alliance route, there is a jump from level 54.86 to 43.94 while in Feralas - looking at the json, it just seems to be a typo for the experience.
---
sir how dare you call Gamers toxic.
---
Gamers,,, of all people
---
Ill paypal you $100 right now for it
---
Yes they do have it figured out perfectly. THEY HAVE THE GOD DAMN DATA.
---
True, and he always has the most paladins following him, so therefore he is the best
---
&gt;I think that the problem is that people seem to feel that classic wow is THEIRS and theirs alone. That they're the only one that "truly knows classic" 
---
I think this is the crux of it.  Gatekeeping.
---
Considering I was leveling on a popular pServer a few months ago in the barrens at 2am and it was pretty dark compared to watching Joana level in the Barrens around 2am and it was basically high noon.
---
The way I read the above is people who did things in classic, now if we are talking about people that advertise classic, sure. The names mentioned above are a different category.
---
and I'm stuck watching streamers, classic reddit, classic vids on youtube, and refreshing my launcher.....
---
Fuck them all.
---
Yes, but profit overtime is often much higher than just profit immediately. Would you rather have one dollar now or five dollars in a year?
---
No.. he‚Äôs pretty fucking good lol
---
Please leave. We don't need people like you giving the classic wow community a bad name.
---
same tbh
---
Probably this strafing bug rofl
---
Then tell my why they gave invites for streamers? im quite sure blizzard wasn't thinking "oh yeah, these guys are going to report all the bugs!"    
---
I'm not covering for blizzard, big part behind this beta is to make hype. you have to be delusional if you think else
---
alterac pvp in 1.12 lmao
---
Probably because there's like 200+ servers to pick from where there will be only a handful for Classic. On top of that, WoW hasn't been a "hyped" game for ages, any only really has any massive influx of activity at the launch of expansions or major content patches. In addition to that: shared tagging, sharding/phasing, cross-realm, all have kind of "shielded" the rest of the population from the few high impact streamers. The "outdoor" game world hasn't simply been as important as it was in Vanilla.
---
Just ask Darkspear what kind of experience they've had with the brainless zerg of viewers that follow around Asmongold, Sodapoppin, Swifty and so forth. Along with the 40-man multiboxers that have risen to troll them.
---
Mage is the only one that really fulfills all 5 points.
---
yes! 
---
I'm sure looking forward to it! I enjoy the posts where people are showing their setups. We will finally get to play classic on really awesome computers. (do you know if the new graphics will be in classic?)  My setup back then was a garbage dell desktop and I barely went into SW because of lag. 
---
Finally it's time for me to be one of those people with a good computer and high FPS! :D
---
Was he the first Scarab Lord?
---
they have made bug reporting for mobs and quests really easy so you can definitely play through the game and test at the same time easily
---
Fuck off
---
Oh no please dont tell me it will be rush garbage? If so I will never enter there
---
&gt;imagine kicking the tank before the LAST BOSS just because of 1 major mistake
---
My server had 7 or 8 people with the scepter, myself included, all happy to wait for everyone ready to do it.
---
Some literal fuckwad did it in the middle of the night when everyone else had to work the next day, and this was before Discord and being able to ping everyone over and over until they answered.
---
One person on my server got it. Myself and a half dozen others? Boned.
---
I will beyond NOT be rolling on a streamer server. Say what you want, but there's no BENEFIT to rolling on a streamer server, but there's huge potential for negatives.
---
It was. You held shift and it looted everything in that one mob.
---
people were using the term "welfare epics" since TBC
---
[Old vanilla meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIVTT4fgPQI&amp;app=desktop)
---
It happened on Ysera. Guy transferred in with the mallet pieces and rang it early in the morning. Right before maintenance. Server lost half their event.
---
Well, if you don't want to spend 50g to respec between pve and pvp specs, you can take mage and priest out of your considerations leaving you with hunter.
---
BC Best C
---
Play Private Wod
---
Ya, too bad I wont ever get that invite so I can, lol... enjoy it
---
Incredible, right?
---
I don't think they ever normalized mobs attack speed in Vanilla, but I might be wrong
---
Brokentooth still has his very high attack speed state in 1.12
---
They aren't looking into it, because the numbers aren't wrong. Watch any video of an old dungeon run. The numbers perfectly line up. 
---
Example:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1FuMa3OyiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1FuMa3OyiM) 
---
Vanilla SFK. The numbers line up perfectly with Asmon's run. If anything Asmon is taking MORE damage than in the video.
---
Why mage though?
---
It's almost like those were two very specific things that annoy you about what people here in general complain about, but you Justified your vague call out thread on the basis that you could not find a person complaining about both of those things in the same thread.
---
I mean, um, oh yeah you go you tell them!
---
An MC clear that's being used for profit and alts does not help the guild with progression encounters.
---
you forget all the crappy ones like ogrila and skettis, which were part of tbc for much longer. For arena you could only play with 2-3 other people on your team, so all the people you did BGs with throughout vanilla had to break up into smaller little cliques. You could make every single spec work in vanilla. There are montages and pvp videos for every spec. I would argue you had to be even more cookie cutter in tbc for anything to work. 25 man raids meant you couldnt bring along underperforming friends, and arena was basically if you couldnt get someone off a pillar and 100-0 them you arent viable.
---
This one needs to be higher.
---
The fun part of Vanilla was building a target on your back for the other faction by constantly ganking them over and over at every possible turn.
---
I hope layering won't kill that.
---
Well, if this sub is 90,000 players and there will maybe be 4-5 million people playing Classic. This means that this is the general 1-5% elitists that you run into each server. We will all need to coordinate with each other to not land on the same server.
---
What a waste of a beta key.... just because hes a streamer and can "hype" it...
---
Specifically asmon highlights.
---
I remember when I was leveling in Vanilla when I hit level 30 I whispered my friend who had been 60 for some time so excited because I was "halfway there". He teased me about how I wasn't even close. This graph confirms that, haha.
---
It would be nice to see a blue post confirming they are correct then.
---
These statements don‚Äôt conflict with each other, you‚Äôre being weird
---
How does being able to watch exactly where your target is and what they're doing help you find and kill them? Is that you question?
---
It's not.
---
Notice how the numbers are...gasp...exactly the same, with Asmon even taking more damage.
---
were you subbed at the time?
---
Shadow priest is probably the worst choice then, hunters and mages are the best farmers as far as I'm aware and are far more desired in raids.
---
Its more like people are upset because of the merit some of the streamers have. 
---
Think of it like seniority in a place of work. If the new guy at your work got a paid holiday off because he streams himself fishing and 100 other people watch him fish; you would be upset sitting at work watching on a big TV on the wall, him out there fishing.
---
Nvm, this is a bad example, but I typed it out so by god I'm hitting the button.
---
Night elf Mohawk bro
---
Beta access is just part of the hype machine.   It's been in closed alpha for months.   There will have been hundreds of F&amp;F of Blizzard playing it.   They even had the 1-20 experience at Blizzcon almost 8 months ago.   We are getting 1-30 as a beta.    It's nothing that hasn't been extensively tested before.
---
One little insult doesn't change the scheme of things in a thread. You guys spamming the subreddit whining about streamers does
---
I won't act up in game because i won't group with scrubs, pretty simple?
---
Specs = goldsink = gold farming in world or dungeons which creates more community and world pvp which = better game.
---
What time today?
---
Are they going to be there in phase 1 ? 
---
I thought they were added in a much later patch.
---
When Moringen? You are EU or US time?
---
 https://www.twitch.tv/videos/426133361?t=01h06m40s 
---
This timestamp show another Tiger hitting for around 7 on the beta. I guess the question is why is there a difference in Tiger damage between the clips?
---
&gt; people weren't CC'ing anything and it seems super easy
---
Yeah I'm almost positive my memory isn't THAT bad, but I remember CC being extremely necessary
---
They acknowledged that regen is working as it is in 1.12.
---
They will also eventually tell you whiners that damage is the EXACT SAME as it was in Vanilla.
---
Example from another thread:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1FuMa3OyiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1FuMa3OyiM) 
---
Notice how that SFK run they are both taking almost exactly the same damage as Asmon did, if anything Asmon took a little MORE damage.
---
Now stop whining and forget everything you "remember from Vanilla" when actually you mean "my favorite private server".
---
It's not healthy for the beta to be behind a paywall, and only giving out free invites to content creators/streamers. These people who make a living out of doing the least kind of stressful "work" living off peoples donations and basically putting on an act are the ones leading the feedback for classic and it sucks. There are some good streamers actually testing things but that is rare, the rest are just using this to put on a show for their viewers. Obviously blizzard is okay with this and I think they are flat out wrong for how they are handling the beta.
---
Does anybody else have more clips of people using the auction house?
---
Might be, I hit 60 when ZG was already out
---
You people are pathetic. Besides needing to stop sucking on asmongolds asshole. RARE MOBS DID MASSIVE DAMAGE IN CLASSIC. hE'S 26 AND THE MOB IS 34. of course he's gonna get thrashed. Streamers are going to ruin the game for everyone.
---
it absolutely did destroy it though. halaa was a poppin place for a little while after launch, even when people didnt need the rewards. but as people slowly got enough gold for flying mounts it just turned into people hovering in the air waiting for people to be solo, or escape if the tide started turning, then people stopped showing up at all.
---
 really lookin forward to playing. Only got to experience vanilla right before bc launched. But yea this sub kinda sucks and everyone just seems like a mean spirited asshole. Theyre probably a vocal minority though so i wouldnt worry about their bs
---
This is why there should of been actual beta testers and not just streamers. Some of those streamers are so stupid and think they understand vanilla. More passionate people should of gotten to play the beta and submit feedback on bug reports as you said with two sides to the story not just them being babies crying.
---
That dude looks like the gnome Halloween mask. ü§£
---
It's been 3 days. Stop.
---
Classes actually being viable. Yeah, it's cool that feral can keep up in raids if they farm for a level 29 item and use a level 40 helmet... But, it shouldn't have that much discrepancy. Other ways to differentiate classes via utility and not damage. High King Maulgar is a great example, though it did force specific compositions. Give/take on that one.
---
Want to DPS as Elemental? Viable on live, charity in Vanilla.
---
No it isn't. Please leave.
---
World of Warcraft is a feeling
---
There are a few so think a Wave Just happaned.
---
Uh, he casted void bolts almost all the time in the asmon video aswell.
---
I know pservers are not the same as classic exactly. But how long did the ally take you to level to 60. Roughly?
---
My god. Four identical private servers. Each more identical than the last.
---
dang man im jealous but im happy for you at the same time lol. I might be able to catch your stream. I just wish I could freeze myself for 3 months lol
---
An MC clear that exists to get bindings for tanks, gear for the rest of the main raid and pay for consumables for progression doesn't help the guild with progression? Is this a serious assertion?
---
This is simply false.  Yeah there are a lot of turds around here but this is the kind of evidence that actually helps things move forward.  Please don't discourage people from posting it.
---
Wait, you had the name Roguee but mained the same name with a symbol being used in one of the "e"? Was there a reason to this?
---
Why? It‚Äôs not an elite mob. It‚Äôs just a rare. Rare mobs in vanilla were statistically the same as the mob type it was, they only had extra health and a couple extra abilities.
---
It's absolutely how it was done. Formulas and values weren't changed willy-nilly just because someone felt like it, almost always you needed to have some evidence that something was wrong, and only then was it changed. And evidence was also investigated, often only accepting known/confirmed vanilla videos.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdcWmvxGvoY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdcWmvxGvoY) This video from 2006 should show the damage is actually correct on the beta.
---
Red trail behind Warrior when they charge. That wasnt in Vanilla.
---
He was definitely against it. At least pre announcement.
---
Not world first at least, that was some US player. Not sure about EU first though.
---
This, this is gatekeeping for gatekeeping.
---
It's best to test this on damage received by his pet, rather than his troll. I am watching Joanna live on Twitch right now while comparing the numbers to his 1-60 run and I see no discernible difference in pet damage received with everything being equal.
---
u stop complaining
---
[https://i.imgur.com/U6Xy8lN.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/U6Xy8lN.jpg)  
---
From vanilla strategy guide
---
Because while you're frost in both pve and pvp (at least till AQ), the specs are very different.
---
Back in Vanilla days, armor, defense, avoidance, certain talents had a lot to do with how mobs hit you.  So maybe they are going back to that, and early on in the game at lower levels, mobs didn't hit very hard.
---
I'm not saying who should and shouldnt be promoted. Obviously humility and kindness is a charactersitic that should be encouraged. What im saying is that people will flock to whatever they find is entertaining. 
---
If asmongold is getting 100k people watching him for being a jerk and rude, what more can you really do? It seems that quality of disingenuity is enjoyed by a good amount of people. We can't say that these people should or shouldnt be popular, because the majority decides.
---
I have watched grubby and I agree with the different type of attitude he has, but majority of online celeberities are not like that, and most put on a show for more reactions. Its just how the internet is.
---
I'm kind of surprised that everyone apparently suddenly got temporarily amnesia after playing private servers.
---
Don't people remember doing something like WC with a lvl 16 or 17 in the group back in Vanilla? Private servers were clearly overturned when it came to instances.
---
In the original video, Arugal is spamming void bolt. In the second video, argual is mostly meleeing. When arugal properly casts shadow bolt in the first video it hits for ~258 a hit. When he casts it in the second video it also hits for ~258 a hit. The problem isn't that arguals damage is wrong, its that his damage pattern is incorrect; rather than casting void bolt hes meleeing with his staff constantly.
---
This Miz guy needs to calm down. Like good god what a child. Lol
---
Can't be unseen üòÄ
---
Yeah, *real* vanilla players would never gatekeep
---
^^^^^/s
---
What you described is certainly happening.
---
Gatekeeping is happening, too, though.  How many times have you seen posts along the lines of *"REEEEEEEEEE this streamer didn't know that XYZ was actually different before 2007, MURDER THEIR FAMILY."*  It's obnoxious as shit.
---
No, it's actually the opposite, they usually buff everything by 30-50% to make it harder.
---
Go play old school Tibia and tell me EverQuest is hard scrub.
---
Might be both and only bosses are normal values because they probably have an algorythm to calculate normal to elite stats but bosses stats are handmade.
---
Lol its genuinely pretty hilarious
---
this meme doesn't make sense. If you are a big fan of BFA and you are enjoying the content, just keep enjoying it! I like things that others don't but I still do them because I am me. I'll play games no one else plays like Wii bowling still lol
---
Just play on different servers - Back in vanilla/tbc me and my friends all played on different realms, and still had a ton of fun - even in "lan"parties, we'd just do our own thing and talk about the game &amp; stuff.
---
0, because when they shapeshift they aren‚Äôt a tauren anymore.
---
Since you listed Mage as a class you're interested in, one suggestion would be making that the first class you level to 60 (This is assuming you'd level multiple classes to 60).
---
I say this because generally a lot of people level a mage as an alt anyway due to its incredible gold farming capabilities. Having that gold farming ability right off the bat would be very helpful with leveling your other characters and getting them decked out.
---
Ultimately, though, you should just do whatever you want. Since it's your first time playing Classic, play whatever class you enjoy the most and just have fun experiencing the world. Warlock and Shaman are both great choices and you can't really go wrong. I currently have a level 31 Shaman on a Pserver and the feeling of getting those sick Windfury procs is hard to beat.
---
Or he sees there‚Äôs money to be made from streaming it lol
---
There were far more autoattack swings.
---
&gt; I see this now - but why is the bosses damage output so much lower. Look  at the old video and he is throwing out 250 damage every couple of  seconds. 
---
Could be an AI issue or pure luck. If you look at the old video you can see that the boss is constantly casting void bolt. This happens in the asmongold video later, but at the start, the boss is meleeing a lot. And the melee hits are rather weak apparently.
---
&gt; Secondly, look at the son of Arugal damage done to Asmon, they are  hitting him for 35 damage. That's not even 5% of his hp per hit for an  elite mob almost the same level as him, it should literally be 2-3x that  amount. 
---
No clue how much damage they did. They appear kinda weak, but without any comparison it's hard to say.
---
That sounds like a horrible idea
---
lol he doesn't have any lag
---
Only 120 minimum....
---
Christ
---
Thought so,  lmao
---
Lad, I'll be sincere with you, and it will be very rude, and I'm sure the citizens of Dalaran will disagree with me, but:
---
That's just unnecessary wanking.
---
You can be anyone. But mage would be the most straightforward.
---
you two (and i am guitly of this myself a bit now) are part of the "community for sure" btw.
---
just stop with the negativity in this sub.. classic is coming, things are getting reported to make the experience better. some earlier some later.
---
its all good, were going home soon. peace
---
Everyone seems to be a fucking vanilla expert
---
I answered Vanilla because it's technically true (fall of 2006), but TBC was really my WoW coming-of-age era.
---
Dude under 20 scolding everyone I'm dead.
---
I like the idea in retail. Not in classic
---
4/7 troll. Goddamn it
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm also thinking. Once that date hits, everyone will be pre-occupied to spread cancer.
---
My confusion is because it wasn‚Äôt added until 1.9.
---
I played vanilla when it was retail and literally couldn't give less of a fuck about being in the beta.
---
I just think the streamers are uninformed about the game and therefore they don't deserve viewers. And yeah, a lot of their content is just dragged out for more revenue. 
---
They just don't really have very much integrity. This isn't every streamer, but a lot of them. Tipsout especially is a huge boner.
---
Stop making threads about gatekeeping.
---
Im not even sure if your criticizing classic or retail.  You're post makes little sense and is irrelevant either way.
---
Wake me up, when August 25th ends
---
is there a way to not see all posts with this literal neckbeard in the title?
---
Hate to shatter a bubble here but the project 60 launch that I was a part of with Sodapoppin was in winter/spring of 2016. Hadn‚Äôt heard of this one on Moon Guard before though.
---
Wish we could still do it, but with the worldwide scaling and ilvl improvements on dungeon gear, raid gear is obsolete so really ruins any chance to make it happen
---
RIP Broken Tooth :(
---
&gt; The regen is too high too.
---
No it isnt, and that has been confirmed with Joanas videos.
---
Again, if you're farming MC on alts and paying pugs, you're not in there to gear up a raid. And any guild at that point still without bindings, can do without a geared rogue.
---
Genuinely wondering what guy who recorded the second video is doing with his life now lol or if hes actually browsing this sub. 11 years man time flies
---
Except... he doesn't. He's how he's supposed to be, if not maybe a tiny bit weaker.
---
I'm not surprised most people here don't know about Quin since he only gets a couple thousand viewers instead of Asmongold/Sodapoppin tier numbers, but basically he plays a character on stream 90% of the time.
---
And it seems like his acting is actually believable enough for some people on this thread.
---
Any news on the second attempt?
---
Nah I have been corrected and they were right. The damage difference is due to the vanilla one chain casting a spell where as vs Osmongold he doesn't really cast a lot for some reason, so his damage output was much lower. The spell seems to do the same damage but for some reason he isn't casting it much vs Asom so the dps is a bit lower.
---
It's hard to tell from one video, but the elites are definitely not doing enough damage. The elite wolves within 1-2 levels of Asmongold are not even doing 4% of his hp per hit, that's fucking crazy lol. Since when could anybody tank 24 hits from an elite in vanilla without dying?
---
His real question is why would any1 stream snipe his beloved overlord streamer sensei. Prob wants a law passed preventing you from doing any such
---
&gt;should have transmog, dual spec, LFG
---
I literally havent seen a single person say any of these things, and I've been browsing this sub for the past 6 hours today alone. I'm fucking refreshing "New" at this point.
---

Something similar happened to a friend of mine in burning crusade. He was a BElf paladin that received double healing from all sources. Nothing he did changed it, was a super valuable tank. He put in like 8 tickets to blizzard and they never really acknowledged it or tried to fix it. Was terrified his account would eventually get banned for cheating. 
---
Took the WotLK launching to fix it
---
is it good?
---
M2
---
yes, if you sub now you are eligible
---
No one is talking about dps.
---
How long did it take for you to make this meme? :P
---
They have the info since the demo and remmeber how the demo was, everything was off. They are making the changes one by one so many things can be wrong
---
‚ÄúUh, uh, uh... moo?‚Äù
---
It's been a while since you played vanilla hasn't it? This isn't retail where everyone has every piece they're missing 2 weeks into the raid tier.
---
This is me. I played an Undead Mage back in the day and I'm planning on rolling a Gnome Mage for classic.
---
Can't wait to kill people with my good looks.
---
&gt; Blizzard has no interest in actually tuning the difficulty in an appropriate manner
---
So you dont want the actual vanilla experice.
---
The numbers pre 2.3 are the same ones i'm using. It was 494.000 XP required from 60 to 61.
---
"How do we get our sub count up?"
---
"Make only subscribed players get access to classic beta"
---
This may seem minor to some. But id rather have the game delayed to fix things like this. It breaks immersion.
---
Y'all need Jesus üôèüôå
---
They are undertuned? Staysafe was level 25 after 24 hours in the beta. He said in private servers he would be level 30 at that time. That is 68% of his former speed. And he is all alone in the beta too with all the mobs for himself. Classic will be a lot harder.
---
Don‚Äôt I think eu will have it server as well since their player base is somewhat notable?
---
Use the realm list page on gamepedia and use the Usrealm pop to see the most popular servers. The center of the country plays the most followed by mountain then pacific and eastern if I did my math right.
---
Late Vanilla (roughly 1-2 months before TBC launched). Technically I didn't count Vanilla because I didn't experience any end-game content, let alone hit max level.
---
Maybe they interrrupted him more.
---
He is... the O.G.
---
I played WoW very casually during Wrath, never raided, and played a bit more in Legion. 
---
Right now I really want to try Classic because it's similar to Oldschool Runescape when it released, everyone being level 1 etc. 
---
I just feel like I'll be shunned for being new/more casual and not grinding 15 hours a day.
---
Sometimes it feels like this sub is full of bitter old boomers who don't understand that streamers/youtubers are a thing now.
---
1. Mage = Hunter &gt; Spriest. Mage can cc, slow enemy group in bottleneck areas, dish out a ton of damage. Hunter can viper sting all the casters and pick people off from afar.
---
2. Spriest &gt; Mage &gt;= Hunter. Spriest is amazing 1v1, but has a harder time 1vx because of mana issues. Mage has really good 1vx potential, great damage and cc, good escapes, and decent survivability with ice barrier, ice block + cold snap. Hunters can track humanoids, shadowmeld + aimed shot (if NE) and kite melee for days. Hunter is amazing in wpvp while leveling, but Mage probably scales better later.
---
3. Mage &gt; Hunter &gt; Spriest. One of the highest dps classes, great utility with food + decurse. Hunters do pretty good damage in early raid tiers, but fall off later. Most raids only bring a few for Tranq shot. Raids MIGHT bring you as a spriest if you're lucky, but I wouldn't count on it.
---
4. Mage &gt; Hunter &gt; Spriest. Again, mage does amazing damage, and has amazing CC. Most dungeon groups want at least 1. Hunter is often seen as a liability and nooby, but will have an okay time finding a group. Spriest‚Äîmight get a spot, but will likely not be seen as optimal. 
---
5. Mage &gt;= Hunter &gt; Spriest. Mages can AoE farm and is probably the most efficient/effective class for this. Hunters can farm really well, and can solo difficult elites/mara etc. Spriest you'll probably be killing 1-2 at a time and can't really solo dungeons.
---
Mage wins on paper. That said, I find spamming frostbolt in raids/drinking after every mob incredibly boring and would probably rather roll a hunter or priest.
---
Hey, I'm a WoW old timer! Played since Vanilla and cleared up through most of Naxx, even!
---
*No.*
---
Welp I just found my new background
---
People like you should have given the beta
---
wtf
---
WOW in general is pretty fucking toxic as a community. Try being someone who actually likes BFA, the abuse you get is hilarious XD  
---
I completely agree, im hoping once I get to try Classic in game the people I bump into will be friendly
---
Mods BIG gay
---
damn good post but im honestly very dissapointed by this. Personally the higher damage on pservers makes the game way more fun imo sadly it looks like we will just faceroll all pve content :( I would honestly like it if they buffed all damage on elite mobs by a bit but that will sadly never happen.
---
All I can say that Vanilla 1.12 nights and Classic nights (as seen on streams, I have no Beta access) is the same.
---
I checked for that too, they have a paladin, hunter, mage, and warrior on dps.   Didn't see a single shield bash, though there may have been a counterspell.
---
And here I am, suddenly pondering if there has always been an auction house in Stormwind.
---
It's released.
---
https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Classic
---
As an old timer, no.
---
IDK why this sub keep bringing this up, they obviously invite legit tester and people who are there to act as free advertisement. Guess which one the one you linked goes under...
---
someone seems desperate for internet points
---
Ahhhhh the old SW auction house at 7pm on a Friday. I could smell my graphics card burning.
---
Fortnite servers must be down
---
Here's what I think is happening, the server is mistakenly loading the normalised tamed hunter pet values instead of the wild values.
---
You have to go frost right? I assume so since MC could have fire res. And I imagine would be better for pvp too.
---
I seen few pvp videos they seem to have pom pyro mostly.
---
So are private servers generally harder than real vanilla?
---
Protector of the realm and all that.
---
I didnt notice that. Thanks for the mention. That does change things.
---
When did this happen? From what I know they arent even sure if addons will be working when the game firsts launches. I suspect this "release" is actually just working in the beta. I want to know if it will be allowed in Classic by the devs or will they purposefully break it
---
Let me guess. May 22nd?
---
Never the less, got a giggle and thus an upvote from me.
---
Ideal Male Body
---
I could never imagine a loot system in a popular streamer‚Äôs guild....
---
Guild streamers are just asking for trouble IMO. You have people stream sniping, joining your guild for the streamer alone, etc. they literally provide nothing to the table other than your guild getting recognition.
---
It's already available
---
Also true
---
I was just refreshing this sub over and over, but I needed a change.
---
Now I refresh this sub *and* quit and reopen the BNet launcher to make sure I didn‚Äôt get into a new beta invite wave.
---
I trust Blizzard more than I trust anyone who isn't Blizzard, so people saying Blizzard are wrong are either from Pservers, or didn't play.    Also any gatekeeping from either side is dumb.
---
Depends on your schedule.  Pre joining a guild is  a good idea if there are select times where you can raid.
---
Sounds legit. Upvote.
---
Why would they purposefully break a shittier version of an addon that exited in vanilla and is used on pservers to this day?
---
having dbm wont really do much in classic tbh, the bosses have very few mechanics and theyre extremely simple
---
Wouldn‚Äôt you need to add 59-60 into the chart as well?
---
You are way overthinking it
---
Nice meme
---
Addons will work and the current addon and lua scripting is available in the Alpha. The API that they said they weren't sure of was for websites / armory / etc.
---
How about, you and I both know the specific gatekeeping thread you are referring to. How about you respond to that specifically instead of wasting space with your own call out thread. LOL.
---
3 swings in the old video and 6 in the asmon video, the old video they dont stand as close either with most of the fight being away from the boss.
---
&gt;gatekeeping
---
just get good or fuck off 
---
that easy
---
The fighting can look bad.  At times, it can also seem abusive. The fighting serves a purpose though. It might not always fulfill that purpose but when it does, it makes it worth it.
---
there certainly was a lot of UI addons even back in classic, not sure how them using the modern servers will effect how addons work, but cant see that people wont make addons for UI again like they did back then.
---
maybe check out curse/twitch and see what classic addons are on there already as you can bet that people are making them
---
&gt;a few extra keybinds
---
I counted 11 keybindable actions for a hunters pet !
---
[/r/classicwow right now](https://i.redd.it/b5lx6rq9yz411.jpg)
---
The bug is he moves too fast??
---
&gt; , it's that streamers who have very little understanding/experience about Vanilla WoW are being given priority Beta access to an extremely limited-population Beta test that hinges on the players reporting issues
---
Do you actually think Blizzard is prioritizing streamers in an attempt to get them to report bugs?
---
You people are so fucking delusional. They are giving streamers priority access to garner hype for the game, nothing else. If you want to be angry at anyone, get angry at Blizzard.
---
Like many games, Firewall started it's journey with a great vision and decent gameplay. 
---
However after playing from the alpha the quality of production continued to decline with poor feature decisions. The dev rant posted in here gives good context for how and why this can happen. Not only in games but any project.
---
Did you get an actual email and added today or did you just notice?
---
I thought of this song while leveling. ‚ÄúI just want to fish ‚Äú...
---
It took you all night to download 4 gigs? Are you running an actual phone line internet connection?
---
They did for tamed hunter pets, but the untamed versions should have different attack speeds afaik.
---
people dont understand that time consumption doesnt mean jack shit. what matters is how engaging and fun the game is moment to moment, if a game has that then it literally doesnt matter how long shit takes because you're having fun playing a great game the entire time.
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt they use a beta to hype stuff? It makes sense
---
This is what terrifies me. Rolling on a server and it being a streamer server, then once their lings realize where they are they converge on the server....
---
I tried downloading the Blizzard Launcher now and installing BFA client. All worked fine up until I tried to launch the game. Then I got a window "This application has encountered a critical error etc etc" and the game was never launched.
---
I Installed the staging version of Wine just now, but it's not 3.7 like yours, so that's wierd. It's 4.0.1
---
Why, because it makes content easier. That was my understanding. I dont really care either way, am just curious what their plan is
---
Are you sure that you had a Bard?
---
That's the starter gear which does not have armor. It is just cosmetic.
---
Which is all r/WoW was when he played retail too.  His content needs to be restricted as it‚Äôs never him posting it nor is it often a link back to his own accounts.
---
Idiotic.
---
Speaking of toxicity... Can we stop bashing Tips, bros? 
---
I mean, he might be noob who doesn't know some stuff, it's also possible that he's took a chance to milk the hype and make himself a name that way, but... 
---
He's really trying, lol. His interviews/footage from the beta was top-tier among all else. He was there all day before soda/asmon etc came, keeping us hyped and playing 20+ hours straight after that. He REALLY makes impact, even if it's his own way. I don't get all that hate.
---
I think you got that backwards.  Tauren has greater reach, and ground aoe they can avoid nova farther while still being in range to hit.
---
They're both great, and while people usually bring fewer druids to raids druids are way fewer and further between so getting your raid spot as one will, probably, be easier.
---
Except you can tell what they think by what they upvote. I can tell this sub dislikes me exposing their hypocrisy.
---
Agreed. I think the correct word for classic is it's punishing.
---
Pulling an extra mob or breaking ccing or getting critted is when the games goes from normal to hard
---
Druids are played less so you might have an easier time getting into raids just because of that.
---
I've always said that releasing the expansion in a "Classic" theme would always be amazing to me.
---
TBC without flying mounts,without HC dungeons and 20/40 man raids instead of 10/25 would be seriously mega interesting to me.
---
You don't HAVE to, but yes in earlier raid tiers you can't really play fire because of all the fire resist. AQ40 onwards you can play fire, and it's more optimal to do so. Frost is probably better for pvp, but fire is decent and a ton of fun. PoM pyro, or a scorch-kiting style like in this video (which is what swayed me to roll mage back in the day): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORh0Akf56dc

I thought there may have been one in theramore? May be worth it to take the boat from wetlands to theramore to grab the FP, then back to wetlands taking the boat to Auberdine. Whenever you need to train can fly from Ru‚Äôtheran to Theramore if OP‚Äôs really set on it
---
Too bad the claim is wrong.  If you look in both videos they both get hit by 230-245 damage by the shadowbolt.
---
I really disagree. Sure the level is fine, but endgame is awful. If you want gear your only options are to PvP 23 hours a day or join a 40 man raid guild to kill bosses that drop two items for the whole raid, and probably not even items that can be used(see druid/warlock chests for more info).
---
So because people don't agree with your opinion  you instantly say he uses his viewers? Bro this is the most piss poor attempt at starting drama where there is none and making a mountain out of a mole hill. Get a life and get some self respect and delete this post if you have any brain cells left.
---
Lol dude chill.
---
Imagine surfing the Classic WoW sub, seeing a question you "hate", then proceeding to answer it.
---
It's very hard to give an accurate answer since private servers I've been drawn to have released content progressively which means that tons of stuff is missing and you have to compensate for it by grinding. With phasing and most of the quests in the game for classic, 4-6 days played should be accurate.
---
So you're intentionally helping to make this sub worse? Looks like it from your post history.
---
At least you're honest about being a jerk.
---
*i'm gonna admit i'm wrong since i can make some money out of it. everybody wins*
---
Thanks for the laugh... Not even past the first sentence.
---
Is this a troll post? 2k-3k for a classic machine?
---
Jesus.

I want to be well respected on my sever and when the horde see me I want them to fear me!

---
&gt;the fantasy of being a berserker or a barbarian, even though it only makes sense for orcs, tauren, trolls, and maybe dwarves
---
Berserkers are from (human) Vikings myths !
---
A really big streamer will complete that questchain much faster than any regular guild could. He will be more than 10 hours ahead of everyone so no one else will get it too. Even more exclusivity for the streamer.
---
Maybe. But most people wont want any of it as they seek a more genuine experience.
---
It also makes players worse, so it's a trade off in terms of difficulty.
---
That said, they spoke of breaking addons that had game breaking functionality which wasn't possible in vanilla, not addons that simply make things easier, peolpe have been using raid warnings and timers since I first stepped into MC in the spring of 2005.
---
Adding a tipsout video here showing REALLY LOW damage from 2 elites melee mobs in SFK.

Yes you are.  He is saying he hit harder.  That is dps.

No, this just breeds elitism.
---
Big True
---
The man, the myth, the legend...
---
There were more than a few complaining last night that there was no flight path from Goldshire to Stormwind... haha.
---
So i guess players like me who started in legion have no hope of getting a beta access :(
---
No. It will take you forever in classic. 
---
Foreverrrr
---
I'm assuming he has around 35-40% again his own level.
---
Yeah! They're all XP!
---
I want to have them in my bed and we can roll around
---
when did you fist play wow, as me and my other half have both played since AQ release and was wondering if when you first joined had much effect on beta invites for people that aren't content creators.
---
hope to get a beta at some point but not a massive loss if i don't as classic is still coming in August
---
That may very well be the case for you, but there is also the chance you will end up having the same experience as me.
---
I played my first bugged version of a vanilla private server in 2010 and i've been playing on and off on private servers for the last 9 years. Levelled each class to 60 at least once and raided MC probably 100s of times on new characters. 
---
I would have prefered if they would have released Classic as WoW 1.13, but releasing it the way they are doing is safer. Let people experience Vanilla this way and then go for 1.13 after people run out of new things to do.
---
Depending on how long he will play and how often, I don't think he will be able to keep rested exp up all the time. It goes away really quickly and takes a long while to build up a lot of it.
---
I think this is a bad idea for a main/mains, but a fantastic idea for alts.
---
My main will go to 60 pretty directly.  But aside from that, I definitely plan on having Lock/Hunter/Mage/Rogue alts that I rotate between, so that any given alt leveling session is on rested XP.
---
I submitted a ticket to get clarification on whether or not you need to be subbed and they said yes. You need to be subbed in order to play and be picked.
---
did you work on the last NASA mission too?
---
Don't pretend to be a perfect human being who would do flawless testing and not send a single bad bug report xD At least he is actually sending bug reports and trying to help out. A lot of players are probably just playing to have fun and don't give a shit about testing
---
Well yeah, why wasn‚Äôt he ‚Äúpro-classic‚Äù before?

You've just described why a good balance between time investment and rewards are needed which destroys this sentence
---
&gt;people dont understand that time consumption doesnt mean jack shit in videogames.
---
You counter argumented yourself there.
---
Found the UD rogue :D
---
English servers are everywhere, of course they will be in Classic too, I don't get your point?
---
I wanna cry... so much memories...
---
Wait the most overpowered world pvp class with the highest grief potential in the world and in cities is buttmad over duels not being fair? el oh el
---
fuck this pedo
---
Gatekeeping?  Pretty sure Blizzard did that by only allowing subbed people to opt into beta as opposed to people who also played back then.
---
I get what you are saying, but you are seeing this because of questionable decisions by the company as well.
---
Awesome thanks for the answer!
---
There is no 5k+ streamer on EU right? Just dodge Method and you are fine.
---
I thought rogue was more difficult even before  warriors had this super high regen, but now that its confirmed that warriors don't need to eat its not even a competition.
---
Rogue is fucking awful before like lvl 40, they have really good talents to make up for it, but before that they have basically all the  weaknesses of warriors besides wearing leather instead of mail
---
I'm sure people will make addons to change the look.
---
Back in Vanilla folks did make full UI replacements or just used stuff like Bongos, art panels, etc to change the look.
---
Personally I like Bartender just so I can hide text and make out of range a full button indicator. A few movers and a DoT timer of some kind to manage dots on targets. I was also a fan of Necrosis back in the day to help manage warlock basics and non-combat abilities so I didn't have to fill my bars with every little spell.
---
There have been a lot of improvements to the UI over the years like drop-down style demon summon buttons, cooldown numbers, etc.
---
In a lot of ways the original UI was pretty poor at providing info to the player that is pertinent. It had some clutter that could have been left out and some consolidation. But interface design back then wasn't as far along as it is now, particularly now that we've gotten better at designing interfaces across a wide range of products not limited to games.
---
It was just an idea, which I've proved wrong in other posts. Turns out something funky was going on with joana specifically against those mobs.
---
I'm still waiting on mine :(
---
Seriously, if your not trolling head over to one of the many PC gaming centric subs. You will find better info.
---
And then there are the Silithid bugs.
---
still remember the confusion when it was redone for wotlk and they made it use orbs instead of needing priests
---
I wouldn't bother spending that much on a prebuilt. You can spend half that and still max out most current games at 144hz.
---
/r/buildmeapc is where you want to go if you want advice on a build.
---
I‚Äôm reference to what
---
Disc was absolute garbage tier in vanilla, so it's not surprising it was frowned upon there.
---
I always think of old school WoW as everything before the Catacylsm. Did you get to try out TBC or WOTLK? I guess I should of mentioned this when I said old school :)
---
Leveling as glass cannon fire mage  (this means going all out on spelldamage) , one of the best kept secrets of the vanilla scene.....
---
Yeah its pretty nice. I get a lot of free stuff and deductables. I'm not complaining.
---
Not trolling and I only provided price tolerance for best advice from the community; again I totally realize how fortunate I am to be able to go overboard. Also, it‚Äôs time for a new machine and of course WoW isn‚Äôt my only use (play shooters, watch 4K vid, would be interested in messing around with VR, etc.)
---
Just figured this a great community with tons of people who are familiar with hardware and wanted to get some input. 
---
Sorry if I came off like a prick!
---
He might've gotten it if he didn't accidentally tag the poly'd mob.
---
Line of sight is still different depending on your races height on retail. It seems to be intended.
---
Fifteen minutes per death? That's the biggest load of crap I've heard in eons. Most corpse runs are 30 sec to 1 minute at average.
---
Regarding your problem, you need to explain to him that this game wasn't made for PvE servers only. It works, but you might as well play be playing Zelda without Link. Two factions. Two continents. World PvP interactions (not necessarily ganking), the dynamics of a PvP server is what the game is about. You're supposed to be nervous, feeling extremely uneasy when entering the Blackrock Mountain. For the first time in your life, you're actually rushing yourself towards the BRD entrance, scared for your life; "Exploring? Fuck that! I'm getting the hell out here!".
---
PvE servers is literally removing half the game. I wouldn't mind you guys having it though, just don't expect respect for feats, like world first kills and stuff on a pve server
---
There has been an error. We need you to contact the support team immediately. You can do so at *inserts personal email*. You weren't supposed to get my beta invite ;)
---
Yes and by the server name it tells you how many chars you have on that server.
---
Stream snipe means watching the streamer's stream so you know where they are. That means knowing where they are in the world at all times. That means they are easy to find and kill. That's how you stream snipe world pvp.
---
Paladin dwarf
---
You pay something called a "hybrid tax" to do damage.
---
Paladins have the lowest damage output and offensive options in heal spec....They are compensated with the best support kit
---
Druids are brought in 40 man raiding just for the buff basically. You could get away with 0 without the buff/faerie fire 
---
Combat res is also nice
---
Check out countdown to classics episodes with the Vanilla WoW devs. Kevin Jordan especially is a great listen. He really was responsible for a lot of the design philosophies that made Vanilla magical.
---
Paladin is a better healer hands down. More effective, more fun, and more desirable. The only reason druids are really brought to raids is because of innervate and battle rez. Play it if you want to, but your quality of life will be higher as paladin probably. Pick whichever race you think looks cooler.
---
If you have the time and want 2 characters, why not
---
What‚Äôs ignorant about what I‚Äôm asking you?  And what makes you think I‚Äôm a bigot when you were the one calling me a nut hugger because I thought the guy was being toxic? 
---
Answer my question tho.
---
How‚Äôs he going to have any idea which server is high pop at launch
---
You won't get in these waves unless your account was made before 2006, just a heads up. Maybe in future waves.
---
Rp's deserve to be trolled and harassed, so ... Good
---
Yep, I made my account opening day and didn't stop playing until MoP. I raided in Vanilla, WotLK and Cata. I also had an alliance priest on an RP server and a horde shaman on a PvP server the entire time, so I'm pretty well versed with how the game worked back then.
---
Ironically enough, when that time comes.. its going to feel like it wasn't a thing to wait. As of now though, i'm dying w/o my invite.
---
seething shill
---
If there is more than zero evidence of numbers being off, it means u can‚Äôt take anything for granted, needs to have an open mind to numbers being off.
---
If you already are hellbent on the opinion that data is perfect you will find 1000 ways to disregard players subjective experiences. (Private server, Nostalgia, Old memory, Better players now than then etc etc etc, you name it)
---
Try to keep an open mind.
---
Yeah pretty much, I'd feel gross speed running WC at 18.
---
This strat is probably good for people that don't have much time to play: If you empty the rested xp on one character, hop on another character and empty rested xp too, and repeat this, you will end up with virtually no rested xp really fast.
---
Where can you reserve your name?
---
Yup, I thought the content on this sub would get better once the beta hits. Nopeee. Inc 100 days of hell.
---
Sorry Stable\*, not Staging, still wierd though. Why is your "staging" at 3.7 but my Stable is at 4.0.1? :p
---
anyway I tried again with the development (which I suppose is the newest bleeding edge) 4.8, still unable to launch :/
---
This also reminded me that people were so starved for gear in TBC they started PvPing for the PvP epic gear so they could have the gearscore necessary for heroic 5 mans, lol.
---
call him a pussy and play pvp anyways
---
Beta on a game released 15 years ago.
---
Yup. 100% this.
---
How can you tell a player played in Vanilla wow? They'll tell you in less than 5 seconds.

It seems reasonable given the limitations. But this graph would look the same if you labeled it "Mobs to kill at each level" since you didn't add time as a variable anywhere. We could make it slightly better by timing streamers time to kill (TTK) of a level 1 mob @ level 1, 10@10, 20@20, and 30@30 and then interpolate out the TTK between 1-30. If a pattern emerges we can use that to step out to 60. If not, we could extrapolate the original data for at least a sense. This would make time a factor into the source xp grid amounts.
---
ehhhhh I don't see people calling for murder, more like taking the piss out of streamers who believe they are the end-all but wind up being incredibly dense and putting their lack of game knowledge on display for the world to see when faced with having to perform in a real environment.
---
There's a giant chasm between the two. Sure you'll have the odd troll who goes overboard but most are like me - we look, point and whip our heads back in laughter at them while at the same time wouldn't do that to a total newbie at the game because most newbies don't act like Johnny Awesome when they step foot in a game for the first time.
---
Oof just saw this on r/wowclassic bingo
---
Nov 23 2004 was sure a different time back then. Internet got more popular, it's even in our pockets, cars and consoles. You'll have more good people and more rotten people fighting in the same room as the years go on. Eventually things will settle down and people can find their corners of their own enjoyment. Games come and go, just like people do.
---
They have raw  base server data, not an actual server.. What they had is very very far away from an even slightly playable game.
---
Servers didn't die back then.. not sure why some people keep saying this.  
---
Yes, there would be que's for a few days, but it would benefit the game in the long run.
---
I watched Venruki do those pulls for like 2 hours this morning lol. So satisfying
---
How the fuck would I know? I don't work there, nor did I in 2004 when they released WoW originally. I'm speaking of the code and hardware they used in 2004. They could probably have done all that again, as it was in 2004 - but it would have been cost prohibitive, especially the part to make it work with the new stuff (I would assume a lot of band-aid code and whatnot). The way they did it (as far as I understand) was to use the current code and architecture, and make it work with the old product to keep it in line with their current methodology.
---
yes but not with the time commitment I give to other streamers that know what they are doing. I'd go to the new persons stream to see if he needs any suggestions. It's like taking virginity w/o all da secks
---
How does this scale with the amount of xp you gain from quests and monsters? It makes it look like 1-20 takes as long as 59-60, but that certainly isn't the case since xp inflates at higher levels.
---
I played vanilla wow and I would pay money not to have that UI again.
---
This is why spell batching is bullshit.
---
This is already hard to connect in PVP as a warrior, but players that know about this can negate your only 2 mobility spells ...
---

---
Yeah buddy! Smack some baddies for me!
---
keep your head up! no one knows how blizzard is weighting each account but im sure it didnt hurt if you account was created in vanilla..
---
That‚Äôs definitely not something I had considered. I don‚Äôt really care if mages are overplayed I‚Äôm just gonna go with what I find fun after I test. Having never played vanilla I have no idea what I‚Äôm getting into.
---
Do face types next

15 years later, Van Cleef is like 36 now.

People are saying he's wearing some leather armor also but I haven't looked at his inventory.
---
It was fifth grade but it was classic.
---
Well, you can argue that you watch professionals that are EXTREMELY talented play sports. We can clearly see that these streamers are just regular Joes when it comes to WoW and some other games. They‚Äôre just there to really be entertainment.
---
If I‚Äôm going to tune in to watch a streamer it will be Joanas trying to break records or a guild doing server first.
---
That 1 month of layering is going to destroy the economy you are right.
---
I only remember it being in IF. Or Lagforge.
---
i will do it aswell
---
Yeah those fucking parasites. Being compensated by fan generosity. And what what do they produce in the mean time? Entertainment? That's not a real job or industry. Fucking leeches, entertaining people for a living.
---
What makes you think you can make it to lvl 60 in one week if you don't know about guild dynamics on a fresh server?
---
Their post isn't exactly an essay.  If you have are honestly having trouble discerning their point from that small block of text then I don't know what to tell you.

Being sensationalist and making constant posts about how awful streamers are is toxic in the same way making posts about how X community is toxic...is toxic.

Just get 9900k and 2080 ti and call it a day maybe look at the corsair one on Amazon for about 3.5k if you want it all prebuilt cheers
---
Random: If you're leveling a troll warrior and you only get spirit, would the in-combat health regen be a somewhat viable strategy, even if it was a meme strat?
---
I was hoping to get into beta just to test this to a degree haha
---
I heard in an interview that they will offer server transfers, so if you end up on a streamer server and you only realize it later down the road, you wont be forced to reroll if you are willing to pay for a transfer. Sucks but atleast you have an option there.
---
Your really bored eh?
---
A warrior hits you once with his weapon - [The Unstoppable Force](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19323), directly afterwards he equips his tanking weapon - [Harbinger of Doom](http://classicdb.ch/?item=23044). He hits you once with the dagger before you blind him and run away. 
---
Which one hit harder? 
---
The beauty of it is that Blizzard's own distinction between damage (how hard something hits) and dps (how much damage something can do over time) is at complete and utter odds with your reasoning... I sincerely hope you're playing a healer or caster.

I had this exact same scenario except I was a little gnome mage, and my nemesis was a Tauren hunter named "Ajaxx" The main difference is I was a flag carrying mvp back before there was a meta. I would run in freeze everyone and blink in ways where they weren't sure where I'd gone. I had a priest with me that I was online friends with for a while named "Refozo". I hadn't thought about that in a long time thanks for the memories. Refozo and Ajaxx if you're out there somewhere then what up
---
Literally everybody who has played on one understands that.

i started maybe a couple months after the game launched and have been active in every expansion except WoD, so definitely before aq  but who knows how they are weighting the invites  /shrug  wife started playing in BC and she has no invite but not really surprised

I'm a guy, and I've done that for gold in Stormwind with I first started playing...

Is that scaled with how XP gain goes up with higher level?

Shared with my skeptical friends!

He said he played mage in vanilla but jeah jump on the streamer hate bandwagon lol
---
This has really put my wow guide in to perspective and I should follow this one! I will meal prep a day before launch too. 
---
Buy a stand up desk and play so I dont get a DVT and drop dead after 30 hours sitting down. 
---
Man I'm keen!
---
3 times the resources for 3 times the players. And it is all temporary, just a few weeks for the servers that lose population faster and 3 months max for the biggest ones.
---
Fair enough, but I bet there alot of people that would not, including me.
---
as someone who played in vanilla i can 100% say i remember a shit ton about it, even boss tactics for raids, but if you asked me to tell you how hard a specific mob hit i would have a clue, best guess hard but then i played a mage back then and not a tank lol
---
This sub has an issue of some Pserver players insisting it's the exact same, and some non pserver players insisting they're completely different. I think the hyperbole is a reddit issue in general, but it's annoying sub-plot of this sub.
---
Yes if people could keep an open mind, especially in a beta wtf. So annoying
---
This has been an argument since day one, mostly made by min/maxers and top raiders from private servers. Unfortunately as more and more normies filled this sub our concerns were drowned out. PvE content will be absolutely facerolled on Blizz Classic, much more so than the buffed content we got on private servers. I remember early on people advocating for buffed raid bosses and some new mechanics to give us that "progression" feeling, but the #nochanges crowd shit all over that.
---
Yeah, this is a huge stretch. I can sort by controversial anywhere and see shitty posts downvoted into the dirt.
---
Big streamers viewership alone can fill a dozen servers.
---
I don't find it wrong to worry about not wanting to be on one of these servers. 
---
They just mention on stream they want to form a raid to go do something in the world and within minutes their fans have gathered. This has already happened in the beta.
---
AoE in plaguelands?
---
Not great considering how long it takes to get rested exp
---
You can only do so much. They‚Äôll probably end up re-rolling to another server in no time and be back on the server you xferred to.
---
Also, I plan on playing with 18+ of my buddies, I‚Äôd have to talk them all into re-rolling or paying to xfer....
---
If the drama kicked off this bad on beta, every single move they make is going to be criticised on release. Can't imagine what's gona happen if they do this on live classic.
---
Shadow priest is only a good duelist, mana problems. They're out, only a slot for one in a raid and it's not even optimum. 
---
AV mage is probably better, although hunter has it's charms too not that far apart. Mage just rapes in zerg combat, hunter better for solo defense and has frost trap which rapes. 
---
Solo wpvp hunter is better (not just 1 v 1 they have things like tracking and vision that give them more info, both have great cc, hunter less mana reliant can keep punishing scrubs if fight extends tho)
---
Spot for raid - about even considering what class populations will look like. Only really need 2 hunters can have many mages tho. If you're reliable good hunter indispensable. Nothing will wipe a raid faster than a crap hunter trying to kite
---
Dungeon /Farming - Pretty much hunter only because of one ability, feign death. You can trivialize all 5 man pulls and can solo a lot of content as a hunter with this ability. Should be able to solo farm Dire Maul tribute with teh right gear. 
---
In a 5 man hunter can just pull one mob, have ur tank shoot it, then hunter feigns death and only one mob is pulled. It's ridiculous.
---
For both 5 mans and solo content hunter is king DPS just because of feign. Unless you're gonna cleave/aoe it doesn't even slow you down much lol...Just makes any pull with any comp so easy
---
I remember a lot from classic but what I am most excited about (outside of the obvious) is re-learning the things I have forgotten about.

Someone has to make a classic thottbot webpage. I'ma make a post about it right now.

I'm excited for for actually belonging to a sever and dont just finding random players from other severs.

I want to level up slowly and take my time and enjoy the ride.
---

yup completely agree
---
There's already been a blue post about some of these "bugs". Health regen is accurate according to blizzard.
---
Go to r/pcmasterrace - sadly the only hardware with waiting for is coming out in Q3, so might be after classic. It's the new Ryzen processors. 
---
But with the budget or can see you have, it's more about finding the stuff that looks exactly like you want it, and fulfills any specific needs you may have. 
---
Consider getting some good monitors, a nice keyboard, etc, since you can't really spend that much on a gaming pc itself, unless you go custom water cooling.
---
See but you can raid as ele for non end content in vanilla. Like lets say you are playing ele, would people bring you to naxx? Probably not, because well it's not really that good, especially if people want to clear it. Just like if you want to do mythic raiding on retail, sure you can play a shittier spec and raid, but you probably won't be clearing the mythic raid as current content. Same as if lets say you play a warlock on retail, I don't know what the best spec is but say aff is the best and Destro is the worst. Would a guild trying to clear mythic coc bring a Destro lock over a aff lock? No. Or lets say for Jaina when it was the end raid for the tier, still no.       
---
People are going to choose the optimal option, not just the viable one for the "hardest" content.

Yikes, you need help.

---
No it isn't. I've never played a beta for any games, and I don't have any interest in starting. As much as you guys hate any and all criticism, I think it's very important to criticize. Classic wow wouldn't even exist if everyone kept their mouths shut to avoid "toxicity".
---
Hell yeah, lots of addons. People simply like to mod their experience. DBM, quest helper, etc.
---
The most wicked of all will be some sort of Player Measurement Addon, where you will be valued by your overall Gearscore *and* by how fast you have completed your dungeon  and raid runs. It will be the Raider io thingy of Classic WoW.

To honor the community, it will be called... *The Gatekeeper.*

maybe it was because we were younger and dumber?

They are doing it to avoid disasters. In case they need to implement a hotfix for an exploit. Have people stand-by at their server farm in case of crashes, etc.
---
Better to have a whole week of actual work, than on a weekend when most people aren't at work
---
People who actually played vanilla would be in their late 20s (minimum) and should act their age.
---
Yeah i feel you. Im just seeing a pattern that specific players are getting access. Classic launches at the beginning of my senior year of uni so i won't have much time to play. Wish i had beta to try it out in summer. Seems only the people who play wow as a career are getting early access
---
As long as we get RP-PvP from the jump I'll be happy. Then I can go home. As of now I don't know where I'll play but I'm glad it's back. Retail just does nothing for me
---
Streamers are pretty stupid people. 
---
The beta should of been for authenticity if the game is good people will come regardless just like Old school runescape
---
I have been falling in love with all the soundtracks again through the beta streams. I cannot wait to immerse myself into this game again.

I'm going dwarf priest just because the casting animation of smite looks DOPE af.

That looks great. Are you able to make a 1920x1080 version?
---
I thought about this as well, the only thing is that I don‚Äôt like to upgrade very often and want something that will be somewhat future-proof for about 4-5 yrs.  Does that change your opinion at all?
---
In an attempt to explain (not defend) the bitterness some players might have, I think a lot has to do with a combination of watching the game they love devolve into what it is today, and watching people talking down to them about why they loved it, saying it‚Äôll fail, and that it‚Äôs all nostalgia. That‚Äôs gonna stir up some bad juju on its own, especially when for years they‚Äôve been told the wall of no or that they don‚Äôt exist and that there‚Äôs no audience for it.
---
Again not defending that bitterness, but it makes sense why it exists.
---
It's what they did for *some* values, but the overwhelming majority of damage values for random mobs is essentially a guess. You could not packet sniff it easily, so it wasn't part of the massive amounts of semi-automatically generated data used to generate the databases. This means that the damage and armor for random mobs for which it was not specifically known was just generated using a lazy formula based on their level.
---
Only recently have modern private servers (TrinityCore) managed to reverse engineer the real mob damage formula, and I'm not sure if this is applied to the vanilla servers because they're running on a less developed emulator. It is, to my understanding, based on three factors: the mob's level, the mob's class (every mob has a class, normally hidden from the user but some addons and packet sniffers can show this), and a hidden multiplier that varies from mob to mob. A friend of mine, who has done a lot of research/QA work on private servers, told me that Verdan in WC, for instance, has a multiplier of 1.7. The problem here obviously is that this multiplier isn't known for all mobs.
---
So yes, mob stats like damage and armor *are* very often literally just a guess. A guess based on some sort of a formula, yes, but a guess nonetheless.
---
Me too.
---
* Feared players and NPCs run fast.
---
* Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth.
---
* Quests objectives and points of interests are not tracked on the map or minimap.
---
* Available quests do not display a ‚Äú!‚Äù on the minimap.
---
Easy way to spot new players :D Not that new players are a bad thing for Classic, on the contrary Classic is a home for everyone. However, on a case of Authenticity, new players who haven't played Vanilla back in the day, may not be the best candidates for testing Classic Beta.  
---
Heck, even those that might be the best candidates aren't really showcasing an incentive to actually test things rather than just having fun, which makes me slightly worried... How many things are actually going to be "bug fixed" or changed in favor of authenticity in this 3 month marketing stunt.
---
Is this hitbox gendered? I will be playing a female tauren
---
You are an idiot.
---
Doubtfull. Unless [x] big streamer has an entire army of geared followers on the same realm. And he still has to beat out all the other big guild working together.
---
You need to be lvl 5 to learn enchanting and you need lvl 1 in enchanting to disenchant anything.
---
There is no way in hell it takes the same amount of time to get from level 59 to 60 as it does from 1 to 12. 
---
Even back in vanilla I could get to level 10 in a few hours, but once you hit 15 or so things slowed down exponentially.
---
Haste? DansGame
---
I think you're blowing single instances and comments way out of proportion, and this in and of itself aids in leading to a "toxic community." That's my two cents.
---
So what? Why is it bad to report a bug in a beta?
---
I don't think it will be possible to gather all the variables that are affecting the damage of the level 7 tiger. You would need a video from vanilla patch 1.12 in which the user displays their character screen to confirm that we have the same items. 
---
I will say that reporting the bug about inconsistent damage from these tigers (3-5 from one, 5-7 from another) would be a good idea. Is there a chance that mobs spawn within a range of stats and that is why each one hits slightly different?
---
&gt;Quests objectives and points of interests are not tracked on the map or minimap.
---
This one killed me the most LOL 
---
I wonder if quest helper is still around?
---
Yeah, verbal harassment is ban worthy. That‚Äôs not appropriate at all.
---
I am iffy about this one.. I don't know to be honest. I think it's a little of both. I think they are VERY aware that they've replaced a hardcord base with a casual. If the numbers would have stayed the same, they wouldnt have blinked. Because the numbers too a MASSIVE dive, it's something they've had to come to a realization on.  Both?

My guess would be that he hasn't played classic since 2006 and he finally played it again and realized that it was better than he remembered?

Whats the general strategy for avoiding streamer realms? I haven't played any games with streamers
---
Wowhead already has one
---
it seems to be following what a lot of other people with invites are saying though, most i have seen that are not streamers/youtube creators have all had accounts since 2004/5 time, even if some of them haven't played since WoD, so they may be doing it based on account creation to get people that actually played back then.
---
Dont know anything about them I'm from New Zealand so only really use Amazon outside of computer stores here

But the specs and parts list looks good and the price looks fine If not too cheap.. i wonder how they are making money Haha

That sounds right. I didn't remember exactly what level you needed but, I knew it was not high at all.

Everyone is entitled to change their opinion. Welcome to classic then.

If you happen to remember the name of the video I'd be interested :)

It's a common mistake lol. It's the age-old debate involving years, too. Do you start counting at 0, or 1?

---
Pretty sure it's squeaky wheel syndrome. There's been more negativity than what's been directed at tipsout (people insisting that classic fans are deluded by nostalgia, the kerfluffle over layering). It's definitely been a small minority, but that minority has been shrill and loud enough that their voice gets amplified well beyond their numbers.
---
My RES says I've downvoted him 34 times lol
---
Paladin is in higher demand. Would roll human to play around with ret, apparently there is a wacky on hit damage build that pulls 1400dps on Pserver, but dwarf is probably the stronger option for strictly healing.
---
Druid is probably the least engaging healer in PvE. Will be playing one personally, but looking more towards PvP and tank/DPS/heal flexing.
---
I‚Äôll probably have two chars that I‚Äôll bounce back and forth on depending on what I feel like playing.  Most likely 1 horde and 1 alliance.
---
You have no idea if that was sarcastic or not. Could be accurate. Depression is real, you might not have had the experience at your age. Or it is sarcastic but in these cases you always err on the side of caution.
---
LMAO! Forgot 'mules' were a thing!
---
I played Horde for 2 year on retail vanilla . . I'll never make that mistake again. I want those crazy paladins on MY team.
---
Also why should retail change? To have two similar games? It is perfect the way it is now.
---
Corsair is highly reputable so personally I would go with them over the ibuypower machine
---
Oof, I want to argue... but I just can't; you win
---
Who is this?
---
Will do, I just like our group here so wanted to take a stab! :)
---
Even one pack with broken cc was rough in Stockades, and none of the streamers I've seen had any trouble with it when they were level-appropriate for the dungeon.
---
Like part of me knows that I was a dumb kiddo back then, but I also really don't think it was actually that easy. About 90% of my total WoW playtime was in vanilla, and my intuition (which I know is unreliable) on a ton of their dungeon pulls was "oh fuck that's a wipe or at minimum a sketchy fight"
---
It's not about the number of HKs specifically, it's about the honor value earned, otherwise known as "contribution points".
---
HKs give varying amounts of honor/contribution points, based on the level and rank of the player, as well as a diminishing returns calculation with repeatedly killing the same player in a given timeframe.
---
Also, honor earned from various BG objectives. What matters is the Honor/contribution points earned. To earn the maximum ranking points (13,000) on the weekly calculation, you have to be the #1 earner for your faction on your server.
---
I‚Äôm thinking 
---
Classic-&gt;BC-&gt;WotLK-&gt;New Content instead of destroying Azeroth
---
Basically yeah
---
Since I assumed the TTK of each mob at every lvl to be the same the amount of mobs equals the relative time. I also only had 20 minutes :p and I expect an actual accurate estimation to be very similar at the least.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to try this in a year when i finally hit 60 lol
---
The vanilla version of the LFG feature was entirely different than the modern LFG feature.  The vanilla version of it was *completely useless* to the point that literally nobody ever used it.
---
And if it were implemented in classic WoW, nobody would use it.  It was *that* worthless.
---
Try being more Condecending, it will get you more upvotes.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be as bad if there weren‚Äôt 10 of the same post within 2 hours of each other.
---
Well I guess they weren't proactive enough and it finally caught up to you.
---
Rest exp grows quite slowly. I think I remember not playing for 7 or so days and it was like half a level full. So it would work well if you have very limited time to play I suppose.
---
When I tell people I'm getting in shape for summer they think it's a beach bod...
---
&gt;e really huge week++ long RP campaigns where all the rp fights were coordinated between Alliance and
---
Argent Dawn EU represent &lt;3
---
By lying?
---
Cons: It will take you ages (in real time) to get your first 60
---
Pros: You'll get better /played on both the characters.
---
I've been thinking of getting 2 character to max reasonably early, if I decide to do this, my strategy will be:
---
Level one character to somewhere in the 20s range as this is where rested xp starts to actually have an impact, then park him while i level the other one to that point.
---
From then on I'll play 1 character as my main and level that most the time while the other is sitting parked only getting logged a couple times a week to burn rested, at least untill I'm "done" with my first character.
---
I think this will be the most optimal way of doing it, but if anyone else has any input, I'd love to hear it.
---
Without streamers classic wouldn't have happened? You mean like the 2 that were really *really* pushing for it? Why are you making a post about others being salty when you're just as salty.
---
No concern at all, once game is released there will no doubt be lots of guilds ingame still needing players of every kind :)
---
I‚Äôm sure elvui will make an addon for the game. One from legion might work already.
---
this makes me smile and laugh. great work :happycryface:
---
Wow, thanks for that guys!

Just remember that Paladins are a one-button spec. You'll be spamming Flash Heal for hours.
---
Oh, and maybe Cleanse. Nevermind. It's a two-button spec :D
---
That's why I'm rolling Holy again.
---
Lol no, it's been at least 8 years since then and back then was the peak era when youtubers uploaded multiple videos daily.
---
I believe so. If you are the top-dog for the week, then that should be 13K RP for you.
---
They also don‚Äôt give beta access to toxic rats with a history of being toxic in-game. 
---
Seeing how so many people in this sub are toxic and salty. Its pretty obvious why they didn‚Äôt get it

You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about, it‚Äôs a cosmetic item which you spawn with, you shouldn‚Äôt even be commenting when you had to post on this subreddit asking if there was going to be group finder in classic. You obviously have not played vanilla and you obviously love quin69 which isn‚Äôt a problem but his knowledge is also lacking in vanilla.
---
Might aswell create placeholders on all available realms and then look where the streamers decide to go/your old friends/guild decides to go.
---
I'm watching Asmon now, and he's basically chain pulling with Esfand, but he's sitting at 300 hp and just pulling 2-3 mobs constantly without a worry in the world. I get that Esfand is there to heal him if necessary, but he's tanking multiple mobs at 300 hp at the same level and he's not even dropping.
---
I *feel* as if there's a discrepancy. However, I genuinely don't know for certain. I just feel like a Warrior sitting at 20% hp shouldn't be constantly pulling 2-3 mobs his level. Not as far as I can remember.
---
Okay, here's my thoughts and I'd like to hear if others agree. From first glance and past experiences playing from the day the game launched until WotlK, and then on private servers it definitely seems to be a little off, at least with elite mobs. Here's the thing though.
---
I would have to bet that a reason for many players wanting to come back is because the game was seen and remembered as more difficult and more rewarding. I would think that if ANYTHING at all, if they didnt have the real numbers correct then they would want to make things HARDER rather than easier. I know we all want a true classic wow, but If the numbers had to be lower or higher because they dont know for sure. I sure as hell wouldn't mind the game being harder in general. Hell, I wouldn't mind if they had the original game 100% correct as was before and then ramp it up 5% or so.. for that memorable challenging yet rewarding aspect we remember and love.. 
---
Make it harder, doubt many would mind that.. I personally just dont want easy face roll content that seems easy.. MAKE IT HARDER, and in turn you'll make me harder :) ... 
---
I will still be glad to play once the game is released. Still plan on taking time off from work and no lifing for a bit. But if its noticeably easier or even seems noticeably easier then content will be cleared more quickly and burn people out more quickly...
---
Just some thoughts. Curious if anyone agrees with me.. thank you.
---
I mean "sort of", since it's "free if you have a retail wow subscription"
---
Most people's complaint with this is, the beta is being used as an advertisement tool. How are people who have not played classic, going to know if the new release is accurate? You have streamers reporting things like not being able to change gear in combat, bosses hitting hard, gear not having stats, etc as bugs.
---
I cannot comprehend the stupidity of "world first" on a beta.. like just look for bugs and test stuff. 
---
Not say "world first deadmines" if we don't die you all need to sub with twitch prime. 
---
Just leeching views and $$
---
Well it was worth a shot
---
I didn't experience this back in the day and definitely want to.
---
There is a lot of debate about how the system worked from memory of looking at it
---
But yes that's how it's supposed to work. As to how they would assign everyone else honor I'm not sure
---
As a general rule go for the throat, you have all the power if you farm more honor. If you feel like you can farm more than them fuck em all just gogogogogogogo
---
Brackets are set by he who has proven he's autistic enough to farm honor endlessly
---
I still have bad memories of seeing this bastard wiping my entire raid out. Hogger is going down.
---
&gt; I mean if you took on two regular mobs in the open world you'd probably die unless you were tanky.
---
Pulling two mobs as a vanilla rogue = super bad time, as best as I can possibly remember it. 
---
&gt;pulling groups of 5-6 enemies and sometimes with a boss!
---
Yeah I can't tell if everyone was just super cautious way back then, but as a rogue I remember needing to sap for literally pull
---
im not salty, i got an invite
---
no, the damage is accurate.
---
https://youtu.be/rQI3mMqUgGw?t=224
---
this is Asmongold's video of the elites hitting him for about 30 damage per swing. that doesn't mean much, until we get to a real video.
---
https://youtu.be/W1FuMa3OyiM?t=75
---
this is a random Warrior in SFK. he's getting hit for less then Asmongold is due to Stoneskin Totem, which, [reduces damage taken by 11](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=8155/stoneskin-totem) according to the classic database, which would account for the difference in damage as well as Mark of the Wild.
---
https://youtu.be/rQI3mMqUgGw?t=1960
---
this is Asmongold's video for Fenrus. he's getting hit from anywhere between 60-80 which seems about right.
---
https://youtu.be/W1FuMa3OyiM?t=205
---
here's the same Warrior getting hit for about 60 damage, again, with MoTW/Stoneskin.
---
so, it seems like the damage is pretty much correct. let's face it: the dungeons weren't that hard. we were just fucking terrible.

---
Imagine the effect on the economy if a streamer threw away the gold they received and people thought it was funny so they kept giving the streamers gold to throw away on purpose.
---
iirc amd new cpus coming in the next couple of months. prob being announced at computex.
---
maybe better than intel or if not could still affect prices.
---
gpu wise it usually doesnt pay off to get the best of the best imo and the whole RTX thing been a fail so far content wise. 6+ months later and only like 2 games use it
---
&gt; OP calling people ‚Äúkids‚Äù
---
&gt; watching streamers play
---
Something doesn‚Äôt add up
---
As someone who was really hyped for anthem and was there for launch and early access... I can honestly say this community pales by comparison in terms of toxicity. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that bad, really enjoying the celebratory posts, and bug data analysis to help blizzard release a great product.
---
I wasn't referring to an invite I was referring to being a salty twat in general.
---
Asmond said "if we dont die you all need to sub with twitch prime"
---
Finally some fucking sense
---
This community is small, atrophied, and toxic as fuck. People are hostile and go for the throat and bitch about everything.
---
The good news is that as more players get access to the game, more people will funnel in and displace their toxic asses. You'll see more and more people slap down the dickheads as time goes by.
---
The funny thing is, despite the hatred of content creators, I doubt we'd be getting Classic if they didn't shine a spotlight on Nostalrius, and kept the fury stoked after it was shut down.
---
To be fair, you said people and there is only 1 person in your example who is heavily downvoted.
---
I could just as easily say "people in freefolk are loving season 8 of game of thrones" and point to someone hugely downvoted who likes it.
---
Thrall doesn't deserve such an insult.
---
If you build it yourself you will get a lot more for your money. Zen 2 should be released soon so it may be worth waiting to see how they benchmark before spending all that cash.
---
and guess what, i never played vanilla, i was 8 years old when it came out
---
WHo cares, drama is good
---
And he said if they wipe he‚Äôll donate subs. That‚Äôs not begging at all.
---
Psst just dont Talk about it, blizz will not be warse of it, they are never aware of anything
---
The community is going to kill it. People are already complaining that level 6 tigers are doing 5 damage instead of 6. Bitching about silly stuff like stop at next flight thing.
---
Overwhelming bitching and crying brought us classic wow but it can kill it jist as easily.
---
oh so watching someone stream a game you are excited for = being a kid now.
---
Extremely helpful. Thanks!
---
The person watching Sodapoppin just called others ‚Äúkids‚Äù
---
Topkek
---
Ah that's better. I didn't see that post.
---
World first! 900 IQ
---
&gt; The idea that people can be wrong without necessarily lying is not a novel concept and there‚Äôs not a ton of evidence to support the idea
---
Ok so first of all I don't know who he is. Since his name is on youtube contains Method and from the vibe I got from this thread and so on, I assume he's an exceptional player. Maybe I'm wrong and he's just a mediocre player and therefor my exceptions on his views are straight wrong.
---
The first thing that seemed wrong to me was [about 1:32](https://youtu.be/-k5K4a-teWo?t=92). He said for accidentally pulling two mobs you'd better be full hp and need to use potions. Pulling three ment gg. That's something I could understand if he was mediocre. Or maybe if he was playing a rogue and not yet having Vanish etc and so on. But as a mage? You start with a soft cc and get your second at level 4, your first hard cc at 8. Even if you can't fight two or even three mobs, that doesn't mean you have to die as a mage. You just run away. Mobs are either already slowed or will be slowed from frost armor. If you are an exceptional player, there are very few times you will as a mage die just from mobs. This would include respawn or something like that, but not just accidentally pulling 3 mobs.
---
That's just something that doesn't compute for me. Maybe he want's to build some hype or I don't know why. But this does not make sense for me.
---
Back to the point I called bullshit in the first place. Again if he's an exceptional player, I simply assume there's no way he actually feels his spells hitting harder every time he got an item with intelligence on it. Maybe he had some high hits after one item and that felt like hitting harder, but he already ha a couple of green items.
---
So maybe he simply wanted to say every item made his character feel more powerful? He had to reg less or could take a hit more or something like that? In that case he most likely noticed that right the moment he said that. He noticed that what he told was just bullshit and thought to himself "fuck, that was wrong". A fuck up can happen right? But there's still something that bugs me about that. Right after he said that, at 3:44 exactly ([here's the link a couple of seconds earlier](https://youtu.be/-k5K4a-teWo?t=210)) he cut the video. He cut the video but did not take the point out, where he said, something that he has to know is wrong, if he's an exceptional player.
---
To me this is a very low chance that fucked up and did not notice and that's why I stand by my point that I call bullshit on that.
---
There are some other minor things that felt off for me, but I guess I already went enough into detail, why I don't believe him. So why does he knowingly say something that's not true? I don't know. Maybe it's his way to try to get others involved with WoW Classic. But there's alot of money involved in WoW Classic right now and it's not a rare occurrence that people lie when it comes to money. So yeah, I tend to believe that's the reason he's lying.
---
PS: You don't wanna tell me my comments were off topic and that's why I got downvoted and the responses were on topic, do you? People on reddit will downvote if they disagree, no matter if downvotes are intended for that or not.
---
Cuz this sub is a toxic circlejerk.
---
Next level Loot boxes.
---
‚ÄúPay us $15/month and maybe you will be invited to play our game.‚Äú
---
How much damage are these mobs supposed to do?
---
Did you even read the OP? He linked a video from vanilla.
---
Atiesh :)
---
lol I didn¬¥t think about this but you are absolutely right. This is stupid af.
---
It's not more toxic than any other /r at is and was years and years ago. It's just people having no backbone anymore and being more and more offended about every and anything. Every generation a bit more and trying to bend over backwards trying to be PC. Fuck it. I mean...,and I'm totally off topic here, but there's how many genders these days? 50? 60? ...Enough said.
---
I like the idea, but think its only applicable in certain situations. If you take too long whatsoever in running back and forth, its likely a dps loss no matter what you do. If you proc Quick Shots as you run in, you waste some auto time and probably break even for your troubles. It's definitely something to consider, but I wouldn't change my spec at all to get Raptor crit chance for instance.
---
Perplexity has the most mechanically impressive videos. 
---
Each class has a handful of extremely talented players. You might be interested in the Classic PvP Discord, should be easy to find a link somewhere.
---
They will probably have a raidfull of people following them so... Maybe a dedicated group of mages popping cds to instant kill them and then run away could be fun.
---
Streamers made classic a reality ??? go read some facts please
---
I can see why certain levels feel bogged down. Not only is the score gained from quests changed but some areas have more spread out quests *cough* tanaris *cough* making them feel slow
---
Based on some private servers, the keyring is visible on the HUD from the beginning, but this might just be private servers not properly initializing player data when they're created.  [https://imgur.com/a/4wWgGhg](https://imgur.com/a/4wWgGhg)
---
TECHNICALLY isn't wrong, He is right. I definitely don't see stats on that item lol. BTW hes trolling JUST IN CASE YOU DONT KNOW because you don't start off with any gear with stats.
---
"What's your first WoW expansion?"
---
But vanilla wasn't an expansion ;)
---
This clip neither proves nor disproves that...
---
Yeah, as a healer you would need to drink regularly there because of the incoming damage requiring you to heal even suring careful pulls.
---
okay, so no denying that you kids who kept saying the dmg numbers aren't off are wrong?
---
IIRC the greater the difference between weapon skill and defense skill increased damage and crit change. Hence Sons of Agural were terrifying when they were 5-10 levels higher becuase their weapon skill was maxxed for their level and unless you were a melee character, your defense skill was most likely not maxxed. Meaning they hit like a truck.
---
Asmongold is playing a warrior, and has been tanking dungeons. Remember no dual spec, no respec. So he's a tank, with a maxed or near maxed defense skill, at equal level to them. That actually sounds about right all those things considered.
---
This is him talking about the mobs hitting for low numbers... can you please show the actual clip that he's referring to?
---
Badge of Justice gear, S1/S2 gear you could get from BGs, arena weapons you could get from losing 10 games a week...
---
I think I took about 5-6 weeks my first time around on my first character, though I did get distracted a lot going off to raid xr and orgrimmar.
---
Nah. This sub just hates fake experts. If you look at the comments in other threads, Tips gets hate not because he‚Äôs bad, but because he‚Äôs bad when he claimed to be an expert.
---
You don‚Äôt see that with Crendor because he admits he‚Äôs clueless and he‚Äôs just blundering around having fun.
---
Eh, play what you enjoy and don't let others opinions change that.
---
I'll be having a Tauren Druid.
---
\[X\] Doubt
---
:/ is it that big a deal? Play what you want
---
We had our warriors run in circles spamming shouts to keep aoe threat on the orcs while the rest of the dps was either cc'ing or killing any mob that got loose.
---
ok these clips are painfully entertaining
---
CC was nice, but actually wasn't super important in dungeons until TBC, specifically TBC heroics.
---
I could be mis-remembering also, it has been over 10 years =P
---
Mostly because it's one of the very rare vanilla videos with good enough quality so you can read the numbers lol
---
Lack of sleep is linked to early onset of alzheimers.
---
Because people are elitist and butthurt they didnt get into the beta
---
no, it's accurate.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq5rxj/can_someone_explain_this_discrepancy_in_mob/eo29ftv/
---
But when put into the equation it becomes ‚Äú79 is half of 99‚Äù which is less catchy
---
&gt; where are the people who kept saying dmg numbers aren't off? You kids really are delusional :)

dude it has to be retail tards who never touched WoW in the old days.
---
it's not that bad just something you need to get used to when playing, most people that are going to play hunters will need to get used to dead zone being a thing again anyway, just get used to using disengage for its intended purpose and you're all good
---
Wow classic? Naw, wow bloodplague
---
Don't think thrall is a white supremacist but ok
---
Who knew Kylie got into the beta, gonna write a song bout it?
---
If his thing is wasting dev time, then he‚Äôs doing a great job
---
Got it, yes I‚Äôm in no rush so this is exactly the type of info I was looking for.
---
Re self-build I‚Äôd need to find a shop to do it, just not confident in my ability. No clue how much assembly would be if I brought the parts, I‚Äôll have to take a look.
---
this is beautiful
---
That has to be the worst song I have ever heard in a replay video ever.. and not even by a small margin. 
---
Sounds like something u would hear on Halloween night as u walk up to the house on the block that over did it every year and had fog machines and lights and music playing..
---
yeah i agree with that, my problem is why do people need to be so mad? It's dividing the community
---
So many posts make me cringe now &gt;.&gt; thanks lol
---
We used a kiting strat as well.
---
MT on the orb
---
OTs running in circles with piercing howl, picking up mobs as they pass by, all melee orcs and dragonkin.
---
Druids and Razorgore sleeping any loose dragonkin.
---
Hunters, casters, and rest of melee on caster orcs as they spawn. Hunters would also pull and kite any orcs aggroed by healers until a kite tank picked them up.
---
We never went with a dps Zerg strat although it probably would have been viable.
---
Says the guy that thought any class was 10% of a raid's DPS.
---
I think the salt levels are just a bit high at the moment.
---
If anything that video proves that they aren't correct. I went and looked at the vod of asmon getting hit by the exact same mobs as that paladin during his SFK &amp; BFD runs. Asmon is getting hit for pretty much the same values, despite having both a shield AND the 10% reduction from defensive stance. Meanwhile, that paladin only has devo aura and no shield. Devo aura gives roughly 170-200 armour less than a level 20+ shield does, so the numbers would not be the same if they were accurate.
---
While this one case shows that damage may actually be overtuned for those two specific sets of mobs, that in turn opens up the possibility for undertuned mobs; specifically in areas later in to SFK &amp; BFD where objectively harder 23-25 elites were hitting for similar amounts as the level 18's.
---
Politics aside, I find that its a very good drawing. And it is quite humorous, if I can say so.
---
Asmon wasnt keeping demo shout up when I watched. Pretty low tier play from him through the entire dungeon tbh.
---
He's trolling, jesus.
---
Says the shitty person who could have taken x amount of seconds to hit up google lol
---
Or you know, take your time and enjoy the game.
---
Toys before we actually had a label for toys.
---
not how i remember it. could be Mandella for one of us.
---
No actually, several ElitistJerks post proved that you have to have an unobtainable amount of agility to outscale the typical MM spec.
---
I also have no idea what I'm suposee to see.
---
Thank you for the post. I got my brother to resub then read the original post. Now I feel better lol
---
This is basically my mindset. People are frothing to get into beta to play when you can just go to a private server and pretend. Plus side is I‚Äôve noticed a LOT of people coming to private serves with the release date news. Barrens has been absolutely PACKED
---
I‚Äôll head on over there!
---
Most raids just kill everything as it spawns now in 2 or 4 groups of people. No more shaman nascar circuit
---
ya watching people pulling multiple elites in dungeons np is a whole lotta bs lol.
---
This sums it up.
---
Hook a broatha up, what's the new wall jump?
---
I mentioned this in a separate post earlier and agree that ramping up the difficulty 5% + wouldn't be a bad thing at all. Harder difficulty is more rewarding in the end. Plus itll take longer to clear the game which means people will spend a longer time playing just to complete content.
---
Waiting for the future to go to the past
---
In current wow you can light all 4 torches and be fine if your tank and healer are coherent and not mentally disabled. 
---
It looks like asmond forgot what he was doing and it is classic so he got rinsed
---
This is really cool, I struggle with finding a path after level ~22 ish so this has given me lots of ideas
---
Female troll is hawt
---
Red, yellow, it all dies the same.
---
Except in classic it was just a threat reduction till wrath
---
eewww
---
Some anecdotal evidence:
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/DeafShakingTarsierSeemsGood
---
Joana himself says that he has not noticed any differences in mob damage compared to back in the day
---
Bein unfamiliar is useful too since you might do things people who know better just avoid for example
---
I'm here to view the shit show that classic wow is going to be.
---
Hi! Sick work and thank you so much for this literal compendium. I just have some comments and suggested edits if you're open to it, mainly for Warlock gear as that tends to be my area of expertise. Feel free to take into account or ignore - your sheets, your rules \^\_\^ 
---
Also, apologies for not shortening links. I figured it was more trustworthy to leave links in their full form, so you know where you're going. Also, apologies if some of this stuff has already been mentioned. Also, when I say "you" in the following recommendations, I'm saying it as a hypothetical "you" rather than talking to you directly.
---
For Casters on Phases 1 &amp; 2, Pre-Raid: Blizzard's already said they're doing progressive item releases, rather than progressive stats on items. This means that Ban'thok Sash, which was and is available on release, will be much better than Clutch of Andros for pre-raid casters. (Link to Wowhead: [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11662/banthok-sash](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11662/banthok-sash))
---
For Casters and Healers on Phases 1-2/3, Pre-Raid and Raid: Atal'ai Gloves ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10787/atalai-gloves](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10787/atalai-gloves)) from ST troll mini-bosses are similar to Archivist's Cape in that they have a random bonus based on name (of the owl, of shadow wrath, etc.), but they already come with +9 spell damage/healing. If memory and Wowhead comments aren't failing me, the damage bonuses are usually 26-27 (total of 35-36 spell damage), and the healing bonuses are usually 44-46 +healing (total of 53-55 +healing). This makes it better than Felcloth Gloves for warlocks, and better than most gloves listed as Pre-Raid BiS for most healing/casting specs/classes.
---
For Warlocks on Phases 2-3, Raid Chest slot: For Robe of Volatile Power to be better than Robe of the Void, 1% crit has to be worth, in terms of dps output, at least 12 spell damage. This isn't necessarily true in earlier Phases with low spell damage, low hit, Rank 9 Shadowbolt, and high crit (explained below) due to lacking the consumables, gear, etc., that get released in later phases. It's different for every warlock depending on their race, spec, gear, etc., but you'd probably be pretty safe saying Robe of the Void is better than Robe of Volatile Power for Warlocks (especially given the fact that Robe of Volatile is such a huge upgrade for Paladin healers). Also if you're weighing crit that heavily for warlocks, Mana Igniting Cord would be way better than Sash of Whispered Secrets for warlocks (I'll argue that it actually is below), and Eye of the Beast would theoretically be better than Royal Seal of Eldre'Thelas for Phase 2 Pre-Raid (which it arguably could be depending on the warlock). Also, if your guild is doing world buffs (most guilds will), The amount of spell crit that world buffs give mean that Warlocks won't exactly be crit-starved, even from the beginning. Furthermore, on earlier content you don't want to crit too much, especially if you're horde, since you might already be having to throttle your dps so that Warriors can keep up on threat.
---
For Warlocks on Phases 2-3, Raid Pants slot: Nemesis Leggings ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16930/nemesis-leggings](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16930/nemesis-leggings)) from Ragnaros will be bis until Phase 4, unless you're in a guild that's downing Kazzak (as you've already added parenthetically). Nemesis Leggings has 39 spell damage over Skyshroud's 34 spell damage and 16 int over Skyshroud's 8.
---
For Warlocks on Phase 2 Raid Wrist slot: Felheart Bracers ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16804/felheart-bracers](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16804/felheart-bracers)) have 1 spell damage and 1 int on Sublime Wristguards. Minor upgrade, but still worth mentioning.
---
For Warlocks on Phase 2 Raid Cloak slot: Sapphiron Drape has 14 spell damage and 17 int, whereas Archivist Cape of Shadow Wrath usually has 20-21 (if I remember correctly!). This really depends on how much you weigh crit (crit, spell damage, and hit are weighed relative to each other in terms of their effect on raw dps, so it's really case-by-case depending on your gear, stats, spec, and buffs), since 60.6 int = 1% crit for locks (Link: [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Attributes](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Attributes)). But even if you're crit-starved (which you won't be), 6-7 shadow damage will pretty much always be better than 17 int for locks (even with buffs).
---
For Warlocks on Phase 2 Raid Belt slot: Once again, it's dependent on multiple variables lock-to-lock, but Mana Igniting Cord is gonna be better for most warlocks than Sash of Whispered Secrets due to the 1% crit and 16 int. That being said, it makes sense, from a raid leader perspective, to prio other casters on Mana Igniting since Nemesis Belt ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16933/nemesis-belt](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16933/nemesis-belt)) has almost the same stats (1% crit and 8 int) as Mana Igniting and drops right around the corner in Phase 3.
---
For Warlocks on Phase 3 Raid: On top of the above, not going for the 3/8 T2 set bonus (+23 spell damage) on Phase 3 seems like a big ol' missed opportunity, given that Nemesis Leggings are already bis for Phase 3 (barring Fel-Infused Leggings), Nemesis Belt is only 8 int worse than Mana Igniting Cord, and Nemesis Boots ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16927/nemesis-boots](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16927/nemesis-boots)) are only 4 spell damage worse than Maleki's Footwraps or 7 worse than a random green BoE world drop "of Shadow Wrath" (which go up to +30 at max lvl, I believe). Overall, with this gear over what's currently listed for Phase 3 Raid gear for locks on your sheets, the hypothetical Phase 3 bis lock would have 16 more spell damage and 1% more crit, along with a slight increase in int.
---
Warlock Shadow Resistance (SR) set: Due to buffs, you only need 220 Shadow Resistance unbuffed to reach the Hard Cap of 315 when buffed (boss level of 63 \* 5 = 315), due to Gift of the Wild, Demon Armor, and Prayer of Shadow Protection. On top of these buffs, Gift of Arthas ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9088/gift-of-arthas](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9088/gift-of-arthas)) adds in an extra 10 SR, so if you use cons to tank Twin Emps (which you should), you only really need 210 Shadow Resistance from gear and enchants. The SR set you have listed on the spreadsheet gives a total of 261-272 SR unbuffed, which leaves an excess of 51-62 Shadow Resistance that has no use. The goal of this set is usually to reach exactly the 315 SR buffed so that you absorb/resist on average 3 shadow damage for every 1 Health you lose, while also stacking as much stamina as possible so that when you do get hit by the rare massive shadowbolt, you can last long enough for heals to top you off or to pop a healthstone/GSPP. Most people suggest Felheart Shoulder Pads ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16807/felheart-shoulder-pads](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16807/felheart-shoulder-pads)) over random greens since it gives 25 stamina along with 7 SR (only lose 13 SR for 15 stam. I would suggest Nemesis Bracers ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16934/nemesis-bracers](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16934/nemesis-bracers)) over Funeral cuffs since you only lose 10 SR but gain 21 stam. Multicolored Bands can be good since they give 10 SR and 10 Stam at 1:1. I really like emp tanking with Dragon's Blood Cape ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17107/dragons-blood-cape](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17107/dragons-blood-cape)) since no one ever wants it, you only lose 10 SR, and you gain 22 Stamina. With Nemesis Belt ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16933/nemesis-belt](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16933/nemesis-belt)) over Runed Stygian Belt, you gain 18 stam while only losing 10 SR.

I'll keep working my way through, and make this a thread where I comment further stuff. Apologies for the density!
---
Level 60 pvp/pve is the only reason I will play, that's why I will rush 60, also I find leveling tedious.
---
MFW /r/classicwow is worse than /r/wowservers
---
Don't know about quest helper specifically, however quest helper addons plural will be in the game come Classic WoW as well as leveling guides.   
---
I'm debating if i want to use any of them at all and just go clueless in again because I'm so rusty :D
---
already getting my bingo ready in this post alone! haha
---
Nope full PvP through and through. Rogues were an easy counter to Hunter. Hell I remember watching my brother play who mained a Rogue all the way up to General and he would always go around picking off Hunters and anyone else ranged that was away from a group.  Dodging flare as a rogue is fairly easy after you've played a bit. After you sprint/vanish you change the direction you were moving to pretty easily avoid flares. At they point you can easily get back to the hunter since their flare is now on CD and you currently have sprint up (lasts 8seconds) makes it easy to close the gap before they can really get away. All you need to do as a Rogue after that is stick to them. Keep crippling on so they can't get away and keep CCd as much as possible. There's a reason Rogues were called the PvP class. They pretty much had tools to deal with every class.
---
 I remember back in the day reading something from one of the top PvPers was the only thing that can easily beat a rogue is himself because a good rogue can keep any class in a unfavorable position in almost any 1v1 scenario.
---
It¬¥s just the private server crowd who is in panic right now because they played scuffedmode for years and it¬¥s damaging their self esteem. So Blizzard must be wrong. Turns out retail players will not be the only one to get a shock from this game.
---
70% of responders answered vanilla.
---
[x] Doubt
---
it is accurate. i find it funny that there's people that "apparently" remember the exact mob damage values from 15 years ago perfectly and it's "way too low", despite people posting video evidence that it's accurate.
---
I don't hate streamers per se, I just don't want the realm I play on to be unplayable from the crowd of people following them around.
---
Hogger is gud boi and he dindu nuffin.
---
Same with Stocks. In Stocks if you pulled 1 (and god forbid 2) extra mobs, you were dead or using pots + kiting. Stocks was literally the dungeon where alliance rogues learned the importance of using sap every pull.
---
as someone that played hardcore up until i got a steady job in 2010 and even then have continued to play on and off with my partner playing and only having taken extended breaks when our kids were born and neither of us having a beta or being salty, we can wait a few months for actual release if we have to as beta will be wiped anyway.
---
the complaints i have are not always against the streamers or those that got it beta at all its the one that are shouting bug because they saw something on a stream that wasn't how they remember it, of in some cases the people crying bug never played in vanilla and think it doesn't work how they think it should, looking at the guy that reported starting gear having no stats as a bug here.
---
and as for "we would have classic if it wasn't for streamers" that's bull shit, we would have classic if it wasn't for a private server that showed that people wanted it, nothing to do with streamers.
---
most of us that played back then and haven't got in yet are not salty we can wait, hell we have waited this long whats another 2-3 months?
---
cool more streamer bullshit
---
I'm 90% sure that Asmongold is trolling when he tanks at this point. He might actually be semidecent.
---
Wait, do you think a guild has anything to do with leveling?    I‚Äôve leveled to 60 many times. Both during vanilla and in private servers  60 in 7 real days is very very very doable. And like I said it may take me a couple days over since my most recent experience is on private servers and I expect classic to be slightly different. And of course just the sheer amount of players that will be playing.   But anyways none of that has to do with my question.
---
if you think about it like this. Asmogold has played non stop for what, 13 years or something, he has played warrior for that entire time basicly. The guys he played with are most likely just the same. If a low level dungeon was to hard for them now it would have been impossible back in the day. Ofcourse it will be easy. Him saying the game is a joke etc etc is just him not ever shutting up as usual, take it with some spoons full of salt.
---
there is not only one person in that chain
---
Man, I wish I could quit caffeine as easily as this dude implies.
---
Lol, calling Joana, the legendary Vanilla speedrunner and leveling guide creator ‚Äústreamer bullshit.‚Äù
---
These retards never cared about vanilla in the first place and now they are just jumping on the hype train to get easy money.
---
Asmongoloid literally begs for prime subs on his stream, cringe as fuck.
---
Better solution: Investigate to find the cause of the issue and fix it.
---
He finally answered your question after you spammed his chat for 30mins with the same question that everyone in the chat already answered for you. Pathetic.
---
good for you go report actual bugs and make sure there are less issues when it goes live, or do what other people with your mentality do and use it to "practice" leveling
---
Using runescape as an example is not a good idea the divide between rs3 and osrs is almost as bad as it is here lol
---
yeah leveling was great, wanding mobs down 1 by 1 all the way to shadow form.
---
Rrrrriiighhhhhhttttt
---
can we have some evidence or are you just gonna take what some streamer said as gospel?
---
Agreed, streamers did not make this happen. I feel like most the streamers jumped on the bandwagon when the ball had already been rolling for a while. The true heroes are all the people who played private servers and supported the movement from the get go. Yes, it is helpful with streamer support, but when it comes to true passion for classic that pushed this movement, that has come from the private server communities.
---
But its different. Nobody watches an NBA game and thinks Lebron James is their friend. Streamers _talk_ to the audience and its proven that people end up feeling like the streamer is their friend. As if they‚Äôre conversing with _you_ directly. 
---
Unlike say, watching competitive esports streaming, that‚Äôs more normal. Or watching a stream of &lt;Method&gt; killing a boss so you can learn the fight, again thats more normal. 
---
The craze of watching a streamer who is just bad at things and just _talks_ is what people have a hard time wrapping their minds around. Especially older people, which is Classics demographic since at minimum people were 10-12 yrs old in Vanilla, most being 16-20. That puts people in their late 20‚Äôs through their 30‚Äôs now! We didnt grow up with streamers being popular, so some shake their fist at it while saying ‚Äúyou kids!!!‚Äù.
---
hunter kited while warrior piercing howl'd everything
---
Yeah just because they have a reference to go back on doesnt mean certain calculations couldn't be off.
---
Please delete your account lol
---
Yeah basically if you're bad you can vanish and not die, but if you have no plans on dying you're just a weaker warrior who can run away.
---
Sure, but companies tend to use the technical definitions for these things. I think this may be why WoW Legion never got a season projected for it, while it too launched in late August--but unlike Classic, wasn't announced massively ahead of its release.
---
Yeah I'm trying really hard not to trust my 15 year-old intuition on this one but they were fucking *steamrolling* dungeons and it felt totally off until I saw this thread.
---
Agreed, while there was good support from streamers namely Asmongold, Nixxiom, and MadSeasonShow, streamers weren't the *only* reason Classic WoW is happening.
---
&gt; He finally answered your question after you spammed his chat for 30mins
---
Can you show me where I asked the question? I clipped this because I was lurking and saw him answer it definitely.
---
1 torch = 1 wave of mobs. Light moar torches get moar waves.
---
I loved being a priest healing raids and dungeons and battlegrounds. It‚Äôs a bit of a backseat role, but man you can make an impact if you‚Äôre good at it. Bagel‚Äôs response covered it pretty good I suppose.
---
Gatekeeping fanboys just salty the "wrong sort of people" got an invite and they didn't. Meanwhile they post that Blizzard's actual 1.12 database is wrong and their pserver's guesswork that spans many patches and not just 1.12 is more correct. 
---
Just lol
---
I think add ons like that should be stopped if possible especially in Classics case. It's going to make somewhat dated content even easier to complete when you've got an add on that tells you when the next move is coming on and throws up big warning messages on your screen when you're required to do something (like moving out of group when you're the bomb). 
---
I have no problem with add ons for people who want to re adjust their UI etc but having something that directly helps you perform better in a PVE scenario just isn't healthy for the game and takes away from the essence of what makes classic great. I understand that it existed back then but it doesn't mean that we should repeat it and allow it to continue this time around, I know you'll probably say just to not use it of you don't like it but we are always going to choose the path of least resistance when available (IE flying and quest helper) even when it's detrimental to the overall health of the game and your experience.
---
We like this streamer though so it's different
---
Yep, https://eu.battle.net/support/de/article/15312 one character every month but is has to have been lvl 50 and above
---
Mediocre troll as best
---
That's not a bad idea, obviously there are incoming comments of people against it but it would indeed make it so much easier and simpler to do so. It'll make most "cool" names like red, green and blue scarcer but it would also add to them being even more special.
---
They might have the database numbers correct, but the server code for calculation damage and reduction incorrect.
---
&gt; Says the guy that thought any class was 10% of a raid's DPS. But you've made my point.
---
3 tanks, 6 healers, 11 dps, if you're not doing 10% of raid dps is only slightly above average....
---
&gt; You agree with this, you just think the time required before it's "allowable" is much longer than I do.
---
At the point where doing it ceases to be selfish, his entire reason for doing it ceases to exist in the first place.
---
I have 1300 days played, a majority of that leveling characters over and over. (Mostly back in the day, to have every spec without switching talents...)
---
I got this guy beat.
---
(Seriously Though, I‚Äôm glad he got in. Not so much because of the leveling part, but because he knows HOW to look for bugs)
---
Even with as much experience as I have in the game, I so rarely hit a bug that I‚Äôm actually ‚Äúaware‚Äù that it‚Äôs a bug.
---
Because its correct. That doesnt mean I have to engage in pointless debates.
---
&gt; Will post results in a day or two! 
---
Got a link?  Been looking forward to seeing these results.
---
?? how is it bullshit
---
Didn't joanna just say he isn't seeing a difference in mob damage?
---
Vanilla was more about guild management than individual performence. Yes great players make stuff a shitload easier, but the grinding / preparing, leading 39 others was the real challange. Kungen trashtalked retail WoW to much to much. Always saying vanilla was the real deal. We will find out soon.
---
How would they do that if they've literally plugged in the 1.12.1 DB into their Universal Adapter which allows the modern client to process 1.12.1 data? There would be no WOTLK values to use, only Vanilla.
---
Which haircut? Haha
---
How can people just knock Vanilla that's stupid mentality right there. I've never played but I'm sure as heck excited for it!
---
Also most randoms playing back then didn't really care about their gear or understand how anything worked. People were generally far weaker than a lot of the streamers that are trying to be at least slightly optimized about their approach.
---
I'm getting trucked at level 10 by level 12 mobs because my gear is trash. Gear makes a really big difference in classic.
---
You sure love generalizing and making assumptions, don't you, lil timmy?
---
You got in today? Damn I need to check, didn't think they'd do weekends. I've played since then and am also 23 now.
---
these vibes, only 3 months.... ONLY 3 MONTHS! I can do this, i can wait, i can do this, i can wait........ has it been 3 months yet?
---
The game abandoned us long ago to cater to you folks who wanted things easy
---
Though it‚Äôs much more of a slog to do so. Most wont be inclined to put themselves through that
---
You haz candle?
---
Did they though? (Thor face)
---
&gt; So why when he runs BFD did he pul llike 6-7 elite mobs and not break a sweat and think nothing was up lol.
---
Did he ever say he knows everything about classic? My understanding is he constantly says that he sucks. He literally said he doesn't remember much.
---
Tbh that whole comment was really cringe.
---
I'm pretty sure he's trolling to drive up viewer engagement at this point. I watched his chat for long enough to figure out that the reason he doesn't sunder armor when tanking is that it makes the viewers lose their shit spamming. I didn't want to deal with that, so I left.
---
We have what we consider to be a very fast alliance guide, it's based on my speedrunning route for Alliance. It's a paid guide, not free though [https://www.patreon.com/theraceto60](https://www.patreon.com/theraceto60)
---
God I love the transcendence armor look. I still have my troll priest decked out in it with Benediction. I‚Äôm tempted to roll a priest again just so I can wear my favorite tier of gear. *sheds tear for tier gear*
---
Sure but now you know
---
Yeah you can 2 man strat too but the traditional way to do is 5? Ubrs is traditionally done as 10
---
Did they use numbers from alpha/beta builds? They were all very different.
---
Nice karma farm attempt...
---
Are you going to add routes for 2 man party? I think quite a lot of people are going to play with friend and such close XP margins might screw them over.
---
well showing how much i played hunter in classic, I forgot it didn't kick you back then, well if nothing else he can pray the pet takes threat so he can back peddle out of melee
---
oh yeah i forgot the part of classic wow where once you hit level 60 you can no longer do WSG
---
If you're very good at it, it might literally land you a job at Blizzard.
---
I've been asked to "apply" to a few guilds, one that even touts sponsorships and registered an LLC in Delaware.
---
I told them no thanks.
---
The first hardcore raiding guild is going to be made up of the first 40 level 60's that can stand to play together. The core group (usually leadership) will likely know each other from before WoW Classic, but other than that, securing a slot is going to be based on getting to the finish line first.
---
This is why the race to 60 is so important. There's not much, if anything, a guild can provide to get you to 60 faster. Guilds are going to have far less impact in Classic than what people remember in Vanilla. Leadership styles are going to have to change.
---
??? The dude (if I'm not mistaken) holds the record for fastest 1-60 in retail vanilla, I'd trust him more than most other streamers.
---
LOL
---
Ui addons, sure.  Model edits are against the tos. And blizz can detect them now. They did a ban wave for it recently on bfa, though I think they backpedaled on it since people banned weren't using it to exploit anything.
---
This is how all posts about this should be structured.
---
It's surprisingly easy to put one together. Just watch some guides a few times and go for it. Pauls Hardware/Bitwit/Jayz2cents/Linus tech tips are some popular youtube channels with build guides, build recommendations and benchmarking.
---
It's a 40 man raid...
---
Can confirm. Am elitist and butthurt I didn't get into the beta.
---
Great post.
---
This is my issue with a lot of impressions so far. Level 30 isn't even 25% of the way and every gameplay system has a shelf life. 
---
I expect a lot of people who currently extoll the virtues of reading the quest text will be installed Quest Helper addons by level 44 because they no longer find the repetitive nature of questing fun. This to me is the biggest problem with questing in WOW. Games often set up a variety of enemies that must be combat differently and then varies the enemy composition so players must react differently.
---
The problem with WOW is that there are two types of mobs. Those that run up to you and melee you. Those that cast from a distance. The only meaningful modifier is whether the enemy runs away at low health. There just isn't the enemy variety or quest variety to sustain the length of time to reach the level cap.
---
While there are currently a multitude of leveling design problems in retail I strongly believe they made the right choice by halving the amount of time to reach level cap to ~3 days.
---
Your comment shows how much vanilla experience you have.
---
We'll see if blizzard can.
---
lmao imagine not knowing who Joana is
---
Unregistered hypercam 2 wasn't the best thing to record with.
---
To be fair after 30 fd will solve a lot of dead zone probs in for pve
---
Lookout guys, we got a badass over here.
---
Retail is the complete opposite of perfect, people are up in arms and constantly vocal about it.  
---
  &gt; To have two similar games?   
---
  It's literally the same fucking game dude, it's just that the new version went off the deep end.
---
Dude. Loved Arugal so much. Hated when he left.
---
Classic needs to be a clean slate.
---
We could ask Kevin Jordan if this was the intended design/if it would be desirable gameplay.
---
I don't see these comments. I see people mentioning that things are harder or easier on pservers but I don't see folks using pservers as the default and calling the beta wrong.
---
99.9% of people who are discussing this aren't so I'm not sure if you think one or two posts represents the majority or you're just not paying attention.
---
I'm undead you little gnome. Hush before I punt you across Tirisfal
---
That kinda explains how you're acting in this thread.
---
this isnt more streamer bullshit, this is someone with TONS of experience denying that mobs are doing too little damage. hes the record holder for fastest 1-60 speedrun and has tons leveling guides, he knows the game inside and out. hes probably one of the best people to listen to in regards to things like that
---
"Well yes, but actually yes"
---
Sure thing. https://i.imgur.com/8VvZIyB.jpg
---
*rubs your butt* soon my sweet
---
Never once did I mention asmongold, if you listen to anything he says, you‚Äôre likely a wow idiot. It has nothing to do with the dungeon being hard and everything to do with people walking through dungeons without dropping below 85% health
---
Those big crits really brought out the potency of abilities. For me that's way more important than some monsters dealing a bit less damage or aggro ranges.
---
Stop making comments about threads about gatekeeping.
---
Did I just have a stroke
---
&gt; At the start of the run he goes on this massive trip about how we only remember it being hard
---
This is funny because Tip went out of his way about how Classic was so much harder than private servers, and that players could easily be looked at 30% longer /played to 60.
---
I think it's fair to trust him more than anyone on the sub actually seeing as most people here aren't even actually playing it.
---
I chuckled. Damn you.
---
wonder if anyone has tested for the old FD bug where if the time run out it would sometimes consider you dead and make you corpse run
---
Oh look a safe space dweller with his feelings hurt, such a rarity
---
I thought we agreed this was binding runs for the warriors, in which case you'd obviously split up the raid into multiple groups.
---
I don't think Nightsong (which was introduced in Cataclysm) has any straight-up copied elements from Vanilla soundtracks, except for sounding a bit night elfish.
---
Your tips witch hunt you have going on trying to get people to hate him for some reason is actually laughable and quite sad
---
A good source of reference material is: Joana's 1-60 speed-run videos found on Youtube. It's from patch 1.9 of vanilla, and covers a HUGE amount of content.
---
Damn if only there was an easy solution to playing on a server with the big streamers if you dont want to. But for the life of me I cant think of one. Like imagine if blizzard made classic with the ability to CHOOSE which server you play on and you had the ability to pick one without streamers.
---
What a crazy idea.
---
You seem like the kinda guy to need on gear they cant even use then log off
---
The more I look at it, the more I think of the Step Brothers movie poster.
---
because it doesn't scale its simply a graph showing the raw xp required, not the time it takes to level.
---
exactly, this is what im gonna do look for a guild in game when it‚Äôs out. no rush and no expectations, just see whats about and which guild takes my fancy!
---
Same here, so many pissed off people, think it was actually like 3am for us.
---
Thrall is nothing like Trump
---
Hit and spirit (and also armor pen and expertise from tbc) stats on items were changed over the game's lifespan and became haste, versatility and crit instead. So yeah on live this thing has haste instead of hit.
---
it's 8% hit chance on a boss mob, but also, it's 5 weapon skill, not 5% hit chance. you do not get nearly enough hit rating from 5 weapon skill for that, or human fury warriors would not need truestrikes and devilsaur (and they do)
---
This is awkward and I feel violated.
---
Anything for beta key though....
---
Vanilla had some of the best world PVP that isn't like BFA. Not only *just* faction fights but the fact that maybe a handful of people pick a fight by killing players and NPCs. Minutes later people start showing up to counter these guys. Well now MORE people show up to counter those guys! AND MORE SHOW UP TO COUNTER THOSE GUYS!! And now you have an all out brawl where players would go back and forth (Terren Mills and Southshore for example) and you're there to woot for your home team. To see something small later escalate into a raid party+ PVP and then slowly die off from people leaving was really an experience to see.
---
Another great time was when you HAD to run to the area to que up for WSG (Northern Barrens/Ashenvale boarder for the horde, south of Astranaar for Alliance I believe). There was no UI for it were you can sit comfortably in Orgrimmar and pop a UI window for it. So while you're waiting for your que, you'd visit the other faction's area and pick a fight with them!
---
And don't get me started on the day that the Honor System dropped. üòâ
---
Stitches in duskwood is neutral? that defnitely seems like a bug
---
That's not what he said at all lmao. Everyone on this sub is just looking to pick fights today
---
Why not looking at the positive side of it? I'd rather have knowledgeable people make the whole thing authentic rather than not. &amp; Perplexity's main focus is pvp, which is a big aspect of vanilla so him testing these things is understandable. Anyone can do anything they want on the beta as long as they're testing different things and making sure it's authentic. You are right when you say the devs are going to compare to their reference client but still as the beta proves, some things pass through this filter + the fact that it's a more modern infrastructure wearing the vanilla skin.
---
Thanks for actually putting in the effort to gather evidence on this.
---
I must admit, my memories of SFK in Vanilla (not ran it on Private Servers) were that you could pull larger groups than other dungeons. I rarely remember wiping in there (probably why I loved the place so much).
---
Also, I ran DM on a private server last week for the first time since TBC. I ran that place hundreds of times in Vanilla, and knew every patrol etc. I purposely got a group of 20+ to run the dungeon so we could breeze it, and we wiped at least 5 times. So although I have no proof, my personal belief is that Private Servers were overtuned rather than the Beta being undertuned
---
Save your tears, waste of good suffering
---
You don't need more than the Main Tank to have the weapon.
---
When we played vanilla we played with other talents and  in much diffrent patches, 1.12 was about the end of vanilla. Most of what we remeber is how the game was, but that is not the game we are getting.
---
I just found out about a week ago who he was and still thought it was bullshit that he wasn't in the first wave.
---
Kind of? 
---
Private servers:
---
Harder
---
Mob spawns are wrong, frequently mobs stacked on top of each other stationary when they should be moving around.
---
Higher Damage
---
Aggro Ranges are almost universally too high.
---
Higher respawn rates. 
---
Easier: 
---
Lower AC (at least leveling mobs anyway)
---
Higher Quest drop rates across the board
---
Nowhere near as likely to get roamer adds 
---
Classic:
---
Higher Ac on leveling mobs
---
Mobs actually wander properly. (more likely to get adds)
---
Much Lower Quest drop rates
---
Easier:
---
Lower Aggro ranges
---
Less damage
---
Mobs Aren't as stacked. 
---
Higher Respawn Times
---
He's the person who's judgement I'd trust the most for this sort of thing.
---
You're a scumbag.
---
Content creators tend to be skilful and knowledgable in the field they create content for, Tips is clueless :)
---
But then how will we know if the bodies hit the floor?
---
It's your opinion. You have no actual facts to back this random statement. You say it is I say it's not. Either provide some proof for the "fact" or don't say anything at all.
---
Who gives a shit
---
Because when you get to 4hm and you need 6/8 tanks threat only matters for one of them?
---
My mistake, there was 1 other person giving the guy shit who then said he gets the point after realizing it was a meme, lol.
---
"Cringey edgelord" imagine my shock being called that /s  
---
Get new material
---
Yeah you‚Äôre just a very lame person. If making people upset gives you joy, you‚Äôre a shit person. I bet you do arenas solo.
---
lmao some people are real salty about an account that sat inactive for 12 years.
---
Preach
---
I'm sorry, i have to know if you have ever played on a private server.  Then I can decide whether your statements are correct or not.
---
This is like politics.  It doesn't matter what your actual point is, people wait until they know if you're an R or a D before they agree/disagree with you.
---
I love this it reminds you that the halfway point actually isn't 30 it's like 47 lol. But try not to think about that until after you hit 30 so you still get that "halfway" dopamine hit.
---
He already established that when he made his account. Read his profile bio lmao
---
It's a matter of principal.
---
I‚Äôve been watching MrGM and Tribe. They‚Äôve been actually running around testing known bugs and filling out great big reports.
---
Get this trump shit outta here
---
wow has always been full of soft whiney bitches
---
Nope, I don't ninja loot. Sorry to disappoint you bub
---
forreal, i unsubbed a month ago and left a note 'waiting for classic' but hell naw am i gonna resub just for a chance at beta, even though i want one.
---
Probably, something on the lines of can't get you outta my head or soemthing.
---
But the thing is, these people don't want to be left behind or have less just because they play less. 
---
They want the game to make so that they can get the same in 3hrs that someone else gets in 60. 
---
They have a weird way of thinking but saying "You can enjoy doing this low lvl/Gear content in your own pace even if there are other people at max level killing raids right now" 
---
They want to or NEED to be at the same level as everyone else.. always, they can't be "Inferior"
---
Oh absolutely. I hope I didn‚Äôt come across as a dick!
---
yes, present it please.
---
They are out in force now here it seems
---
Literally every private server ever was "wrong".
---
Maybe he got that name (Roguee) later on when he was already 60 or something
---
Yes, that's exactly what it is, beta tests have been used to sell games for years. Why would they release beta for games with prepurchase, and make it the week before it comes out (Black ops 4). How much can you fix in that time frame? Betas are being used more and more to generate interest in games, more to the point why wouldn't they do that, it's good for business? You don't think game studios have huge internal testing teams to run structured tests?
---
Oh look, some more "all content creators are evil" circle jerk.
---
Do you own BfA OP?
---
got it, thank you very much
---
If it was actively being used id agree.
---
i'm not saying time consumption literally means nothing. i'm being hyperbolic to say that time consumption isn't a negative in the sense that most people seem to mean it.
---
Im not saying dont test this stuff im saying this subreddot is acting like all these streamers are dumb for doing normal stuff and ppl like perplexity are the only ones doing it right
---
And these people get beta keys.. Salty much

Our character name should be Incel
---
Not even true lol
---
Lol, staysafe the retail babby panderer. Just like he thought that variable boss armor was some brand new information when private server bosses have variable armor depending on what category they fall into, with most raid bosses having almost 1k more armor than calculated armor from retail vanilla, and who thought that bears in dun morogh having the Ice Claw ability was something that was unheard of (bears on private servers had that ability for the last 2 years at lesat). Yea, I think you should take whatever Staysafe has to say with a grain of salt, pal.
---
By the time you get into Naxx, there are plenty of other options that will do the job.
---
I would absolutely refuse to join a guild that gives every set of bindings to warriors.
---
Same here. I love all the starting zones but Dun Morogh always been a special place for me.
---
I'm pretty sure according to another poll the average age was like 25. I highly doubt 70% of the people here had a decent enough computer, and an active wow subscription when they were 10-13 and are coming back now.
---
Actually that's Darkest Night a DC comics storyline. Poe is good too though 
---
What do you read besides teen vogue and big butts monthly?
---
I don't think that would have saved them.
---
You know they give beta access to people who have completed wow content right? Calling people no skill when you would have had beta access if you'd gotten more than aotc seems a bit ironic.
---
&gt; takes away from the essence of what makes classic great.
---
How does something that existed in classic take away the essence of what made classic great?
---
What's the difference at this point?
---
Screw that. If there isn‚Äôt a full raid group 5 minutes after launch, I will unsubscribe! üòÑ
---
Nooooo! I need to re buy a pc and a desk!
---
I am not ready yet
---
Yeah he was on autopilot most likely
---
Wow OP is an asshole
---
Fapping in between flightplans. Nice
---
While there is evidence of it being accurate, there is also evidence of it being lower than it should in seemingly random situations
---
Streams are providing evidence that in the low level dungeons you can fail every condition in your first paragraph, and still easily succeed.
---
I agree there are a lot of misconceptions about difficulty, but if you believe what you said in the first paragraph I think you'd be surprised by the stream content.
---
Oh well maybe I can enjoy wow over and over again for the first time then
---
Again it's a DC comics storyline mister butt bandit LOL shouldn't you be on r/idonthavesex
---
Classic did not happen because of streamers. We all know this. Streamers that jumps on the hype train however is really good, and will make the community larger, but I believe wow classic would have thrived and lived with or without streamers. Sodapoppin was somewhat a pushing force for classic, which I liked, aswell as Asmongold and other streamers. But we are kidding ourselves if we actually believe that THEY made it happen. Classic is here because the wow community want a good game, nothing else. I am so grateful that I fell into the private server scene, even though I was sceptical at first. The game is just so good it does not need advertisement. I'm so glad people are starting to realize WoW classics potential.

I appreciate the confidence in me haha! I‚Äôll take a look at those and see if I feel worthy :)

I feel you on that; I guess it probably blew up with that wailing cavern thing and then everyone assumes they're unreliable sources because of it.
---
Saltiness affects the brain and fogs the mind I guess.

Same here. I‚Äôm not wasting my money buying a sub when I likely won‚Äôt get a beta invite. I‚Äôll just wait till the 27th.

---

Ok that‚Äôs BS.
---
I remember leveling being hard, but I was able to consistently juggle 3-4 mobs in the open world in classic/TBC. Still can‚Äôt on private servers, leveling wasn‚Äôt *that* type of hard. Most of the issues with time consuming leveling were with pathing, grinding, and finding miscellaneous quests to fill in gap levels.
---
I distinctly remember wiping multiple times by someone lighting all the torches.
---
You might have been in good groups that always made sure to do one at a time.
---
Some people enjoy leveling quickly to fully immerse in the end game or PVP! Unless your a sadist, fighting 400 other players for a drop quest isn‚Äôt very enjoyable lol.  :)
---
But by that logic plenty of other options will do the job for the rogue as well....
---
And I would absolutely refuse to join a guild that gave a set of bindings to someone over a warrior, sure if the only warrior missing it is an alt or a social or w/e, then fine, give it to a rogue.
---
It's the black lanterns oath moron and it's a better story than anything marvel put together recently
---
How about all those music videos like. 
---
Pugs all night, Ulduar, that's the world of warcraft that you play, horde for life, songs by Nyhm and Gigi. Such good content
---
But vanilla is very time consuming depending on what activities you do (but pretty much any endgame activity require a good amount of grinding for consumables/world buffs).
---
The question wether or not it is enjoyable is not on the table.
---
It's the matter that a lot of the people who played vanilla back in the day where students or early employees now they have full careers and also some families and people are sceptic that they were only able to really enjoy vanilla due to putting ludicrous amount of hours into it, that was the main "time consuming" fear in a sense.
---
As a few people mentioned it might be more complicated.  They have the old 1.12 values, but the Legoin client is not interpreting them correctly in every case.  Not my argument as I do not understand such things, but other people have suggested it.  Sounds like a possibility.
---
I might
---
I don't understand why you're getting so defensive if you're motives **are** purely altruistic. If they're **not**, then it makes sense that you feel like you have to defend yourself. Regardless of what justifications you use, you're asking for personal information from an at risk demographic. That's a fact, and it should be taken into consideration before attempting to engage with such a charity. 
---
There is no direct incentive for you to be altruistic. However there is incentive to misuse personal information. That's the problem with receiving PII (Personal Identifiable Information) and why there's an entire industry just to certify bodies to handle PII so they can be held to accountability. You have none of that. Just your word of honor that you're not going to perform nefarious deeds with the information. Zero accountability. 
---
This isn't about human touch. I already admitted that I'm far too cynical to ever believe you're giving away free money out of the goodness of your heart. But I'm not trying to make this personal, even if that's how you're taking it. 
---
Your offer is indistinguishable from a scam, and people who keep that in mind before contacting you. If you really cared about people, you wouldn't disagree with me.
---
they actually do care, i remember watching these guys years ago and they always said they loved vanilla and the reason they dont stream private servers its because well, they are illegal.
---
And you have a point about Asmongold, but, i hated him when i first saw him, but trust me he grows on you. I dont  like his chat tho. And the prime stuff he literally does it as a meme, he makes fun of himself.
---
But yeah, I undestand your point of view.
---
I trust him!!
---
No one uses the p servers as default, the assumption is to our best knowledge most of those values are correct. Certainly when it comes to class mechanics. Raids while they look good and play well on p servers rarely line up with the code of the original.  Even if the end results are very similar 
---
The reality is the p servers with 1.12 mechanics are in 90% plus of general questions better representations of the game than some one who played through vanilla.
---
You have a very distorted view of the product we'll be getting if you bought the game anywhere near launch. 
---
Private servers tried to emulate more progression, so they are in fact closer to the Vanilla than the classic we will be getting. 
---
So using them is a much better baseline than anything. Because these topics have been debated there, that's how you got those values. People act like no one has talked about these things before......
---
Literally any in depth topic there is a better discussion (or was) on some private server forum somewhere.
---
How do we know Blizz isnt' going to fix it?  Have they said that already?
---
Yeah shocking. Where‚Äôs that grumpy grandpa who swore on his life and memory that it was all completely wrong and that Joanna of all people would vindicate him.
---
They have a reference client. There‚Äôs literally thousands of videos from vanilla showing damage values. They were correct on private servers, they are correct in classic beta. Eat it salty nerds who didn‚Äôt get into the beta.
---
Never heard of that sub, but you somehow do, you didn‚Äôt have to tell me you frequently visit it :0
---
They don't see a difference. They just see something that doesn't line up with what they believe/remember and freak out. Actually closely watch the asmongold videos with comparisons people are linking. The damage is almost exactly the same, the only real differences are in damage patterns not damage done (in the arugal clip, arugal spends way more time meleeing asmongold than it does in the video from 2006. but the shadow bolt on asmongold are hitting for 258, the ones from 2006 are hitting for 259). People are linking things that prove themselves wrong and not actually watching them closely.
---
None of that is toxic... it‚Äôs funny an interesting. 
---
Throwing a temper tantrum on forums is not funny or interesting.
---
Great song
---
Yeah lots of salty warriors it seems
---
Yeah, most computers nowadays can run WoW pretty smoothly. It's nice for those 40-mans raids :)
---
There are updated graphics in the beta, and I think this will be in the full version aswell. You can however tune it to look old school aswell.
---
imagine using guides at all for games. The only game I see that would need a guide right now is path of exile for new players.
---
From What day is this. Starting zone is fucking crouwded lol. Like they invites everyone except me xD
---
I also think about dungeon running with consecrate for low lvls.
---
If you did, which I think you didn't, actually work on a private server, it must've been a shitty one then...
---
Ahhhhh hhhnnnggghh!! Funeral Raid! That was hilarious! Best toxic moment I can remember!!
---
Ironforge Bank Murder was great too! Tried to find the video but basically a gnome warlock's voidling had the Barron's debuff from MC that does a DOT to it's target and when it expires, BOOOOOOM! AoE damage to the surrounding targets! Blizzard had to issue a warning to any further actions of this would result in a ban. So good.
---
Except the evidence here supports that the numbers are the same. The evidence shows a void bolt hitting, and if you watch later in the Asmon clip he gets hit for a very similar amount by a void bolt.
---
was under the impression he played in vanilla but this makes me think otherwise, there are some things you do not forget, the candles in this room are one of those things
---
Middle class family with one decent family computer that you only were allowed to play on for 1 hr a night (2 on the weekends).  Not much but it was my roots. This turned into a personal laptop as a Xmas/bday combined gift in about 6 months of me being annoying to the parents
---
Link of that video?
---
well, most of us who are passionate about WoW never wanted things easy. Blizzard did that as a business move to cater to regular joes who have 30 minutes to play when they get home from work. Even tho I don't like it, i understand, they're a company, in the business of making money.
---
I disagree. Alliance scum crying on the forums is always funny. 
---
Little kids crying about how toxic a community is, is not
---
They were removed in patch 1.4.
---
Wow Classic is using patch 1.12.
---
That's a no.
---
That vid made me cringe. How the fuck did tipsout makeit that far without a defensive bar setup wtf? No shield block either. He was also in stone talon and said he couldn‚Äôt pummel spellcasters because that ability is learned in the 30s. How does he not know that shield bash which does the same thing when I stopped in dreanor or w.e it‚Äôs called silences. It did the same thing in classic also. How the fuck is he a vet? Did he even play any of the private servers to brush up? That‚Äôs not even bad that‚Äôs just clueless.
---
Also this is only a comparison of leveling mobs. no clue about raid targets yet.
---
A quest helper add-on also existed in Vanilla and that directly takes away from the essence of exploration and immersion from having to read quests and then go out and explore/learn the zones. The exact same goes for DBM, stop being a mong.
---
You missspelled cuckslayer. 
---
Bet you play undead.
---
Yeah like you said on your last point, the benefit of streamers getting beta is allowing thousands to spot inconsistencies.
---
See that's what everyone in my guild said. It didn't work. They at least had good intentions.
---
He has no idea what he's talking about though, the guy only spent the last 18 months leveling on pservers.
---
Came here to say this as well üôÇ
---
yeah, i don't doubt that there's probably completely asinine instances of mob damage being a little too low, but, seriously, it's a friggin level 6 tiger.
---
i posted in that topic further down with people complaining about SFK damage being too low with a video from '06 vs ASmongold's SFK run and the numbers were pretty much identical.
---
This is from yesterday lol, did you get into beta?!
---
damn right, they always were master race for warriors
---
"exploration and immersion" are in no shape or form the essence of vanilla though.
---
No sadly not. There was a Wave few hours ago
---
‚ÄúACKSHUALLY its the black lantern‚Äôs oath huahhahahonk‚Äù

Lmao ok clown, calm down.

You don't know what Joana is famous for, right?

I have been subbed since 2004 my dad obviously use to pay now i do
---
Nostalgia can be very detrimental to this unique opportunity.
---
I agree that people just need to go in and test for proper bugs where you genuinely feel something isn't right (I really like the "not a bug" post from blizzard that clears up some of them for us) and enjoy it while they do so. Trying to compare this beta with anything historical drives up the controversy between different visions of what classic 'should be'.
---
Fuck that, just enjoy it as a fresh experience and help blizzard out. They'll take care of it.
---
Really depends how efficient you are at multiboxing
---
Lol JeBaited :(
---
I've been playing since 2005. I'm 34 years old. I hope you take away the lesson that took me more than half a decade to learn: the best way to have fun in this game is by playing it, not by reading about others' experiences or watching them play it. Find a good group of friends and fuck everyone else.
---
if this post makes blizzard nurf 1.12 classic. Screw this, and screw you. If it's 200%harder, GOOD!! Consider it a Master quest version of WoW. (Reference Zelda OOT Masters Quest).

why test the games when they can get people to test it for them for free.
---
It's determined by your gear and not your spec mostly.  You'll struggle to deal damage and stay alive with healing gear on, and you'll run out of mana and won't be able to save anyone with mortal strike in balance gear.  I suppose it does flow fine, but it's not effective.
---
I used to go out of my way to teach low level hunters I came across how to properly play the class.  Someone did the same for me and it totally changed my perception of the class around LVL 30.  Like "wtf I can FD to try out of combat and lay a trap?"  Or the use of auto shoot cast bar to move between auto shots or weave aimed shots.
---
I felt the sooner someone learned to play the class the more practice they'll have by the time they hit max level.
---
Care to share that link?
---
The fact is that the cloak SHOULD have went to the hunter. No questions asked. Agi cloak -&gt; hunter end of story. If there would have been a str stam cloak and someone decided to take it from yall FOR ANY REASON it would be blasted all over the internet.

I never played on a pvp server back in the day. I wonder if I should give it a try this time to see what that experience is like.

Or are the servers all like modern wow now with war mode or whatever? I‚Äôm a bit out of the loop on that.

Red trail looks good and gives a sense of more feedback. It is not a bug.

---
was the same problem in alpha at blizzcon, they didn't bother fixing an of this after all this time xd.
---
I'm genuinely lost for words if you don't think that immersion is part of the essence that made Vanilla great, simply stating that implies to me that you didn't play back then and haven't played on a Pserver.
---
Exploration and immersion are one of the game design pillars that are required to make a successful MMORPG.
---
"Cringey edgelordssss" hur durrrr 
---
Run back to your safe space I'm sure your body pillow waifu misses you
---
Check out nzxt bld. Im very happy with the build I got from them
---
Isn't it as easy as someone with Beta Access creating a new troll hunter and basically following what Joana does? Like trying to recreate some pulls. You could also track down whatever items he got etc. for later pulls.

COUNTRY ROADS

As someone who talks a lot of shit on Dota 2 I can guarantee Valve doesnt care about what you say

You also get an email from Blizzard with the subject

"xxxxxxx - You‚Äôre Invited to the World of Warcraft Classic Beta Test "
---
You don't understand how the mallet chain works if you think big streamers aren't getting it.
---
Who cares?
---
Im going to be doing 3 at the start. Get all 3 to 10 and then put two in an inn and pick a main. AFter that just grind the rested on the 2 other characters once a week while focusing on my main.
---
Is it faster? No but at least you can switch it up and not really worry about having to do the beginning area again.
---
&gt; the dungeons weren't that hard. we were just fucking terrible
---
Yeah it matches my memory of these dungeons and some of [the old alt.games.warcraft posts](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/alt.games.warcraft/threat|sort:date/alt.games.warcraft/qEsSARMYByk/NdOVjQArBH8J) also back this up. 
---
I remember that these early dungeons (up to, what, Uldaman?) were doable with a poorly geared shaman as your tank.
---
Basically invest in a new 1440p 144hz monitor and upgrade later when you decide to ditch classic. Obviously ask people in the /r/buildapc subreddit about upgrades if you want to play other games as well.
---
I haven't seen much overly negative stuff except people wanting to get in beta and crying about it or people crying about toxic posts then again I'm only checking in here every so often.
---
Appreciate that :D
---
also all the people clipping streamers for forgetting stupid shit like you can't swap armor during combat, and then shaming them. who cares, is it really pertinent ?
---
Only Live Classic WoW will tell.
---
Yes, usables
---
A post so pure, like a drink of water from a clear mountain spring
---
No, there is no buts, if you sell something, YOU NO LONGER OWN IT. You're a shitty person.
---
This reminds me of an old guild member that played guitar during raid down time over vent. He played classical style. It was hard to get everyone to actually shut up on vent, but when he played everyone would be quiet. I wanted him to play during fights so people would be quiet and listen. But we needed him healing us more lol.
---
Shhhh The OP is gonna get mad you called him unfunny and uninteresting. Just look at all the comments hes spewing lol
---
Cant some hunters use beast lore on those tigers to check their damage (it does show dmg right?) and also post combat logs including glancing blows etc so we have more infos.
---
When did you start playing?
---
How long since subbed?
---
PLEASEEE &lt;3
---
It's a closed level 30-max beta, you dweeb. You don't need to make money... Play whatever you want to play. Play every single class, in fact, just to search out more bugs or something.
---
Normal, functional adults.
---
This is exactly what I needed. You're my hero! Dad, is that you?
---
I remember this happened during Overwatch's closed beta too
---
This sub was around 48-52k subs for awhile. In the last 3 months its gained legit 30k, and bow with the beta out another ~12k in like 3 days.
---
considering it sat dormant for 12 years, i'm not going to lose sleep. you care way too much. i love this.
---
Or he wanted it really bad and wanted 5 separate chances to get in?  Now that he has won he doesn‚Äôt need the other wins.
---
Subbed since 2004 and played since 2004
---
Its not looking great when this sub legit gatekeeps and witch-hunts people for reporting "the wrong things". Its vile.
---
not everyone did the last boss in that place, just like not everyone did the one underwater.

Im just wondering what to play or what would be the most fun cause they will raise the cap eventually
---
I‚Äôd assume the mods aren‚Äôt allowing people to spam with posts about getting an invite. Probably a smart call.
---
I got an invite last night.
---
Pick any game and almost any site and youll see the same toxic meme/troll environment. Its a joke tbh.
---
No, you make a succesfull mmo by creating compelling gameplay and allow players to bond over it.
---
People are fucking horrible. Welcome to Earth.
---
The first character I played was a dwarf hunter on my father's account, I've been torn between going Horde making a Troll hunter or making a Dwarf hunter when classic comes out.
---
Well it is the weekend...
---
Yeah cause telling people to stop crying equals crying in whatever weird reality you live in. 
---
Shame it's still a reality where you couldn't get laid in a morgue
---
What do his guides have to do with anything? He's known for more than just his guides in the vanilla community, like being the record holder for 1-60, take away the guides and my comment remains the same. He isn't just a random streamer that bullshits his way through things that he has no clue about.
---
OP‚Äôs attitude got stuck in 2006 and hasn‚Äôt found a way out yet. F to pay respects for OP.
---
if you got the email today it means you got added 1-2 days ago.
---
Blizzard is like China now, what a pathetic reason to ban people. This is not even an insult.
---
So glad right click reporting will be in for people like you tbh.
---
This wasn't fixed till BC.
---
What are you playing as?
---
If you get scammed, you warn the rest of the server of the person who ninja‚Äôd from you. People generally want to maintain their server reputation so it‚Äôs not a common occurrence.
---
Why would a normal functional adult want to stop someone else from enjoying a game because of a completely tame and ultimately meaningless insult they made
---
Go cry more about this place being a toxic circlejerk snowflake
---
And you couldn't have done the same at battlegrounds or in 5mans?
---
Leveling is just there for you to learn the basics.
---
I believe the best leveling spec for shamans is sword and board enhancement, that's by far the worst spec when you start doing endgame though.
---
The amount of rested xp you get overnight, you'll get through in like 10-15 minutes of playing. If you're leveling two characters because you want two, then do it. If you're doing it out of some "efficiency", it's a faulty idea and it'll take you maybe 4-5 months real time if you have a job.
---
&gt; It's the matter that a lot of the people who played vanilla back in the day where students or early employees now they have full careers and also some families and people are sceptic that they were only able to really enjoy vanilla due to putting ludicrous amount of hours into it, that was the main "time consuming" fear in a sense.
---
yes totally. and those people probably never "got" vanilla in the first place. if someone says something is "time consuming" as a general negative, what do most people mean? i think its that they must put in a lot of effort in order to see benefit right? but the thing is in vanilla wow that's not actually true. you can log into vanilla for an hour a day and feel like you at least got something done or made some progress in some activity and feel really good about it. personally i cant do this in retail, their reward structure is what i would define time consuming because even though they might shower you with gifts it takes forever and lots of rng to get a gift you actually care about. but in vanilla the whole game is balanced so well that this isnt the case imo.
---
so really my problem when people just say "vanilla was sooo time consuming" is that i see "time consuming" as a general POSITIVE. call me crazy but i dont dump hours into a game if im only enjoying it a small percentage of the time. retail wow gameplay to me may as well be 90% chaff and 10% actual enjoyment. vanilla wow to me is 90% enjoyment and 10% chaff. so if vanilla is time consuming to me it means i was so engaged with the game i couldnt stop playing it. is it "time consuming" to hit max level? yes, sure, but my point is that if you are looking at vanilla wow just as how long it takes to hit max level, you're missing that in vanilla the entire leveling experience is fun and well balanced the whole time, so what's the problem? isn't the whole point that we want a game that is fun the whole time?
---
the argument that "oh people grew up and have kids and responsibilities now" just doesn't work at all for me considering in vanilla i knew so many people who were adults with families or schoolwork or whatever. you make time for your hobbies, and if wow is your hobby, that's what you did. if an adult is so pressed for time they cant enjoy casually playing vanilla then they have bigger problems preventing them from enjoying any games at all, not just wow imo.
---
It was actually quicker than a lot of classes, and mana efficient to boot (with the talent for mana regen).

Read again, it says you have to be subscribed pretty clearly.
---
Do you think all of these people going nuts over damage values of mobs also know we aren't running potatoes for pcs anymore, and we are overall better players as a whole?
---
How can you say that when there is video evidence on front page showing that at least 1 mob does wrong damage, despite blizzard ‚ÄúHAVING THE GOD DAMN DATA‚Äù 
---
Keep an open mind.
---
You think they had time to go through multiple videos for every instance, zone, and then account for armor types and buffs? 
---
They might have done it here and there, but damage calculations were perfect until very recently on private servers. A lot of it was still guess work, and I‚Äôm sure as hell that they didn‚Äôt get everything right.
---
Using direct comparisons to original vanilla content is the only way to get a real idea of what numbers were like. As you said, they offer a great starting place for comparisons. But I would never compare a test piece against something that was once built as a test piece as well.
---
Science dictates you go to the source, the only sources we have are the database blizzard has and actual vanilla content.
---
I ran WoW on a shitty $250 Dell laptop when I was 13 so..
---
Yeah but that doesn't suit the narrative.
---
There is more to life than knowing who some kid who speedran something is. I was busy playing vanilla wow and hanging out with friends playing yugioh cards back in the day. You act like these people are the president and everyone should know who they are lmao.
---
You are absolutely correct.
---
We CC'ed *everything* because mobs hit like trucks.
---
It's not that it was impossible, but fights quickly spiralled out of control when multiple mobs were involved. 
---
That's the thing I see a lot of people keep forgetting when talking about the difficulty of vanilla.   
---
If you ended up fighting three mobs at once or in partially overlapping consecutive fights, *you were fighting for survival*. Add in the fact most mobs had *some* kind of fucky ability and it got real bad real fast.   
---
They all hit so fucking hard and elites were just straight up crazy, especially at the lower levels.
---
No moon walking is really really killing my mood this needs more upvotes...
---
&gt;people that don‚Äôt have much time to play and don‚Äôt want to hit 60 soon
---
I‚Äôm going to level one character to 60 at release and then level another around Jan-March timeframe. As I play my main, I‚Äôll still rack up rested xp on my alt.
---
Err. I'm pretty sure you're wrong there mate. Sure you're not remembering BC?
---
First of all, the OP in this thread is comparing data from authentic vanilla videos and the current beta data, which has nothing to do with private servers.
---
You seem to have the opinion that I think private server devs went through the entire database of mobs and calculated values for each and every mob, which I absolutely do not. But there is a large contingent on this subreddit that thinks private server devs did the exact opposite, and made up values for everything with zero quantitative evidence, which is simply not true, as you pointed out yourself.
---
Seal Fate rogues.
---
Lol no it won‚Äôt, you‚Äôd have to have an extensive background in programming with years of game development experience to even get an interview. Go look at their job postings if you think otherwise.
---
How are locks a bane to paladins? They can remove curses and magic right?
---
It just feels like people who are mad that streamers make money playing wow, so they want to attack them at any opportunity.
---
Hey you do you man. I totally understand that side of it and lean that way sometimes.
---
Classic is not Out for 3 months and it's already ruining my life. Basically been watching streams for 3 days while checking launcher every 3 hour. Wtb a life

I got an invite yesterday, just didn't think it was worthy of a post.
---
I really shouldn‚Äôt need to explain that one to you. You‚Äôll figure it out, I‚Äôm sure.
---
It's not a bigger "dead zone", it's a bigger "melee zone". The dead zone is just in a different area than other races' dead zones, this is why people didn't notice it that much until later on in WoW's lifespan.
---
All of them. They're all fun. It's closed beta, man. You have no expectations except to report bugs. This is your time to try literally everything and discover your favorite race/class for yourself. Why are you outsourcing your fun to jerks like me?
---
I'd go Troll personally

That must be why it‚Äôs launching with DM, ZG, AQ, Naxx, BGs and the world bosses right off the bat, huh?

You‚Äôre don‚Äôt want them in because you don‚Äôt want to speed level and you don‚Äôt want people who speed level to have something you don‚Äôt have. You can get fucked.

Just ignore them dude, it's not that big of a deal

Warrior - Leveling Arms, Prot/Arms at 60  
---
Lock - Affliction probably, not sure yet  
---
Hunter - BM, farming toon  
---
Mage - Frost  
---
Rogue - Combat to level, unsure at 60  
---
Shaman (eventually) - Ele/Resto
---
That's extremely subjective though.
---
PVP and/or RPPVP. I want to try a RP server out this time but not sure how that community is so gonna wait and see how that turns out

"put on your big boy pants" mate vanilla WoW was one of the most casual MMO's even when it was released back in the day.
---
Context: previously a Community Manager said: " ‚ÄùIf you are not currently an active subscriber then this would disqualify you from being considering for future beta waves.‚Äù
---
Maybe if you were a rlly well geared pally or warrior, but for everyone else it was kinda tough. I distinctly remember trying to juggle 3 mobs as a level 55-60 tauren druid in Ungoro crater and eastern plaguelands and I always barely got by and would run out of mana healing myself.
---
I was geared decently since I did dungeons alot but juggling 4 mobs is kinda something you do in modern wow. Also I never played on a private server btw so I have no idea what people's experience was with them.
---
Plenty of GMs have confirmed this by now.
---
They have an actual server actually. They showed it during blizzcon on the classic panel.
---
They use it to compare how environments are supposed to look etc.
---
Maybe you should spend all that vast amount of Vanilla knowledge and disseminate it amongst the population. From there your name might get noticed as a positive person in the community and you may likely get more opportunities with blizzard products. You won't do that because you are just a general negative salt fest individual who thinks themselves more highly than they probably are.
---
Yeah it's around now these posts start occuring, maybe an hour sometimes. I'd bet no invites on a weekend, maybe not even Monday, but with a chunk on Tuesday/Wednesday.

He keeps constantly saying things in his stream today like "I played a lot from Vanilla to Wrath of the Lich King... but I've only ever done BFD and most of the other dungeons once," or when he said BWL will be easy because "he did it when he was level 70 and it's so easy that it's stupid."  
---
I'm under the impression that a lot of these streamers have been exposed lately for their massive incompetence to fairly basic mechanics.
---
Did that on my very first run of the dungeon too, made sense to me back then that you have solve the "puzzle" of lighting all torches in the room, yes we wiped.
---
&gt; You think they had time to go through multiple videos for every instance, zone, and then account for armor types and buffs?
---
No, I do not. But as I said to another person, there is a large contingent on this subreddit that thinks private server devs did the exact opposite and made up values for everything, with zero quantitative evidence for any of it.
---
Damage has been re-scaled several times when numbers got to high, it might have been done with the engine, so when you load up the old database the engines still makes it's small changes.
---
Just because you have a simple healing rotation, that doesn't dictate how fun or engaging a class is. In PvP you had 3 viable specs which all played very differently. Shockadin was the most fun spec of any class I played by a large margin once you had the right gear. You could also do any of the 3 roles in normal 5 man dungeons without any issues. Yes raiding meant you were healing and while I agree spamming flash of light isn't exactly rocket science, no class or spec in vanilla had a very engaging or hard pve rotation outside of maybe hunter.
---
Also paladins didn't spam rank 1 flash of light. With any kind of decent gear and enough crit you could easily spam rank 6 without going OOM.

Don't yuck someone else's yum.

They mentioned that back then they didn't have proper version control setup so they couldn't do it this easily.

Which is why all we get is 1.12 because they found a version laying around somewhere in a random folder.

Neither you nor this subreddit is important for vanilla wow. not a single person will change their mind about trying wow because someone was a dick on the internet.

Stop shoving streamers down our throats then.

Respect our wishes, and we will respect yours.

that sounds about right. hunters kiting, warriors using piercing howl.
---
Why is your name highlighted in brown?
---
No, I plan to speed level and still don't want them in.
---
I think Classic (and the War3 and Starcraft remasters) are just proof that Blizz is beyond redemption. They can't do anything as good as stuff they've already done, and everyone knows it, including Blizz.
---
It sucked for everyone except tauren warriors who were mace stunning and sword proccing healers through pillars.

It didn't go well.

Maybe it's real, but idk it seems kinda fake to me. Compared this to the leeroy jenkins vids fake reactions. Maybe just done for the show, though I guess it doesn't really matter, its good entertainment anyway.

Lower levels stuff was pretty easy, it didn‚Äôt ramp up until like level 40ish....
---
As for your other point, I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they made endgame raiding harder. It would keep people from just barreling through the content and then bitching at blizzard to give them more.
---
I'm a long time warrior arena player, he is braindead in that area too.
---
Hunter better than mage in wpvp lol good one xD
---
The first who showcased skull of impending doom, or at least the first who got famous for it.
---
In vanilla the highest level I got was 32, i was 8 at the time however, I was the great gnome mage Slimeum who fucking got mad at the pirates outside booty bay cus I couldn't kill them and didn't understand why. (theyre like level 40~)
---
How is it a waste of time? It would take them 2 seconds to discern it isn't a bug. Quinn doesn't know anything about WoW but he is a streamer of thousands so naturally he gets into the beta. Shroud got into the WoW Beta as well. This isn't a big deal at all but it does make him look dumb in the eyes of WoW people.
---
Of which immersion plays a big part in.
---
The first time I ever felt proud of how my character looked (UD Rogue).  I had just gotten my mount, a cool full-length cloak, the [Embrace of the Lycan](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=9479) helm out of ZF, and the Phantom Blade which sheathed on your character model's back.
---
Why would he have posted it here if it wasn‚Äôt of interest?
---
If a streamer was the first to discover a supposed bug like the title would obviously be read, that could be a valid reason to post here.
---
If a streamer was one of the vast amount of other streamers who had already encountered this bug days ago, why would this be relevant for this sub?
---
Duel Duel Duel. Practice makes perfect. Though watching videos on it explaining your specific class pvping would be good. Learn combos and such.
---
200% off is a bit of exaggeration. But there is a difference ofc. Semms more like a flat damage per mob, harpies did 2-3 extra damage on "vanilla". 7-8 classic, 10ish vanilla. Thats far from 200% mate.
---
Thank you
---
I was leveling a toon around xmas time 2004, a wee lad I was. My guild leader said wait where you are, he rode up on his mount, dropped me 5 g and dipped. It was really cool
---
Right? I‚Äôm gonna be surprised if the mods don‚Äôt ban him out of here.
---
Why is the post about the tiger silly? It may help blizzard fix algorithms that may affect a many other mobs.
---
I think that kind of feedback is EXACTLY what blizzard wants out of the beta.
---
for a warrior to take 50-60 damage from a hit that a mage (prob around 10% mitigation) he would had to have 55% mitigation, which is surreal without an giga armor pot and very strong shield running.
---
1 on 1 is just a duel...
---
wpvp yea hunter much better, especially while leveling. If they're good
---
Mage is a lot simpler yes...
---
I wish this guy would learn to physically close his mouth. Looks even worse than he sounds.
---
We just gotta make a concerted effort to downvote it whenever we see it. They are weak people that want something to hate. If they stop getting affirmation then they will stop
---
&gt; There are objective good and bad points but wether you enjoy it ? It's entirely subjective.
---
games dont have "objective good and bad points" necessarily though, if im understanding what you mean. they have design goals, and their mechanics can objectively meet those goals if you're crunching the right numbers, but those goals and whether people think the mechanics are good or not are totally subjective, yes.
---
&gt;Lmao nice death threat.
---
Lolwhut? Where did I make a death threat? Are you an actual retard and doesn't understand what I said? 
---
Even dead people would reject you is the joke idiot. It's not a death threat
---
you're an idiot dude Joana got a day 2 invite. i even reported it before him. why are you talking?
---
quote where i said it was
---
Because if enough people report stupid shit like this, like we‚Äôve seen streamers do, any dev on earth will eventually get frustrated/annoyed and their reluctance to address real issues might be hindered. 
---
You‚Äôre given an opportunity thousands of people are desperate for and you do stupid shit like this? Nah dude.

They're not wrong. Sodapoppin is not a fucking authoritative source of information. If a blue post says it, then I'll eat crow. Until then, given the plethora of cringeworthy clips already posted here of streamers incorrectly claiming that something is wrong in Classic when it's obvious to most anyone else that it isn't, to ever take a single thing any streamer says as gospel is to demonstrate your complete and utter ignorance.
---
Thanks, wasn‚Äôt sure about that but sounds good :)
---
Paladins have always been good in PvP. Yes, they are not "aggressive button masher" PvP class that people are foaming for all the time.
---
Paladins are just very defensive PvP class, that makes duels long and drawn out.

PvE however, is another matter.

Did he just get in today? Not heard of any invites today, that's encouraging
---
Did you watch clips listed in the reply? I can‚Äôt on mobile so I‚Äôm wondering is he was actually not 100% honest.
---
Be weary of anyone saying they got an invite today. Be sure to ask if they got the EMAIL or the invite itself. If it is the email, those seem to be going out 1-2 days after the actual invite.
---
My first character was a mage, and I leveled as Fire. I remember being so excited when I got Combustion (end talent) at level 40 and thinking it was so sick. I ran around and used it every 3 minutes, and drooled over the crits.
---
It's true that this sub is very toxic, and people simply can't remember Vanilla well 15 years later, but you're exaggerating, there are things which are legit looking undertuned on the Beta even compared to everything pre-MoP.
---
I watched the end of Asmongold BFD stream and that Twilight Lord Kelris boss hit him for 40 damage on a 2 second swing (if not more) - while Asmon had a 1k2 health pool. That means that boss would need to keep pounding him ***for one whole minute*** to actually kill him. Even undertuned MoP/WoD/Legion bosses wouldn't hit that little. Then I took a look at his stream an hour later and normal wolves in Duskwood hit him for 30+ (he didn't wear a shield though I admit, but these are non elites and non bosses). That doesn't seem normal.
---
They also pulled a 6 elite mob pack in the very same run just before that boss and killed them without even getting into a "Oh shit" situation. I find it strange tbh. But whatever, there's over 3 months of testing left, sure we'l find out who's right before launch anyway, no reason to make a big deal out of it.
---
Great video tbh, he nailed a lot of the great points about classic wow.
---
We'll have to agree to disagree, because apparently that's subjective.

CLASSIC ROADS
---
Well, to tell you the truth, dual spec was a long awaited feature for any classic player.
---
I don't understand the problem here. Don't read the post if you don't like it. He and several other streamers have been advocating Classic for a while, they and their communities, played a big part in this happening. You seem to be a Classic WoW hardcore player and their very presence in classic WoW is acting like a trigger for you. Nothing about this makes you look good. You look petty and downright pathetic just because you believe you are on some level above them in regards to Classic.
---
Here's a video from 2006 level 24 warrior tanking SFK The elites are hitting him for roughly 40 damage and he has roughly the same gear Asmongold had during his run. 2006 SFK: [https://youtu.be/W1FuMa3OyiM?t=222](https://youtu.be/W1FuMa3OyiM?t=222) Asmons Run:  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/426485749?t=01h41m28s  , as you can see its basically the same damage coming in. As to Joana's clip of being hit 1-3s in the starting area from a lvl 7 mob, the same mob was hitting Tips for the correct amount so there is definitely something going on there whether MoTW was reducing the damage by so much at such a low level i dont know since he doesnt mouse over the buff in the clip.
---
Been watching Kargoz on youtube hes pretty good.
---
DM if you have any specific questions. Im not a pro or anything but Ive played for awhile and could probably help.

Presuming absolutely zero bonus honour for anyone, yes you would be in the top bracket.  
---
[Here is a pretty clear explanation about the whole system as well as the brackets.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFbX5drsnAw)
---
It's worth noting that there's a lot of misinformation about the honour system, people will often confidently tell you incorrect things like "There can be only one rank 14 at a time", the video is pretty clear on exactly what is what and how many people can fit into each bracket (as a percentage of overall participants).
---
Very well put.
---
I just try to invite others to a group to blow through the starting zone.  It's better having 1 group killing 10 'x', instead of 5 people running over each trying to kill 50 'x'.
---
It's certainly stronger, and I'm honestly not sure how it should have been, but it makes a huge difference in how you should talent while leveling if you plan to aoe grind as frost mage
---
Might not have been today, but he just realised at least!

&gt; ‚Äúa lot of people in this community have matured worse than wow did in 15 years‚Äù 
---
Best example of that are the people who legitimately can't accept that there are people that rather wanter to play on a PvE server, because they don't want to get corpse camped by a group of players or perma ganked by those 20 levels or more higher than them, because that's what world PvP boggles down to most of the time. Instead you get replies like "pussy", "git gud" and the like.

I was playing with my father and cousin beside me (literally, we only had 1 decent PC so we played the game, switching every other hour), going around goldshire, having level around 6-8, and then we spotted warlock on his fiery lvl 60 mount, our jaws dropped.
---
No we're not

Bit of a tangent but... Are rogues beastly flag runners in WSG like they were back in the day? I remember them being able to grab the flag, sprint, vanish, prep, and repeat. It was so OP but also pretty fun to try to deal with honestly.

Oh, that's a bummer.

Modern war. Have a plan B for when you in inevitably get camped. But if you can grit your teeth long enough it becomes worth it. :D
---
&gt;you realize everyone in the day 1 beta reported this  not 5 minutes into logging in right?
---
This implies it was useless to report since people have already done it, and also implies people should already know that.
---
There are no beta keys.
---
Not to mention when you get a weapon upgrade you have that period of time where you have to spend time leveling up your weapon skill.
---
Yeah lobotomy used to be commonly prescribed.

Paladin, that weird Holy Ret spec to level then either Holy healing for raiding or Ret for PvP.
---
Some he'd hit harder than others.  I've leveled on 3 pservers now.
---
One two of those servers, this guy was an afterthought.  The gear I had already amassed (fresh server, no blues) was enough to tank him without worrying.
---
One of those servers, you still get hit hard with a trust fund character.
---
Meanwhile, I was buying all the runecloth to turn in for Darkspear reputation because a GM guaranteed me my Tauren would be able to ride raptors once I hit exalted. -_-
---
It's because no one working on Classic actually worked on Vanilla back in the day and they didn't keep records of all the settings/damage tables etc. that were used back in the day. Same reason why health and energy regen is wrong, ability mechanics don't work like they used to. Prepare for a lot of descrepancies between Vanilla and Classic.
---
I want to play Classic with people like the guy who wrote this post, and not those who continuously trash-talk streamers here. WoW Classic was great because it was a community game: you had to be nice to one another to get anywhere. I kind of hope it would restore my faith in the gaming community. All I see on reddit is anonymous angry people.

Vanilla has addons.
---
imagine believing u could pull 5-6 elites in dungeons in vanilla and survive.

Hi mate, I dont have Wallpaper engine, but I could send you guys a email with the mp4 if you want that! :)

---
It has already been confirmed that they will not be in the game because they don't want people rushing just to make it before cutoff. I like the mounts, but I don't want my entire leveling experience and pace be dictated by a deadline.
---
You're just a shitty person that lacks morals. That's all, can't be trusted.
---
How do you know they will get fixed? They've been working on Classic for 2 years and these huge glaring issues are still there when the game is set to release in 3 months.
---
Andy is 43. He has growth hormone deficiency which is why he appears and sounds like an adolescent.
---
Yeah there is absolutely no way you could solo 2 elites as a warrior, even 4 levels higher with retaliation, in classic.

Rogue - NE - Sub (Ambush/Hemo w/ weapon swap macro).    
---
Warlock - Gnome - SM/Ruin.   
---
Warrior - Troll - Fury/Prot.   
---
Shaman - Troll - Resto/Ele.
---
This is all for leveling.
---
Oh. This. Again.
---
Yeah that should be a 1 shot
---
Old Vanilla videos: took place during various stages of the game where damage values could've been modified due to attack normalization, changes in itemization values on items, different sets of gear players had equipped vs what players have in Beta, different talents, different defense skill, different stat buffs, etc.
---
There's no reliable way to reconcile the differences between old videos and Classic's numbers.
---
I would submit that since Blizzard imported the old unmodified data, and the old combat formulas from the source code of the reference version they have running internally and that only they have access to; that the values are correct and to keep trying to speculate about it is a pointless endeavor.
---
If there's a discrepancy, they will know about it better than anyone else sitting here trying to look at 240p youtube clips and blindly make assertions that damage is wrong, because they quite literally have the exact 1.12.1 client and server running internally as a reference.
---
Please give Classic devs more credit than this.
---
This is how I remember it being, we purposefully went to dungeons when we were near the end bosses level to make it easy.  We were usually a level or two above the gear we received.  The "real" challenge doesn't really start till like around SM Cath/ULD/ZF/Mara.  If they are able to face tank with 2h weapons pulling 2x the normal mobs (like I saw today) when they are average level of the dungeon with average gear, then we have a real problem.

When you say Berenstein/Berenstain I find it interesting because a few weeks back I saw an end cap display of the books at the local supermarket and while most did say Berenstain, a few were printed as Berenstein.

I checked back to make sure what I was saying was correct. I was comparing the wrong monsters. In the video of the mage at 4:36 ( https://youtu.be/shlghS5psDo?t=275) he was being hit by the Arcane Nullifier (lvl32/33) robots, which were hitting for an average of 120 damage with lvl 35 mage gear. 
---
So I found a portion in the stream involving a fight against this same monster: https://clips.twitch.tv/PluckyCoweringSardineStinkyCheese
---
Although the streamer isnt tanking it, you can see the other warrior tanking also using the same 2H and probably same gear, both at level 30. Assuming they have similar HP, lets say 1.2k, and the robot is hitting Netty for an average of 10% per hit thats about 120 dmg per hit with lower level gear.
---
I will correct my post to adjust to this.
---
Let me know if you can come to the same conclusion
---
Another gold story, just started leveling a dwarf warrior and some guy rides up and gives me 5g. I remember I got to level 11 and went to ironforge where I proceed to log out. Can never log back in because my computer was so bad I would D.C. when I would log in. For some reason I always remember that haha
---
I considered it but couldn't find a sufficient pattern to even out experience for many players consistently because there's too many unknown variables. The compromise is yet again that I don't allow myself any rested experience, minimize dungeon experience and skip class quests.
---
Based on the alpha, quests that involve you looting stuff on the ground are much more tolerable in Classic than they are on private servers since the items respawn very quickly. Drop quests are still a problem but I've made sure to emphasize the quests with abysmal droprates which should be autoskipped for groups. People who play solo end up skipping plenty of group content, die to ganks and kill less monsters overall while groups blizz through everythings and the experience evens out.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I started mine in 2006, kind of tempted to try resubbing for an invite but I doubt it‚Äôs worth it. 
---
Is there a way to check specific account start date?
---
In early TBC I got my brother into the game and first toon he rolled was a gnome rogue. I‚Äôll never understand why. Anyway about six months later he was level 11.
---
Sorry, but you're the massive minority on this one and are the one who's attempting to ruin classic for us 
---
You're absolutely entitled to have your different views on which version you like more, but if you want to be the special titan chosen hero, don't play classic. It wasn't like that then and it shouldn't be like this now
---
I cannot remember a single instance when my damaged was questioned in vanilla and i mostly leveled through dungeons to lvl53, there was a pretty long period when i was a "melee hunter" without people commenting on it. Interesting that you should bring that up, I never thought about that.
---
Depends where you are going. Tram takes you to the back of both cities. Flying takes you to the middle of IF and front of SW
---
It's extremely low. He isn't high enough level to have good damage reduction yet but the elite is doing less than 4% of his hp per hit.
---
No one is shoving them down your throat, you don't have to click on every conversation in the sub. Mind you there does need to be some sort of rule because it is getting flooded with the most menial clips.

literal mudhut niggers eating KFC in their designated nigger KFC huts in the middle of every zone (complete with every vendor, more quests then alliance and FP ofc oh and sometimes there is even a zeppelin or free transport thrown in) while chimping on anything that moves in numbers only despite rolling for pvp racials but never actually 1v1ing to use them
---
then porting into their literal mudhut nigger KFC city called "orgrimmar" more like ogreshit lol blizzard literally took some somalian shithole town and copy pasted it into wow to give that authentic nigger feel to the faction le monster races br0 check out these NO SHOES so whacky better name myself something fucking retarded like boogerbones to fit in btw get owned kid totally bg queued out of that 1v1 close one

you want a sick capital city to afk in br0? take your pick :

I'm fairly sure Tauren hitboxes were normalized in Wrath/3.0 but I can't find any hard evidence.

---
This is the only source I can find of that blue post, but the timestamps are relative so 'a decade' is fairly vague in that it only tells you the post was made more than 10 years ago and less than 20 years ago. My guess is it's somewhere around 2007-2008.
---
https://www.dual-boxing.com/archive/index.php/t-7338.html

Here is a thread discussing the hitboxes in May of 2008, which is after 2.4 was released.
---
e: http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/38552-tauren-hitbox-nerfed/
---
This thread is talking about it being changed in Wrath beta.
---
The toxicity and elitism in this thread is real. He was just trying to be helpful. I won't blame a retail player for seeing nothing but a name of an item in its tooltip and thinking its bugged. It goes against everything that seems logical about gear in wow, even the items you spawn with.
---
Brilliant job! I love this.
---
I checked my account yesterday and tuesday nothing.  This morning it was under my account tab
---
why are you so mad
---
Well I'm playing the beta and I'm doing my best to send as much feedback as possible. Classic for me is when I started playing, so I'd like the game to be that. You can want it your way. In the end, I hope it becomes something in the middle, I think we can all agree on that! :)
---
The first thing they need to do is add worgen as a race. Make them start out in the current Gilneas, and Goblins in booty bay. It just feels... off.. to not be able to play Worgen lol.
---
Asmons group might have interrupted him more aswell.

Nah no worries mate

I'm honestly stunned people don't get what random is.

---
\[Run back to your safe space I'm sure your body pillow waifu misses you
---
I don't disagree with everything you said, but at the end you link a DB for a pserver.. not reliable information to say the least. Also, RARE =/= ELITE. Idk why so many people see a rare and think "omg he's gonna be hard" like an elite. It just means they drop better than average loot, and maybe something thematic to that rare. They might have different abilities too but again, RARE =/= ELITE.
---
Yep. I hope the higher level dungeons prove more difficult, but I doubt it. I have a healer on ND and the dungeons aren't particularly hard but there's still a sense of danger and I'm still kept fairly busy healing people. Watching beta footage no ones health bars drop hardly at all, I could just afk the whole run as a healer. Very concerning to me.
---
I was comparing the wrong mobs. I have corrected the clips in the beginning of my post. They are both being hit by Arcane Nullifiers and are both being hit for an average of 120
---
When Hogger sends his gnolls, he's not sending his best. He's sending gnolls that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems to Elwynn. They're bringing potions. They're bringing aggro. They're gankers. And some, I assume, are good gnolls.
---
It's not supposed to be a celebration. We'll have enough time for that if the game comes out without glaring issues. For now it's better to point those issues out or we'll likely have to live with them.
---
Yeah, TBC was amazing but in hindsight a lot of the problems with modern wow had their roots in that expansion.
---
Things that were seen as huge improvements in TBC back then, would not be looked at the same now. Like, a couple years from now, blizz announce TBC. People arent going to be excited for flying mounts, or dailies.
---
However, at what point is redesigning an existing expansion such a big undertaking that they consider just releasing small, incremental new content?
---
Leather belt, leather belt. Ahhh hnughhhh!
---
You can quit it just as easily as anyone else. The only difference is the motivation/ determination to get it done.

Hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as assholeish

Ah yes. The Artifact effect.

I just feel in general that less creative videos are being made, back in my Runescape days, RSMV and other shorts were extremely popular and everyone made them, nowadays, even with OSRS there is basically nothing.

One of the most watched WoW content creators is in and you‚Äôre not?  Shocker.
---
Shut the fuck up you entitled little cunt.
---
Yeah the RSMV were my favourite I use to watch them and play all the time. Tanzoo etc they do those challenge videos which are fun sometimes. 
---
I guess the quality is too hard these days and its more produce something mediocre and make a lot of videos. Or like for example bandwagons such as "snow flake" iron men. 
---
In saying that! Classic wow pvp videos will still be a blast to watch!
---
Jesus christ shut the fuck. All this whining is what's toxic.
---
I don't get your point. The streamer linked has been one of the biggest content creators for wow for so long. Even has 
---
vids of his mom dinging 60 in vanilla.

If you start as Undead, the rest of the Horde races are yellow. Do they die the same?

SquadW
---
I thought they had the xp values off in a bad way, that you get more xp for 30+ quests (tbc values) meaning it will be even longer? :D
---
How you gonna be salty they gave the most popular WoW streamer an invite, seriously.
---
People on the internet are just toxic. Simple. Been on here for two years. Seen way too many of these post on subs. Always the same thing
---
At least joana is testing something. Asmon on stream today said he hadn‚Äôt reported anything, just been playing the game. It was during his BFD run.
---
The first few days on Wow, the first levels as a NE druid, on Teldrassil. The aestethic, the music, everything.
---
After rolling every other races, I am still thinking that NE have the best leveling zone to discover WoW.
---
By far Atiesh imo
---
Who cares.
---
I shittalked way harder than that in Vanilla and never got so much as a warning. Blizzard is going full SJW these days.
---
For you.  You're conflating your own experience with ours.  I get no joy from immersion so don't push that on me.
---
Has anyone been invited that didn't play in vanilla?
---
How many level 60s did you have by the end of vanilla?

---
This is/was still a problem long after Vanilla. Legion had a secret mount quest that Taurens couldn't complete because they couldn't fit through a hole in a ship. They had to drown and be rezzed by another player on the inside.
---
Taurens on a mount have lots of issues, especially inside AQ.
---
Good thing I started playing originally in ‚Äò05.
---
The irony was funny though.
---
It's shopped.
---
I've had an active subscription to WoW since 2004, only canceled it during BFA. I got my Beta invite the other day.
---
Do us a favor and follow your advice :)
---
I grew up on a pvp server and it was awesome. Until CRZ and people had nothing better to do to make the levelling experience horrific. I‚Äôd love to go back to a pvp server. I hope it‚Äôs tolerable
---
Honestly, leveling a ret paladin is fun, if only because you're super tough and flexible as a healing hybrid.
---
Also, prot paladins are perfectly good tanks in 5-mans. Don't listen to the nay-sayers.
---
Healing people in your group should not be underrated, and you can take pretty hard fights. If you don't mind healing almost exclusively at 60, then roll that paladin.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right, on launch it will be a bit different. I don‚Äôt think people fully grasp how bad it could be with 500+ people in one zone, even with your own party. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll be doing this route or worst case leaving the zone all together with a group to farm level 5s lol
---
I tried this back in tbc and it ported me back to my originals spirit healer in the wetlands
---
My first few days on the game, my first levels as a NE druid on Teldrassil. The aesthetic, the music, everything.
---
After rolling all other races, I keep thinking that starting with NE was the best thing that could ever happens in WoW.
---
What a waste
---
I thought I had seen that somewhere. However, I got a beta invite with a lapsed subscription. Granted, it had only been lapsed for a few days and I reupped it upon getting the beta invite, because that was enough to actually get me to play WoW again.
---
And?
---
I remember 59 to 60 was brutal. I ran out of quests so I went to winterspring and started just grinding mobs. Found a couple quest givers on the way but dang it took forever. I think I finally dinged in ubrs or something.
---
i always cook my thighs boneless, uncovered @ 425 for 70 minutes

nice crispy skin, moist interior, perfection incarnate
---
&gt; I got this guy beat.
---
To be fair, he's more known for holding the world record 1-60 speedrun than just levelling a lot of times.
---
No, you will spirit res at the graveyard you died closest to.
---
Alot of people here will outright reject this logic, but in order to accurately reproduce the classic *experience* (not code) blizzard would have to adjust for increased player ability. Good luck having a conversation about that with all the No ChAnGeS goons out there.
---
And good luck trying to do AQ without a few good hunters.

It was very blatantly sarcastic.

Do you expect a written test to be given to get in?

People ran deadmines with a group of lvl 15-17, ofc it was hard and they hit hard. If you go in with 5 lvl 20s it's cakewalk and has always been.

If I got into the beta my plan was to run dungeons as much as possible and to level in zones I wasn‚Äôt planning on playing through when classic goes live.

Well that clip was an irrelevant watch

Almost certainly either holy or protection. Not sure on class yet.
---
you mad?

Holy shit, you're Grafx?! Nice to see you, man!
---
Literally never heard of you before this post, but nice to see you all the same.

Mine is the second edition, it says on the front cover. It's volume one on the spine. Not sure how many editions were made. Yours must be an original volume one. Probably minor differences between the books!

this this? proof proof read read.

Ask Sylvanas.
---
i think whatever you do asmongold have been more dedicated to their game
---
So you‚Äôre entitled to a beta code? Nah get the fuck out of here with your entitled perspective.
---
I considered it but couldn't find a sufficient pattern to even out experience for many players consistently because there's too many unknown variables. The compromise is yet again that I don't allow myself any rested experience, minimize dungeon experience and skip class quests. Drop quests are still going to be problematic, but I've made sure to emphasize the ones with abysmal droprates so you can autoskip them.
---
Based on the alpha, quests that involve you looting stuff off the ground are going to be much more tolerable in Classic wow than they are on private servers since items respawn significantly quicker. Who knows if the same thing applies to named minibosses like Mai'zoth in STV that have 30min respawn timers on private servers.
---
We've already talked about this like 10000 today, and the day before that and the day before that - those streamers are there just as a big ad for classic. Actual random beta invites are handed to people with accounts from 2004-2006 if you check the many reddit threads about people getting invited so no they arent ignored - a guildie of mine resubbed just for the invite and got in few hours later (with a 2005 account)
---
&gt; thinking any achievement in D3 is hard or worth being proud of
---
That wouldn't happen, there was much more involved with getting the mount/title than the mat turn-ins including a long quest chain that included raid bosses afair plus some so they couldn't sneak it in like that
---
Because OP mentioned me I think.
---
Having fun is no longer allowed?
---
The warriors also get gear funneled to them. If those hunters got rings/trinkets their dps would be a bit higher as well.
---
This shit was an 808 slapped
---
PvP kind of sucked after trinkets were introduced. Since Mind Flay was a channel, priests relied on Psychic Scream to fear them for maximum damage. But the trinket meant they could instantly break out of it. So.. yeah.
---
cant blame a guy for not remembering.
---
can blame a guy for acting like he does.
---
Lol this is at 52% up voted. This sub is absolutely ridiculous.

Well, tbf he did say it was useless
---
This couldn't have been said in one of the other countless threads bitching about high profile streamers getting beta access?
---
You can also use them for early game mats and as bank alts for your main
---
You can't remember that it's wrong, but you can remember that it's right? How does that make sense?
---
Apparently not. Which is sad. Because i see a lot of people who only know private servers are seemingly the majority of beta testers :(

I prefer the music to idiots screaming "Smash that like button and subscribe to all my shit!"

Use pcpartpicker.com to double check parts compatibility, other then that everything else will just be plug and play. A pc can be built by a novice in 30 min with pretty much 1 Phillips screw driver. Plenty of videos on YouTube to walk you through it. The hardest part of building a pc is cleaning up the cables and making it look nice. If you buy a case that doesn't have glass you can skip that part and just slap all the parts in
---
You have 3 months 
---
Try all of them to see what you want to play to 60 when it launches.

I can‚Äôt wait to grind AB rep. Best BG ever.

---
Would've been really stupid if only raiders could have done TBC.
---
To be fair, that is probably a bug that they just forgot about. So in a sense they did find something worthwhile.
---
Logging in for the first time. Not sure about which class it was but it was a Night Elf, I think Rogue?
---
The scale of the world was the first thing that hit me, I had never seen anything close to the size and view distance in any other game at that point. When I eventually found out you could right click to look at the world map I was filled with excitement for exploring it all, realizing what I was seeing was a tiny part of it all.
---
That's my biggest thing about it. I don't want people supporting the shitty business tactic because that then encourages them to keep doing more of it in the future. Old players returning &amp; paying for a chance at a Beta is bullshit.

Fucking quit it with these useless whiny posts. If you're such a snowflake you can't handle some critical opinions then don't read them.
---
Lol omg you‚Äôre not kidding
---
*you're
---
THAT IS NOT CORRECT.
---
Where are you getting this bullshit information?
---
To get a qiraji tank you can use OUTSIDE of AQ? I do not remember this.
---
Okay, so what spec do you play? For example, I watched a video of PvP HotW spec 1/29/21 or 0/30/21 but the person was accenting gearing with +sta and +int. Seems very underwhelming to spend so many feral points just to be playing with caster gear, no?
---
It puts the RP back into the RPG
---
Paladins are pretty fun to level. They're super tough, and super strong in groups.
---
Is your defense mechanism for fights immediately shitting?
---
He was in the recent video they did announcing remaking Classic. It was interesting to see how he worked through it with the team.
---
Athene - cult leader
---
Yes. My sub ran out a couple of days ago, I got a beta invite yesterday. I don't know if it's actually a requirement, but I resubscribed just to be safe.
---
Just grab parts for an AMD build off r/buildapcsales. Insane builds right now for cheap that'll run WoW like a tank and even current games.
---
2600/450 or 470 mobo/ 580 8 GB. Case. Power Supply. Ram. Will total around $650 or so and that's a solid ass build that'll run new games too, just not on ultra.
---
Tips never played vanilla as much as he likes to claim he does.  He started in Cata.
---
That's fair, actually... We didn't rush to buy it in 2005 because we didn't know it was going away.
---
LOL at people bitching about Ninja Looting
---
Blizzard didn't give a fuck about it in Vanilla, and they don't know. 
---
Need everything you Need.
---
i'm perfectly capable of handling them lmao
---
This stream is epic
---
I wouldn't call that a "class" of armor, more of a "type." 
---
Armor Class is usually used as a rating of the armors power, a higher armor class is a higher effective mitigation, which is what I was referring too in response to the above poster.
---
Vacation. You're coming back August.
---
Elves are know for gatekeeping. He was playing the part nicely haha
---
I played a Druid tank in classic it was good in 5 man casual didn‚Äôt pvp much but can do it dps is fine as well all spec that is meh is boomkin in my view
---
This isn't a meme - this is art.
---
Is the irony of your "rebuke" lost on you?
---
You're the personification of that political cartoon of the protestor beating an unconscious Maga hat wearer with a blood soaked peace sign. As are your peers in this same thread.
---
Meet me at Goldshire Inn
---
Damn I was literally going to say the same thing. It‚Äôs worth it if you find it fun.
---
BUT BUT JOANA
---
I've played on a few different private servers over the last couple of years and all I will say is with communities like discord, 4chan etc you will not be found wanting. The amount of rumors circling around absolutely surpassed those of vanilla WoW. Degeneracy finds a way.
---
seems ok :) duel time now !
---
Lol, you mad. Would have never survived the internet during vanilla. Snowflakes.
---
Not exactly.
---
Its just a bit different. Some mechanics you see people using for ‚Äúbest leveling‚Äù usually do not work. Like sit crits to activate passives. Doesn‚Äôt work.
---
There are things that are easier to abuse in private servers.
---
Mobs and nodes have WACKY AS FUCK respawn rates.
---
Its important to know that vanilla servers are way worse in terms of the code compared to tbc and up servers. AI is wrong..so you can have an easier time abusing AI. So in some cases its deff not harder.
---
If I played alliance, you‚Äôd have sold me. 
---
Gotta good KEK out of the last part, incel degenerate neck beards who gave up on women being on the internet fixed that hole in their heart, with their pixel chicks.
---
To be fair, you COULD swap armor in combat in like the very first WoW patch version.
---
I was with a friend killing some mobs in blackfathorn deeps, the dungeon in ashenvale. I was an elf warrior and he was dwarf paladin. We exit the dungeon, and suddenly, we see 5 people appear in front of us. We look at each other. Seconds feel like minutes. We felt threatened by their presence, they were 5 people after all. Suddenly my friends charges and I charge. We swing at everything, assist each other. One goes down. I keep using whirlwind and I see 2 more going down. I am about to die when my friend uses lay on hands on me. Boom, full life again. We finish the 2 remaining people, and just after killing them, we burst laughing at what we did. It felt SO satisfying to kill 5 people. I thought we were dead for sure, but we destroyed them. My friend was a very good healer, that's why we won.
---
So salty lol I've been subbed since 2005 and so what, they aren't going to invite us all, we aren't special snowflakes.
---
It is!
---
The whole thing is just off generally.
---
Pretty sure those are just estimates
---
But the way it was designed clearly there wasn't enough to do late 40s on alliance
---
Rogue and hunters are probably better if you're preferring to PVP. I'd roll a rogue personally
---
One could say your post is condescending which can be veiwed as verbal harassment.
---
No, it'd take you back to your original spirit healer.
---
What irony? I'm not an American nor do I need to take sides in the retarded political and cultural war going on. Fact of the matter is you obviously are since you're seriously acting high and mighty over people younger than you and bringing up cliche culture war bullshit.
---
I was that rogue in vanilla.  
---
We'd pugged out 4 out of 5 of our tanks that week, and the attendance of that tank was abbysmal at best.  
---
Our raid leader, having been Main Tank for a previous guild thought about it for about 3 minutes, talked to a few others, then in a suprise to most in the raid the notice went out that it was awarded to my rogue.  
---
At that point I'd had 100% attendance (in roughly 3-4 months of raiding) and consistantly pushed the others in the raid, while also farming rare patterns, mats for pots, etc... it was about what I brought to that guild's raid consistantly.  
---
I'm going prot warrior this time around to ensure to not be the hot gossip on the server (particularly when the second binding dropped literally the next raid for me).
---
Who is this
---
Oh no, people are having FUN! Stop it!
---
Money making off portals??? It's a beta dude.
---
Are you seriously going to try and charge people for portals in a beta lmao.
---
It‚Äôs also weird people mainly seem to remember the bad and none of the good. At least those that don‚Äôt like it.
---
I really wish there was a Defias Brotherhood rep now
---
You're right anyway I will not get anything with this publication xd
---
I misjudged you. I apologize for assuming the worst. However all the white knights portraying exactly your criticism whilst attempting to defend you can kiss my ass.
---
There is plenty of positivity in the community. You just want to bitch and moan because people probably insulted your favorite streamer.
---
As others stated, there are plenty pf posts her upvoted that are very much positive, like the one thanking Nostalrius.
---
This subreddit is not the only classicwow community.
---
This post is fucking cancer, fuck off. Just ignore it, dumbass. Lead by example.
---
Pretty much anything sold today will run WoW with absolutely no issues.  You‚Äôd have to try really really hard to find something that wouldn‚Äôt
---
&gt; After stitching various key pieces together, we had a locally rebuilt version of Patch 1.12 running internally. The team could create characters and do basic questing and leveling‚Äîand dying, which we did many times. For testing purposes. Obviously. 
---
 [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881587/dev-watercooler-world-of-warcraft-classic](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881587/dev-watercooler-world-of-warcraft-classic) 
---
They have a server.
---
 xd
---
He tested if you could get into the Crypt.
---
Jesus dude did you HAVE to timestamp the 2nd vid right during the screamo part of the song??
---
So you want something viable for dungeons and world pvp, depending what you mean by 'hold your own'. 
---
Honestly of all the things you listed they will all have issues. Shaman/druid respecing between dungeons and world pvp. Rogue, getting into dungeon groups because theres going to be a million and one of them. Hunters probably fit the 'best' to what you want, world pvp ok, dungeon ok. Ofc if you don't wanna heal you wont have the respec problem between dungs and world pvp.
---
Not sure if that's helped at all
---
Well they need something to hate now Blizzard is actually bringing out Classic. This sub has alot of angry idiots unfortunately
---
I stand corrected, but it seems like it's only those two. I would love to know why :o
---
It lines up with that old video though
---
Ok?
---
We should let em keep talking shit and then gank them relentlessly wherever they go when classic comes out
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
His fault for not keeping it in his pants!
---
what do you mean with "But as you can see, Blizzard don't seem to have figured it out perfectly either." ?
---
Every video I've seen seems to point that they do in fact have it figured out.
---
Don‚Äôt think you can run to different spirit healers beyond the one you spawn as a ghost in front of.  Would be a good idea if I‚Äôm wrong tho
---
Hi, /u/BladePocok
---
Reddit is great
---
They aren't true focus frames, just addon workarounds that save the name etc.
---
So, do you perhaps know how that works?.. if you get an invite for the stresstest, will you be able to play the rest of the beta or is it just for the stress test?
---
Only 10 years old?  You didn‚Äôt even play Vanilla.  What help could you possibly offer?  Filthy casual.
---
Hacker
---
‚ÄúI will probably be downvoted for this post‚Äù that‚Äôs when I decided to downvote
---
What is the huntard version for warriors?
---
41=92
---
Right. 
---
I mean I‚Äôm not believing that. 
---
Any streamer, especially ANTI CLASSIC, that does this for a living, seeing Asmon‚Äôs stream, well... I‚Äôd be pro classic in an instant if I praised retail. 
---

That's what I suspected
---
Shut the fuck up lol
---
You really think he'd remember how much damage the baby mobs did 15 years ago? His opinion is largely irrelevant tbh
---
what i dont understand is if they didnt do some sort of export and import how did they set damage values
---
i personally dont mind too much about low level stuff but if the values are off at such a low level the raids and even pvp damage may be way off.
---
they cant litterally be manually correcting the damage on every mob and skill right...???
---
Noticed that in his Deadmines video, the damage felt really low to me. Healer never even broke a sweat, and it's not like you're capable of super l337 play at level 19.
---
a dude with a camera
---
Uhm. But you mean overwhelmingly good, right?
---
I play 7/14/31 in any serious PvP.  I enjoy messing around with HotW and 30/0/21 but it's not something that I would call competitive.  Those specs have their place, but a druid shines as a healer first, and then change your trinkets, cloak, rings, neck, etc to fit the other desired roll.  +healing for group play, +spell power for solo, +stam for flag running etc.
---
Stacking as much stam and int as you can get your hands on does seem a bit underwhelming I suppose.  But unfortunately moonfire and insect swarm scale like crap and so do your instant heals so you'll better off doing 200 less damage with your dots and have +300hp and +200 mana in most situations.
---
As HotW I can see the argument for stacking stam and str to maximize feral capacities but you'll lose all of your support and become a shitty rogue real quick.  You need the int to outlast your opponents and be able to help the group as long as possible so that's just what you've gotta choose.  You'll only be 4/5 HotW anyway because you'd have to be nuts to not take Nautes Grasp.
---
&gt; There is only so much a casual player can do in classic
---
There's a lot they can do, considering it's a whole (arguably more varied than raider/rank-farming content) game for them on its own, as opposed to just being a watered down version of hardcore content like it is on retail
---
need this but for warlock? anyone got the hookup?
---
Cursed raid group
---
Dwarves have customization options that can make them look like 1:1 representations of Riflemen and Mountain Kings. You can also be an Arthas lookalike as a long haired blonde blue eyed white human paladin .
---
Sucks that Orcs and Trolls are so hunchbacked tho
---
Well, that is some compelling evidence.
---
Team 2 is huge. The idea of some mass exodus during cata is pretty funny.
---
Pcpartpicker.com Just put something together
---
Almost both at 666 monkaS
---
This makes me so sad....
---
100% PR Beta... and I am subbed since first day EU release and got no invite...yeah fuck you blizzard...
---
/focus allows you to click/mouseover target another frame, show's you the HP and mana of them, show's you their target, and their cast bar.
---
Addons from vanilla and addons in Classic will do this and you'll be able to macro or trigger them to your heart's content.
---
Just because it isn't called focus in the API doesn't mean it won't work.
---
Keep in mind that classicdb is a *pserver database* and the values listed are directly from the pserver's database, not from Vanilla. It is an amazing ad-free database but you should always take the information there with a grain of salt, especially the stats on items that had itemization changes and the drop rates.
---
Chests seem bugged?
---
They drop the same item several times, such as 3 different stacks of hp pots in the same chests (not combined stack). Leaving less room for other items to be included. Feels like there should be a roll where an item can be added, if added, doesnt roll again.
---
Shhh just let them all burn out in the next 3 months in beta so I have a better time on release.
---
&gt; Oh no, people are having FUN! Stop it!
---
Knowing blizzard, they'll probably make it so this wont be do-able anymore. rip under kara.
---
Are the protected functions in the API the same as in 8.1.0?
---
The face of Diablo.
---
huh
---
"remember"
---
You act like his account isnt 10+ years.
---
diablo turned wow turned path of exile streamer
---
Front stabbing does not work.
---
Ooh okay you're definitely trolling nevermind then
---
Hi, /u/I_Too_Read_Reddit
---
Don‚Äôt worry no matter how you pay them a month, they still won‚Äôt play with you.
---
It's 4,084,700 XP to LVL 60.
---
It's 987,900 to LVL 38, so 25% of total XP needed is 40% into LVL 39.
---
50% is 9% into LVL 49 and 75% is 74% into LVL 55.
---
Level 30 is 12.2% of the way to 60. You're basically halfway done when you hit 50.
---
Shit.  This is something I would have never guessed as a 2.0 change.  This is a huge PvP change.
---
VANILLA VIRGINS RISE UP!
---
Oh yeah good call.  My main is going to have some good professions but alts will have gathering ones until max level. Currently thinking if caster then Ill go with the usual Tailor and Enchant. If melee probably Alchemy and Herb. Maybe Engineering if I have my alts do herb.
---
I have so many fond memories of walljumping into this place..
---
Original post is guy reporting bug. Someone comments saying this is why you invite people to the beta [to report bugs]. You comment that it was already reported and implied he should know that [hence useless report]. I ask why people shouldn't report bugs in a beta. Have you heard the word semantics before? Check it out.
---
Yes. Almost any modern PC can run Classic WoW at the lowest setting. 
---
As a heads up, it looks like that specific model is ‚ÄòOut of Stock‚Äô from that specific site.
---
wtf lol
---
As a follow up I got the email about 24 hours later.
---
Probably could, but it‚Äôs not going to run it well.
---
idk man, it's hard to say without seeing the source code, but number changes are usually incredibly easy to fix. I wouldn't be so disappointed just yet.
---
Your point?
---
Well, it was a nice thought. But not the reason why I posted it. There is a genuine concerned downtrend of negativity. Thought I would address it.
---
Take your own advice.
---
Boss mechanics in vanilla were easy is what I‚Äôm saying. You can‚Äôt really compare it to bosses nowadays which are hundred times more complex than vanilla bosses will ever be. The hard part of vanilla are not the bosses, the mechanics or whatever. It was getting 40 people into a raid knowing the few simple mechanics the boss had and not screw up, Showing up to the raid on time and being prepared with consumables. And yes the Laggs that were added by hardware and FPS drops during boss mechanics definitely played a roll in difficulty. People denying that have probably never played vanilla and imagine that everybody played it with a high end pc back then. This was not the case. In our guild we had so many wipes because people had constant DCs and fps drops. And replacing them was hard since it‚Äôs already hard enough to find 40 motivated people. THIS is what makes vanilla hard, but the game you play is easier than any other wow expansion after that.
---
Vanish drops the flag so you'd really have to pick the time.  
---
When kitty sprint and your engineering boots work (while floating down with the parachute) it feels great.
---
Maybe people have said this, but maybe it seems easier because we‚Äôre older and better at the game?
---
R/buildapc
---
One of the best things about the game back then was the community for sure. Modern day trolls and well assholes to be frank, wont be able to do their thing and get away with it for long. People like that gain a reputation and with the tight knit classic servers you are actually held accountable much of the time.
---
Back then you knew people in the servers. It truly brought the game to life, which is something you rarely see these days. People with social issues were suddenly coming out of their shell and making friends all because of a game. 
---
At any time you could walk around and talk in /s or w.e and make friends, group up for a quest and dungeon for some good times. Not only that but due to the way the community was back then (no lfg button and cross server grouping) you were forced to make friends and talk to people on your server and faction, which meant after you were finished with that task and that group often you stayed friends and grouped again in the future. 
---
It may not be quite like that for the first month while layering exists but i cant wait for that tight knit community feeling to come back along with classic!
---
Cheers to meeting old and new friends back in the place where this all began!
---
Are you trolling?
---
Yes, yes is the answer.
---
any good guides? I think I saw a great video that was in BRD. Found it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxU7-iXyoAE
---
Apologies, it was the first part of the video that I found that supported one of the points I made. I had the video muted so didn't know
---
Where did the comments go
---
My point is that after the main tank, bindings should go to any class equally.
---
Stop. It makes no difference.
---
You‚Äôll either get an invite or you won‚Äôt.
---
Also, in general, don't pay for beta. Would you pay for a car that isn't finished? For a meal that hasn't been cooked? Nah
---
Don't pay money for unfinished products.
---
Classicdb is not correct, if this was true this one NPC would 3 shot asmon, at  272 - 324  damage per swing (before reductions) this would hit harder than a boss.  A lvl 31 druid from back in 2007 claims to have soloed him. I doubt that a druid would last long against a NPC hitting for 272-324 without help.  
---
You are also forgetting that Asmon is wearing armor, def stance, and has other buffs (not the best person to ask to ID buff icons)
---
Well no its not that huge to me, but getting farmed by rogues and warriahs isnt so fun and this has a pretty big impact on that. i mean did u see the video? the tauren hit model is dummy thicq
---
The usage of evidence helps no matter what.
---
In the end it doesn't matter. It's just one item that may never drop if RNG is really bad. So it's a hunter's weapon like all the others.
---
When you trade there should be no window asking if you are sure about the trade to confirm, has it been reported yet?
---
My gm in chat confirmed it too. But he said that the age of the account doesn‚Äôt matter.. so not the best Source in my eyes
---
Another example is front shredding on druids, it rapidly increases your leveling rate but you can't do it in the actual beta only on pservers
---
Sounds like you got invited yesterday evening then.
---
Doesn't work on live.  
---
Depends on how you hit it with spell batching. 
---
Yes, untalented stealth isn't great without distract but with distract it's fine.
---
Actually it seems like it does.  Everyone who I ask is from 2004.
---
So you stop, gatekeeper.
---
I played back in beta vanilla until now. I for one think that classic will be exactly what vanilla should have been back in the day. The new UI and client just help add to the game IMO.
---
I see the classic beta will have the true vanilla feel of contact lag. I remember shattered hand being such shit that during a massive spike you could run through AQ40.
---
I just realized Im not allowed to post on the forums without an active sub lol. Got me.
---
I can confirm frontstabbing isn't possible.
---
i remeber you strafed not ran left and right 
---
i wonder if this means you are showing more of your back because tankes strafed to not show their back
---
I think not!
---
Oh shush, Asmon and Esfand just took 60+ people raiding Stitches, then fighting their way to Kara and going into the Crypts and are now fucking around making guild tabards. They're having fun and exposing people to the kind of group/community events that people want from classic.
---
So some context; this IS a Vanilla screenshot dated back June 14 2005 (can't believe I still had this, posted on my DeviantArt page). I remembered seeing a video back then of someone clipping or 'wall walking' to get into a spot at the then closed entrance. I copied it and managed to get in. Result we're obviously unfinished structure. 
---
Pretty neat regardless.
---
knowing soda he probably didnt even use the report feature. He just leveled and like most streamers don't actually report anything they find unusual to them unless it's major.
---
&gt; The face of Diablo.

Quinn69.

Big diablo streamer that has recently been streaming other games like PoE and this.

He often does really stupid shit on stream (see the other thread about him) but it's pretty clear much of the stupidity is an act to get views.

My guild &lt;TKO&gt;being the only one to complete all the requirements to open the gates of AQ....and holding it ransom for an unheard of amount of gold from both the horde and alliance.
---
Yeah I don't get it. Why would Blizz give access to a popular streamer who currently has over 50k people watching his stream when they could have given it to some nobody based solely on the age of their account...
---
My account has been active since early 05 and I could care less if I get into the beta or not. I don't need to play the beta to know whether I'll play Classic or not. 
---
This whole argument of "my account is old so I deserve beta access" is ridiculous. None of us deserve anything, we are not special snowflakes so get over it.
---
anyone got a diagram for BFA total XP required?

Oh my god. And his avatar and background pictures. Pure cringe.

My guild killing raggi first time:

---
&gt;our druid leader heals someone with an 8k, gets aggro and runs away with half the adds

&gt;somehow like 5-15ppl are still alive when rag reemerges

&gt;he starts oneshots everyone, adds come back and join the slaughter

&gt;everyone is dead, the sons cleaned up nicely

&gt;we had to burrow elementium from other guilds for building the weapon

---
The frostbolt, thats The Thing thats cristall clear in my mind after 13 years. There could have been some meeles left and or it was some random dot, but i remember this damn, dumb, beautyfull, amazing frostbolt as it hits in raggis back and he dies.
---
Are you planning to add a license to the repo? If not, there's no real point to having the source available.
---
You‚Äôre adding nothing to the discussion with this post.
---
Fadeleaf isn't that expensive. Itd be more time efficient to farm more expensive herbs and buy your fadeleaf. That or stock up like mad when leveling herbs through swamp of sorrows
---
Asmon is a scumbag but he's also one of the biggest wow streamers so saying someone who plays with him won't grow because he plays with him is probably just false. Really asmon's gaming personality, real or fake, is entertaining and people don't care if he's a dick because he's entertaining to watch. Esfand might be lying here to feel better about himself because he can't admit that he enjoys being a scumbag too but yeah, pretending he'll stop growing cause of asmon isn't realistic.
---
How would a feral cat hold up against a rogue 1v1
---
The massive influx will die out as you progress in levels. If you are one of the first ones to 60 you will get to know some people as the groups will be smaller before the rest of the people come in. I do think the "community" aspect is a bit exaggerated. The WoW realm forums is where most of it came from because of people complaining about the same campers or pvpers.
---
[Did my best to recreate it in retail on max graphics lol.](https://ibb.co/wy0NsLQ)
---
Private servers sure aren't flawless but neither is your memory of classic. Its been 14 fucking years. Human memory is not that good. I'd reckon that a fresh memory of a flawed private server, is still better than a 14 year old memory of a flawless server. 
---
Both private server and "vanilla only" players have been reporting things that aren't bugs. It's natural, none remembers vanilla perfectly. The natural way to go about things is if you spot something that isn't how you remember it, or isn't how it works on a private server(and that isn't known as a common pserver bug), then you ask others, you try look at vanilla footage, here joana's speedrun is a great source of 1.12 information. And if the footage isn't how it is in the beta, or you can't find a source, then you report it, and blizzard who has a working 1.12 client can see if it's intended or not.
---
posting a clip of your hero saying the numbers are off as fact and insulting doubters in the title, thats either completely dumb or childish, you pick :)
---
DAE streamers = BAD?
---
I can also guarantee that was not what that guy said to get banned in LoL
---
I watched the clip and the cloak came from a chest didn't it? I feel like the retail attitude of "who ever gets boe items keeps them" will probably be in classic, except in guilds where they might sell them for consumables or what ever.
---
thank you sir
---
Bruh really?
---
I'm not saying he'll stop growing, he'll still grow regardless of whether or not he plays with Asmon. But whenever Asmon does something retarded, if Esfand is present, he'll get dragged into it. 
---
I dunno, avoiding Asmon just avoids drama.
---
Neither. Long live el Classico.
---
Don‚Äôt worry no matter how much you pay him per month, he still won‚Äôt play with you. I just made a statement that his opinion doesn‚Äôt matter because he was anti vanilla. Now he‚Äôs just trying to jump on the hype train to stay relevant because the project isn‚Äôt a heaping pile of shit.
---
Combat rogue but will be doing pickpocket runs nonstop for about a month once I hit 60.

I don't think the bosses are easier in retail wow, what is easier is normal mobs + elites.  
---
The actual game play of everything except raiding was massively, massively harder.
---
The argument goes both ways. There's no way joana can remember exactly how mob damage was back in vanilla.
---
In what alternate reality do you live in where *that* is gatekeeping?
---
What are you talking about? Every video found shows that the numbers are high enough...
---
Depends how good you are and how good the rogue is
---
You‚Äôre not. These loud voices are the neckbeard fringe of the player base, like myself. Filthy casual noob.
---
The ball gazer? I mean I kinda get it but I kinda don't.
---
Just hedging my bets a bit. They also said first two zones at one point.
---
Realistically any drama that happens with asmon is forgotten in like a day at most.
---
Wut? He clearly meant that comment for you to not have your hopes up and dissapoint yourself, litt nothing sounds like gatekeeping.
---
I'm wondering how much of the 1.12 data is intact, and how much had to be "filled in" with other old (but later than 1.12) data.
---
Patch 2.3 in TBC was a notorious noob patch which upgraded dungeon item drops (Serpent shoulders gaining stats as an example), reduced xp between levels, and quite heavily nerfed a lot of mob damage. How possible is it that some of these changes have found their way into the classic beta somehow?
---
This was my first ever character, before switching to my priest, and then to my hunter, which i still currently main today, on a diff account unfortunately.
---
They didn‚Äôt use an /s, but it was there.
---
It's sad that I thought you weren't joking for the first half. A surprising number of comments on this sub have started looking like yours
---
Pack it up guys, random reddit claims to have reported the bug first. Might as well revoke Joana's beta key at this point. What a fool he must've been to not ask you first!
---
Blizzard knows all! I have blind faith in them to recreate the game with full precision and authenticity! They have never given us a reason to doubt their omniscience or their judgment! All hail Blizzard who can do no wrong!

Probably frozen breasts
---
It's the internet man, nothing gets forgotten. The drama will die down but the black mark will be on your record.
---
Everyone starts at the same level (as long as you start on launch) so ganking wont be an issue until you get to places like STV at higher levels. 
---
With that said classic has much more of a faction pride aspect to it as well as a tight knit community due to how servers are run. If youre getting ganked join the world channel or something and ask for help, im positive people will be willing to help ESPECIALLY those who are going for rank 14 titles. People pushing pvp rank always look for excuses to farm HKs!
---
Also people were a lot less likely to just watch you get ganked back then, most people will help during times like that, even if youre dying to some pve content. Which brings me to my next point, if you gain a bad rep for being an asshole you may not get help, one of the if not the biggest difference between retail and classic is just how tight knit the communities in classic were due to the lack of sharding, and cross server grouping. This means behave, be nice, help others and they will help you!
---
Happy hunting
---
There is literally video evidence of at least 1 mob doing wrong damage, it‚Äôs important to figure out why and fix potentially undiscovered damage values being off.
---
Try to keep an open mind. No need to be defensive. This discussion is good for the beta, I‚Äôd even argue it‚Äôs what beta exists for.
---
comments seem to be bugging out on reddit these past two days, idk why.
---
I think you can self-select into a healthier place. Pretty sure lots of private server bro toxicity can be avoided by playing on PvE and RP realms.
---
Thank you for this, it's really helpful!
---
The real tips are always in the comments.
---
Bro, just play the game and have fun with it. People didn't have guides when it first released. You'll be alright.
---
I don't really understand why you have to bring HK's into it. If you have the most honor, then you are standing one and get the most out of anyone.
---
It is not guarenteed that that will be 13000 though, that requires an active playerbase big enough to have a bracket one place. Though there most likely will be at least one on each faction on every server. The amount needed is 333 players on your faction getting 15hks
---
Quality timestamp right there.
---
Never seen this before, but there are "7 comments" here but, even as a mod, I can only see three.
---
Y'all got super shadowbanned or something, damn.

Cloth wearing, 1 handed spell power Ret paladin.

The face of failure for Path of Exile as well

Stopped playing after the end of WotLK.

A part of me just refuses to delegate Asmon as a face WoW.

Whe

 don't want associate one of the best games ever made and to Asmon's face

I‚Äôm a hardcore Vanilla player that will be a Casual player this time around and that infuriates me about retail WoW. The people that you explained want their cake and will eat it too, regardless of how much they destroy the game. Anyone who plays more than I do should have better gear than I do, they should utterly wreck face if I go against them. However, I‚Äôll always find other ways to enjoy my time in the game. I can always use my limited time to rep grind, run a raid once a week, or get extremely rare crafting items to sell and buy better gear on the AH.
---
I‚Äôve always felt that Vanilla was more like Capitalism and retail is like communism. If I get behind in Vanilla, I‚Äôll find a way to outsmart the system and get the most out of my game time, while with retail no matter what I do I‚Äôll just get the same crap for minimal work.
---
they got me too with the diablo 3 season 17 start email =(
---
They have the reference client, if they say it's not a bug then it's not, they know better than anyone.
---
They have information literally no one else in the world has. I'd honestly believe them over some old footage where any number of things could be at play.
---
That's actually hilarious.  If a single person went and bought something out of the 65k then it was worth it.
---
you weren't kidding about the terrible music.
---
But does "normal Vanilla population levels" mean normal for non-launch times? I think the answer is clearly, yes based on what they've said in the past. I'm not saying it'll be low population, but it'll likely be extremely low when compared to the launch of a new server in 2005.
---
Also, I'm not making critiques so much as presenting what I'm expecting this news means realistically.
---
"You will be able to invite anyone on the server."
---
Is this for sure accurate? I saw this debated over and over in the thread a few days ago.
---
Towelie is a tool. Turning into alexensual

&gt; **Most** **~~This~~** **gaming subreddits are toxic as hell.**

FTFY.

Thank you for the reply now I ply the waiting game. Or die waiting
---
Time investing does not equal hard in terms of difficulty.. 
---
and I feel like yes, bosses today are wayy harder than back then. If you follow today‚Äôs world first raids on twitch is a whole other level than bosses on wow. The raiding today is way more efficient, in terms of Getting everybody bugged up and in front of the boss after a wipe and the whole mechanics take weeks to learn. You see the best players wiping hundreds of times and most players today don‚Äôt even finish mythic endgame until after the next raid tier .. 
---
I know tons of players haven‚Äôt cleared vanilla bosses as well, but not due to lack of skill but to lack of investing time into attuning and all that. Which in my opinion has nothing to do with skill or the game being hard. You can watch esfands stream from yesterday where he‚Äôs talking about this topic exactly. That basically even rank 14 don‚Äôt require a lot of skill, just a lot of time investment. But just listen to his words as his probably on of the most informative people to vanilla that there is right now ..
---
Ret still does decent damage, they just have mana issues. So they shine in shorter fights like 5 man dungeons. They are really good in pvp too.
---
There is no reward good enough for me to escort a single mechanical goddamn chicken. NO.
---
If you haven't played vanilla, how can you know if something? 
---
*mind blown*
---
I knew this dude was special. I saw him in that interview and felt like I had just witnessed the messiah. Now it is known.
---
Lul, what do you want them to answer?
---
You should consider looking for a guild with similar interests sure. But it's not a requirement. Considering the high player peaks each server and faction will probably have atleast 1 guild that fits your level, but whether they have spots for you, or your schedule fits theirs etc. etc. that's why I would recommend seaching for a guild in advance. It doesn't have to be now. It will probably be easier when we get a finalized realmlist released, though the question is when that will be.
---
Hi, /u/Jefftommens
---
You should probably seek help

---
May you please present your arguments about the fact that you imply that there are no potential arguments about playing in a server with a streamer? Calling him a whiney child with no basis is significantly ironic don't you agree?
---
The first clip is a 30% Ice armour slow, the second is a 50% CoC slow, hence the different speed.
---
Basically skill requirement makes a game hard. Time investing doesn‚Äôt.
---
I guess at the end of the day it doesn't matter
---
Most Streamers and Retail players. Memed us, Talked mad shit, and whenever we would present a dialog for classic we would get you think you do but you dont'd and ganged up on. As someone whos been playing classic since 2010 on Feenix and constantly trying to start discussions on forums I know first hand. Your either a troll or vastly ill-informed. Present your points what streamer made classic a reality? 
---
Because from my view Nosalrius's success with retails pitiful numbers. Showed Blizzard their was money to be made, Then a petition went around, then Nosalrius relaunched "kinda".  Then Blizzard asked If their team "can we do this" Omar i believe showed them how and in turn got us the green light. 
---
That said you misinterpret what people are unset about. Most, granted im sure a few are w.e, dont care if Jimmy from Legion got in as a streamer. People are upset that Jimmy is using this opportunity for self gain and not to make the game better. It is literally a beta test """a trial of machinery, software, or other products, in the final stages of its development, carried out by a party unconnected with its development."""
---
&gt; are evil
---
ahahaha they arent evil! we're not talking about some mastermind scheming evil plans, they are douchebags that are whoring in order to make a buck.
---
content? are you serious? 90% are idiots playing games(most of them aren't even good at it). their video editing skills are minimal and the product looks like shit, their interviewing skills are laughable (NEVER asking questions that will put the company in a difficult position) and their judgement always questionable since they  depend on the corporations to throw them a bone.
---
fuck you, your fanboism and your lack of arguments.
---
I think people are **vastly** overstating the difficulty of vanilla. That's really common on this subreddit, of course. There's a pretty big obsession with trying to paint it as the epitome of difficulty in WoW, when it's obviously never been close to the case.
---
Having said that, hopefully Blizzard is looking into this and offers an explanation, because there are a lot of factors that we can't really understand just by watching. 
---
For what it's worth I've felt like things are about how they should be leveling a druid on beta, but I'm not going to pretend I have a photographic memory.
---
Run? Yes. Smoothly? No.
---
any comparison with BFA&gt;?
---
Why are you sperging so hard
---
Nyhm made some good ass songs too, ‚Äúcan‚Äôt pug kz‚Äù ‚Äúassassinate‚Äù and ‚Äúm.a.g.e‚Äù were songs I played on a near daily rotation. The good old days
---
I'm twisted. I wanna play this again badly .. but I'm happy I quit wow... I know if I start it it's gonna take away so much considering how much time vanilla needs to get anywhere.
---
Target of target displays animation debuff duration (shadowed spiral similar to spell cooldowns) from NPC abilities. Only one I saw confirmed was daze from being attacked from behind on Sodapoppin's stream.
---
I'm assuming this is a meme. Actually, did Athene ever get banned from Twitch? I feel like with all the shady as fuck stuff he does he should be and I haven't seen him streaming there any time I've been browsing.
---
does anyone else think it's kind of odd that, despite making up less than 13% of the population of elwynn forest, Gnolls make up for 52% of violent crime?
---
Well the fun is on the pvp realms though. I tried PvE and an RP server once, never again. I can deal with the bullshitters, pretty much every game has them nowadays.
